'''Aboulomania''' ({{etymology|gre|a–|without||boulē|will}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=aboulia|encyclopedia=The New Oxford American Dictionary|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[mental disorder]] in which the patient displays [[pathological]] indecisiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phrontistery.info/mania.html|title=Manias and Obsessions|year=2007|work=The Phronistery|first=Stephen|last=Chrisomalis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9788131903537|last=Rawat|first=P.S.|title=Midline Medical History|publisher=Jane Publishers|year=2002|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically associated with [[anxiety]], [[Chronic stress|stress]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and mental anguish, and can severely affect one's ability to [[social functioning|function socially]]. Although many people suffer from indecision, it is rarely to the extent of obsession.&lt;ref name="JenniferByrne"&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/181144-how-to-overcome-indecision/|first=Jennifer Byrne|last=2010|title=How to Overcome Indecision|work=Livestrong}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of the brain that is tied to making rational choices, the [[prefrontal cortex]], can hold several pieces of information at any given time.&lt;ref name="JenniferByrne" /&gt; This may quickly overwhelm somebody when trying to make decisions, regardless of the importance of that decision. They come up with reasons that their decisions will turn out badly, causing them to over-analyze every situation critically in a classic case of [[paralysis by analysis]]. Lack of information, valuation difficulty, and outcome uncertainty can become an [[obsession (psychology)|obsession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rassin|first=Eric|title=A psychological theory of indecisiveness|journal=Netherlands Journal of Psychology|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1007/BF03061056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sent to [[Siberia]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II's]] troops after participating in the [[January Uprising]] in [[Belarus]], [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]]. From there he succeeded to escape to the West. He established in [[France]] and became a known [[physician|doctor]].

There he wrote in [[Polish language|Polish]] the story of his adventure, which was later translated to [[French language|French]] by Joséphine Bohdan. The original Polish written version of the memoirs seems to be owned by Jean and Madeleine Okinczyc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.interlog.com/~mineykok/Okin1.html Memoires by Doctor Alexander Okinczyc] translated by Krzysztof Mineyko&lt;/ref&gt; The doctor died in [[Villepreux]].

'''Behavior change''', in the context of [[public health]], refers to efforts to change people's personal habits to prevent [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;WHO 2002: [http://www.who.int/whr/2002/en/whr02_en.pdf?ua=1 "World Health Report 2002 – Reducing Risks, Promoting Healthy Life"]. Retrieved February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior change in public health is also known as social and behavior change communication (SBCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthcommcapacity.org/about/why-social-and-behavior-change-communication/|title=Why Social and Behavior Change Communication? – Health Communication Capacity Collaborative – Social and Behavior Change Communication|website=Health Communication Capacity Collaborative – Social and Behavior Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; More and more, efforts focus on prevention of disease to save healthcare care costs.&lt;ref&gt;US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. [https://www.cdc.gov/features/preventionstrategy/ "National Prevention Strategy"]. Retrieved February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly important in [[Developing country|low and middle income countries]], where health interventions have come under increased scrutiny because of the cost.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison DT, Breman JG, Measham AR, et al., (eds) (2006) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11784/ Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries]. 2nd edition Chapter 2: Intervention Cost-Effectiveness Retrieved February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The 3-4-50 concept&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SD County|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_health_statistics/3-4-50.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines that there are 3 behaviors (poor diet, little to no physical activity, and smoking), that lead to four diseases (heart disease/stroke, diabetes, cancer, pulmonary disease), that account for 50% of deaths worldwide.  This is why so much emphasis in public health interventions have been on changing behaviors or intervening early on to decrease the negative impacts that come with these behaviors. With successful intervention, there is the possibility of decreasing healthcare costs by a drastic amount, as well as general costs to society (morbidity and mortality).  A good public health intervention is not only defined by the results they create, but also the number of levels it hits on the socioecological model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American College Health Association|url=https://www.acha.org/HealthyCampus/Implement/Ecological_Model/HealthyCampus/Ecological_Model.aspx?hkey=f5defc87-662e-4373-8402-baf78d569c78}}&lt;/ref&gt; (individual, interpersonal, community and/or environment).  The challenge that public health interventions face is generalizability: what may work in one community may not work in others.  However, there is the development of [[Healthy People program|HealthyPeople 2020]] that has national objectives aimed to accomplish in 10 years to improve the health of all Americans.

Health conditions and infections are associated with [[risk]]y behaviors. [[Smoking|Tobacco use]], [[alcoholism]], [[multiple sex partners]], substance use,  reckless driving, [[obesity]], or unprotected [[sexual intercourse]] are some examples. Human beings have, in principle, control over their conduct. [[Behavior modification]] can contribute to the success of self-control, and health-enhancing behaviors. Risky behaviors can be eliminated including physical exercise, weight control, preventive nutrition, dental hygiene, condom use, or accident prevention. Health behavior change refers to the motivational, volitional, and action based processes of abandoning such health-compromising behaviors in favor of adopting and maintaining health-enhancing behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAID project|url=http://www.psp-one.com|publisher=Private Sector Partnerships}} SAID project focused on increasing the private sector's role in providing high-quality health products and services in developing countries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barrier Analysis website|url=http://barrieranalysis.fhi.net/|website=Barrier Analysis website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caregroupinfo.org/docs/Multisectoral_DBC_Curriculum_April_2012.doc|title=Designing for Behavior Change Curriculum|website=Designing for Behavior Change Curriculum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addiction that is associated with risky behavior may have a genetic component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biliński P, Wojtyła A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studziński T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann. Agric. Environ. Med. | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 491–496 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23020045 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One emerging concept in the American health system is that of small, manageable changes. It is not necessary to make sweeping, drastic alterations to one's whole lifestyle in order to see benefit. Dietary and exercise contexts in particular show the benefit of moderate, slow changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=James|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=2009|volume=89|issue=2|pages=477–484|doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.26566|title=Can a small-changes approach help address the obesity epidemic? A report of the Joint Task Force of the American Society for Nutrition, Institute of Food Technologists, and International Food Information Council|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/2/477.full.pdf+html|pmid=19088151}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, behavior change steps to include more physical activity can improve one's life expectancy, control weight, and boost mental health. It is also known to reduce the chance of some diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.&lt;ref name=CDC2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/pdf/2009-power-of-prevention.pdf|title=The Power of Prevention|last=|first=|date=2009|website=www.cdc.gov|publisher=cdc|access-date=7 December 2016}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy behaviors and practices during youth, particularly in school settings, is far more cost-effective than waiting until unhealthy behaviors are entrenched. A study of the Toward No Tobacco program, which was designed to prevent cigarette use among middle and high school students, found that for every dollar invested in school tobacco prevention programs, almost $20 in future medical care costs would be saved.&lt;ref name=CDC2009/&gt;

== Theories ==
Behavior change programs tend to focus on a few [[behavioral change theories]] which gained ground in the 1980s. These theories share a major commonality in defining individual actions as the locus of change. Behavior change programs that are usually focused on activities that help a person or a community to reflect upon their risk behaviors and change them to reduce their risk and vulnerability are known as [[intervention (counseling)|interventions]]. Examples include: "[[Transtheoretical Model|Transtheoretical (Stages of Change) Model]] of Behavior Change", "[[theory of reasoned action]]", "[[health belief model]]", "[[theory of planned behavior]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehealthcompass.org/sbcc-tools/theory-planned-behavior|title=Theory of Planned Behavior – The Health COMpass|website=www.thehealthcompass.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[diffusion of innovation]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehealthcompass.org/sbcc-tools/diffusion-innovations|title=Diffusion of Innovations – The Health COMpass|website=www.thehealthcompass.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[health action process approach]]. Developments in health behavior change theories since the late 1990s have focused on incorporating disparate theories of health behavior change into a single unified theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Polly|journal=Clinical Nurse Specialist|date=2009|volume=23|issue=3|pages=161–172|doi=10.1097/NUR.0b013e3181a42373|title=Integrated Theory of Health Behavior Change: Background and Intervention Development|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2778019/pdf/nihms-150510.pdf|pmc=2778019|pmid=19395894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prochaska|first1=James|last2=Velicer|first2=Wayne|journal=American Journal of Health Promotion|date=1997|volume=12|issue=1|pages=38–48|doi=10.4278/0890-1171-12.1.38|title=The Transtheoretical Model of Health Behavior Change|url=http://ahp.sagepub.com/content/12/1/38.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual and interpersonal === 
*''[[Health belief model]]:'' It is a psychological model attempting to provide an explanation and prediction of health behaviors through a focus on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janz|first=Nancy K.|last2=Becker|first2=Marshall H.|date=2016-09-04|title=The Health Belief Model: A Decade Later|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/109019818401100101|journal=Health Education Quarterly|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–47|doi=10.1177/109019818401100101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on the belief that the perception an individual has determines their success in taking on that behavior change.  Factors: perceived susceptibility/severity/benefits/barriers, readiness to act, cues to action, and self-efficacy.

*''[[Protection motivation theory]]:'' Focuses on understanding the fear appeal that mediates behavior change and describes how threat/coping appraisal is related to how adaptive or maladaptive when coping with a health threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Ronald W.|date=1975-09-01|title=A Protection Motivation Theory of Fear Appeals and Attitude Change1|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00223980.1975.9915803|journal=The Journal of Psychology|volume=91|issue=1|pages=93–114|doi=10.1080/00223980.1975.9915803|issn=0022-3980|pmid=28136248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors: perceived severity, vulnerability, response efficacy.

*''[[Transtheoretical model|Trans-theoretical model]]:'' This theory uses "stages of change" to create a nexus between powerful principles and processes of behavior change derived from leading theories of behavior change.  Incorporates aspects of the integrative biopsychosocial model (CITE).

*''[[Self-regulation theory|Self-regulation model]]:'' Embodies the belief that people have control over their own behavior change journey, as long as they have the resources and understanding to do so.  Aims to create long-term effects for particular situations and contexts.  Mainly focuses on stopping negative behaviors.  

*''[[Relapse prevention]] model:'' Focuses on immediate determinants and underhanded antecedent behaviors/factors that contribute and/or lead to relapse.  Aims to identify high-risk situations and work with participants to cope with such conditions.  Factors: self-efficacy, stimulus control.

*''[[Behaviorism|Learning theory]]:'' Aims to understand prior context of behavior development that leads to certain consequences.  

*''[[Social cognitive theory]]:'' Explains behavior learning through observation and social contexts.  Centered on the belief that behavior is a context of the environment through psychological processes.  Factors: self-efficacy, knowledge, behavioral capability, goal setting, outcome expectations, observational learning, reciprocal determinism, reinforcement. 

*''[[Self-determination theory]]:'' Centers around support for natural and/or intrinsic tendencies with behavior and provides participants with healthy and effective ways to work with those.  Factors: autonomy, competence, and skills. 

*''[[Theory of planned behavior]]:'' Aims to predict the specific plan of an individual to engage in a behavior (time and place), and apply to behaviors over which people have the ability to enact self-control over.  Factors: behavioral intent, evaluation of risks and behavior.

=== Community ===
*''[[Community-based participatory research|Community based participatory research]] (CBPR):'' Utilizes community researcher partnership and collaboration.  People in the designated community work with the researcher to play an active role as well as being the subjects of the study.  

*''[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of innovation]]:'' Seeks to explain how new ideas and behaviors are communicated and spread throughout groups.  Factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trial-ability, observability.

== List of behavior change strategies ==
{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
* Motivational Interviewing
* Goal oriented technique for eliciting and strengthening intrinsic motivation for change.
* Behavioral Contract
* Intent formation, making a commitment, being ready to change. (usually written)
* Knowledge
* Educational information through behavior, consequences and benefits, getting help, acquisition of skills.
* Behavioral Capabilities
* Skill development through practice, modeling, imitation, reenacting, rehearsing.
* Choices
* Building autonomy and intrinsic motivation through relevance, interests and control
* Graded Tasks
* Planning ahead 
* Anticipate barriers
* Problem solving 
* Self – Reporting 
* Self – Adjustment 
* Rewards 
* Stimulus control
* Social support

== Tools ==
* Care groups are groups of 10–15 volunteer, community-based health educators who regularly meet together.
* [[Barrier analysis]] is a rapid assessment tool used in behavior change projects to identify behavioral determinants.
* [[Community-led total sanitation]] is a behaviour change tool used in the [[sanitation]] sector for mainly rural settings in developing countries with the aim to stop [[open defecation]]. The method uses shame, disgust and to some extent peer pressure which leads to the "spontaneous" construction and long-term use of toilets after an initial triggering process has taken place.

=== Behavior change communication (BCC) ===
{{Main article|Social and behavior change communication}}
[[Behavior change communication]], or BCC, is an approach to behavior change focused on communication. It is also known as social and behavior change communication, or SBCC. The assumptions is that through communication of some kind, individuals and communities can somehow be persuaded to behave in ways that will make their lives safer and healthier. BCC was first employed in HIV and TB prevention projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsi.com/JSIInternet/IntlHealth/project/display.cfm?ctid=na&amp;cid=na&amp;tid=40&amp;id=7241|title=Brazil: Behavior Change Communication for More Effective Tuberculosis Control|last=|first=|date=2010–2011|website=John Snow Inc.|publisher=|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hivpolicy.org/Library/HPP000533.pdf|title=Behaviour Change Communication (BCC)for HIV/AIDS a Strategic Framework|last=|first=|date=September 2002|website=HIVPolicy.org|publisher=|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, its ambit has grown to encompass any communication activity whose goal is to help individuals and communities select and practice behavior that will positively impact their health, such as immunization, cervical cancer check up, employing single-use syringes, etc.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Examples  ==
===Organizations, foundations and programs===
* Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs specializes in health-related BCC (behavior change communication) programs, primarily in developing countries. It includes programs in reproductive health and family planning, malaria, and HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccp.jhu.edu/|title=Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6386">The '''Bodenseeklinik''' is a private clinic in [[Lindau]], Germany. The clinic was founded by Dr. Werner Mang, who is also the medical director. 
Every year, approximately 2,000-3,000 plastic surgeries are performed at the Bodenseeklinik.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title=Bodenseeklinik bewältigte 2014 über 2.000 erfolgreiche Eingriffe|url=http://www.gesundheit-infos-247.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=16475 |accessdate=17 August 2015 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bodenseeklinik-Lindau.jpg|thumb|Bodenseeklinik-Lindau]]

== History ==
In 1989, the clinic was founded by Dr. Werner Mang. Initially started as a small private clinic for plastic surgery, the clinic’s capacity has grown from six to ten and later 20 beds. Ten years later, in 2000, the new hospital wing worth €25 million was built on the Western part of the small island that belongs to the city of Lindau.
The new building was built directly on the shores of Lake Constance in park-like surroundings. In 2003, the building’s extension was finished and opened as a private clinic which specialized in plastic and aesthetic surgery. Nowadays, the Bodenseeklinik features 50 beds on two wards, five operating rooms, one auditorium and a research lab. Currently, it is the biggest private clinic for aesthetic surgery in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title=Bodenseeklinik feierte ihr 25-jähriges Gründungsjubiläum |url=http://newsfenster.de/medizin-gesundheit-wellness/pm185088-bodenseeklinik-feierte-25-jaehriges-gruendungsjubilaeum-presseservice-bodenseeklinik-gmbh.html |accessdate=20 August 2015 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title=Werner Mang: Der König der Nasen |url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/panorama/Werner-Mang-Der-Koenig-der-Nasen-id18739386.html|accessdate=19 August 2015 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical principles and training facility ==
The Bodenseeklinik follows a “gentle path to beauty”, and all doctors work and teach according to this principle. Mang and his team always stress the importance of preserving both health and the natural looks of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title=Werner Mang: Ausbildung / Academy |url=http://www.bodenseeklinik.de/ausbildung-academy|accessdate=19 August 2015 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The „Mang School“ believes in the motto ''Less is more''. Following this motto the director, Prof. Mang published the book a Manual of Aesthetic Surgery which features the current trend towards more gentle surgical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title=Manual of Aesthetic Surgery|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783540787945#aboutBook|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a training hospital, the clinic features one lecture hall. From here, live videos of operations are streamed so that young doctors can watch them during their classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title=Man muss nicht jede Falte wegbügeln |url=http://www.bodenseeklinik.de/images/pdf/presse-media-bereich/B2B_2_2013_Auszug_Mang.pdf |accessdate=18 August 2015 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Commitment==
Medical director Werner Mang, Chairman of the Prof.-Mang-Foundation, performs surgery on children from socially weak families. Lately, the plastic surgeon operated the elven year old boy Suresh from Nepal. Suresh was suffering from a tumor that disfigured his face and denied him to eat and talk. The family could not afford any medication or operation. With the support of his colleague, Mang reconstructed the face of the young boy in an eight-hour surgical intervention free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title= Prof. Dr. Mang schenkt nepalesischem Jungen ein neues Gesicht |url= http://www.presseanzeiger.de/pa/Prof-Dr-Mang-schenkt-nepalesischem-Jungen-ein-neues-Gesicht-564017|accessdate=2 December 2015 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bodenseeklinik also does facial reconstruction for all victims injured by the [[Ramstein air show disaster]]. There is often more than one operation needed to reconstruct the facial appearance for fire victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title= Prof. Mang: Ramstein-Opfer wurde im April erneut operiert|url= http://www.nachrichten.net/details/33573695/Prof_Mang_Ramstein_Opfer_wurde_im_April_erneut_operiert.html|accessdate=30 November 2015 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The European Unions 2008 "'''C'''lassification, '''L'''abelling and '''P'''ackaging" regulation incorporates the classification criteria and labelling rules agreed at the UN level, the so-called Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). It introduced new classification criteria, [[european hazard symbols]] (pictograms) and [[Risk and Safety Statements]] for labelling, while taking into account elements which were part of the prior EU legislation.

The regulation requires companies to appropriately classify, label and package their substances and mixtures before placing them on the market. It aims to protect workers, consumers and the environment by labelling that reflects a particular chemical's possible hazards. It also addresses the notification of classifications, the establishment of a list of harmonised classifications and the creation of a classification and labelling inventory, as required by REACH.

==Implementation==
The regulation came into force in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagent.co.uk/chemical-glossary/#clpregs Chemical Glossary : CLP Regulation], reagent.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers and importers had already pre-registered more than 140,000 substances with the [[European Chemicals Agency]] under the REACH Regulation. They had until 1 December 2010 to propose "provisional classifications" for these substances, which have been used for the labelling of pure substances since that date. The deadline for classifying mixtures was 31 May 2015. The deadline for re-labelling and re-packaging of products already on the market was two years later: 1 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://newsletter.echa.europa.eu/de/home/-/newsletter/entry/labels-make-sure-you-re-legal-after-1-june-2017 Labels – make sure you’re legal after 1 June 2017]'', [[European Chemicals Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further legislation 2008–2009==
In 2008, Directive 2008/112/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0112:EN:NOT Directive 2008/112/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 amending Council Directives 76/768/EEC, 88/378/EEC, 1999/13/EC and Directives 2000/53/EC, 2002/96/EC and 2004/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to adapt them to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures]&lt;/ref&gt; and regulation (EC) No 1336/2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008R1336:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 1336/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 amending Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 in order to adapt it to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures]&lt;/ref&gt; adapted classification-based provisions in other existing EU legislation (“downstream legislation”) to the new rules.{{technical statement|date=November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3780">A '''cascade effect''' is an inevitable and sometimes unforeseen chain of events due to an act affecting a [system].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O14-cascadeeffect.html&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a possibility that the cascade effect will have a negative impact on the system, it is possible to analyze the effects with a consequence/[[impact evaluation|impact analysis]]. Cascade effects are commonly visualised in tree structures, also called [[event trees]].

==In aeronautics==
Cascade effects seen in the perspective of space travelling are theoretical possibilities that "space junk" or a [[satellite]] destroyed by a [[meteor]] will send debris throughout the orbits of most [[Communications satellite|telecommunication satellites]] destroying them in the process and subsequently sending that debris into all possible orbits, destroying everything in orbit around the Earth, known as the [[Kessler syndrome]]. It is theorized that if this occurs, space flight beyond Earth will become very difficult if not impossible.

==In medicine==
In biology, according to Mold and Stein, the term cascade refers to "a process that, once started, proceeds stepwise to its full, seemingly inevitable, conclusion".&lt;ref name = Mold&gt;{{cite journal

These result in [[Medical error|iatrogenic injury]] and from medical error flows a cascade of effects and results often including pain, disability, loss of job, poverty and homelessness which obviously cause mental health problems and may cause death. In medicine, a cascade effect may also refer to a chain of events initiated by an unnecessary test, an unexpected result, or patient or physician anxiety, which results in ill-advised tests or treatments that may cause harm to patients as the results are pursued.  An example would be ordering a full body [[CT scan]] without a clear reason, finding an [[incidentaloma]] and undergoing a debilitating surgery to remove it, despite the fact that the condition was [[asymptomatic]] and possibly [[benign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A '''dental spa''' is a [[Dentistry|dental]] facility supervised by a licensed Oral Health Care Provider in which dental services are provided alongside [[spa]] treatments.&lt;ref&gt;(Toronto Star November 2002 coverage of Dental Spa Pacific Palisades and citing ''The Guardian,’' London, Jan. 2003)(“The Atlanta Center for Cosmetic Dentistry in Georgia is one of the first of these new dental spas.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Spa dentistry" refers to dental practices that offer many services not normally associated with dental care: facials, paraffin wax hand treatment, reflexology, micro-dermabrasion, massage therapy, Botox and Restylane treatment, and many other pampering, therapeutic and rejuvenating offerings.&lt;ref name="One-Stop Shopping"&gt;Glick, M. [http://jada.ada.org/cgi/reprint/138/3/282.pdf One-Stop Shopping] ''J Am Dent Assoc.'' Vol 138, No 3, 282-283 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The administration of botox and restylane is based on each respective state's dental board approval.

==Etymology==
The American Dental Association notes that the consumer media have coined the term “dental spa,” but many practices offer services and amenities specifically designed to relax patients without considering themselves a “spa.”&lt;ref name="ada.org"&gt;American Dental Assoc. News Release [https://www.ada.org/public/media/releases/0310_release04.asp Growing Number of Oral Health Care Providers Offer Patient-Pampering Amenities] ''J Am Dent Assoc'' October 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The loose definition of “dental spas” makes it difficult if not impossible to know how many dental spas exist in the United States.&lt;ref name="ada.org"/&gt;

In 2003, Lynn Watanabe, DDS of the Dental Spa in Pacific Palisades, California, and the Day Spa Association defined a dental spa as "a facility whose dental program is run under the strict supervision of a licensed Oral Health Care Provider, which might be a Dentist or an Independent Dental Hygienist. Services are provided that integrate both traditional and non-traditional dental and spa treatments (such as massage therapy, skincare and body treatments)." &lt;ref&gt;Day Spa Association Glossary 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackjack 2006"&gt;Dental+Spa=Blackjack, American Dental Association 147th Annual Scientific Session, October 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Chinese all used certain methods to relax a person suffering from ailments such as a toothache. The "barber surgeon" in the 18th and 19th century allowed barbers to perform some dental procedures as well as shaves and haircuts.&lt;ref name="Blackjack 2006"/&gt; The term "spa dentistry" (synonymous to dental spa) was used in the 18th century to describe dental practitioners in Bath England.&lt;ref name="Fawcett"&gt;Fawcett, T., Spa dentistry: practitioners in 18th century Bath. May 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Curris, a female dentist in 18th Century Bath England likely created the first dental spa offering patients dentistry with skin and bodycare.&lt;ref name="Fawcett"/&gt;

The terms, “dental spa” and “spa dentistry,” began to be more publicly used in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SB&amp;p_theme=sb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB04654130C30AC&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM“Dental Spa Opens May 1”] (April 9, 1997). ''The Sacramento Bee'' ("The Dental Spa" teeth whitening salon opened May 1, 1997, in California.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Lorin Berland]] DDS, reserved the name DallasDentalSpa.com.&lt;ref&gt;Wahl, P., Hollett, L., Hegarty, G. [http://www.dentaleconomics.com/display_article/212874/54/none/none/Feat/KNOCKS-and-Rubs-of-Dental-Spas KNOCKS and Rubs of Dental Spas] Dental Economics (Sept. 29, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline===

====1990s====
'''1994''' London's ''The Guardian'' has identified the Atlanta Center for Cosmetic Dentistry as "one of the first of these new dental spas.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian,’' London, (Jan. 2003)("The Atlanta Center for Cosmetic Dentistry in Georgia is one of the first of these new dental spas."&lt;/ref&gt; The February 19, 2007 reported that Debra Gray King, DDS, began providing spa services at the Atlanta Center for Cosmetic Dentistry in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, V. (Feb 19, 2007) [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/10/magazine/tm-dentalspa28“ Relax and say, ‘Ahhh’; Stressed about that dental cleaning and exam? Some spa-like offices now offer aromatherapy, facials, even massages.”] ''Los Angeles Times'' (“Dr. Debra Gray King, an Atlanta dentist who has been featured on ABC’s '‘Extreme Makeover,'’ has been offering spa services since 1994.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1996''' Lorin Berland DDS, began providing a massage therapist on staff.&lt;ref name="rdh"&gt;Dalin, J. [http://www.rdhmag.com/login/index.html;jsessionid=3AB6D263C47AB65BEBC053607ECD8AE2 A conversation with...Lorin Berland, DDS]. ''Dental Economics'' (April 1, 2005) (For me, probably the first step in spa dentistry came in 1996 when I brought a massage therapist into the office.")&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1999''' On July 11, 1999, the New York Times reported several Long Island dentists were offering "distraction techniques" by offering massage therapy to their patients. The article reports that massage services were offered since early 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/nyregion/open-wide-and-how-about-a-massage.html?pagewanted=1] New York Times,"Open Wide, and How About a Massage?" July 11, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000s====
'''2001''' On October 1, 2002, ''Salt Lake Magazine'' reported that the Dental Spa in Sugarhouse provided patients with complimentary spa services such as temple massage, hand treatments, eye masks, and other techniques aimed at calming the patients.  The spa services were provided since the Spa's inception in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Salt Lake Magazine, October 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2002''' On August 12, 2002, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported Lynn Watanabe, DDS, one of the field's "pioneers," opened "Dental Spa" in Pacific Palisades, California, with a full-time esthetician and full-time massage therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, August 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early adopters===
The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' noted Jeff Golub-Evans of New York and Grace Sun of Los Angeles,&lt;ref&gt;"Massaging More Than Your Gums" September 10, 2002. ''The Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
In 2003, the American Dental Association reported that more than 50% of 427 practicing dentists surveyed at their annual session offered some sort of spa or office amenity.&lt;ref&gt;Spa Dentistry. Aug/Sept. 2004. ''AGD Impact''. The Academy of General Dentistry.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, as many as 5% of the American Dental Association's more than 152,000 members had declared themselves "dental spas".{{cn|date=May 2016}}  In 2007, the ADA estimated that possibly that one in every 20 dental offices in the United States actually offers, to some extent, some spa dentistry services to their patients.&lt;ref name="One-Stop Shopping"/&gt;

==Professional associations==
In 1978, the [[Holistic Dental Association]] was formed to focus on the mind-body connection and the dental patient's well being. Spa dentistry is recognized by the International Medical Spa Association and the Day Spa Association, but similar to the field of cosmetic dentistry, is not recognized as a specialty practice area by the American Dental Association. In 2002, Lynn Watanabe, DDS founded the first dental spa association with the creation of the International Dental Spa Association.&lt;ref&gt;Southwest Airlines Spirit Magazine, August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The New York Times'' reported in 2006 that "it now has ten members and are coming up with guidelines for what services constitute a dental spa."&lt;ref&gt;Alsever, J. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/business/yourmoney/30dentist.html?pagewanted=all At the Oral Health Care Provider's Office, X-Rays, Root Canals and, Now, Pampering] ''New York Times,'' (April 30, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dental fear studies==
One of the main reasons people avoid visiting the dentist is dental anxiety.&lt;ref name="jada.ada.org"&gt;Smith, T, Heaton, L [http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/134/8/1101 Fear of Dental Care: Are We Making Progress?] ''J Am Dent Assoc'' Vol 134, No. 8, 1101-1108, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bails, J.  [http://health.msn.com/health-topics/oral-care/slideshow.aspx?cp-documentid=100199125&amp;imageindex=2 Spa Dentistry: Indulgent treatments reduce the stress of once-dreaded appointments.] ‘’MSN Health &amp; Fitness’’&lt;/ref&gt; Dental anxiety drives some people to create more dental problems by not visiting the dentist on a regular basis. Patients who are high in dental anxiety have the greatest likelihood of avoiding dental treatment.&lt;ref name="jada.ada.org"/&gt; An estimated nine percent to fifteen percent of the American population—about 30 million to 40 million people—avoid essential dental care because of fear or anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;WPTV, May 14, 2008, [http://www.wptv.com/content/health/mb/story/Dental-Spas/62Bg2I0hk0Ggk0JmQsIh3A.cspx Dental Spas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WFTV, June 17, 2008, [http://www.wftv.com/health/16628390/detail.html Patients Relaxing in Dental Spas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known scientific study on [[dental fear]] occurred in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Shoben EJ, Borland L. An empirical study of the etiology of dental fears. ‘’J Clin Psychology’’ 1954;10:171–4.[Medline]&lt;/ref&gt; Dental anxiety has been a well-studied phenomenon since the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="jada.ada.org"/&gt;  Since then, studies and several books report successful treatment of patients with dental fear using behavioral methods.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger RF. Managing the apprehensive dental patient. Cincinnati: Heritage Communications; 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger RF. How to overcome fear of dentistry. Cincinnati: Heritage Communications; 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milgrom P, Weinstein P, Getz T. Treating fearful dental patients. 2nd ed. Seattle: University of Washington; 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Although there are many variations, adapters of the dental spa concept generally offer cosmetic, general, and restorative dentistry with a key focus on making the visit a pampering and pleasant experience.&lt;ref&gt;Song, S. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003969,00.html “Root Canals Are Better With a Foot Massage,”] ''Time,'' December 30, 2002. (“You feel like you're there to get nurtured and pampered.”).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3389">'''ERG theory''' is a theory in [[psychology]] proposed by [[Clayton Alderfer]].
[[File:Alderfer's ERG Theory.jpg|thumb]]

Alderfer further developed [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] by categorizing the hierarchy into his '''ERG theory''' ([[Existence]], [[Coefficient of relationship|Relatedness]] and Growth). The existence group is concerned with providing the basic material existence requirements of humans. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs is those of relatedness&amp;nbsp;– the desire people have for maintaining important [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]]. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for [[personal development]]. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under [[self-actualization]].
Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category. The Growth category contained the self-actualization and self-esteem needs. Alderfer also proposed a regression theory to go along with the ERG theory. He said that when needs in a higher category are not met then individuals redouble the efforts invested in a lower category need. For example if self-actualization or [[self-esteem]] is not met then individuals will invest more effort in the relatedness category in the hopes of achieving the higher need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.washington.edu/inde495/lece.htm Design in the Manufacturing Firm syllabus] University of Washington Industrial Engineering course syllabus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5030">'''The European Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOPE or SIOP Europe) ''' is an organisation representing all professionals working in the field of childhood cancers in Europe. SIOPE has more than 1,680 members across 35 European countries.&lt;ref name="vaasal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaasal|first1=Gilles|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=Edel|last3=Schrappe|first3=Martin|title=Challenges for Children and Adolescents With Cancer in Europe: The SIOP-Europe Agenda|journal=Pediatric Blood &amp; Cancer|date=2014|volume=61|issue=9|pages=1551–1557|doi=10.1002/pbc.25044|pmid=24706509|pmc=4285788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1998 as the European branch of [[International_Society_of_Paediatric_Oncology|The International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP)]], SIOPE became an independent organisation with a permanent office in Brussels (Belgium) in 2007.&lt;ref name="vaasal" /&gt;

== Activities ==
SIOPE aims to support education for health professionals and facilitate new drugs development by participating in EU-funded projects such as: The Joint Action on Rare Cancers (JARC)&lt;ref name="eceuropa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andriukaitis|first1=Vytenis|title=EUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR PAEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY (SIOPE) DAY, EUROPEAN CANCER CONGRESS – AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS – 27 JANUARY 2017|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/andriukaitis/announcements/european-society-paediatric-oncology-siope-day-european-cancer-congress-amsterdam-netherlands-27_en|website=European Commission|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=21 November 2017|date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; or The European Reference Network on Paediatric Cancer (ERN PaedCan)&lt;ref name="landenstein"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ladenstein|first1=Ruth|title=A cross-border healthcare network to cure childhood cancers|url=https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/partner_article/siope/cross-border-healthcare-network-cure-childhood-cancers|website=The Parliament Magazine|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. SIOPE led the preparation of the ‘European Standards of care for Children with Cancer’, a document that was published in 2009 and translated into 21 languages.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowalczyk|first1=Jerzy|last2=Samardakiewicz|first2=Marzena|last3=Fitzgerald|first3=Edel|title=Towards reducing inequalities: European Standards of Care for Children with Cancer|journal=European Journal of Cancer|date=2013|volume=50|issue=3|pages=481–485|doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2013.11.004|pmid=24300454|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804913009994#!|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

SIOPE has also been involved in several discussions with EU policy-makers on the revision and assessment of EU legislation on paediatric medicines. Every year, SIOPE marks the International Childhood Cancer Day, which is a one-day event organised at the [[European_Parliament|European Parliament]] in Brussels, in order to raise awareness on the growing challenges posed by this disease. &lt;ref name="iccd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/partner_article/siope/international-childhood-cancer-awareness-day-2016|website=The Parliament Magazine|accessdate=21 November 2017|title=International Childhood Cancer Awareness Day 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Strategic Plan ==
On 18 November 2015, the SIOPE Strategic Plan ‘A European Cancer Plan for Children and Adolescents’ was officially launched at the European Parliament during a key event hosted by MEP [[Lojze Peterle|Alojz Peterle]] and co-organised by SIOPE and the ‘MEPs Against Cancer’ Group.&lt;ref name="maclaunch"&gt;{{cite web|title=SIOPE – MAC Launch: European Cancer Plan for Children and Adolescents|url=http://www.europeancancerleagues.org/mac/mac-events/400-siope-mac-launch-european-cancer-plan-for-children-and-adolescents.html|website=The Association of European Cancer Leagues|publisher=The Association of European Cancer Leagues|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of the plan is to improve both the cure rate and the quality of life for survivors of childhood cancer, with the ultimate aim of increasing disease-free and late-effect free survival. This document presents the 7 medical and scientific objectives that should be achieved for the next decade in order to increase the cure rate and the quality of survivorship for children and young people with cancer.&lt;ref name="strategicplan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vassal|first1=Gilles|last2=Schrappe|first2=Martin|last3=Pritchard-Jones|first3=Kathy|last4=Arnold|first4=Fréderic|last5=Basset|first5=Luisa|title=The SIOPE strategic plan: A European cancer plan for children and adolescents|journal=Journal of Cancer Policy|date=2016|volume=8|pages=17–32|doi=10.1016/j.jcpo.2016.03.007|url=http://www.journalcancerpolicy.net/article/S2213-5383(16)30001-7/abstract|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FoodCycle''' is a UK charity (no. 1134423) that combines surplus food, spare kitchen spaces and volunteers to create three-course meals for people at risk of food poverty and social isolation. &lt;ref&gt;Rosie Birkett, [http://www.metro.co.uk/lifestyle/848026-dishing-up-a-wastey-treat, ''FoodCycle: Dishing up a wastey treat''], ''The Metro'', 22 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  

FoodCycle operates from [[London]], England, but has operations throughout the [[United Kingdom]] (see list of operations below).

==History==
In September 2008, Canadian Kelvin Cheung founded FoodCycle. He decided to start the organisation after hearing about the US on-campus student service program, [[Campus Kitchen]], where students use on-campus kitchen space and donated food from their cafeterias to prepare nourishing meals for their communities. FoodCycle’s pilot hubs were at the [[Imperial College London]] and the [[London School of Economics]]. In October 2010, the first Community Café was opened at [[Stroud Green]], [[Haringey]], [[London]], called Station House.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Youle, [http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/community_cafes_serve_up_something_different_1_705346,''Community Cafe serves up something different''], ''Ham &amp; High'', 25 Oct. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
FoodCycle’s mission is to combine volunteers, surplus food and spare kitchen spaces to create nutritious meals and positive social change in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Morris, [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23904298-join-the-waste-watchers.do ''Join the Waste Watchers''], ''The London Evening Standard'', 6 December 2010 ,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
*In March 2010, named '''New Charity of the Year''' for the Charity Times Awards &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Holt, [http://www.charitytimes.com/ct/2010_Charity_Times_Awards_winners.php ''Charity Times award winners announced''], 3 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*In November 2010, received award from the '''Arthur Guinness Fund''' &lt;ref&gt;Jessica Odubayo, [http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/news/east_end_life/1_november/food_charity_wins_award.aspx ''Food charity wins award''], '''Tower Hamlets''' 1 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*In January 2011, received the Prime Minister's '''Big Society Award'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodcycle.org.uk/dl/FoodCycle-wins-Prime-Ministers-Big-Society-Award-21012011.pdf ''FoodCycle wins Prime Minister's Big Society Award''], 11 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Constituent school of the Hospital for Joint Diseases ===
A school of nursing was founded October 15, 1945, by New York City's Hospital for Joint Diseases, offering a one-year curriculum leading to becoming a [[Licensed Practical Nurse]]. Its inaugural class graduated October 29, 1946. By 1950, the program was named "'''Hospital for Joint Diseases School of Practical Nursing'''".

The school, in 1955, received a grant from the [[Helene Fuld Health Foundation]] and was subsequently named the "'''Helene Fuld School of Practical Nursing'''".

In 1964, under the leadership of Justine Hannan, RN, Director of Nursing Services and Nursing Education, the school launched the first program in the country to offer [[licensed practical nurse]]s an accredited curriculum in higher education leading to a degree as a [[Registered nurse]]. In 1973, Mary Ahl-Heugel ''(née'' Mary Ellen Ahl; born 1918), PhD, RN, became Director of Nursing Education. In 1976, the school received a permanent charter from New York State with the authority to confer the Associate degrees in Applied Science with a nursing concentration, becoming one of the first hospital-based schools in New York State to offer the associate degree. 

In 1978, the school phased out its practical nurse program. The last class of about 300 in practical nursing graduated in October 1978.

In 1979 the Hospital for Joint Diseases relocated downtown on East 17th Street and a new, private, non-profit corporation named "Joint Diseases North General Hospital" became the new tenant at 1919 Madison Avenue location in [[East Harlem]]. Helene Fuld College of Nursing had been, since October 15, 1945, a New York State Registered Nursing School.

=== Constituent college of North General Hospital ===
In 1980, Margaret Wines, PhD, RN, became Dean. In 1981, the school's associate degree program became the first such hospital program to be accredited by the [[National League for Nursing]]. On October 27, 1987, the hospital was renamed [[North General Hospital]].&lt;ref name="NY-Dept-of-State" /&gt; In 1988, the school became the first hospital-based nursing school to become accredited by the [[Middle States Commission on Higher Education]].

On December 12, 1991, North General Hospital moved into a newly built, modern facility at 1879 Madison Avenue, between 120th and 121st Streets, two blocks south of its old location.&lt;ref name="NYTs 1991 Dec 12" Group=lower-roman /&gt; In 1992, the Helene Fuld School of Nursing moved into its current location at 24 East 120th Street, New York.

In February 1996, with the permission of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, the name "'''Helene Fuld School of Nursing'''" was changed to "'''Helene Fuld College of Nursing'''", reflecting the depth and breadth its curricular programs in higher education.

=== Independent college ===
In July 2007, the College separated from North General hospital and amended its charter with the [[New York State Board of Regents]] as an independent not-for-profit college.&lt;ref name="Chronicle-of-Higher-Ed 2007 Oct 12" group=lower-roman /&gt; [[North General Hospital]] – its former parent institution – closed July 2, 2010, and filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews 2010 Jun 28" group=lower-roman /&gt; In 2012, Wendy Robinson, [[PhD]], [[Registered nurse|RN]], became President of the College and the [[New York State Education Department]] authorized the College to confer [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|Bachelor of Science]] degrees for registered nurses.&lt;ref name="FuldCollegeAnnualReport 2014" /&gt;

=== Colors ===
The college uses blue, green, purple, and black in its publications.  Moreover, the interior design color palette of the college's main reception area uses those colors. With the exception of black, nurses commonly wear [[Scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]] in those colors. Since 2010, there has been a growing trend for hospitals and health care organizations to assign scrub color codes to help identify healthcare professional by discipline or department. Color coded uniforms, however, have been widely criticized by healthcare workers for various reasons, one being that it cultivates a [[caste]] mentality in an environment that requires teamwork across all disciplines.  In any event, the colors at the college do not represent a particular discipline or academic level.

== Notable people ==

===Hospital executives===
*[[Abraham Rosenberg]] (1900–1976) was appointed Executive Director of '''Hospital for Joint Diseases''' in 1952; he had been associated with the hospital since 1929.

Dowling; 1881–1966), who retired after having served as Superintendent of Nurses at HJD for 21 years.&lt;ref name="AmericanJournalofNursing 1945 Dec" /&gt; In 1946, Huffman became the Founding Director of the School of Nursing at HJD.

:Huffman had earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of Illinois]] (Physical Education) in 1923&lt;ref name="Illo 1924" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Univ-Ill-CommenceProgram 1923" /&gt; and a Graduate Nurse degree from the School of Nursing at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="St_Louis_Post-Dispatch 1936 Jun 7" group=lower-roman /&gt; In 1940, Huffman was appointed Superintendent of Nurses at the [[Ellis Fischel Cancer Center]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. During [[World War II]], around 1943, Huffman had been a representative and recruiter for the [[Cadet Nurse Corps]].&lt;ref name="St_Louis_Post-Dispatch 1940 Mar 17" group=lower-roman /&gt;&lt;ref name="NebraskaStateJournal 1943 Oct 31" group=lower-roman /&gt;  From October 1943 through December 1943, Huffman served on the field staff of the Nursing Council on National Defense, an organization that ran from 1940 to 1951, with an objective to analyze the country's needs for the education, procurement, and distribution of professional nursing and auxiliary nursing services in relation to national defense.

*[[James C. Frauenthal]], PhD (born 1944), had been a long-term Trustee of the Helene Fuld College of Nursing and the Hospital for Joint Diseases.  He is the brother of Stephen C. Frauenthal.

== Neighborhood ==
The immediate neighborhood, until about 1992, had been [[Urban decay|blighted]].  This was the case with many neighborhoods and districts throughout the [[Boroughs of New York City|five boroughs]].  In 1992, when [[North General Hospital]] moved into its new quarters two blocks south, Maple Plaza, an eight-story, 155-unit residential co-op, designated for affordable housing, was built in its place at 1919 [[Madison Avenue]].&lt;ref name="Journal-Housing-Comm-Dev 2002 Mar-Apr" /&gt;  Maple Plaza was developed in the 1990s under a plan by the city and [[North General Hospital]] to revive the area around the hospital.  Eugene Louis McCabe (1937–1998), President and CEO of [[North General Hospital]] from its inception in 1979 until his death in 1998, was a strong advocate of developing Maple Plaza.  Maple Court, another similar project in the area with 135 units, was completed before Maple Plaza.  Since then, the area around [[Marcus Garvey Park]] has developed.  The neighborhood is no longer blighted.  While [[gentrification]] is typically criticized by civic leaders for making neighborhoods unaffordable – particularly to those who, for generations have thrived and lived there – the neighborhood surrounding [[Marcus Garvey Park]], by design, offers a mix of [[New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development|affordable housing]].  At the same time, adjusting to [[gentrification]] throughout Harlem is an ongoing concern of policy makers, citizens, civic leaders, and religious leaders.

Two blocks west of the college, in the [[Mount Morris Park Historic District]], there has been considerable recent (since 2000) residential development and restoration.  The stretch of 122nd Street between Mount Morris Park West and [[Lenox Avenue|Malcolm X Boulevard]] ''(aka'' [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] and [[Lenox Avenue]]) is known as "Doctors' Row".&lt;ref name="NYTs 1999 Feb 7" group=lower-roman /&gt;  As has been the case in many neighborhoods throughout the [[Boroughs of New York City|five boroughs]], old, historic residential buildings, including [[brownstones]], fell into disrepair.&lt;ref name="ChicagoTrib 1998 Jun 21" group=lower-roman /&gt;  Until around 1999, on Mount Morris Park West, between 120 and 121st Streets, there was a row of brownstones, built around 1885, which, according to the ''[[New York Times]],'' were so deteriorated that they came known as "The "Ruins".  That row has been completely rebuilt into luxury [[Condominium|condominiums]] that were initially priced for [[Mixed-income housing|mixed income]] buyers.&lt;ref name="NYTs 1999 Sep 22" group=lower-roman /&gt; Revitalization since the 1990s has occurred in many neighborhoods, including the [[Mount Morris Park Historic District]], notably brownstones, and in particular the [[brownstones]] at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 West 122nd Street, on the south side of the street, which date back to 1888 and 1889.  Those particular [[brownstones]] were designed by [[William Tuthill]].  St. Martin's Episcopal Church, featuring a tower that houses the city's second largest [[carillon]] (40 bells), is at 18 West 122nd Street – at the corner of [[Lenox Avenue|Malcolm X Boulevard]].  It is a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Designated Landmark]].&lt;ref name="Gregg-Nanda-Pacheco 2004" /&gt;

"Fifth on the Park," Harlem's first [[Upper East Side]]-style high-rise [[Condominium|condominium]] tower is one block east from the college, at the southeast corner of 120th Street and [[Fifth Avenue]] – at 1485 [[Fifth Avenue]].  Its architects are [[FXFOWLE Architects|FxFowle]].  The tower, 28 stories, 26 of which are residential, includes a 38,000 square foot (3,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) church with a four-story, 1,800-seat [[sanctuary]] for the Bethel Gospel Assembly, who sold the development rights for a full block.  There are 194 residences, of which 47 are church-owned [[New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development|affordable rental apartments]], and 147 are [[market rate|market-rate]] [[condominium]]s.  The spa includes a 55-foot (16.76 m) [[lap pool]].&lt;ref name="NYTs 2007 Mar 11" group=lower-roman /&gt;

In 1951 school changed its name to Helene Fuld School of Nursing, honoring the mother of its benefactor, Leonhard Felix Fuld – the same benefactor as the Helene College of Nursing in New York City.  The Trenton school closed in 2011, citing, among other things, changes in nursing education.&lt;ref name="Patch 2011 Dec 17" group=lower-roman /&gt;  The Trenton school was not related to the New York school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10129">'''Historical trauma''' ('''HT'''), a term used by [[social worker]]s, [[historian]]s, and [[psychologist]]s, refers to the cumulative emotional and [[psychological wounding]] of an individual or generation caused by a traumatic experience or event. Historical trauma response (HTR) refers to the manifestation of emotions and actions that stem from this perceived trauma.

HTR is exhibited in a variety of ways, most prominently through substance abuse which is used as a vehicle for attempting to numb the pain associated with trauma. HTR often includes other types of self-destructive behavior, such as suicidal thoughts and gestures, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, anger, violence and difficulty recognizing and expressing emotions. Many historians and scholars believe the manifestations of violence and abuse in certain communities are directly associated with the unresolved grief that accompanies continued trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart "The historical trauma response among natives and its relationship to substance abuse: A Lakota illustration." ''[[Journal of Psychoactive Drugs]]'' 35(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical trauma, and its manifestations, are an example of [[transgenerational trauma]]. For example, a pattern of maternal abandonment of a child might be seen across three generations,&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, M. S. (1999). Intergenerational transmission of trauma: Recent contributions from the literature of family systems approaches to treatment. ''American Journal of Psychotherapy, 53''(2), 225-231.&lt;/ref&gt; or the actions of an abusive parent might be seen in continued abuse across generations. These manifestations can also stem from the trauma of events, such as the witnessing of war, genocide, or death.  For these populations that have witnessed these mass level traumas (e.g., war, genocide, colonialism), several generations later these populations tend to have higher rates of disease.&lt;ref name="Sotero"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sotero|first1=Michelle|title=A Conceptual Model of Historical Trauma: Implications for Public Health Practice and Research|journal=Journal of Health Disparities Research|date=2006|volume=1|issue=1|pages=93-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First used by social worker and mental health expert [[Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart]] in the 1980s, scholarship surrounding historical trauma has expanded to fields outside of the Lakota communities Yellow Horse Brave Heart studied.&lt;ref&gt;Vinnie Rotondaro,"'Reeling from the Impact' of Historical Trauma," National Catholic Reporter, September 03, 2015. https://www.ncronline.org/news/peace-justice/reeling-impact-historical-trauma&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow Horse Brave Heart's scholarship focused on the ways in which the psychological and emotional traumas of colonization, relocation, assimilation, and [[American Indian boarding school|American Indian boarding schools]] have manifested within generations of the Lakota population. Yellow Horse Brave Heart's article "Wakiksuyapi: Carrying the Historical Trauma of the Lakota," published in 2000, compares the effects and manifestations of historical trauma on Holocaust survivors and Native American peoples. Her scholarship concluded that the manifestations of trauma, although produced by different events and actions, are exhibited in similar ways within each afflicted community.

Other significant original research on the mechanisms and transmission of intergenerational trauma has been done by scholars such as [[Daniel Schechter]], whose work builds on the pioneers in this field such as: [[Judith Kestenberg]], [[Dori Laub]], [[Selma Fraiberg]], Alicia Lieberman, [[Susan Coates]], [[Charles Zeanah]], Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Yael Danieli, [[Rachel Yehuda]] and others. Although each scholar focuses on a different population – such as Native Americans, African Americans, or Holocaust Survivors – all have concluded that the mechanism and transmission of intergenerational trauma is abundant within communities that experience traumatic events. Daniel Schechter's work has included the study of experimental interventions that may lead to changes in trauma-associated mental representation and may help in the stopping of intergenerational cycles of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Myers MM, Brunelli SA, Coates SW, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Grienenberger JF, Marshall RD, McCaw JE, Trabka KA, Liebowitz MR (2006). Traumatized mothers can change their minds about their toddlers: Understanding how a novel use of videofeedback supports positive change of maternal attributions. Infant Mental Health Journal, 27(5), 429-448&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS (2004). Intergenerational communication of violent traumatic experience within and by the dyad: The case of a mother and her toddler. Journal of Infant, Child, and Adolescent Psychotherapy, 3(2), 203-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joy DeGruy's book, ''[[Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome]]'', analyzes the manifestation of historical trauma in African-American populations, and its correlation to the lingering effects of slavery. In 2018, Dodging Bullets, the first documentary film&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mspmag.com/arts-and-culture/minnesota-made-documentary-sheds-light-on-historical-trauma-plaguing-native-communities/|title=Minnesota-Made Documentary Sheds Light on Historical Trauma Plaguing Native Communities|last=Poling|first=Les|date=2018-10-02|work=Mpls.St.Paul Magazine|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; to chronicle historical trauma in Indian Country, was released. It included interviews with scientist [[Rachel Yehuda]], sociologist Melissa Walls, and [[Anton Treuer]] along with first hand testimonies of [[Dakota people|Dakota]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Ojibwe]] and [[Blackfeet Nation|Blackfeet]] tribal members.

==Manifestation==
Historical Trauma (HT), or Historical Trauma Response (HTR), can manifest itself in a variety of psychological ways. However, it is most commonly seen through high rates of substance abuse, alcoholism, depression, anxiety, suicide, domestic violence, and abuse within afflicted communities. The effects and manifestations of trauma are extremely important in understanding the present-day conditions of afflicted populations.

Within Native American communities, high rates of alcoholism and suicide have direct correlation to the violence, mistreatment, and abuses experienced at boarding schools, and the loss of cultural heritage and identity these institutions facilitated. Although many present-day children never experienced these schools first-hand, the "injuries inflicted at Indian boarding schools are continuous and ongoing," affecting generations of Native peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Piccard, "Death by Boarding School: "The Last Acceptable Racism" and the United States' Genocide of Native Americans." Gonzaga Law Review 49, 1 (December 2013): 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial oppressors like Australia and Canada have issued formal apologies for their involvement in the creation and implementation of boarding schools that facilitated and perpetuated historical trauma. Australia's [[Bringing Them Home]] report and Canada's [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)]] both detailed the "experiences, impacts, and consequences" of government-sponsored boarding schools on Indigenous communities and children.&lt;ref&gt;"Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada." Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Canadian Government. http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=7&lt;/ref&gt; Both reports also detail the problems facing Indigenous populations today, such as economic and health disparities, and their connection to the historical trauma of colonization, removal, and forced assimilation.

==Treatment==

Treatment of HT must repair the afflicted person or communities' connection with their culture, values, beliefs, and self-image. It takes the forms of individual [[counseling]] or [[therapy]], spiritual help, and group or entire community gatherings, which are all important aspects in the foundations of the healing process. Treatment should be aimed at a renewal of destroyed culture, spiritual beliefs, customs, and family connections, and a focus on reaffirming one's self-image and place within a community. Without proper treatment and understanding, historical trauma will continue to plague generations of afflicted communities.&lt;ref&gt;Swinomish Tribal Mental Health Project. (2002). A Gathering of Wisdoms: Tribal Mental: A cultural Perspective. (2 Ed) Intergeneration Trauma in the Tribal Community (pp. 77-114). LaConner, WA: Swinomish Tribal Mental Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular attention should be given to the needs and empowerment of peoples who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. Social workers and activists should promote [[social justice]] and [[social change]] with and on behalf of clients, individuals, families, groups, and communities. In order for advocacy to be accurate and helpful to the afflicted populations, social workers should understand the [[cultural diversity]], history, culture, and contemporary realities of clients.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, H.N. (1999). Indigenous People and the Social Work Profession: Defining Culturally Competent Services. Social Work 44(3). 217-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Congress of Radiology''' ('''ICR''') is a meeting of radiologists for the exchange of ideas and the harmonisation of international standards and practice, first held in 1925 in London and held at regular intervals since then.  Since 1994 it has become a biennial event.  Until 1953 each congress was organised by radiological society of the host country, but in that year, a formal organisation, the '''International Society for Radiology''' was set up to provide continuity between the congresses.

At the second congress, held in 1928 in Stockholm, three international commissions were set up - the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP), the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) and the [[International Commission on Radiological Education]] (ICRE).  The latter two have become fully functional organisations in their own right while the latter has remained a sub-committee of the ICR.

Within years of [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]] discovering [[X-Rays]] in 1895, they were being used for imaging fractured bones.  Various societies sprung up in different countries where ideas were exchanged between like-minded people and national standards for the measurement of X-Ray intensity developed. These societies also tried to address the problems associated with the dangers of X-Rays, particularly [[cancer]].

By the end of the [[First World War]] a number of proposals on how to measure the intensity of X-Rays had been made, but there was little agreement between the various parties concerned.&lt;ref name=GM&gt;{{cite conference

This congress set up a framework for future meetings - future congresses would meet every three years in a different country, would be organised by the host country. The host country would nominate the chairman of the congress. It was also established that three commissions should be set up which would meet at the congresses:
:*[[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements|The International Commission of Radiation Units &amp; Measures]] (ICRU)
:*[[International Commission on Radiological Protection|The International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP)
:*[[International Commission on Radiological Education|The International Commission on Radiological Education]] (ICRE)
Until the outbreak of the Second World War, congresses were held every three years.  The 1940 congress was due to meet in Berlin in 1940, but was suspended due to the war. Apart from some copies of records kept by the 1973 Congress secretary-general, Benjamin Orndoff, the records of the congress, which had been handed to the German organisers in preparation for the next congress in Germany, were lost during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=ISR_History&gt;{{cite web

The second congress was held in Stockholm under the chairmanship of [[Manne Siegbahn]] where the three commissions proposed in London met for the first time. Subsequent meetings were held in Paris (1931), Zurich (1934) and Chicago (1937).

After the war, the British Institute of Radiology organised the sixth Congress which was held in London, exactly 25 years after the first congress and in the same hall as the first congress. A total of 3364 people from 54 countries including 1,742 radiologists registered for the congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Christie]], who had been nominated thirteen years before was unable to attend the London conference, so Orndoff, the secretary-general of that congress deputised handing the presidency to [[Ralston Paterson]]. The congress also saw a resumption of the work of the three international commissions.

At the seventh congress, held in Copenhagen in 1953, the organisational details of the conference were overhauled and an executive committee under the chairmanship of [[Lauriston S. Taylor]]  was set up to oversee the organisation of future congresses and to provide continuity between congresses.

Before the Second World War, the location of the congresses was dictated largely by the places of residence of the delegates who had to travel by rail or sea - a delegate from the western seaboard of the United States would have to commit a month to attend a week-long ICR congress in Europe.  The advent of air travel removed this restriction and subsequent congresses have since been held in many parts of the world.

== International Society of Radiology ==
The International Society of Radiology was set up in 1953 to oversee the organisation of the International Congresses of Radiology and to provide continuity between congresses.

The 1950 congress provided an occasion for workers in the radiology industry to meet for the first time in over a decade and to discuss the direction future congresses should take. At the 1953 congress, under the guidance of [[Flemming Norgaard]] in Copenhagen  the International Society of Radiology was set up to oversee the organisation of the International Congresses of Radiology rather than the ad hoc arrangement whereby the organisation of the next congress was left entirely in the hands of the host country. A permanent committee would also provide continuity between congresses. Norgard became the first secretary-general of the Society, while the radiologist from the sponsoring society who had been president of a congress was, by that token, president of the ISR until the next meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[drug development]], the '''Investigator's Brochure''' ('''IB''') is a comprehensive document summarizing the body of information about an investigational product ("IP" or "study drug") obtained during a [[drug trial]]. The IB is a document of critical importance throughout the drug development process and is updated with new information as it becomes available. The purpose of the IB is to compile data relevant to studies of the IP in human subjects gathered during preclinical and other clinical trials.

An IB is intended to provide the investigator with insights necessary for management of study conduct and study subjects throughout a clinical trial. An IB may introduce key aspects and safety measures of a [[clinical trial protocol]], such as:
* Dose (of the study drug)
* Frequency of dosing interval
* Methods of administration
* Safety monitoring procedures

An IB contains a "Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator" section, of which the overall aim is to "provide the investigator with a clear understanding of the possible risks and adverse reactions, and of the specific tests, observations, and precautions that may be needed for a clinical trial. This understanding should be based on the available physical, chemical, pharmaceutical, pharmacological, toxicological, and clinical information on the investigational product(s). Guidance should also be provided to the clinical investigator on the recognition and treatment of possible overdose and adverse drug reactions that is based on previous human experience and on the pharmacology of the investigational product".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2015/08/WC500191488.pdf ICH GCP guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;

The sponsor is responsible for keeping the information in the IB up-to-date. The IB should be reviewed annually and must be updated when any new and important information becomes available, such as when a drug has received marketing approval and can be prescribed for use commercially.

Owing to the importance of the IB in maintaining the safety of human subjects in clinical trials, and as part of their guidance on '''[[Good clinical practice|good clinical practice (GCP)]]''', the '''[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]]''' has written regulatory codes and guidances for authoring the IB, and [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|the '''International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)''']] has prepared a detailed guidance for the authoring of the IB in the [[European Union]] ('''EU'''), [[Japan]], and the [[United States]] ('''US''').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073122.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidance documents==
As part of its guidance on [[Good Clinical Practice]] ('''GCP'''), the International Conference on Harmonisation ('''ICH''') has prepared a detailed guidance for the contents of the IB in the European Union ('''EU'''), Japan, and the United States ('''US''').[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073122.pdf]

If many clinical trials have been completed, tables that summarize findings across the various studies can be very useful to demonstrate outcomes in, e.g., different patient populations or different indications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4675">'''James Ormiston McWilliam''' (1808–1862) was a Scottish [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]], physician and writer on infectious diseases, best known as medical officer to the [[1841 Niger expedition]].
[[File:James Ormiston McWilliam.jpg|thumb|James Ormiston McWilliam]]

==Life==
Brought up in [[Dalkeith]], McWilliam became a licentiate of the [[Edinburgh College of Surgeons]] in 1827, and entered the [[Royal Navy]] in 1829 as assistant-surgeon. After serving abroad in this capacity for seven years, he was appointed surgeon to [[HMS Scout (1832)|'''HMS'' Scout]] on the west coast of Africa.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=McWilliam, James Ormiston|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McWilliam returned to England in November 1839, and attended the London medical schools and hospitals. He became M.D. of Edinburgh in 1840, and in September of the same year was appointed senior surgeon on board the steamer ''Albert'', which joined the expedition sent to the [[River Niger]] for geographical and commercial purposes, and against the continuing [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The ''Albert'' and two other vessels left England on 12 May 1841, and entered the Niger on 18 August. On 4 September a malignant fever broke out in the Albert, and almost simultaneously in the other two vessels. The latter were sent back to sea filled with the sick and dying, leaving the ''Albert'' to continue the voyage alone.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

By 4 October the ''Albert'' had also turned back, and was managed for some days by McWilliam and [[William Stanger (surveyor)|William Stanger]], the other officers and crew being unable to take part in the work. In ten days they reached the open sea. A few days later McWilliam himself was taken ill. Out of 145 Europeans who took part in the expedition 130 went down with fever and 40 died; but among 158 Africans there were only 11 cases of fever and 1 death. McWilliam reached England on 19 November 1841.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

After again serving two years afloat, McWilliam was sent on a special mission to the [[Cape de Verde Islands]] to inquire into the [[yellow fever]] which attacked the inhabitants of [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]] soon after the arrival of the [[HMS Infernal (1843)|''HMS'' Eclair]]. In 1847 he was appointed medical officer to the custom house, a post he retained till his death.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1848 McWilliam was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], in 1858 he became [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]], and in 1859 Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians of London]]. He was a member of the [[Epidemiological Society]], and for several years acted as secretary. He was also one of the secretaries to the medical section of the [[International Statistical Congress]] held in London in 1860. He worked to ensure that naval medical officers obtained the official recognition of their rights.

McWilliam died, 4 May 1862, from the effects of a fall in his own home, No. 14 Trinity Square, Tower Hill. He left a widow and several children.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
McWilliam's ''Journal of Practice'' from '''HMS'' Scout. In 1843 he brought out ''Medical History of the Niger Expedition'', which was well received. It included a history of the fever, description, morbid anatomy, sequences, causes, treatment, with cases; with an account of the state of medicine among the Africans and of vaccination; a description of the ventilation of the ships, which was carried out on the plan adopted by [[David Boswell Reid]] for the houses of parliament; an abstract of meteorological observations; and a brief account of the geology of the Niger, condensed from the notes of William Stanger.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

McWilliam's report which established that yellow fever had been imported into Boa Vista by the ''Eclair'', was presented to parliament, and printed in 1847. He contributed to medical and other journals, and also wrote:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

*''Remarks on Dr. Gilbert King's Report on the Fever at Boa Vista'', 1848.
*''Exposition of the Case of the Assistant-Surgeons of the Royal Navy'', 3rd edit. 1850.
*''Further Observations on that portion of Second Report on Quarantine by General Board of Health which relates to Yellow Fever Epidemic on board H.M.S. Eclair, and at Boa Vista'', 1852.
*''On the Health of Merchant Seamen'' (reprinted from ''[[Transactions of the Social Science Association]]'', 1862).

Sir '''James Ranald Martin''' (12 May 1796 – 27 November 1874)&lt;ref&gt;Riddick, D. J. F. (2006) ''The History of British India: A Chronology'' Greenwood Publishing Group, p 216 {{ISBN|0-313-32280-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a surgeon in India who worked in the service of the [[Honourable East India Company]] and was instrumental in publicising the effects of [[deforestation]], and finding links between human and environmental health.

==Early life==
Born in the [[Isle of Skye]] in one of the oldest families living on the island, his father was Rev. Donald Martin and his mother was the daughter of Norman Macdonald and sister of Lieut-Gn. Sir John Macdonald. Martin was educated at St. George's and [[Windmill Street School]]. He became a [[C.C.S.]] in 1811 and entered the [[Bengal]] Medical Service on 5 September 1817. He obtained commission of assistant-surgeon through the interest of his uncle, Sir John MacDonald.&lt;ref name=lancet&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_gsCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71 Biographical sketch in the London Lancet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
He reached [[India]] at the port of [[Calcutta]] in June 1817 by ship, the ''Lord Hungerford'', and reported for duty with the Bengal service on 2 December 1817.&lt;ref name=lancet /&gt;

In 1818 he served in his Majesty's 17th and 59th Regiments forming the garrison of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]]. Here he came to see the effect of [[Cholera]]. He was then sent to [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] where a malignant fever had prevailed and destroyed more than half the inhabitants of [[Ganjam]].&lt;ref name=lancet /&gt; He saw action in a number of military engagements during the 1820s. The most notable of these was the [[First Burmese War]] from 1823–26. His war experiences, especially the fact that diseases affected the [[natives]] and the [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] differently, led him to believe that mapping of the medical features of the empire in much the same way as [[topography]] was critical for military and economic development. His notes on the medical topography of [[Calcutta]] pioneered a genre of works that explored linkages between climate, public health and development. He was made the President of the East India Company's medical board in 1843. In 1856, he substantially re-wrote and extended the then well-known treatise on diseases in the tropics, ''Influence of Tropical Climates'' originally authored by [[James Johnson (surgeon and writer)|James Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, M. (1992) Tropical Medicine in Nineteenth-Century India ''The British Journal for the History of Science'' 25:3, p.302&lt;/ref&gt; He was also appointed as a member of the Sanitary Commission and contributed to the report of the Commission published in 1863.

[[Smallpox]] vaccinations had been started in India around 1803, well before his arrival but Martin was the first major advocate of [[preventive medicine]]. He proposed in 1835 that Company medical officers should collect statistics of places so that they could be collated for study.&lt;ref&gt;Hume Jr., John Chandler (1986) Colonialism and Sanitary Medicine: The Development of Preventive Health Policy in the Punjab, 1860 to 1900. Modern Asian Studies. 20(4):703-724.&lt;/ref&gt; His pioneering report&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. (1836) ''The sanitary conditions of Calcutta''&lt;/ref&gt; on the need for [[public health]] measures and the universal provision of clean water in [[Calcutta]] in 1836 called for a whole series of medico-topographical reports on India by the medical service. During the Burma War, a number of his colleagues in the Medical Department of the Bengal Army wrote topographies of [[Rakhine State]], and in the following years other Company surgeons began to follow suit, producing detailed medical surveys of their town or district. The [[Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta]], of which Martin was a prominent member, and its counterparts in other presidencies, encouraged the publication of such reports in their transactions. Many of these reports&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt; spoke about the rapid rates of deforestation since the early 1820s. Such reports were instrumental in institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of Forest Departments and the [[Indian Forest Service]].

[[File:Kehr-Woche.png|thumb|Sign "Kehr-Woche". The text says: "This week it is your turn"]]
The [[Swabia]]n or [[Württemberg]]ische '''Kehrwoche''' began at the end of the 15th century in Württemberg, to improve household [[cleanliness]]. In its original form, it imposed duties on individual households regarding order and cleanliness inside the common property within the building, like staircases or entrances, as well as outside the house, especially on public pathways and places adjacent to the house. It was a weekly duty, taken in turns, on Saturday.

==History==
Stuttgart's [[municipal law]] from 1492 states, "To ensure that the city stays clean, everyone should remove their muck, (...) from your own street corner every 14 days, although only at night. Those who do not have a privy, must bring the waste to the stream." In the 18th century, a new law, the "clean alley ordnung" came about, that added detail. In 1988 the kehrwoche was abolished as a communal law. It doesn't apply to public order in any part of Baden-Wurtemberg, but it can be part of house rules and rental contracts. The communal order obliges every owner of a house to hold parts of his property, like entrance areas and access paths as well as the public pavements free of dirt, snow and ice. There is no determined time or interval, making it a permanent obligation, contrary to the weekly duty on Saturdays as in the tradition of the kehrwoche.

==Situation today==
In Württemberg, as generally in Germany and other countries, it is typical to include the kehrwoche into the [[rental agreement]], describing which parties on which days clean the sidewalk, shovel snow and clean the staircases. Also a sign displaying the bolded letters "Kehrwoche" is often hung on the door of the party responsible for the Kehrwoche activities of the week. The rental owner as well as the other tenants can see who is responsible for such tasks.

Agreements distinguish between "small" and "large" kehrwoche. Small kehrwoche includes hallways and staircases. Large kehrwoche includes the outdoor sidewalk in front of the house. Outside of Württemberg the cleaning of multi-tenant property is organized very similarly, using "large and small house rule" with identical meaning, as long as the delegation of cleaning responsibilities is not given to costly outside vendors or building superintendent.

The Kehrwoche is often cited as something highly characteristic of Swabians or of Wurttemberg, often seen as proving their petifogging obsession with order. In actual fact it proves to be more of a myth, or a projection of a German characteristic on one particular of its ethnic subgroups.

The statistical annex has detailed charts for homicide counts and rates by country with data from 2000–2012.

Research suggests that intentional homicide demographics are affected by changes in trauma care, leading to changed lethality of violent assaults, so the intentional homicide rate may not necessarily indicate the overall level of societal violence.&lt;ref name="Harris 2002 128–166"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Anthony R. |author2=Stephen H.

A study undertaken by the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]] estimated that there were approximately 490,000 intentional homicides in 2004. The study estimated that the global rate was 7.6 intentional homicides per 100,000 inhabitants for 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Global-Burden-of-Armed-Violence-full-report.pdf |title=Global Burden of Armed Violence Report |publisher=Geneva Declaration Secretariat |date=September 2008 |location=Geneva, Switzerland |format=PDF |type=report |isbn=978-2-8288-0101-4 |pages=67ff |quote=data from 2004-2007}}. [http://www.genevadeclaration.org The Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development].&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]] (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) reported a global average intentional homicide rate of 6.2 per 100,000 population for 2012 (in their report titled "Global Study on Homicide 2013").{{sfn|UNODC|2014|p=12}}&lt;ref name=UNODCXLS&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/data/GSH2013_Homicide_count_and_rate.xlsx Intentional homicide count and rate per 100,000 population, by country/territory (2000-2012)].

==Definition==
[[File:UNODC definition of homicide.png |thumb |400px |right |UNODC statistics only include the intentional killing of others outside of war. Deaths occurring during situations of civil unrest are a grey area.]]
Intentional homicide is defined by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) in its ''Global Study on Homicide'' report:{{sfn|UNODC|2014|p=10}}

{{quote|Within the broad range of violent deaths, the core element of intentional homicide is the complete liability of the direct perpetrator, which thus excludes killings directly related to war or conflicts, self-inflicted death (suicide), killings due to legal interventions or justifiable killings (such as self-defence), and those deaths caused when the perpetrator was reckless or negligent but did not intend to take a human life (non-intentional homicide). 
}}

Though some discrepancies exist in how specific categories of intentional killings are classified, the definitions used by countries to record data are generally close to the UNODC definition, making the homicide rates highly comparable at the international level.{{sfn|UNODC|2014|pp=102-103}} UNODC uses the homicide rate as a proxy for overall violence, as this type of crime is one of the most accurately reported and internationally comparable indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Note of clarification about the Global Study on Homicide 2013|url=https://www.unodc.org/lpo-brazil/en/frontpage/2014/05/02-nota-de-esclarecimento-sobre-o-estudo-global-sobre-homicidios-2013.html|website=UNODC|accessdate=9 May 2018|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures from the Global Study on Homicide are based on the UNODC Homicide Statistics dataset, which is derived from the criminal
justice or public health systems of a variety of countries and territories.&lt;ref name="executivesummary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Study on Homicide 2013: Executive Summary|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_Report_ExSum.pdf|website=UNODC|accessdate=9 May 2018|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homicide rates derived from criminal justice data (typically recorded by police authorities) and the public health system data (recorded when the cause of death is established) may diverge substantially for some countries.{{sfn|UNODC|2014|p=99}} The two sources usually match in the Americas, Europe and Oceania, but there are large discrepancies for the three African countries reporting both sources.{{sfn|UNODC|2014|p=101}} For the 70 countries in which neither source was made available, figures were derived from [[WHO]] statistical models.{{sfn|UNODC|2014|p=99}}

Deaths resulting from an armed conflict between states are never included in the count.{{sfn|UNODC|2014|p=104}} Killings caused by a [[non-international armed conflict]] may or may not be included, depending on the intensity of hostilities and whether it is classified as 'civil unrest' or a clash between organized armed groups.{{sfn|UNODC|2014|p=104}}

The MAR is a part of a patient's permanent record on their [[medical chart]]. The health care professional signs off on the record at the time that the drug or device is administered. MARs are commonly referred to as '''drug charts'''.

==Format==
The actual chart varies from hospital to hospital and country to country. However they are typically of the format:
* Administrative/Demographics
** Patient Name (often Surname, First name or similar)
** Treating team details
** Allergies
** Other, variable – [[weight]], special diet, [[oxygen therapy]], application time of topical local anaesthetic e.g. [[EMLA]]
* Prescription Details
** Drug name
** Dosage strength
** Route
** Frequency
** Medication indication / Diagnosis
** Prescribing doctor details, signature
** Day by day chart where [[caregiver|carers]]/[[nurse]]s administering medications can sign when medication has been given

==Kardex==
A '''kardex''' (''plural'' kardexes) is a [[Genericized trademark|genericised trademark]] for a medication administration record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O62-Kardex.html|title=Kardex - Dictionary definition of Kardex - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is common in [[Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In the [[Philippines]], the term is used to refer the old census charts of the charge nurse usually used during endorsement, in which index cards are used, but has been gradually been replaced by modern health data systems and pre-printed charts and forms.

'''Multidrug tolerance''' or '''antibiotic tolerance''' is the ability of a disease-causing [[microorganism]] to resist being killed by [[antibiotic]]s or other [[antimicrobial]]s. It is mechanistically distinct from multidrug resistance:&lt;ref name=Lewis2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lewis K |title=Persister cells, dormancy and infectious disease |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology  |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=48–56 |year=2007 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v5/n1/abs/nrmicro1557.html |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1557 |pmid=17143318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not caused by [[mutant]] microbes, but rather by microbial cells that exist in a transient, [[dormancy|dormant]], non-dividing state.&lt;ref name="Bra17"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brauner|first1=A|title=Distinguishing between resistance, tolerance and persistence to antibiotic treatment.|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=2017|volume=14|page=320|doi=10.1038/nrmicro.2016.34|pmid=27080241|url=https://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v14/n5/full/nrmicro.2016.34.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microorganisms that display multidrug tolerance can be [[bacteria]], [[pathogenic fungi|fungi]] or [[protozoa|parasites]].

==History==
Recognition of antibiotic tolerance dates back to 1944 when Joseph Bigger, an Irish physician working in England, was experimenting with the recently discovered penicillin.  Bigger used penicillin to lyse a suspension of bacteria and then inoculated culture medium with the penicillin-treated liquid.  Colonies of bacteria were able to grow after antibiotic killing.  The important observation that Bigger made was that this new population could be again be killed by penicillin except for a small residual population.  Hence the residual organisms were not antibiotic resistant mutants but rather a subpopulation of what he called ‘persisters’.&lt;ref&gt;Bigger JW (14 October 1944). "Treatment of staphylococcal infections with penicillin by intermittent sterilization". Lancet. 244 (6320): 497–500. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(00)74210-3&lt;/ref&gt;  The formation of persisters is now known to be a common phenomenon that can occur by the formation of persister cells prior to the antibiotic treatment&lt;ref name="Bal04"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balaban|first1=NQ|title=Bacterial persistence as a phenotypic switch|journal=Science|date=2004|volume=305|page=1622|doi=10.1126/science.1099390|pmid=15308767|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5690/1622.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in response to a variety of antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, K. Annu Rv Microbiol. 2010;64:357-72. doi: 10.1146/annurev.micro.112408.134306. Persister cells.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to chronic infections==
Multidrug tolerance is caused by a small subpopulation of microbial cells termed persisters.&lt;ref name=Bigger1944&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bigger JW |title=Treatment of staphylococcal infections with penicllin by intermittent sterilization |journal=Lancet |volume=244 |issue=6320 |pages=497–500 |date=14 October 1944 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)74210-3 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2800%2974210-3/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Persisters are not mutants, but rather are dormant cells that can survive the antimicrobial treatments that kill the majority of their genetically identical siblings.  Persister cells have entered a non- or extremely slow-growing physiological state which makes them insensitive (refractory or tolerant) to the action of antimicrobial drugs.  When such persisting microbial cells cannot be eliminated by the immune system, they become a reservoir from which recurrence of [[infection]] will develop.&lt;ref name=Gefen2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gefen O, Balaban NQ |title=The importance of being persistent: heterogeneity of bacterial populations under antibiotic stress |journal=FEMS Microbiol. Rev. |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=704–17 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19207742 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00156.x |url=http://www.phys.huji.ac.il/bio_physics/nathalie/GefenFEMS2009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722102656/http://www.phys.huji.ac.il/bio_physics/nathalie/GefenFEMS2009.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such non-growing bacteria have been observed to persist within mammalian cells.&lt;ref name="Hel14"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Helaine|first1=Sophie|title=Internalization of Salmonella by macrophages induces formation of nonreplicating persisters.|journal=Science|date=2014|volume=343|page=204|doi=10.1126/science.1244705|pmid=24408438|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6167/204.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it appears that persister cells are the main cause for relapsing and chronic infections.&lt;ref name=Lewis2007/&gt;  Chronic infections can affect people of any age, health, or immune status.

==Medical importance==
Bacterial multidrug or antibiotic tolerance poses medically important challenges.  It is largely responsible for the inability to eradicate bacterial infections with antibiotic treatment.  Persister cells are highly enriched in [[biofilm]]s, and it has been suggested that this is the reason that makes biofilm-related diseases so hard to treat.  Examples are chronic infections of [[implant (medicine)|implanted]] medical devices such as [[catheter]]s and artificial joints, [[urinary tract infection]]s, [[otitis media|middle ear infections]] and fatal lung disease .

==Distinction from multidrug resistance==
Unlike resistance, multidrug tolerance is a [[wikt:transient|transient]], non-heritable [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name=Lewis2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bigger1944/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gefen2009/&gt;  Multidrug tolerant persister cells are not [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic resistant]] mutants. Resistance is caused by newly acquired genetic traits (by mutation or [[horizontal gene transfer]]) that are [[heredity|heritable]] and confer the ability to grow at elevated concentrations of antimicrobial drugs.  In contrast, tolerant bacteria have the same [[Minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]] (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) as susceptible bacteria&lt;ref name="Bra17" /&gt; and differ in the duration of the treatment that they can survive. Multidrug tolerance can be caused by a reversible physiological state in a small subpopulation of genetically identical cells,&lt;ref name=Lewis2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bigger1944/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gefen2009/&gt; similar to a differentiated cell type.&lt;ref name=Lopez2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopez D, Vlamakis H, Kolter R |title=Generation of multiple cell types in ''Bacillus subtilis'' |journal=FEMS Microbiol Rev |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=152–63 |date=January 2009 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121529639/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00148.x |pmid=19054118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It enables this small subpopulation of microbes to survive the antibiotic killing of their surrounding siblings.  Persisting cells resume growth when the antimicrobial agent is removed, and their [[Offspring|progeny]] is [[antibiotic sensitivity|sensitive]] to antimicrobial agents.&lt;ref name=Lewis2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bigger1944/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gefen2009/&gt;

==Molecular mechanisms==
The molecular mechanisms that underlie persister cell formation and multidrug tolerance are largely unknown.&lt;ref name=Lewis2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gefen2009/&gt; Persister cells are thought to arise spontaneously in a growing microbial population by a [[stochastic]] genetic switch,&lt;ref name=Gefen2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jayaraman2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jayaraman R |title=Bacterial persistence: some new insights into an old phenomenon |journal=J Biosci |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=795–805 |year=2008 |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/dec2008/795.pdf |doi=10.1007/s12038-008-0099-3 |pmid=19179767}}&lt;/ref&gt; although inducible mechanisms of persister cell formation have been described.&lt;ref name=Gefen2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dörr2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dörr T, Lewis K, Vulic M |title=SOS Response Induces Persistence to Fluoroquinolones in Escherichia coli |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=e1000760 |year=2009 |url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000760 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000760 |pmid=20011100 |pmc=2780357 |editor1-last=Rosenberg |editor1-first=Susan M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to their transient nature and relatively low abundance, it is hard to isolate persister cells in sufficient numbers for experimental characterization, and only a few relevant genes have been identified to date.&lt;ref name=Lewis2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gefen2009/&gt;   The best-understood persistence factor is the ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' '''''hi'''''gh '''''p'''''ersistence gene, commonly abbreviated as ''hipA''.&lt;ref name=Moyed1983&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moyed HS, Bertrand KP |title=hipA, a newly recognized gene of Escherichia coli K-12 that affects frequency of persistence after inhibition of murein synthesis |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=768–75 |year=1983 |pmid=6348026 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/155/2/768 |pmc=217749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although tolerance is widely considered a passive state, there is evidence indicating it can be an energy-dependent process.&lt;ref&gt;|journal=Science |volume=354|issue=6318|year=2016|&lt;/ref&gt;  Persister cells in ''E. coli'' can transport intracellular accumulations antibiotic using an energy requiring efflux pump called TolC.&lt;ref&gt;Pu, Y, et al. (2016) Enhanced Efflux Activity Facilitates Drug Tolerance in Dormant Bacterial Cells. Mol Cell, 62: 284–294.&lt;/ref&gt;

A persister subpopulation has also been demonstrated in budding yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''. Yeast persisters are triggered in a small subset of unperturbed exponentially growing cells by spontaneously occurring DNA damage, which leads to the activation of a general stress response and protection against a range of harsh drug and stress environments. As a result of the DNA damage, yeast persisters are also enriched for random genetic mutations that occurred prior to the stress, and are unrelated to the stress survival &lt;ref&gt;Yaakov, G., Lerner, D., Bentele, K., Steinberger, J., &amp; Barkai, N. (2017). ″Coupling phenotypic persistence to DNA damage increases genetic diversity in severe stress″. ''Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution'', '''1''',16, https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-016-0016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential treatment==
In May 2011, it was reported by [[Nature.com]] that the addition of certain metabolites can help suppress multidrug tolerance in numerous species of bacteria, including ''[[E. coli]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'', by "the generation of a [[proton]]-motive force which facilitates aminoglycoside uptake".&lt;ref name=Allison2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allison KR, Brynildsen MP, Collins JJ |title=Metabolite-enabled eradication of bacterial persisters by aminoglycosides |journal=Nature |volume=473 |pages=216–220 |year=2011 |doi=10.1038/nature10069 |pmid=21562562 |issue=7346 |pmc=3145328}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phage therapy]], where applicable, entirely circumvents antibiotic resistance.

The '''National Mental Health Act''' (1946) became law on July 3, 1946. It established  and provided funds for a [[National Institute of Mental Health|National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)]]. 

The act made the mental health of the people a federal priority. It was inspired by alarm at the poor mental health of some draftees and veterans, and was demanded by veterans and their families.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ellen |last=Herman |date=1995 |chapter=The National Mental Health Act of 1946 |pages=246–250 |title=The Romance of American Psychology: Political Culture in the Age of Experts |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |url=http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft696nb3n8/ |chapter-url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft696nb3n8&amp;chunk.id=d0e5267&amp;toc.id=d0e5184&amp;brand=ucpress }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  When veterans who were under stress during the war were later studied they displayed a high incidence of earlier mental health illness, completely aside from the problems that might have arisen from combat and wartime situations of high pressure.

Through the National Mental Health Act and the [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]], a new form of diagnosis and treatment was created to better help those facing mental health problems. It was discovered during this time that mental health patients benefited more from evaluation and treatment rather than being institutionalized. The act redirected financing from the state level to a national level, and placed the [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] as a leader for further research and analysis on the brain and psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) |website=Espionage Information: Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security |url=http://www.faqs.org/espionage/Ne-Ns/NIMH-National-Institute-of-Mental-Health.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, wartime pressures had stirred up repressed mental illness in the soldiers, who were a representative statistical sample of the general population, gender aside. The government realized it had a very serious problem on its hands—a population with a high incidence of mental health illness and therefore should take care of it immediately via government intervention, aiming to cut off future social pathologies.

The [[Karl Menninger|Menninger]] brothers set about training analysts, to fill the vacuum that existed at that time.

The act was first introduced by Congress in March, 1945, as the National Neuropsychiatric Institute Act. The name ultimately made its way to "Mental Health" to capture the importance of World War II and the problems associated with veterans returning from war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Robert Felix, a psychiatrist appointed as director of the Public Health Service's (PHS) Division of Mental Hygiene in 1944, did much work to try to pass the bill. [[William C. Menninger|William Menninger]], Lawrence Kubie, and others helped Felix by testifying about how the lack of trained professionals in the field of mental health sometimes thwarted military morale and how intervening earlier rather than later actually helped the military in the long run by conserving personnel. They believed that if veterans received federal help and support through preventive services, professional training, and research they would transition back into postwar life quicker and easier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, organizations like [[Mental Health America]] that advocated for changes in the psychiatric field helped push legislation towards action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/our-history|title=Our History|website=Mental Health America|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the act was passed, during World War II, there was a severe shortage{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2018}} of professionals in the mental health field, and advanced treatment and understanding of psychiatric disorders lagged behind the increasing numbers of problems in veterans returning from the war. This provided the foundation for the act and the reasoning behind it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Rider|first1=Frank|date=4 September 2011|title=A Brief History of Mental Health in the United States, 1773-1982|url=http://tapartnership.org/enterprise/docs/RESOURCE%20BANK/RB-SOC%20APPROACH,%20DEFINITION,%20HISTORY/General%20Resources/05-02-11_History_of_Mental_Health_in_US_-_1773-1982_Rider.doc|format=DOC|author2=National Federation of Families|website=Technical Assistance Partnership for Child and Family Mental Health|publisher=American Institutes for Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the act was passed, many discoveries and breakthroughs regarding mental health diagnosis and treatment were made. These new drugs and treatments improved the lives of those previously suffering from psychosis and delusion, and were a result of the new funding and federal support that came from the National Mental Health Act of 1946.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Like optometrists, they examine eyes, test sight, diagnose abnormalities and prescribe suitable corrective lenses. OMPs are registered with and regulated by the General Medical Council. There are currently around 400 registered ophthalmic medical practitioners in the UK.'' 

"''The responsibilities of OMPs in conducting NHS sight tests are the same as those of optometrists and both have an important role in the primary detection of eye disease. In the course of sight testing, symptoms and signs of eye disease may become evident and the OMP has the additional role of taking a history, conducting an ophthalmic examination as appropriate, and referring patients for further investigation and treatment where indicated.''

''Some OMPs also work in the Hospital Eye Service or as General Practitioners or in other health care settings''."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rcophth.ac.uk/professional-resources/ophthalmic-medical-practitioners/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Organisation of African First Ladies against HIV/AIDS (OAFLA)''' is a [[non-governmental organization|nongovernmental]], [[non profit organization|not-for-profit]] organization founded in 2002 by 37 African [[first ladies]].

The Organisation of African First Ladies against HIV/AIDS works to cultivate a spirit of solidarity and the exchange of experiences among African first ladies and increase the capacity of [[First Ladies]] and other women leaders to advocate for effective solutions to respond to the ongoing [[HIV/AIDS epidemic]], and acts against stigma and discrimination in the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]], develops  partnerships with international, regional and local donors, organizations, and partners, and raises awareness, develops, and supports prevention, treatment, and care programs.&lt;ref name="UNGA AIDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2016/june/20160608_PR_HLM_OAFLA|title=BREAKING THE SILOS: EMPOWERING ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN TO ACCESS INTEGRATED HEALTH-CARE SERVICES|author=UNAIDS|publisher=UNAIDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:OAFLA_High_Level_Event_during_the_72nd_UNGA.jpg|thumb|right|alt=OAFLA High Level Event during the 72nd UNGA.|OAFLA High Level Event during the ''[[Seventy-second session of the United Nations General Assembly]]''.]]

In 2002, thirty-seven African first ladies met in [[Geneva]] at a meeting facilitated by [[UNAIDS]] and the International AIDS Trust (IAT). As a result of this meeting, the organization of African First Ladies against HIV/AIDS (OAFLA) was established as a collective voice for Africa’s most vulnerable people, women and children infected and affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

Since then, OAFLA has transformed itself from a forum of ideas to an institution capable of providing the continent-wide leadership needed to bring about change in peoples’ lives. With its permanent secretariat in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], OAFLA has moved from addressing the symptoms of the HIV/AIDS crisis to the root causes of poverty and the overall inequality of women in the region.

==Work and Campaigns==
The organisation and its members have taken on various causes including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[PMTCT]], [[maternal death]], [[child mortality]], [[women's empowerment]], and [[youth empowerment]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6251">The '''Palestine Children's Relief Fund''' (P.C.R.F.) is a registered [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-governmental organization]] established in 1991, by, according to its website, "concerned people in the U.S. to address the medical and humanitarian crisis facing [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] youths in the [[Middle East]]. The main objective of the P.C.R.F. is to locate in the U.S. free medical care for children who cannot be adequately treated in the Middle East. The P.C.R.F. is the main organization regularly sending injured and sick Arab children to the U.S. and Europe for free care that is not available to them there. Since 1991 over 1,000 children have been or currently are being treated outside of the Middle East through the P.C.R.F."&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.pcrf.net/who/who.html PCRF: Who We Are] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406150359/http://www.pcrf.net/who/who.html |date=2006-04-06 }} (Accessed April 13, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitarian activities==
The Palestine Children's Relief Fund sends medical equipment, supplies, and American medical personnel to the region to treat difficult cases and train Palestinian surgeons. Several injured or sick children are being treated in the U.S. for free. Palestine Children's Relief Fund relies on [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s throughout the U.S. who act as host families and donors. The organization also helps suffering children from other Middle Eastern nations, based on medical need.

The PCRF, along with the [[British Arts Council]], co-produced the 2006 22-minute documentary ''Open Heart'' by [[Claire Fowler (filmmaker)|Claire Fowler]] about healthcare in the Palestinian areas. It has subsequently been shown at film festivals around the world.

==Praise==
As of September 2009 the PCRF has received the 4-stars* by [[Charity Navigator]], an independent evaluator of charities' fiscal management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.summary/orgid/6421.htm PCRF information] at [[Charity Navigator]]&lt;/ref&gt; It has received support and endorsements from Senator Paul Sarbanes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcrf.net/images/senate.jpg Commendation letter by Senator Paul Sarbanes dated May 23, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712050157/http://www.pcrf.net/images/senate.jpg |date=July 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Albert Wynn]] and actor/humanitarian [[Richard Gere]].&lt;ref name = "Gala"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcrf.net/RichardGere.html | title = Message from Richard Gere To the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund | work = Palestine Children's Relief Fund | accessdate = 2008-02-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081137/http://www.pcrf.net/RichardGere.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=488 | title = The Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund Gala | first = Susan | last = Schwartz | work = [[Muslim Observer]] | date = 2006-11-09 | accessdate = 2008-02-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120714050653/http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=488 | archivedate = 2012-07-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] issued a video endorsement of the organization.&lt;ref name = "Gala"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcrf.net/first.html Jimmy Carter's endorsement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110005424/http://www.pcrf.net/first.html |date=2006-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The PCRF has been criticized in the past due to its financial affiliation with the [[Holy Land Foundation]], which was shut down by the United States government because it was suspected of funneling donations to terrorist organizations.&lt;ref name = "Times"&gt;{{cite news |first = Stephanie | last = Strom | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E5DF143BF936A25757C0A9629C8B63 | title =  Charity Seeks To Transfer Money Frozen By Treasury | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2004-04-15 | accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PCRF's connection to the Foundation has since harmed its reputation within Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1145961251253 | title = The Limits of Sympathy | work = [[Jerusalem Post]] | date = 2006-04-30 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/3141/ | title = Palestinian Legislator to Appeal for Support | work = [[Jewish Exponent]] | date = 2006-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Holy Land Foundation asked that the United States Treasury Department allow a transfer of $50,000 from its accounts to the PCRF.&lt;ref name = "Times"/&gt;

The '''pelvic floor''' or '''pelvic diaphragm''' is composed of muscle fibers of the [[levator ani]], the [[coccygeus muscle]], and associated [[connective tissue]] which span the area underneath the [[pelvis]]. The pelvic diaphragm is a muscular partition formed by the levatores ani and coccygei, with which may be included the parietal pelvic fascia on their upper and lower aspects. The pelvic floor separates the [[pelvic cavity]] above from the perineal region (including [[perineum]]) below.

==Structure==
The right and left levator ani lie almost horizontally in the floor of the pelvis, separated by a narrow gap that transmits the urethra, vagina, and anal canal. The levator ani is usually considered in three parts: [[pubococcygeus]], [[coccygeus|puborectalis]], and [[iliococcygeus]]. The pubococcygeus, the main part of the levator, runs backward from the body of the pubis toward the coccyx and may be damaged during [[birth]]. Some fibers are inserted into the prostate, urethra, and vagina. The right and left puborectalis unite behind the anorectal junction to form a muscular sling. Some regard them as a part of the [[external anal sphincter]]. The [[iliococcygeus]], the most posterior part of the levator ani, is often poorly developed.

The coccygeus, situated behind the levator ani and frequently tendinous as much as muscular, extends from the ischial spine to the lateral margin of the sacrum and coccyx.

The [[pelvic cavity]] of the [[true pelvis]] has the pelvic floor as its inferior border (and the [[pelvic brim]] as its superior border).  The [[perineum]] has the pelvic floor as its superior border.

Some sources do not consider "pelvic floor" and "pelvic diaphragm" to be identical, with the "diaphragm" consisting of only the levator ani and coccygeus, while the "floor" also includes the [[perineal membrane]] and [[deep perineal pouch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard L. |last1=Drake |first2=Wayne |last2=Vogl |first3=Adam W. M. |last3=Mitchell |title= Gray's Anatomy For Students |year=2005 |page=391 |isbn=978-0-443-06612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources include the [[fascia]] as part of the diaphragm.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In practice, the two terms are often used interchangeably.

Posteriorly, the pelvic floor extends into the [[anal triangle]].

The pelvic floor has two [[hiatus (anatomy)|hiatuses]] (gaps): Anteriorly [[urogenital hiatus]] through which [[urethra]] and [[vagina]] pass through and posteriorly [[rectal hiatus]] through which [[anal canal]] passes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daftary |first1=Shirish |last2=Chakravarti |first2=Sudip |year=2011 |title=Manual of Obstetrics |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier |pages=1–16 |isbn=978-81-312-2556-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
It is important in providing support for pelvic [[viscera]] (organs), e.g. the [[urinary bladder|bladder]], [[intestine]]s, the [[uterus]] (in females), and in maintenance of [[wikt:continence|continence]] as part of the [[Urethral sphincter|urinary]] and [[anus|anal]] sphincters. It facilitates birth by resisting the descent of the presenting part, causing the fetus to rotate forwards to navigate through the pelvic girdle. It helps maintain optimal intra-abdominal pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Clinical significance==
The pelvic floor is subject to clinically relevant changes that can result in:
* '''Anterior vaginal wall prolapse'''
** [[Cystocele]] (bladder into vagina)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/cystocele-prolapsed-bladder|title=Cystocele (Prolapsed Bladder) {{!}} NIDDK|work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Urethrocele]] (urethra into vagina)
** Cystourethrocele (both bladder and urethra)
* '''Posterior vaginal wall prolapse'''
** [[Enterocele]] (small intestine into vagina)
** [[Rectocele]] (rectum into vagina)
* '''Apical vaginal prolapse'''
** [[Uterine prolapse]] (uterus into vagina)
** [[Vaginal vault]] prolapse (roof of vagina) - after [[hysterectomy]]

Pelvic floor dysfunction can result after treatment for gynegological cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramaseshan|first=Aparna S.|last2=Felton|first2=Jessica|last3=Roque|first3=Dana|last4=Rao|first4=Gautam|last5=Shipper|first5=Andrea G.|last6=Sanses|first6=Tatiana V. D.|date=2017-09-19|title=Pelvic floor disorders in women with gynecologic malignancies: a systematic review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-017-3467-4|journal=International Urogynecology Journal|language=en|pages=1–18|doi=10.1007/s00192-017-3467-4|issn=0937-3462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damage to the pelvic floor not only contributes to urinary incontinence but can lead to pelvic organ [[prolapse]].  Pelvic organ prolapse occurs in women when pelvic organs (e.g. the vagina, bladder, rectum, or uterus) protrude into or outside of the vagina.  The causes of pelvic organ prolapse are not unlike those that also contribute to urinary incontinence.  These include inappropriate (asymmetrical, excessive, insufficient) muscle tone and asymmetries caused by trauma to the pelvis.  Age, pregnancy, family history, and hormonal status all contribute to the development of pelvic organ prolapse.  The vagina is suspended by attachments to the perineum, pelvic side wall and sacrum via attachments that include collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle.  Surgery can be performed to repair pelvic floor muscles.  The pelvic floor muscles can be strengthened with [[Kegel exercise]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid12806450 /&gt;

Disorders of the posterior pelvic floor include [[rectal prolapse]], [[rectocele]], [[perineal hernia]], and a number of functional disorders including [[anismus]].  [[Constipation]] due to any of these disorders is called "functional constipation" and is identifiable by clinical diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref name="pmid16720016"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16720016 |pmc=2259151 |year=2005 |author1=Berman |first1=L |title=Management of disorders of the posterior pelvic floor |journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=211–21 |last2=Aversa |first2=J |last3=Abir |first3=F |last4=Longo |first4=W. E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelvic floor exercise (PFE), also known as [[Kegel exercises]], may improve the tone and function of the pelvic floor muscles, which is of particular benefit for women (and less commonly men) who experience [[stress urinary incontinence]].&lt;ref name="pmid15971718"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15971718 |year=2005 |author1=Kielb |first1=S. J. |title=Stress incontinence: Alternatives to surgery |journal=International Journal of Fertility and Women's Medicine |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=24–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12806450"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12806450 |year=2003 |author1=Harvey |first1=M.

Pelvic floor muscle tone may be estimated using a [[perineometer]], which measures the pressure within the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbosa|first=Patrícia Brentegani|last2=Franco|first2=Maíra Menezes|last3=Souza|first3=Flaviane de Oliveira|last4=Antônio|first4=Flávia Ignácio|last5=Montezuma|first5=Thaís|last6=Ferreira|first6=Cristine Homsi Jorge|date=June 2009|title=Comparison between measurements obtained with three different perineometers|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1807-59322009000600007&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Clinics|volume=64|issue=6|pages=527–533|doi=10.1590/s1807-59322009000600007|issn=1807-5932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medication may also be used to improve continence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In severe cases, surgery may be used to repair or even to reconstruct the pelvic floor.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Perineology]] or pelviperineology is a speciality dealing with the functional troubles of the three axes (urological, gynaecological and coloproctological) of the pelvic floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beco|first=J.|last2=Mouchel|first2=J.|date=2002-10-01|title=Understanding the Concept of Perineology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001920200060|journal=International Urogynecology Journal|language=en|volume=13|issue=5|pages=275–277|doi=10.1007/s001920200060|issn=0937-3462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I copied most of the history section prior to 1949 because, well... the Chinese red cross was JUST ONE BEFORE 1949. (DO NOT EDIT THE ABOVE SECTION WITHOUT DISCUSSION ON THE TALK PAGE... THX)----&gt;

The '''Red Cross Society of the Republic of China''' ({{zh|t=中華民國紅十字會}}) is the [[Red Cross Society]] of the Republic of China on [[Taiwan]]. The society is not recognized by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) because it does not meet all the conditions&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/6erk5h.htm "Conditions for recognition of national societies"] ICRC&lt;/ref&gt; set out in the Statues of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and it is not a member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/where-we-work/asia-pacific/ "List of National Societies in Asia Pacific"] IFRC&lt;/ref&gt; From its founding in 1904, to 1949, when the [[Kuomintang]] retreated to Taiwan, the society shared its history with the [[Red Cross Society of China]]. Both societies associate their origins with the founder, [[Shen Dunhe]], a tea merchant.

==History==

===Origin===
On 3 March 1904, during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Shen Dunhe created the "Manchuria Red Cross Benevolent Society" and on 10 March 1904, the society was renamed the "Shanghai International Red Cross Committee". Its founders were Chinese business and political leaders and expatriates from the West. Shen chose the aegis of the Red Cross because its neutrality allowed aid to reach those Chinese civilians caught between Japanese and Russian forces in [[Manchuria]].&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;{{rp|at=20 May 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;Yannan L. L. [http://www.philanthropy.iupui.edu/files/event_resources/lipaper.pdf "Red Cross Society in Imperial China, 1904-1912."] The Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. Accessed 26 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
After the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the society expanded and its mission to aid those affected by war and disaster continued. The society opened Red Cross hospitals in Shanghai and other cities. Local Red Cross chapters were popular because the association represented international connections, modernity and its activities were seen as patriotic. For example, the society sent workers to [[San Francisco]] after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and workers, medicines and funds were sent to Japan after the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]]. In 1920, there were over 300 Red Cross chapters in China.&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;{{rp|at=20 May 2008}}

===Recognition===
In 1912, the ICRC recognised the national society of the then [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. In 1919, the society joined the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Federation]] as one of its first members.&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;{{rp|at=20 May 2008}} In the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the society held ties with [[American Red Cross|American]] and [[British Red Cross]], the [[Kuomintang]] government and the [[Shanghai]] business community. In 1933, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the Act of Administrative Rules and Procedures of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|中華民國紅十字會管理條例施行細則}}) was passed. The society was renamed the ''Red Cross Society of the Republic of China''.&lt;ref name="republic"/&gt;{{rp|at=20 May 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/tracing_offices?opendocument "Tracing offices of recognized Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies."] ICRC 28 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The society's activities during the war time period (1937 - 1945) were limited to [[Kuomintang]] held areas in southwest China and to some areas under Japanese control. Supplies were received through [[Burma]] and [[India]] from the United States and the United Kingdom. [[Overseas Chinese|Expatriate Chinese]] also raised funds.

===Relocation to Taiwan===
&lt;!---Note 1: Still translating Chinese text from the official site... its a slow work in progress... Id appreciate some help...
----&gt;
After 1950, when the major hostilities of the [[Chinese civil war]] had ended, the society moved its headquarters to Taiwan. In 1955, the government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] declared the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China the sole national humanitarian organization of the country and wrote this in [[legislation]]. The act clarified the role of the society in the case of invasion by the forces of the [[Communist Party of China]] and in caring for wounded [[Republic of China Army|Taiwanese]] soldiers and [[prisoners of war]]. Fiscal exemptions for society volunteers were approved. The organization was tasked with provision of basic sanitation and hygiene to the most impoverished; and, with teaching first aid to adults and children.&lt;ref name="republic"/&gt;{{rp|at=5 December 2008}}

===International recognition===
The society meets most of the conditions laid out in Article 4 of the Statutes of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] of 1995, except that Taiwan is not a signatory to the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref name="conditions"&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/6ERK5H "Conditions for recognition of national societies."] ICRC 29 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission may be made more difficult because of a lack of clarity surrounding the society's independence from the [[Red Cross Society of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Guilloux A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sJGEcRBGp2QC&amp;dq=%22red+cross+society+of+the+republic+of+china%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "Taiwan, Humanitarianism and Global Governance."] Routledge 2009 p147. {{ISBN|1134030495}}, 9781134030491. Accessed at Google Books 26 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kinmen Agreement===
On 11–12 September 1990, the society held talks with its [[Red Cross Society of China|mainland counterpart]] in [[Kinmen]], resulting in the [[Kinmen Agreement]] signed on 12 September.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mac.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=51914&amp;ctNode=6124&amp;mp=3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hsin-Huang M.

Accessed at Google Books 27 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The talks were about issues such as repatriation of criminals, smugglers or fugitives in the spirit of humanity and practicality.&lt;ref&gt;Ko S.

'''Rete tubular ectasia''' is a [[benign]] condition, usually found in older men, involving numerous small, tubular [[cystic]] structures within the [[rete testis]].

==Mechanism==
The formation of cysts in the rete testis is associated with the obstruction of the [[efferent ducts]], which connect the rete testis with the head of the [[epididymis]]. They are often bilateral.&lt;ref name=nair&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nair|first1=R|last2=Abbaraju|first2=J|last3=Rajbabu|first3=K|last4=Anjum|first4=F|last5=Sriprasad|first5=S|title=Tubular ectasia of the rete testis: a diagnostic dilemma.|journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England|date=October 2008|volume=90|issue=7|pages=1–3|doi=10.1308/147870808X303119|pmid=18831860|pmc=2728311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The condition can be detected with sonography. It is commonly associated with epididymal abnormalities, such as [[spermatocele]], [[epididymal cyst]], and [[epididymitis]]. The condition  shares a common location with [[cystic dysplasia]] of the [[testis]] and [[intratesticular cysts]]. Unlike cystic neoplasms, they don't present specific tumor markers.&lt;ref name=bhatt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhatt|first1=S|last2=Jafri|first2=SZ|last3=Wasserman|first3=N|last4=Dogra|first4=VS|title=Imaging of non-neoplastic intratesticular masses.|journal=Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology (Ankara, Turkey)|date=March 2011|volume=17|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.4261/1305-3825.DIR.3116-09.0|pmid=20677130|url=http://www.dirjournal.org/eng/makale/490/34/Full-Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Typically none is required, but they can be treated surgically if symptomatic.&lt;ref name=bhatt /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1449">'''Schizothymia''' is a [[temperament]] related to [[schizophrenia]] in a way analogous to [[Cyclothymia|cyclothymia's]] relationship with [[bipolar disorder]]. A schizothymic individual displays a [[Reduced affect display|flat affect]] and a high degree of introversion, withdrawing from social relations generally; nevertheless, some individuals with this characteristic may be able to achieve relatively [[Wiktionary:affable#English|affable]] social relations and a measure of affectivity in some situations. As a kind of temperament, schizothymic personality traits are thought to be more or less innate rather than the result of socialization (or a lack thereof).

A '''sick bay''' is a [[Compartment (ship)|compartment]] in a [[ship]], or a section of another organisation, such as a school or college, used for medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Geelong Grammar School teacher jailed for sex abuse|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/former-geelong-grammar-school-teacher-jailed-for-sex-abuse-20150911-gjkk1w.html|accessdate=12 September 2015|publisher=The Age|date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sick bay contains the ship's [[medicine chest]], which may be divided into separate cabinets, such as a [[refrigerator]] for medicines requiring cold storage and a locked cabinet for [[controlled substance]]s such as [[morphine]].

'''Truth''' (stylized as '''truth''') is a national campaign aimed at eliminating teen smoking in the [[United States]].  "truth" produces television and digital content to encourage teens to reject tobacco and to unite against the tobacco industry.  When "truth" launched its campaign in 1998, the teen smoking rate was 23%.  In 2017, that number was down to 2.1% of middle schoolers and 7.6% of high schoolers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/youth_data/tobacco_use/index.htm|title=CDC - Fact Sheet - Youth and Tobacco Use - Smoking &amp; Tobacco Use|last=Health|first=CDC's Office on Smoking and|date=2018-09-21|website=Smoking and Tobacco Use|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly due to the "truth" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/06/15/teenagers-tobacco-use-hits-a-record-low-with-a-sharp-drop-in-e-cigarettes/|title=Teenagers’ tobacco use hits a record low, with a sharp drop in e-cigarettes|last=McGinley|first=Laura|date=15 June 2017|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans WD, Rath JM, Hair EC, Snider JW, Pitzer L, Greenberg M, Xiao H, Cantrell J, Vallone D | display-authors = 6 | title = truth FinishIt brand on tobacco outcomes | journal = Preventive Medicine Reports | volume = 9 | pages = 6–11 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29276667 | pmc = 5724797 | doi = 10.1016/j.pmedr.2017.11.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2014, "truth" launched "Finish It", a redesigned campaign encouraging youth to be the generation that ends smoking.&lt;ref name="NYT Finish It"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Andrew Adam |title=A Less Defiant Tack in a Campaign to Curb Smoking by Teenagers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/business/a-less-defiant-tack-in-a-campaign-to-curb-smoking-by-teenagers-.html |accessdate=10 December 2014|work=The New York Times|date=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Florida Tobacco Pilot Program===

The "truth" campaign was modeled after a campaign developed by the Florida Tobacco Pilot Program, which ran from 1998 to 2003.

Through their marketing campaign, the program set out to drive a wedge between the tobacco industry's advertising and a youth audience.&lt;ref name="FloridaTruth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.social-marketing.org/success/cs-floridatruth.html |title=Social Marketing Institute - Success Stories - Florida "truth" Campaign |publisher=Social-marketing.org |date=1997-08-25 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program not only assembled a team of advertising and public relations firms, but also collaborated with Floridian youth to develop a campaign that would effectively speak to their generation.&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/Brp/tcrb/monographs/19/index.html|title=The Role of the Media in Promoting and Reducing Tobacco Use: Tobacco Control Monograph No. 19|last1=National Cancer Institute|date=June 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute|location=Bethesda, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FloridaTruth /&gt; Youth articulated their frustrations with the manipulative marketing tactics used by the tobacco industry, and described their ideal campaign as one that would give them facts and the truth about tobacco.&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19" /&gt;  From this emerged the concept of uniting youth in a movement against tobacco companies promoted through grassroots advocacy and a youth-driven advertising campaign.&lt;ref name=FloridaTruth /&gt;

In March 1998, student delegates at a meeting sponsored by Florida's Office of Tobacco Control voted to change the theme of the campaign to "truth, a generation united against tobacco."&lt;ref name="FloridaTruth" /&gt; In April 1998, Florida launched a $25 million advertising campaign that included 33 television commercials, seven billboards, eight print ads and four posters.&lt;ref name="FloridaTruth" /&gt; With a target audience of youth aged 12–17, the Florida "truth" campaign modeled their approach after commercial marketing to teens, and used messages that "attacked the [tobacco] industry and portrayed its executives as predatory, profit hungry, and manipulative."&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19" /&gt; The ads re-framed tobacco as an addictive drug promoted by the adult-establishment, and tobacco control as a hip, rebellious, youth-led movement.&lt;ref name=FloridaTruth /&gt; The grassroots effort of the campaign involved real teenagers taking on the tobacco industry as part of the 13-day "Truth Train" tour across the state.&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19" /&gt;  Despite positive results, reduced funding for the program, among other factors, ultimately led to the demise of Florida’s "truth" campaign.&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19" /&gt;

===Truth Initiative "truth" campaign===

As Florida’s campaign diminished, [[Truth Initiative]] (originally the American Legacy Foundation), adopted Florida's successful strategy and converted "truth" into a national campaign. Generally consistent with Florida's campaign, Truth Initiative's version of "truth" featured hard-hitting messages highlighting the deceptive practices of tobacco companies, and stark facts about the deadly effects of tobacco.&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19" /&gt;

==Campaign strategy and style==

"truth" strives to be a brand youth can identify with.  In stark contrast to the heavy "life or death" tone adopted by many anti-tobacco campaigns, the strategy behind "truth" is to emphasize the facts about tobacco products and industry marketing practices, without preaching or talking down to its target audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/Brp/tcrb/monographs/19/index.html|title=National Cancer Institute - Cancer Control and Population Sciences|website=cancercontrol.cancer.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resonating theme underlying "truth" is one of tobacco industry manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2007/Ending-the-Tobacco-Problem-A-Blueprint-for-the-Nation.aspx|title=Ending the Tobacco problem: A Blueprint for the Nation|last=|first=|date=23 May 2007|website=Institute of Medicine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021204700/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2007/Ending-the-Tobacco-Problem-A-Blueprint-for-the-Nation.aspx|archive-date=2009-10-21|dead-url=yes|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With hard-hitting advertisements featuring youths confronting the tobacco industry, "truth" built a brand focused on empowering youth to construct positive, tobacco-free identities. Above all, the campaign avoids making directive statements telling youth not to smoke, and instead encourages them to make up their own minds about smoking and the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Health Promotion Chapter 10"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://samples.jbpub.com/9780763753771/53771_CH10_FINAL.pdf|title=The truth Campaign: Using Countermarketing to Reduce Youth Smoking|last1=Allen|first1=Jane|last2=Vallone|first2=Donna|last3=Vargyas|first3=Ellen|last4=Healton|first4=Cheryl|date=2010|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|pages=195–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; "truth" channels youths’ rebellious nature and need to assert their independence towards tobacco control efforts.&lt;ref name="Farrelly"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farrelly|first1=M.|last2=Healton|first2=C.|last3=Davis|first3=K.|last4=Messeri|first4=P.|last5=Hersey|first5=J.|last6=Haviland|first6=M.|date=June 2002|title=Getting to the Truth: Evaluating National Tobacco Countermarketing Campaigns|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=92|issue=6|pages=901–907|doi=10.2105/ajph.92.6.901|pmc=1447480|pmid=12036775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to exposing industry marketing practices, many of the advertisements produced for "truth" focus on facts about the ingredients in cigarettes and the consequences of smoking, including addiction, disease, and death.&lt;ref name="Health Promotion Chapter 10" /&gt;  A large portion of the facts and information exposed in "truth" advertisements were pulled from real tobacco industry documents that were made publicly accessible following the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|Master Settlement Agreement]].  The [[Truth Tobacco Industry Documents|Truth Tobacco Documents Library]], created in 2002 and managed by the [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California San Francisco]], houses millions of formerly secret tobacco industry internal corporate documents.

=== Initial tactics and campaigns ===
The "truth campaign's initial objective was to "change social norms and reduce youth smoking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=httpd://www.legacyforhealth.org/content/download/621/7337/file/truth_fact_sheet_January_2012.PDF|title=truth Face Sheet|last=|first=|date=12 December 2014|website=American Legacy Foundation|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In building a strategy to accomplish this goal, "truth" campaign designers looked to marketing and social science research, evidence from other successful campaigns, and engaged in conversations with teen audiences. This research revealed that although youth were aware of the deadly nature of cigarettes, they were attracted to smoking as a tool for rebellion and empowerment. The "truth" campaign designers wanted to counter the appeal of cigarettes by encouraging teens to rebel against the duplicity and manipulation exhibited by tobacco companies.&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19" /&gt;

Since the launch of "truth" in 2000, the campaign asserts it has "utilized many different forms of media and evolved its tactics to ensure it reached the teen audience most effectively."&lt;ref name="truth Fact Sheet 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legacyforhealth.org/content/download/621/7337/file/truth_fact_sheet_January_2012.PDF |title=truth Fact Sheet |last1=American Legacy Foundation |date=January 2012 |website= Legacy |accessdate= 12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the most recognized media produced for "truth" are its television advertisements.  For example, the iconic "truth" advertisement "1200" portrays a mass of youth walking up to a major tobacco company building, then suddenly collapsing as if dead while a single youth remains standing with a sign that reads, "Tobacco kills 1,200 people a day. Ever think about taking a day off?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1200|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJTCWtcAews|website=YouTube|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the "Body Bags" commercial, youths pile body bags on the sidewalk outside of a tobacco company's headquarters.  One youth steps forward with a megaphone to shout up at the workers in the building, "do you know how many people tobacco kills every day? This is what 1200 people actually looks like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4xmFcrJexk|title=The Truth - Body Bags Tv Ad|website=YouTube|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another "truth" advertisement, "Singing Cowboy", portrays a cowboy who has a breathing stoma (opening) in his neck singing, "you don’t always die from tobacco, sometimes you just lose a lung", and other similar lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP6vMbkx2hw|title=ugly truth: Singing Cowboy|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A third commercial, "1 out of 3", uses "fantasized scenes such as an exploding soda can" to convey the message that tobacco is the only product that prematurely kills one out of three users.&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19" /&gt;  Perhaps one of truth's best-known campaigns, "Shards O' Glass," aired during [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].  The commercial showed an executive for a popsicle company, "Shards O' Glass," that provided disclaimers for their product - a popsicle with shards of glass in it, clearly unsafe and deadly - and posed the question, "What if all companies advertised like big tobacco?"

Through social media feedback and focus group testing, "truth" designers learned teens respond best to "up-front and powerful messages that display courage and honesty in a forceful way."&lt;ref name="truth Fact Sheet 2012" /&gt;  With that in mind, other edgy "truth" advertisements with various themes were produced between 2000 and 2014, including "Connect truth", "The Sunny Side of truth", "Unsweetened truth", and "Ugly truth."

Prior to the launch of the [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration’s]] "Real Cost" campaign in February 2014, "truth" was the only national youth tobacco prevention campaign not sponsored by the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name="Health Promotion Chapter 10" /&gt;

=== Campaign re-launch strategy and examples ===
In August 2014, "truth" launched the "Finish It" campaign targeting the next generation of U.S. youth aged 15 to 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNS0JaX9_X8|title=truth - Finishers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811231135/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNS0JaX9_X8|archive-date=2014-08-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with a revamped campaign design, web presence, and series of ads, Finish It embraces a powerful new campaign theme: be the generation that ends smoking for good.&lt;ref name="NYT Finish It" /&gt;  In research with its target audience, campaign designers discovered today’s teenagers are less interested in protesting against tobacco industry manipulation, and more interested in driving positive collective action.  "Finish IT" was developed to suit this generation’s desire to be agents of social change.&lt;ref name="NYT Finish It" /&gt; The campaign aims to empower the 94 percent of teenage nonsmokers, and the 6 percent of teen smokers, to take an active role in ending the tobacco epidemic.&lt;ref name="Tobacco-Free Kids"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press_releases/post/2014_08_12_truth_campaign|title=Reinvigorated truth® Campaign Will Empower Youth to Finish the Fight against Tobacco|last1=Myers|first1=Matthew|date=12 August 2014|accessdate=15 December 2014|agency=Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first campaign ad released, "Finishers", was shot in the style of a video manifesto and tells youth, "We have the power. We have the creativity. We will be the generation that ends smoking. Finish it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNS0JaX9_X8|title=truth - Finishers|last1=truthorange|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spot encouraged youth to get involved in the "Finish IT" movement by superimposing the campaign logo, an "X" in an orange square, onto their [[Facebook]] profile picture. This online activism tactic is similar to that used by the [[Human Rights Campaign]] when they asked individuals to change their profile pictures in support of [[Same-sex marriage|marriage equality]].&lt;ref name="NYT Finish It" /&gt;

In another series of "Finish IT" ads, "Unpaid Tobacco Spokesperson" and "Unpaid Tobacco Spokesperson Response", the campaign tries to shed light on the way smokers, especially celebrity smokers, give tobacco companies free marketing as "unpaid spokespeople" when their photos are posted.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaLjUAj_54s|title=truth - Unpaid Tobacco Spokesperson Response|last1=truthorange|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTj4I9WUggw|title=truth - Unpaid Tobacco Spokesperson|last1=truthorange|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, Finish It asked youth to "think before you post a smoking selfie."&lt;ref name="youtube.com" /&gt; The campaign also encouraged youth to "erase and replace" cigarettes from photos on social media with various props from the "truth" website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruth.com/take-action|title=Take Action|last1=truth|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, "Left Swipe Dat," a full-length song and music video created as part of the "Finish IT" campaign, debuted at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]] and connected smoking to dating.  The video featured [[Becky G]], [[Fifth Harmony]], [[King Bach]] and other influencers.  The lyrics revealed that you get half the matches on dating apps if you're smoking in your profile picture.  "Left Swipe Dat" encouraged teens to lose the cigarettes so they could avoid being "left swiped," aka, passed over on a dating app.

In another effort to connect smoking to a teen passion point, "CATmageddon" showed teens that smoking is bad for pets and set up the scenario that if there were no cats (due to smoking-related illness and disease) there would be no [[Cats and the Internet|cat videos]] and therefore there would be a "CATmageddon," a "world devoid of furry kittens and the adorable, hilarious videos that come with them."  The ad launched at the [[58th Annual Grammy Awards]] and featured partnerships with [[Petco]], [[Adult Swim]], and [[BuzzFeed]].

In 2017, the "truth" campaign showed how the tobacco industry has targeted African-Americans, low-income communities, LGBTQ individuals, members of the military as well as those with mental health conditions.&lt;ref name="Kulp"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2017/02/12/tobacco-ads-target-diversity/|title=A new anti-smoking ad slams Big Tobacco for targeting black neighborhoods|last=Kulp|first=Patrick|work=Mashable|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/new-ads-accuse-big-tobacco-of-targeting-soldiers-and-people-with-mental-illness/2017/08/23/02bff930-8843-11e7-a50f-e0d4e6ec070a_story.html|title=New ads accuse Big Tobacco of targeting soldiers and people with mental illness|last=Wan|first=William|date=2017-08-24|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign encouraged young people to take note of the industry's advertising tactics while educating teens on the tobacco-related health disparities across these demographics.  Initial documentary style videos created for this campaign featured comedian and actress [[Amanda Seales]] and premiered at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref name="Kulp"/&gt;  Later videos, premiered at the [[2017 MTV Video Music Awards]] and featured journalists [[Kaj Larsen]] and [[Ryan Duffy (journalist)|Ryan Duffy]], as well as rapper [[Logic (musician)|Logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/new-ads-accuse-big-tobacco-of-targeting-soldiers-and-people-with-mental-illness/2017/08/23/02bff930-8843-11e7-a50f-e0d4e6ec070a_story.html|title=New ads accuse Big Tobacco of targeting soldiers and people with mental illness|last=Wan|first=William|date=2017-08-24|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, "truth" launched anti-vaping campaign ads showing the dangers of vaping for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thetruth.com/articles/hot-topic/safer-safe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health-news/will-e-cigarettes-reverse-the-decline-in-teen-smoking#The-concern-about-Juul|title=E-Cigarettes and Teen Smoking|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grassroots tours ===
In addition to its television advertisements, "truth" maintains an online presence and employs [[Guerrilla marketing|guerrilla "on-the-street" marketing]].  Grassroots marketing is done via a team of "truth tour riders" who are sent to popular music and sporting events across the country every summer, including [[Warped Tour]], [[Mayhem Festival]] and High School Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2015/07/22/truth-anti-smoking-organization-launces-summer-tour-finish-it/|title=Anti-smoking organization launches tour to end teen tobacco use|date=2015-07-22|work=USA TODAY College|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merchandise ===
"truth" also produces a line of custom merchandise every summer that is distributed at events.  Each piece of merchandise features a design that corresponds with a fact about smoking.  Items are often created in partnership with artists, such as a pair of custom sneakers made in collaboration with Kevin Lyons and [[Vans]] shoes.  That partnership also spawned a contest called "Custom Culture" where students competed in design challenges relevant to the campaign's merchandise and subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vans.com/article_detail/custom-culture-2015.html|title=Vans Kicks Off the Sixth Annual Custom Culture Art Competition|website=Vans USA - English|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation and effectiveness==

Rigorous evaluation studies of "truth" have been published in the peer-reviewed literature since the launch of the campaign in 2000.&lt;ref name="Health Promotion Chapter 10" /&gt; To evaluate the effectiveness of "truth", Truth Initiative employs an internal Research and Evaluation team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Legacy Foundation|title=Examining tobacco use among youth and young adults|url=http://www.legacyforhealth.org/what-we-do/tobacco-control-research/research-evaluation/examining-tobacco-use-among-youth-and-young-adults|website=Legacy|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its efforts include evaluation of televised truth ads as well as digital, gaming and grassroots campaign components. Between 1999 and 2004, Truth Initiative (known at the time as the American Legacy Foundation) conducted a nationally-representative Media Tracking Survey of youth aged 12–17 to inform its "truth" campaign evaluation. The Legacy Media Tracking Survey (LMTS) measured tobacco-related attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, exposure to smoking influences including "truth", sensation seeking, and openness to smoking.&lt;ref name="Health Promotion Chapter 10" /&gt;

Cross-sectional studies on the effectiveness of the "truth" campaign provided convincing evidence that the campaign "had a significant impact on tobacco industry-related attitudes, beliefs, and other behavioral precursors, as well as a significant impact on youth smoking prevalence in the United States."&lt;ref name="NCI Monograph 19" /&gt;  Exposure to "truth" was also associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonsmokers’ intentions to smoke in the future.  Another study of "truth" from 2000 to 2004 examined whether campaign awareness and receptivity differed for youth across socioeconomic backgrounds.  In 2005, a study published in the [[American Journal of Public Health]] conducted by [[RTI International]], [[Columbia University]], and Truth Initiative used a pre/post quasi-experimental design to relate changes in national youth smoking prevalence to exposure to the "truth" campaign over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/Brp/tcrb/monographs/19/index.html|title=The Role of the Media in Promoting and Reducing Tobacco Use: Tobacco Control Monograph, No. 19|last=National Cancer Institute|first=|date=|website=cancercontrol.cancer.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study’s statistical analyses showed that smoking rates among youth in the U.S. declined at a faster rate after the launch of the "truth" campaign.  A similar study published in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] in 2009 found a direct association between youth exposure to "truth" messaging and a decreased risk of taking up smoking.

A 2009 study examined whether the $324 million investment in the "truth" campaign could be justified by its effect on public health outcomes.  Researchers found that the campaign was economically efficient because it saved between $1.9 and $5.4 billion in medical care costs to society between 2000-2002.  In this way, the authors argue "truth" is a cost-effective public health intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtgrave, D.; Wunderink, K.; Vallone, D.; Healton, C.|first=|date=2009|title=Cost-Utility Analysis of the National truth Campaign to Prevent Youth Smoking|url=http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%2809%2900075-0/pdf|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=36|pages=385–388|via=|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2009.01.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study evaluating the "Finish IT" campaign indicated lower intentions to smoke in the next year as well as anti-tobacco attitudes with higher ad awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vallone|first=Vallone|last2=Cantrell|first2=Cantrell|last3=Bennett|first3=Bennett|last4=Smith|first4=Smith|last5=Rath|first5=Jessica|last6=Xiao|first6=Xiao|last7=Greenberg|first7=Greenberg|last8=Hair|first8=Elizabeth C.|date=2017-06-02|title=Evidence of the Impact of the truth FinishIt Campaign|journal=Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research: Official Journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco|doi=10.1093/ntr/ntx119|issn=1469-994X|pmid=28575421}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ad recall remained high, even when the campaign aired lower levels of television targeted rating points as compared with earlier "truth" advertising campaigns.

== Awards and praise ==
The "truth" campaign has been praised by a number of leading federal and state public health officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/502009|title=Anti-Smoking Campaign Lowers Youth Smoking Rates With"Truth" Funding Threatened|last1=Krisberg|first1=Kim|date=2005|accessdate=14 December 2014|publisher=Nations Health|issue=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/counter_marketing/manual/pdfs/tobacco_cm_manual.pdf|title=Designing and Implementing an Effective Tobacco Counter-Marketing Campaign|last1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=October 2003|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ash/initiatives/tobacco/tobaccostrategicplan2010.pdf|title=Ending the Tobacco Epidemic: A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.|last1=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|date=November 2010|publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has also been recognized for its achievements in marketing with numerous awards in advertising efficacy, such as [[Emmy Award|Emmy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emmyonline.com/psa_0506_winners|title=The National Television Academy Presents the Public and Community Service Emmy Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=National Academy of Television|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://64.13.227.18/emmy/2005_csa_psa_winners_release.html|title=Public &amp; Community Service Awards - 2005 Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=Television National Academy|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clio Healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cliohealthcare.com/catalog/2013/film/|title=Winners 2013, Film|last=|first=|date=|work=CLIO Healthcare|access-date=2017-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121041850/http://www.cliohealthcare.com/catalog/2013/film/|archive-date=2013-11-21|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cliohealthcare.com/catalog/2013/integrated_campaign/entry.cfm?entryid=401310051&amp;award=50&amp;from=1&amp;to=500&amp;order=0&amp;direction=1|title=Winners 2013|last=|first=|date=|work=CLIO Healthcare|access-date=2017-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206104512/http://www.cliohealthcare.com/catalog/2013/integrated_campaign/entry.cfm?entryid=401310051&amp;award=50&amp;from=1&amp;to=500&amp;order=0&amp;direction=1|archive-date=2014-12-06|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Effie Award|Effie]] awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://effie.org/case_studies/by_category/106|title=Youth Marketing North America Case Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=Effie Worldwide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920061744/http://www.effie.org/case_studies/by_category/106|archive-date=2013-09-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://current.effie.org/goodworks_effie|title=Woodworks Effie|last=|first=|date=|website=Effie Worldwide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218024847/http://current.effie.org/goodworks_effie|archive-date=2014-12-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=22 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/truth-shares-grand-effie-award-64707|title='Truth' Shares Grand Effie Award|last=Griswold|first=Alice|date=|work=|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "truth" has also been featured in a variety of academic marketing and communications textbooks to educate the next generation of public health and social marketing leaders.&lt;ref name="truth Fact Sheet 2012" /&gt;

In 2014, Advertising Age named truth one of the top 10 ad campaigns on the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adage.com/lp/top15/#truth|title=Top 15 Ad Campaigns of the 21st Century - Advertising Age|last=Rodriguez|first=Ashley|date=|website=adage.com|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Monitoring the Future]] study, which surveys national samples of over 45,000 youth in grades 8, 10 and 12, reported historically low levels of current cigarette use amongst youth - only 6 percent of teens still smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2016.pdf|title=Monitoring the Future National Survey Results on Drug Use 1975-2016|last=Monitoring the Future website|first=|date=|website=|access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==

A "truth" campaign radio ad called "Dog Walker" prompted [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]] to pursue litigation against Truth Initiative (then the American Legacy Foundation). The dispute ran from July 2001 until its resolution in July 2006.  In the ad, an actor who identified himself as a dog walker placed a phone call to Lorillard, offering to sell Lorillard the urine from his dogs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlegacy.org/190.html  |title=Legacy Litigation &amp;#124; The American Legacy Foundation |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012071958/http://www.americanlegacy.org/190.html |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "truth" advertisement states urine and tobacco both contain [[urea]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Initially, Lorillard accused the ad agency of violating the laws regarding the taping of telephone conversations and threatened to refer them to the criminal authorities. In October 2001, Lorillard filed a [[Motion (legal)|Motion]] for a [[Declaratory Ruling]] with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), asking the FCC to rule that the radio stations’ broadcast of the ad violated an FCC regulation regarding broadcasting of telephone conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Public_Notices/da012565.doc |title=Mass Media Bureau Action Comment Sought On Motion For Declaratory Ruling |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=November 5, 2001 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2001, Lorillard notified Truth Initiative of their intent to litigate against the organization and its ad agency for defamation. Lorillard stated that it would not sue if the foundation agreed to a series of demands.  Accordingly, Truth Initiative entered into discussions with Lorillard to attempt an out-of-court resolution.  However, on January 18, 2002, Lorillard abandoned discussions and advanced a new claim that portions of the "truth" campaign violated the Master Settlement Agreement's prohibition against "vilification" or "personal attacks."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Cases were filed in both [[Delaware]] and [[North Carolina]]. The matter was resolved by the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] on July 17, 2006. They ruled unanimously that the "truth" campaign did not violate the Master Settlement Agreement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

A '''virtual human''' or '''digital clone''' is the creation or re-creation of a human being in image and voice using [[computer-generated imagery]] and sound, that is often indistinguishable from the real actor. This idea was first portrayed in the 1981 film ''[[Looker]]'', wherein models had their bodies scanned digitally to create 3D computer generated images of the models, and then animating said images for use in TV commercials. Two 1992 books used this concept: "Fools" by [[Pat Cadigan]], and ''Et Tu, Babe'' by [[Mark Leyner]].

In general, virtual humans employed in movies are known as '''synthespians''', '''virtual actors''', '''vactors''', '''cyberstars''', or '''"silicentric" actors'''.  There are several legal ramifications for the digital cloning of human actors, relating to [[copyright]] and [[personality right]]s.  People who have already been digitally cloned as simulations include [[Bill Clinton]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ed Sullivan]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Bruce Lee]], [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Anna Marie Goddard]], and [[George Burns]].  Ironically, data sets of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] for the creation of a virtual Arnold (head, at least) have already been made.&lt;ref name=Landon&gt;{{cite book|title=Edging Into the Future: Science Fiction and Contemporary Cultural Transformation|editor=Veronica Hollinger and Joan Gordon|author=Brooks Landon|chapter=Synthespians, Virtual Humans, and Hypermedia|pages=57&amp;ndash;59|year=2002|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1804-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Creed&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film Cultures Reader|editor=Graeme Turner|author=[[Barbara Creed]]|chapter=The Cyberstar|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-25281-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Schwarzeneggerization" comes from the 1992 book ''Et Tu, Babe'' by [[Mark Leyner]].  In one scene, on pages 50&amp;ndash;51, a character asks the shop assistant at a video store to have Arnold Schwarzenegger digitally substituted for existing actors into various works, including (amongst others) ''[[Rain Man]]'' (to replace both [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]), ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (to replace [[Rex Harrison]]), ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (to replace [[F. Murray Abraham]]), ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (as Anne Frank), ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (to replace [[Ben Kingsley]]), and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (to replace [[James Stewart]]).  Schwarzeneggerization is the name that Leyner gives to this process.  Only 10 years later, Schwarzeneggerization was close to being reality.&lt;ref name=Landon /&gt;

By 2002, Schwarzenegger, [[Jim Carrey]], [[Kate Mulgrew]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Denzel Washington]], [[Gillian Anderson]], and [[David Duchovny]] had all had their heads [[3D scanning|laser scanned]] to create digital computer models thereof.&lt;ref name=Landon /&gt;

== Early history ==
Early computer-generated animated faces include the 1985 film ''Tony de Peltrie'' and the [[music video]] for [[Mick Jagger]]'s song "Hard Woman" (from ''[[She's the Boss]]'').  The first actual human beings to be digitally duplicated were [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]] in a March 1987 film "[[Rendez-vous in Montreal]]" created by [[Nadia Magnenat Thalmann]] and [[Daniel Thalmann]] for the 100th anniversary of the [[Engineering Institute of Canada]].  The film was created by six people over a year, and had Monroe and Bogart meeting in a café in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.  The characters were rendered in three dimensions, and were capable of speaking, showing emotion, and shaking hands.&lt;ref name=Thalmann&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Virtual Humans|author=Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann and Daniel Thalmann|pages=6&amp;ndash;7|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-470-02316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the Kleiser-Walczak Construction Company (now Synthespian Studios), founded by Jeff Kleiser and [[Diana Walczak]] coined the term "synthespian" and began its Synthespian ("[[wikt:synthetic|synthetic]] [[wikt:thespian|thespian]]") Project, with the aim of creating "life-like figures based on the digital animation of clay models".&lt;ref name=Creed /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.synthespianstudios.net/about/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140511233900/http://www.synthespianstudios.net/about/ |archive-date=2014-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, ''[[Tin Toy]]'' was the first entirely computer-generated movie to win an [[Academy Award]] ([[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]).  In the same year, Mike the Talking Head, an animated head whose facial expression and head posture were controlled in real time by a puppeteer using a custom-built controller, was developed by [[Silicon Graphics]], and performed live at [[SIGGRAPH]].  In 1989, ''[[The Abyss]]'', directed by [[James Cameron]] included a computer-generated face placed onto a watery pseudopod.&lt;ref name=Thalmann /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lester&gt;{{cite book|title=Visual Communication: Images With Messages|author=Paul Martin Lester|pages=353|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|isbn=0-534-63720-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', also directed by Cameron, confident in the abilities of computer-generated effects from his experience with ''The Abyss'', included a mixture of synthetic actors with live animation, including computer models of [[Robert Patrick]]'s face.  ''The Abyss'' contained just one scene with photo-realistic computer graphics.  ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' contained over forty shots throughout the film.&lt;ref name=Thalmann /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lester /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Visual Digital Culture: Surface Play and Spectacle in New Media Genres|author=Andrew Darley|chapter=The Waning of Narrative|pages=109|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-16554-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Industrial Light and Magic]] worked on creating a virtual actor that was a composite of the bodily parts of several real actors.&lt;ref name=Creed /&gt;

By the 21st century, virtual actors had become a reality.  The face of [[Brandon Lee]], who had died partway through the shooting of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' in 1994, had been digitally superimposed over the top of a body-double in order to complete those parts of the movie that had yet to be filmed.  By 2001, three-dimensional computer-generated realistic humans had been used in ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', and by 2004, a synthetic [[Laurence Olivier]] co-starred in ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]''.&lt;ref name=Remshardt&gt;{{cite book|title=Intermediality in Theatre and Performance|editor=Freda Chapple and Chiel Kattenbelt|author=Ralf Remshardt|chapter=The actor as imtermedialist: remetiation, appropriation, adaptation|pages=52&amp;ndash;53|year=2006|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-1629-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital 3D Design|author=Simon Danaher|pages=38|year=2004|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|isbn=1-59200-391-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Star Wars]]'' Anthology film, ''[[Rogue One|Rogue One: a Star Wars story]]'' (2016) whose plot ends minutes before that of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (1977), digitally recreated the appearances of [[Peter Cushing]] in the role [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] (played and voiced by [[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]]), and [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Princess Leia]] (played by [[Ingvild Deila]]. Fisher's only line was added using archival voice footage of Carrie Fisher saying the word "Hope".). The virtual versions replicated the characters' appearances as seen in the aforementioned ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope''. Cushing had died in 1994, while Fisher died a few days after the film's release. [[Industrial Light and Magic]] created the special effects, and noted that the technique would not be used often, noting also that the ''young [[Han Solo]] film'' would not use [[Harrison Ford]]'s likeness.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/movies/how-rogue-one-brought-back-grand-moff-tarkin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
Critics such as Stuart Klawans in the ''[[New York Times]]'' expressed worry about the loss of "the very thing that art was supposedly preserving: our point of contact with the irreplaceable, finite person".  And even more problematic are the issues of copyright and personality rights. Actors have little legal control over a digital clone of themselves. In the United States, for instance, they must resort to database protection laws in order to exercise what control they have (The proposed [[Database and Collections of Information Misappropriation Act]] would strengthen such laws). An actor does not own the copyright on his digital clones, unless they were created by him. Robert Patrick, for example, would not have any legal control over the liquid metal digital clone of himself that was created for ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''.&lt;ref name=Remshardt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Control And Globalization in Asia: Copyright, Piracy, and Cinema|author=Laikwan Pang|chapter=Expressions, originality, and fixation|pages=20|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-35201-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of digital clones in movie industry, to replicate the acting performances of a cloned person, represents a controversial aspect of these implications, as it may cause real actors to land in fewer roles, and put them in disadvantage at contract negotiations, since a clone could always be used by the producers at potentially lower costs. It is also a career difficulty, since a clone could be used in roles that a real actor would never accept for various reasons. Bad identifications of an actor's image with a certain type of roles could harm his career, and real actors, conscious of this, pick and choose what roles they play ([[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] became [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] with their roles as [[Count Dracula]] and the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], whereas [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]] have played a diverse range of parts). A digital clone could be used to play the parts of (for examples) an axe murderer or a prostitute, which would affect the actor's public image, and in turn affect what future casting opportunities were given to that actor. Both [[Tom Waits]] and [[Bette Midler]] have won actions for damages against people who employed their images in advertisements that they had refused to take part in themselves.&lt;ref name=Einhorn&gt;{{cite book|title=Media, Technology, and Copyright: Integrating Law and Economics|author=Michael A. Einhorn|pages=121, 125|chapter=Publicity rights and consumer rights|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=1-84376-657-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, the use of a digital clone in advertisements is required to be accurate and truthful (section 43(a) of the [[Lanham Act]] and which makes deliberate confusion unlawful). The use of a celebrity's image would be an implied endorsement.  The [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] held that an advertisement employing a [[Woody Allen]] impersonator would violate the Act unless it contained a disclaimer stating that Allen did not endorse the product.&lt;ref name=Einhorn /&gt;

Other concerns include posthumous use of digital clones. [[Barbara Creed]] states that "Arnold's famous threat, 'I'll be back', may take on a new meaning". Even before Brandon Lee was digitally reanimated, the [[California Senate]] drew up the Astaire Bill, in response to lobbying from [[Fred Astaire]]'s widow and the [[Screen Actors Guild]], who were seeking to restrict the use of digital clones of Astaire.  Movie studios opposed the legislation, and as of 2002 it had yet to be finalized and enacted. Several companies, including Virtual Celebrity Productions, have purchased the rights to create and use digital clones of various dead celebrities, such as [[Marlene Dietrich]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/09/business/fi-64043 Los Angeles Times / Digital Elite Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vincent Price]].&lt;ref name=Creed /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">'''Wandering womb''' was the belief that a displaced [[uterus]] was the cause of many medical [[pathology|pathologies]] in women. The belief originates in the medical texts of ancient Greece, although it persisted in European academic medicine and popular thought for centuries.

==Origins==
The belief in the "wandering womb" was found in ancient Greece. Some scholars have argued that it originated in Egypt, but this has now been disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merskey|first=Harold|last2=Potter|first2=Paul|year=1989|title=The womb lay still in ancient Egypt|url=|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=154 |issue=6|pages=751–753|via=|doi=10.1192/bjp.154.6.751}}&lt;/ref&gt; One description of the theory of a "wandering womb" comes from [[Aretaeus]], a physician from Cappadocia, who was a contemporary of [[Galen]] in the 2nd century AD. He wrote that the uterus could move out of place, and float within the body. In the translation of [[Francis Adams (translator)|Francis Adams]] (1856)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/aretaioukappadok00aret|title=Aretaiou Kappadokou Ta sozomena = The extant works of Aretaeus, the Cappadocian|last=Aretaeus|first=of Cappadocia|last2=Adams|first2=Francis|date=1856-01-01|publisher=London : Printed for the Sydenham Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; this reads: {{blockquote|In the middle of the flanks of women lies the womb, a female [[viscus]], closely resembling an animal; for it is moved of itself hither and thither in the flanks, also upwards in a direct line to below the cartilage of the thorax, and also obliquely to the right or to the left, either to the liver or the spleen, and it likewise is subject to prolapsus downwards, and in a word, it is altogether erratic. It delights also in fragrant smells, and advances towards them; and it has an aversion to fetid smells, and flees from them; and, on the whole, the womb is like an animal within an animal.|sign=|source=}}

The Greek translated here as "like an animal within an animal" would be better translated as "like a living thing inside another living thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hysteria Beyond Freud|last=Gilman|first=Sander L.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=0520080645|location=|page=26|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the uterus could move freely, which this imagery evokes, was linked to the use of scent therapy to entice it up or down within the body. This may have been part of ancient cultural beliefs in Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hysteria Beyond Freud|last=Gilman|first=Sander|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=0520080645|location=|pages=17–25|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the earliest known written accounts of it are in the fifth- and fourth-century BC texts associated with the name of [[Hippocrates]]. The movement of the uterus was believed to cause symptoms throughout the body, depending on the destination to which the uterus moved in search of fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hysteria Beyond Freud|last=Gilman|first=Sander|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=0520080645|location=|pages=18–20|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposing views==
[[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]] of Ephesus, another second century AD physician, opposed the theory of the "wandering womb". In a description of what he labelled "hysterical suffocation" - suffocation arising in the uterus - Soranus wrote, "the uterus does not issue forth like a wild animal from the lair, delighted by fragrant odors and fleeing bad odors, rather it is drawn together because of stricture caused by inflammation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in the Classical World: Image and Text|last=Dean-Jones|first=Lesley|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=199|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia|Aretaeus]] used the more neutral "living thing", Soranus used the term for "wild beast", ''therion''. [[Galen]] also insisted that the uterus was stationary and that symptoms were due to substances being retained inside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hysteria Beyond Freud|last=Gilman|first=Sander|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=0520080645|location=|pages=41|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that Aretaeus was unusual among physicians of his period in believing in a mobile and animate womb. Despite the fact that Soranus was an influential writer on gynecology, and that Galen was the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] medical writer with the greatest overall influence on Medieval and [[Renaissance medicine]] in Europe, the belief in the "wandering womb" continued for centuries, for example in [[Edward Jorden]]'s influential 1603 treatise on the supposed bewitching of 14 year-old Mary Glover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hysteria Beyond Freud|last=Gilman|first=Sander|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=0520080645|location=|pages=116–118|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hysteria==
{{further information|Female hysteria}}
The idea of a condition called [[hysteria]] caused by "wandering womb" developed from the "hysterical suffocation" of ancient Greek writers. Medical researchers developed a better understanding of anatomy after the invention of microscopes in the 17th century and cellular research in the 19th century. [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of the free-floating unconscious, the "mind within the mind", was similar to the ancient belief in the "animal within the animal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilman|first=Sander L.|title=Hysteria Beyond Freud|year=1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520080645|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both "wandering womb" and "hysteria" are unused in medical theories of today.

[[Namibia]] is an arid country that is regularly afflicted by droughts. Large rivers flow only along its Northern and Southern border, but they are far from the population centers. They are also far from the country's mines, which are large water users. In order to confront this challenge the country has built dams to capture the flow from ephemeral rivers, constructed pipelines to transport water over large distances, pioneered potable water reuse in its capital [[Windhoek]] located in the central part of Namibia, and built Sub-Saharan Africa's first large seawater desalination plant to supply a uranium mine and the city of [[Swakopmund]] with water. A large scheme to bring water from the [[Okavango River]] in the North to Windhoek, the Eastern National Water Carrier, was only partially completed during the 1980s.

Most urban residents have access to drinking water supply, but access lags behind in rural areas. Access to sanitation also considerably lags behind access to drinking water supply. The bulk water supply infrastructure is owned by [[NamWater]], a public entity operating under commercial principles. It sells water to the mining companies, as well as to the municipalities which in turn sell it to urban residents and businesses.

==Water resources==
[[File:Namibia-1113.jpg|thumb|250px|Namibia is primarily a large desert and semi-desert plateau.]]
Namibia’s climate is hot and dry with erratic rainfall during two rainy seasons in summer. Within Africa its climate is second in aridity only to the Sahara. Namibia shares several large rivers, such as the [[Orange River]] in the South, shared with South Africa, as well as the [[Zambezi]] and [[Okavango River]]s in the North, shared with Angola, Zambia and Botswana. But these rivers are far away from the population centers and the cost of tapping them for drinking water supply is prohibitive. Only the [[Cunene River]], which is shared with Angola, provides drinking water for four Northern regions of Namibia. The total average "safe yield" of Namibia’s water resources is estimated at 660 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year, distributed as follows: groundwater 300 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year, ephemeral rivers 200 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year, perennial rivers 150 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year and unconventional sources such as treated wastewater 10 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia Water Report|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/nam/index.stm|publisher=FAO|accessdate=11 June 2016|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundwater===
Groundwater is distributed unevenly over the territory of Namibia, thus making the construction of pipelines necessary to tap their potential. In particular, the coastal area is nearly devoid of groundwater. Recharge in these areas is low and unreliable, groundwater lies at great depths and sometimes is of poor quality. Other areas are favorable, sitting on high-yielding, very productive aquifers that contain more water than farmers and communities presently need. Numerous small springs throughout the country sustain wildlife, man and livestock. Over the past century, more than 100 000 boreholes have been drilled in Namibia. Half of these are still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Groundwater in Namibia|url=http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/iwrm/fundaments-in-iwrm/groundwater-in-namibia/index.php|publisher=GIZ: Integrated Water Resource Management in Namibia|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 German hydro-geologists discovered a huge aquifer in Northern Namibia that could supply the area, where 40% of the population of the country lives, for 400 years. The aquifer, called [[Ohangwena]] II, contains about 5 billion cubic meters of water which is up to 10,000 years old. The aquifer is about 300 meters deep and is under pressure, so that its water could be pumped up at a relatively low cost. However, a saline aquifer sits on top of the freshwater aquifer, so that drilling must be done carefully in order to avoid saline intrusion. The aquifer receives some recharge from Angola in the North. Experts recommend that, during normal climatic conditions, water abstraction should be limited to the inflow from the North in order to manage the aquifer on a sustainable basis. However, during extended droughts induced by climate change, the aquifer can be drawn down and serve as an important buffer against drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matt McGrath|title=Vast aquifer found in Namibia could last for centuries|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-18875385|publisher=BBC News Science and Environment|accessdate=12 June 2016|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video: Namibia's new groundwater treasure - The Ohangwena II Aquifer|url=http://www.bgr.bund.de/EN/Themen/Zusammenarbeit/TechnZusammenarb/Projekte/Laufend/Afrika/1062_2009-2096-7_Namibia_Grundwassererkundung_Cuvelai_PhaseII_en.html|publisher=BGR - The German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, groundwater is slightly saline (brackish). In the [[Omusati]] Region in Northern Namibia, four small brackish water desalination plants were installed in 2010 as part of the German-Namibian research project CuveWaters. The plants are powered by solar energy and provide between 0.5 and 3.3 m&lt;sup&gt;³&lt;/sup&gt; of safe drinking water per day, enough to satisfy the basic needs of between 10 and 66 people. At 15 Euro/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; the cost of desalinating brackish water in these small plants is very high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Groundwater Desalination|url=http://www.cuvewaters.net/Groundwater-Desalination.77.0.html|publisher=CuveWaters|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface water===
[[Image:HardapDam.JPG|left|thumb|250px|The reservoir of the Hardap Dam on the ephemeral Fish River in Southern Namibia is the largest in the country.]]
Many of the [[ephemeral]] (=seasonally flowing) rivers of the Namibian interior are dammed and, according to the [[FAO]], provide a 95%-assured yield of 96 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year, based on historical rainfall data. These dams have low safe yields in comparison to their total volume, because of uneven flows over time and high evaporation losses. Thus only about half the water from ephemeral rivers is usable. There  is  surplus  water  in  some dams, e.g. in the [[Oanob Dam]], the [[Hardap Dam]], the [[Naute Dam]] and the [[Friedenau Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A. Puz|title=Namibia Water Resources Management Review: Water Use and Conservation Theme Report|url=http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/downloads/theme-report-water-use-and-conservation-2000.pdf|accessdate=12 June 2016|page=10|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surplus water cannot be used because of the remote location of these dams and the comparatively limited local demand.

Namibia suffers from regular droughts, the most recent one hitting the country in 2015/16.

[[File:Namibia 124.jpg|thumb|250px|The Cunene River, shown here at the Ruacana Falls at the Namibian-Angolan border, is an important water source for Northern Namibia.]]

The water from [[perennial]] (=permanently flowing) rivers used in Namibia corresponds to the small share of Namibia in its border rivers. The actual abstractions as of 1999 (latest available data) were 23 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; from the Cunene River at [[Ruacana]], 49 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; from the Orange River at [[Noordoewer]], 22 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; from the Okavango River (that flows through Namibia in the Caprivi Strip) at [[Rundu]], and 7 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; from the Zambezi River. Namibia has agreements in place with Angola and South Africa about the sharing of the Cunene and Orange Rivers respectively. The water allocation from the Cunene River is 180 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and thus far larger than the amount withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia Water Report|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/nam/index.stm|publisher=FAO|accessdate=11 June 2016|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A.

===Flood and rainwater harvesting===
In Northern Namibia rain is relatively abundant, but it falls only during the dry season, creating temporary natural ponds called Oshanas. At the height of the rainy season the water in these ponds is clear and of good quality. In a pilot project as part of the CuveWaters research program, in the remote village Lipopo in the Southern Oshana region water from an Oshana has been pumped to a storage tank to be used for the irrigation of vegetables during the dry season using a [[drip irrigation]] system. In addition, rainwater is being collected from the rooftop of a greenhouse and from the roofs covering the storage ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floodwater Harvesting|url=http://www.cuvewaters.net/Floodwater-Harvesting.78.0.html|publisher=CuveWaters|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another village, Epyeshona near [[Oshakati]], only rainwater is collected, both on an individual basis from the rooftops of houses, and on a communal basis from a concrete area on the ground constructed especially for [[rainwater harvesting]]. In both cases the water is used for the irrigation of vegetables during the dry season, either in an open filed or in a communal greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainwater Harvesting|url=http://www.cuvewaters.net/Rainwater-Harvesting.75.0.html|publisher=CuveWater|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2016 drought Areva offered to sell its plant to the Namibian government for $200 million USD.&lt;ref name="OOSKA Drought"/&gt;

===Water reuse===
Reuse of treated wastewater is practiced in Namibia in many urban areas such as [[Swakopmund]], [[Walvis Bay]], [[Tsumeb]], [[Otjiwarongo]], [[Okahandja]], [[Mariental, Namibia|Mariental]], [[Oranjemund]] and [[Windhoek]]. In most localities, water is reused for irrigation. In Windhoek, [[reclaimed water]] is also used for potable uses.

A representative example of direct potable reuse is the case of [[Windhoek]] (Namibia, New Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant (NGWRP)), where treated wastewater has been blended with drinking water for more than 45 years. It is based on the multiple treatment barriers concept (i.e. pre-ozonation, enhanced [[coagulation]]/dissolved air flotation/rapid sand filtration, and subsequent [[ozone]], biological activated carbon/granular [[activated carbon]], [[ultrafiltration]] (UF), chlorination) to reduce associated risks and improve the water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Van Buynder|first2=Paul|last3=Lugg|first3=Richard|last4=Blair|first4=Palenque|last5=Devine|first5=Brian|last6=Cook|first6=Angus|last7=Weinstein|first7=Philip|date=17 March 2009|title=Indirect Potable Reuse: A Sustainable Water Supply Alternative|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=6|issue=3|pages=1174–1203|doi=10.3390/ijerph6031174|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Clemencia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Michael|first2=C.|last3=Duan|first3=X.|last4=He|first4=X.|last5=Dionysiou|first5=D.D.|last6=Mills|first6=M.A.|last7=Fatta-Kassinos|first7=D.|date=June 2015|title=Dissolved effluent organic matter: Characteristics and potential implications in wastewater treatment and reuse applications|journal=Water Research|volume=77|pages=213–248|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2015.03.011|last1=Michael-Kordatou|first1=I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the year 1968 the capital of Namibia, Windhoek, has used reclaimed wastewater as one of their drinking water sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.cy/books?id=726SCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA424&amp;lpg=PA424&amp;dq=Water+reuse+in+Windhoek,+Namibia:+37+years+and+still+the+only+case+of+direct+water+reuse+for+human+consumption&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rqEcYVF1UE&amp;sig=65vxYKKIguDOlQsC0KBv7oFUyEY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2ocGX0ZjOAhWK0RoKHfjeA8wQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Water%20reuse%20in%20Windhoek%2C%20Namibia%3A%2037%20years%20and%20still%20the%20only%20case%20of%20direct%20water%20reuse%20for%20human%20consumption&amp;f=false|title=Water and Health - Volume II|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=9781848261839|language=en|last1=Grabow|first1=W.

There is also a pilot project for small-scale reuse of treated wastewater in rural areas in [[Outapi]] in Northern Namibia as part of the CuveWaters research project. The wastewater of 1,500 people is collected in [[vacuum sewer]]s and treated in such a way that pathogens are removed, but nutrients remain to a large extent in the water. The technology is relatively sophisticated for a rural area in a developing country, using [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] followed by aerobic treatment using a [[rotating biological contactor]], a microsieve and [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|ultraviolet disinfection]]. The water is then used to irrigate vegetables for the local market. Community members have been trained in how to operate the facilities and a tariff and billing system has been introduced to recover the operating costs of the plant from users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanitation and Water Reuse|url=http://www.cuvewaters.net/Sanitation-and-Water-Reuse.79.0.html|publisher=CuveWaters|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water use and access===
[[File:Mandume Ndemufayo Street Ongwediva 2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Water tower in the town of [[Ongwediva]] in Northern Namibia.]] 
Total water use in Namibia was estimated at 300 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in 2000. The municipal sector including tourism and industry used 73 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (24 percent), while the bulk of water use is for agriculture and livestock. Only 13 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (4 percent) was used in mining at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A. Puz|title=Namibia Water Resources Management Review: Water Use and Conservation Theme Report|url=http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/downloads/theme-report-water-use-and-conservation-2000.pdf|accessdate=12 June 2016|page=15|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this amount has increased due to the development of mining – in particular uranium mining – after 2000. [[Mining in Namibia]] makes extensive use of water, which is used for a broad range of activities including in particular mineral processing, but also dust control, [[slurry]] transport and the water use of employees. Uranium mining uses large quantities of water for processing using alkali [[heap leaching]]. For example, the [[Trekkopje mine]] in the [[Namib desert]] uses 14 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year of high-quality water that must be free of any salt. Saline water extracted through local wells is used for dust suppression, thus reducing the need for freshwater. Furthermore, some of the wastewater is treated and reused, thus further reducing water demand. Freshwater demand is met from the Erongo [[desalination]] plant that also supplies neighboring communities. Since the lifetime of the plant (30 years) is longer than the expected lifetime of the mine (12 years), already when the plant was planned it was expected that it would be taken over by NamWater at the closure of the mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water management in mining – a selection of case studies: Trekkopje uranium mine Namibia|url=https://www.icmm.com/document/3660|publisher=International Council on Mining and Metals|accessdate=12 June 2016|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations|UN]] evaluated in 2011 that Namibia has improved its water access network significantly since [[Namibian War of Independence|independence]] in 1990. Furthermore, in rural areas access is sometimes limited by the long distance between residences and water points.&lt;ref name=UN2011&gt;{{cite news

===Water supply and water use in Windhoek===

[[File:Goreangab Damm.jpg|thumb|Goreangab Dam aerial view]]

Windhoek is provided with water from three different sources. As of 2006 17 Mio m&lt;sup&gt;³&lt;/sup&gt; of the water demand was covered by dams around Windhoek, such as the [[von Bach Dam]], 5.4 Mio m&lt;sup&gt;³&lt;/sup&gt; from the Goreangab Reclamation Plant and only between 1 and 2 Mio m&lt;sup&gt;³&lt;/sup&gt; still come from boreholes. The city estimates per capita water consumption at 200 liter per capita per day including industries, businesses and tourism, which is slightly higher than in Europe. An analysis of residential water consumption alone estimated it at 163 liter per capita per day in 2010, with significant differences between neighborhoods. For example, it was 306 liter in high-income neighborhoods in the South-East, while it was only 27 liter in informal settlements in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dr. T. Uhlendahl and D.

In April 2016, the city of Windhoek launched a Zero Tolerance to Water Wastage policy, under which it would disconnect or fine on anyone using potable supply to water gardens or wash cars. The [[Swakoppoort Dam]], [[Von Bach Dam]] and [[Omatako Dam]], which supply the region, were only filled at 11 percent of their capacity. In May, the Coca-Cola Namibia Bottling Company stopped production due to the severe water shortages.&lt;ref name="OOSKA Drought"&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia Needs $1.6 Billion to Relieve Water Shortages: President|url=https://www.ooskanews.com/story/2016/06/namibia-needs-16-billion-relieve-water-shortages-president_171781|publisher=OOSKA News|accessdate=9 June 2016|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility for water supply and sanitation==
The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry is in charge of water resources management, drinking water supply and sanitation in Namibia.

[[NamWater]] is a state-owned bulk water supplier that operates dams, pipelines and water treatment plants throughout the country. Created in 1997, it provides and sells water to mines, as well as to municipalities which in turn distribute and sell the water to households, businesses and offices in their respective service areas.{{sfn|Banerjee|Skilling|Foster|Briceño-Garmendia|2009|p=66}} In rural areas, the Directorate of Rural Water Supply of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry is in charge of water supply and sanitation.

==History==
[[File:Goreangabdam.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Goreangab reservoir near Windhoek, looking downstream away from the city.]]
In Windhoek, groundwater was almost the only source of water for until 1958 when a small surface reservoir, the [[Goreangab Dam]], was built downstream from Windhoek. A conventional water treatment plant was also constructed to treat the surface water from this reservoir. In 1960 the Gammams Wastewater Treatment Plant was commissioned near Goreangab Dam, discharging treated wastewater downstream of the reservoir. Subsequently, industrial and domestic effluents at the wastewater treatment plant were separated. The plant treating the domestic wastewater was upgraded so that its effluent could be further treated in the existing water treatment plant.&lt;ref name="Pisani"/&gt;

The water treatment plant was also upgraded, so that it could further treat the treated wastewater in one train, alongside the existing train for the raw water from Goreangab Dam. Thus, the Goreangab Reclamation Plant was born in 1968. Its output was blended with water from the city's well field and was delivered as drinking water to the city's residents.&lt;ref name="Pisani"/&gt; When the city grew further, the municipality started to receive water from the [[Von Bach Dam]] 170&amp;nbsp;km north of Windhoek commissioned in 1970. The 1974 Water Master Plan envisaged The Eastern National Water Carrier to supply water to Namibia's central area from the [[Okavango River]], some 750 kilometers to the north on the Angolan border. Construction of the carrier began in the late 1970s in several phases from South to North, first connecting the von Bach Dam to the newly built Omatako Dam further North over a distance of 94&amp;nbsp;km, and then connecting the Omataku Dam to Grootfontein over a distance of another 300&amp;nbsp;km. However, the next and last phase of the scheme connecting Grootfontein to the Okavango River near [[Rundu]] was never built. The [[Omatako Dam]], completed in 1981, now only receives flood water and is empty most of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE OMATAKO DAM –  SARTORIUS VON BACH DAM  COMPONENTS  OF THE  EASTERN NATIONAL WATER CARRIER Brochure issued for the opening of the scheme on 4 May 1984.|url=http://www.namwater.com.na/images/data/The%20Omatako%20Dam.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2016|date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the city introduced progressive water pricing and educational programs that reduced consumption substantially. The  daily  per  capita  residential  consumption  decreased  from  201  liters  in  1990/91  to 117  liters  in  1996/97, partly due to the introduction of a very high drought tariff. When the normal water tariff was put in place again in  1997/98, the  consumption  increased  to  130  liters/person/day. Total per capita consumption including commerce and industry shows a reduction from 322 liters/capita/day in 1990/91 to 201 liters/capita/day in 1997/98. According to a study by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), water consumption was lowered in all sectors, which is a major achievement because the reduction in water consumption in public buildings is not easily achieved. In schools, government buildings and municipal gardens, army bases and prisons the water consumption  was  lowered  by  as  much  as  50%. These savings postponed new supply infrastructure by about 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ben van der Merwe|title=WATER DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNTRY STUDY NAMIBIA|url=http://www.the-eis.com/data/literature/WATER%20DEMAND%20MANAGEMENT_Report%20to%20IUCN.pdf|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=12 June 2016|pages=10–38|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; But despite all these savings more water was needed. Thus the plant's capacity was almost tripled in 2002, allowing it to provide more than a third of the city's water demand and to relieve overused groundwater resources.&lt;ref name="Pisani"/&gt;

[[File:Karte Vorstadt Windhoek-Goreangab.png|thumb|300px|left|The watershed of the Goreangab reservoir is heavily urbanized, as shown on this map.]]

To retain public confidence, water quality at the Goreangab Treatment Plant is monitored on an ongoing basis after every process step. In the event of any quality problems, the plant goes into recycle mode and water is not delivered. According to Pisani "The citizens of Windhoek have over time become used to the idea that potable reuse is included in their water provision process. In fact, they have grown to harbor a fair amount of pride in the fact that their city in many respects leads the world in direct reclamation."&lt;ref name="Pisani"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petrus L. Du Pisani|title=Surviving in an arid land: Direct reclamation of potable water at Windhoek's Goreangab Reclamation Plant|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/oals/ALN/aln56/dupisani.html|publisher=Arid Lands Newsletter No.56|accessdate=11 June 2016|date=November–December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upgrading of the plant was partly funded by the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) and Germany through [[KfW]] development bank. In its ex-post evaluation of the project, KfW noted that the plant faced considerable technical difficulties and temporary shutdowns over a period of seven years until it started to work properly. KfW noted that in the spirit of [[integrated water resources management]] more should have been done to reduce the per capita water consumption in Windhoek and to protect the Goreangab Dam from pollution, for example by establishing a protection zone with restricted activities around the reservoir. It also noted that the plant did achieve its objective to relieve pressure on overexploited groundwater resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex Post-Evaluierung: Kurzbericht  Namibia: Abwasserrückgewinnung Windhoek|url=https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Evaluierung/Ergebnisse-und-Publikationen/PDF-Dokumente-L-P/Namibia_Abwasser_Windhoe_2011.pdf|publisher=KfW|accessdate=11 June 2016|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial aspects==
Namibia spends about 3% of its [[Gross Domestic Product]] on the operation expenditures of it water utilities. This is by far the highest percentage of all Sub-Saharan countries.{{sfn|Banerjee|Skilling|Foster|Briceño-Garmendia|2009|p=56}} Per capita, Namibia spends about 80[[US$]] annually on water supply and sanitation, other countries in the region spend between 1 and 10 US$. Providing access to utility water in Namibia costs 4,000 US$ per capita on average.{{sfn|Banerjee|Skilling|Foster|Briceño-Garmendia|2009|pp=60-61}}

===Financing===
A large share of these expenses is borne by NamWater. NamWater passes its costs fully on to its customers. Since its inception some customers failed to pay their water bills, resulting in poor financial performance. However, beginning in 2003 the company was turned around financially, including also by cutting costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Plan|url=http://www.namwater.com.na/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9|publisher=NamWater|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today NamWater refinances itself to a large extent through notes issues in the Namibian stock market. As of 2015, interest paid on five-year notes issued in the same year was 9.05 percent and the company had a BBB rating from the rating agency [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitch Ratings|title=FITCH RATES NAMWATER'S NAD200M SENIOR UNSECURED BONDS 'BBB'|url=http://www.namwater.com.na/images/data/bond/Fitch%20NamWater%202015%20Report.pdf|publisher=NamWater|accessdate=12 June 2016|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tariffs===
Water tariffs in Namibia are among the highest in Africa. The first block of the residential water tariff in Windhoek costs N$13.86 (USD 0.92) per cubic metre in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia: Windhoek Faces 10 Percent Water Increase|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201606080132.html|publisher=Namibian|accessdate=11 June 2016|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tariff includes a fixed monthly charge of N$74.43 (5 USD) which is independent of consumption. The first consumption block includes a basic consumption of 200 liter per household and day, an amount that is high for small households but can be low for large households. Higher consumption is charged at a higher tariff that was N$20.93 per cubic metre (USD 1.40) in 2015. The municipality bills water together with electricity, solid waste collection and the property tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Windhoek: Understand your statement|url=http://www.cityofwindhoek.org.na/documents/145_cow_-_001498_-_df_-_understand_your_statement_-_pt1_final_.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of informal settlements receive water through public standpipes equipped with prepaid water meters. Prepaid customers pay about USD 1.9 per kiloliter (cubic metre), or about USD 0.038 per 20‐liter container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chris Heymans, Kathy Eales and Richard  Franceys|title=Prepaid Water in Windhoek: Case Study, in: The Limits and Possibilities of Prepaid Water in Urban Africa:Lessons from the Field|url=https://www.wsp.org/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/Windhoek-Africa-Prepaid-Water-Case-Study-2014.pdf|publisher=Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) of the World Bank|accessdate=11 June 2016|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water tariffs in other municipalities vary. Those municipalities that receive bulk water from NamWater, which includes all large municipalities, have to recover the costs of bulk water supply plus the cost of water distribution to the customers through their own networks. A few smaller municipalities that have their own water sources are not subject to this constraint. For example, the municipality of [[Oranjemund]] provides water for free and thus has by far the highest water use in the country with an astonishing 2,667 liters/capita/day. Bulk water tariff charged by NamWater vary slightly across the country depending on the cost of supplying a specific location, but these differences are not fully passed on to municipalities. Thus NamWater effectively cross-subsidizes localities with high supply costs with surpluses from localities with lower supply costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ben van der Merwe|title=WATER DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNTRY STUDY NAMIBIA|url=http://www.the-eis.com/data/literature/WATER%20DEMAND%20MANAGEMENT_Report%20to%20IUCN.pdf|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=12 June 2016|pages=3–37|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanitation==
Compared to the efforts made to improve access to safe water, Namibia is lagging behind in the provision of adequate sanitation.&lt;ref name=UN2011/&gt; This includes 298 schools that have no toilet facilities.&lt;ref name="N2014"&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Agglomeration um den Goreangab Damm.jpg|thumb|Township near Goreangab Dam]]
Apart from residences for upper and middle class households, sanitation is insufficient in most residential areas. Private flush toilets are too expensive for virtually all residents in [[township]]s due to their water consumption and installation cost. As a result, access to  [[improved sanitation]] has not increased much since [[Namibian War of Independence|independence]]: In Namibia's rural areas as of 2008 13% of the population had more than basic sanitation, up from 8% in 1990. Many of Namibia's inhabitants have to resort to "flying toilets", plastic bags to defecate which after use are flung into the bush.&lt;ref name="N2008"&gt;{{cite news

A National Sanitation Strategy 2010-15 estimated that it would cost N$1.64 billion over five years to reach the strategy's goal through 186 individual initiatives. The strategy also noted that it was unlikely that the government would be able to afford these costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia: National Sanitation Strategy 2010/11-2014/15|url=http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/downloads/nat-sanitation-strategy-0910.pdf|publisher=Republic of Namibia: Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry|accessdate=12 June 2016|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Émile Colling''' (12 April 1899 – 16 September 1981) was a [[Luxembourgers|Luxembourgian]] doctor and politician.

==Life==
Colling was born in [[Clervaux]], as the youngest of 6 children. After attending the [[Athénée de Luxembourg]], he studied medicine in [[Strasbourg]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Freiburg]], and [[Cologne]]. In 1925, he settled in [[Esch-sur-Alzette]] as a doctor. In 1945 he was made the first director of public health. In the same year, he became manager of the spa in [[Mondorf-les-Bains|Mondorf]] and a member of the [[Consultative Assembly (Luxembourg)|Consultative Assembly]]. Politically, he was aligned with the newly founded conservative [[Christian Social People's Party]]. In 1945, he was elected to the city council of Esch, and also to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Chamber of Deputies]] for the South district. He was re-elected as a Deputy in 1948 and 1954. In 1954 he became Minister for Agriculture and Public Health in the [[Bech-Bodson Ministry]]. He remained in this post from 1958 to 1959 in the [[Frieden Ministry]]. Then he became Minister for Labour and Social Security in [[Pierre Werner]]'s government, until 1964, and thereafter the Minister for Agriculture, Wine-growing, Families, Population and Social Security. In 1967 he became the Luxembourgish ambassador to the [[Holy See]], which he remained until 1974.

He had five children, including François Colling.
