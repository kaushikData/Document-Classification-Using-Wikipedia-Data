The '''albacore''' (''Thunnus alalunga''), known also as the '''longfin tuna''', is a species of [[tuna]] of the order [[Perciformes]]. It is found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] waters across the globe in the [[epipelagic]] and [[mesopelagic]] zones. There are six distinct stocks known globally in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans, as well as the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The albacore has an elongate, [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] body with a conical snout, large eyes, and remarkably long [[pectoral fins]]. Its body is a deep blue [[dorsally]] and shades of silvery white [[ventral]]ly. Individuals can reach up to {{convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.

Albacore are [[pelagic]] predators that eat a variety of foods, including [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, and [[cephalopod]]s. They are unique among tuna in that their primary food source is cephalopods, with fish making up a much smaller portion of their diet. Reproduction usually occurs from November to February and is [[oviparous]]. An adult female can release over 2 million eggs in a single cycle. Fry generally stay near where they were spawned for about a year before moving on. Albacore form schools based on their stage in the life cycle, but also combine with other tuna like the [[skipjack tuna]], [[yellowfin tuna]], and [[bluefin tuna]]. Once grown, schools are highly migratory.

The albacore is a very economically important fish and is a target of [[Commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[Recreational fishing|recreational]] fisheries. It was originally the basis for the United States tuna-canning industry and is no less important today, making up significant percentages of the [[gross domestic product]]s of various Pacific nations. It is listed as [[Near Threatened]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) because of the threat of overfishing. Several stocks are in significant decline and the species' overall population trend is decreasing.

The first [[scientific description]] of the albacore was authored in 1788 by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the illustrated encyclopedia ''Tableau encyclopédique et methodique des trois règnes de la nature''. He originally placed it in the [[mackerel]] [[genus]] ''[[Scomber]]''. It was assigned to the genus ''Thunnus'' by ichthyologists Bruce B. Collette and Cornelia E. Nauen in 1983.&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Thunnus | species = alalunga | month = January | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the [[Thunnus (subgenus)|Thunnus subgenus]], also known as the bluefin group. Populations of albacore differ genetically by region, with Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean groups each showing differences in [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] and [[DNA|nuclear DNA]].&lt;ref name=vinas&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vinas |first=J. |author2=J.

==Description==
[[File:Histoire naturelle des poissons (10438834583).jpg|thumb|The albacore's pectoral fins can be longer than 30% of the fish's total length.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt;]]
The albacore has a streamlined, fusiform body with a conical snout, large mouth, and big eyes. Its body is dark blue dorsally, shades of silvery white ventrally, and covered by small scales.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; The [[pectoral fins]] begin slightly before the first [[dorsal fin]] and extend well beyond the front of the [[anal fin]], usually as far as the second dorsal finlet, often as long as 30% of the fish's total length. Like the fish's body, the fins are dark blue on top, but change to a medium yellow color on the underside. They are markedly shorter in fish under {{convert|0.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, often resulting in confusion with ''[[Thunnus obesus|T. obesus]]'' juveniles, which also have long pectoral fins, though these are rounded at the tips where the albacore's taper to a point.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; The first dorsal fin is a deep yellow and the second, which is smaller than the first, is a light yellow, as is the anal fin. It has 7-9 dorsal finlets and 7-8 anal finlets, dark blue and silvery white in color respectively, matching the part of the fish's body they are on. The [[caudal fin]] is also silvery white.&lt;ref name=wash&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/tuna/ |title=Fishing &amp; Shellfishing: Albacore Tuna |website=Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite book |last=Collette |first=Bruce B. |author2=Cornelia E.

It reaches sexual maturity at {{convert|0.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} and its common length is only slightly larger at {{convert|1.0|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; Males and females exhibit no [[sexual dimorphism]].&lt;ref name=ramon/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The albacore has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] in tropical and temperate waters across the globe and in every ocean as well as the Mediterranean Sea. A highly migratory species, schools of albacore travel great distances, though Atlantic and Pacific populations do not appear to mix.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; North Pacific albacore migrate to two regions of the Northeast Pacific: one off the northern part of [[Baja California]], Mexico, and the other off the coasts of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name=childers/&gt; Every summer, North Atlantic albacore head to the [[Bay of Biscay]] off of [[France]] and [[Spain]], but now arrive about 8 days earlier than they did 40 years ago.&lt;ref name=dufour&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dufour|first=Florence|author2=Haritz Arrizabalaga |author3=Xabier Irigoien |author4=Josu Santiago|title=Climate impacts on albacore and bluefin tunas migrations phenology and spatial distribution.|journal=Progress in Oceanography|date=July 2010|volume=86|issue=1/2|pages=283–290|doi=10.1016/j.pocean.2010.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=a8b9f830-3b2d-41ff-99a8-bb41b1559822%40sessionmgr15&amp;hid=17&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=51810422|title=EBSCOhost article|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its latitudinal range extends from [[59th parallel north|59°N]] to [[46th parallel south|46°S]]. Its temperature range is {{convert|10|-|25|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; Its depth range is {{convert|0|-|600|m|ft}} in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones. It is most often found in surface waters {{convert|15.6|-|19.4|C|F}} in temperature, though larger individuals can be found in deeper waters {{convert|13.5|-|25.2|C|F}}. It can survive at temperatures as low as {{convert|9.5|C|F}} for short periods of time. It favors areas where warm and cool water mix.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt;

There are 6 globally managed stocks of albacore worldwide, one in the North Pacific, one in the South Pacific, another in the Indian Ocean, two for the North and South Atlantic, and one in the Mediterranean Sea. Both Pacific stocks are stable, while both Atlantic stocks are likely overfished. The status of the Indian and Mediterranean stocks is less clear, but preliminary reports suggest that these are also declining.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
[[File:Hooked albacore tuna.jpg|thumb|Freshly Hooked Albacore Tuna]]
The albacore is a powerful, hard-hitting predator&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; that forms mixed schools with [[skipjack tuna]], [[yellowfin tuna]], and [[bluefin tuna]], sometimes around floating objects like [[sargassum]] weeds.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; Schools of albacore are highly migratory within bodies of water and segregated by maturity, with older fish tending to form more compact groups. Of those caught by humans, immature albacore have a 1:1 sex ratio while older albacore are mostly male. In the Atlantic Ocean, older fish are found in cooler waters. The opposite is true for the Pacific Ocean, where fish are found more abundantly along thermal discontinuities. Depth range also varies by location: Atlantic fish dive as deep as {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} where Pacific fish reach only {{convert|380|m|ft|abbr=on}} in depth.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; In the northeast Atlantic, feeding migrations to productive areas occur during the summer. Due to climate changes over the last 40 years, the timing and spatial distribution of the albacore have also changed.&lt;ref name=dufour/&gt;

Albacore show a broad range of behavioral differences by region. In [[Baja California]], albacore make frequent dives to depths exceeding {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} during the day and stay near the surface at night, while off the coast of Washington and Oregon they stay near the surface the entire day.&lt;ref name=childers&gt;{{cite journal |last=Childers |first=John |author2=Stephanie Snyder |author3=Suzanne Kohin |title=Migration and behavior of juvenile North Pacific albacore (''Thunnus alalunga'') |journal=Fisheries Oceanography |date=1 January 2011 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=157–173 |url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=23f372e8-52f0-4fe7-81b4-2676fbd5a155%40sessionmgr11&amp;hid=17&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=fe259a2b&amp;AN=WOS%3A000289259700001 |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albacore never really rest; their need for oxygen means they must always be on the move.&lt;ref name=dufour/&gt;

===Feeding===
Albacore tuna are pelagic predators - open-sea hunters. Their diets vary very little from season to season. Unlike other tuna that eat primarily fish, for example the [[bigeye tuna|bigeye]] and yellowfin tuna, the albacore's main source of food is [[cephalopod]]s. The most abundant cephalopod in its diet is ''[[Heteroteuthis dispar]]'', a tiny deep-water squid found in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Other food sources of the albacore include fish, crustaceans, and gelatinous organisms.&lt;ref name=bertrand/&gt; Not much is known about the food pattern of the albacore, however, mostly because it dives over 400 m underwater when searching for food, and tagging and tracking has been unsuccessful thus far.&lt;ref name=bertrand&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bertrand |first=A. |author2=Bard, F. |author3=Josse, E. |title= Tuna food habits related to the micronekton distribution in French Polynesia |journal=Marine Biology |volume=140 |issue=5 |pages=1023–1037 |doi=10.1007/s00227-001-0776-3 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-001-0776-3# |date=1 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Consoli |first=P.|author2=Romeo, T. |author3=Battaglia, P. |author4=Castriota, L. |author5=Esposito, V. |author6=Andaloro, F.|title=Feeding habits of the albacore tuna Thunnus alalunga (Perciformes, Scombridae) from central Mediterranean Sea |journal=Marine Biology |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=113–120 |doi=10.1007/s00227-008-1012-1 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-008-1012-1# |accessdate=21 October 2013 |date=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life history===
The albacore's reproduction is [[oviparous]] and a {{convert|20|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} female can produce between 2-3 million eggs per spawning,&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; which usually takes place between November and February.&lt;ref name=ramon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramon |first=D. |title=Spawning seasonality of albacore, ''Thunnus alalunga'', in the South Pacific Ocean |journal=Fishery Bulletin |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=724–733 |url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=8&amp;sid=2f419ba1-0fee-4148-8143-8e03c7d42179%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=109&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=fa6db032&amp;AN=15782000 |date=4 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eggs mature outside of the female's body and hatch in 1–2 days, after which [[fry (biology)|fry]] begin to grow quickly. For the first year of their lives, juveniles remain close to the place where they were hatched. They begin to migrate after their first year. Albacore have a lifespan of 11–12 years, but they reach reproductive maturity at around 5–6 years.&lt;ref name=thisfish&gt;[http://thisfish.info/fishery/species/albacore-tuna/ "Albacore Tuna"] This fish. ThisFish &amp; Ecotrust Canada 25 Oct 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large majority of albacore have larger right testes or ovaries, depending on sex. Albacore have asynchronous [[oocyte]] development, that is their immature egg cells do not develop at regular intervals. The creation of [[Ovum|ova]], known as [[oogenesis]], begins with the rapid production of [[oogonia]] (undifferentiated germ cells that give rise to oocytes) by mitotic separations in the oogonial nests of female tuna. The resulting oocytes are cast ''en masse'' into the sea, where full development and later fertilization take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Kurt |title=Reproductive biology of tunas |journal=Fish Physiology |year=2001 |volume=19 |pages=225–270 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546509801190072 |accessdate=21 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s1546-5098(01)19007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial fishing===
Albacore is a prized food, and the albacore [[fishery]] is economically significant. Methods of fishing include [[Angling|pole and line]], [[long-line fishing]], [[Troll (angling)|trolling]], and some [[Encircling net|purse seining]]. It is also sought after by [[Sport fishing|sport fishers]].

The harvest of albacore tuna for commercial use began at the start of the 20th century. The migratory patterns of the fish brought droves of albacore schools near the coastline of southern California, which sparked the start of commercial albacore fishing. In 1903, 700 cases of albacore were used as an experimental pack which ultimately led to the development of the U.S. tuna-canning industry. The experiment was a huge success, and the commercial fishery expanded rapidly due to the high level of demand for canned tuna. By the 1920s, the industry expanded further and three other species of tuna, bluefin, yellowfin, and skipjack, were also being canned. Albacore tuna is the only species that can be marketed as "white meat tuna". The canning industry uses this label as a way to differentiate canned albacore from other types of tuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Borks|first=Manfred|title=Pacific Juvenile Albacore in the Ensenada/San Diego Area History, Biology, Lures, Tactics and Night Fishing|edition=Rev 6 Final|date=June 2011|url=http://www.albacoretuna.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Pacific Islands|Pacific island]] countries and territories (PICTs) heavily rely on oceanic fisheries for economic development and food security. The albacore is one of the main four species of tuna that support oceanic fisheries along with the skipjack, yellowfin, and the bigeye tunas. Domestic tuna fleets and local fish processing operations contribute from 3-20% of the gross domestic product in four PICTs. License fees from foreign ships provide an average of 3-40% of government revenue for seven different PICTs. Processing facilities and tuna fishing vessels provide more than 12,000 jobs for workers in the Pacific islands. Fish provide 50-90% of dietary animal protein in rural areas of PICTs.&lt;ref name=bell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=J. D. |last2=Reid |first2=C. |last3=Batty |first3=M.

===Conservation===
Albacore are managed by four tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, (RFMO's) include the [[Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission]] (WCPFC), the [[Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission]] (IATTC), the [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]] (ICCAT), and the [[Indian Ocean Tuna Commission]] (IOTC).&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Robin |title=International management of tuna fisheries Arrangements, challenges and a way forward |journal=536  FAO FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE TECHNICAL PAPER |date=2010 |volume=536 |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/i1453e/i1453e00.pdf |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICCAT has established catch quotas in the North and South Atlantic. There is substantial uncertainty on current stock status, since different models and assumptions provide a wide range of estimates. However, most of them agreed on the view that spawning stock biomass decreased since the 1930s and started to recover since the mid-1990s. Most of the model formulations, as well as the base case, concluded that currently the stock is not undergoing [[overfishing]] but the spawning stock biomass is overfished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ALB|url=https://www.iccat.int/Documents/SCRS/ExecSum/ALB_EN.pdf|website=www.iccat.int|publisher=The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas|accessdate=March 5, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102309/https://www.iccat.int/Documents/SCRS/ExecSum/ALB_EN.pdf|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOTC judges albacore in the Indian Ocean are not overfished, but maintaining or increasing effort in the core albacore fishing grounds is likely to result in further declines in albacore biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ALBACORE|url=http://www.iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/science/species_summaries/english/Albacore.pdf|website=www.iotc.org|publisher=Indian Ocean Tuna Commission|accessdate=March 5, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091335/http://www.iotc.org/sites/default/files/documents/science/species_summaries/english/Albacore.pdf|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WCPFC has assessed the South Pacific Albacore are not over fished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STOCK ASSESSMENT OF ALBACORE TUNA IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN|url=http://www.wcpfc.int/system/files/SA-WP-04-Stock-Assessment-Albacore-Tuna-SPO-Rev-1.pdf|publisher=WCPFC|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014 assessment, the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in North Pacific Ocean (ISC), Albacore Working Group (ALBWG), found estimates of total stock biomass(age-1 and older)show a long term decline from the early 1970s to 1990 followed by a recovery through the 1990s and subsequent
fluctuations without trend in the 2000s.

All of the tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations noted that there is uncertainty surrounding the life history and biology of
Tunas and tuna like species including age and growth, maturity, and natural mortality rates; uncertainty about the quality and completeness of available data; and uncertainty about recruitment.

In the North Pacific, [[NOAA]] Fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC). Since the 1970s the SWFSC has collaborated with [[American Fishermen's Research Foundation]] (AFRF) in tagging studies of albacore. Through these studies we have learned that juvenile albacore (2 to years of age) make trans-Pacific migrations in their younger years between Japan and the West coast of North America. To date over 24,000 albacore have been tagged with conventional dart tags and 1,245 of these have been recovered. In Spring of 2001 AFRF and the SWFSC began a pilot project to learn more about the migration habits of North Pacific albacore, Thunnus alalunga in an effort to allow the incorporation of detailed migration movements into stock assessment models. Archival tags are a recent technical innovation that are being used to collect daily locations (through light level data recorded by the tag), internal temperature of the fish's abdomen, ambient water temperature, and depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Southwest Fisheries Science Center|title=Albacore Archival Tagging|url=https://swfsc.noaa.gov/textblock.aspx?Division=FRD&amp;id=1194|website=swfsc.noaa.gov|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Atministration|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of programs have been developed to help consumers identify and support responsible and [[sustainable fisheries]]. Perhaps the most widely accepted of these programs is that of the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC). Several albacore fisheries have been certified as sustainable according to MSC standards, including the U.S. North and South Pacific albacore [http://www.fao.org/fishery/fishtech/30/en pole and line] and [http://www.fao.org/fishery/fishtech/1015/en troll/jig] fisheries ("pole and troll"), Canadian North Pacific troll fishery, and the New Zealand South Pacific troll fishery.&lt;ref name=MSC&gt;{{cite web|author=Marine Stewardship Council|title=List of all certified fisheries|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/all-certified-fisheries|publisher=MSC.org|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SeaChoice]] ranks albacore as a "best choice" for consumers, although notes some "moderate concerns" regarding the management effectiveness (in particular, no definitive assessment of the albacore stock of the [[Indian Ocean]] fishery has taken place), and "moderate concern" over the fishing stock, especially regarding the North Atlantic albacore population, which the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) considers overfished with [[overfishing]] still occurring. The southern Atlantic stock is also considered (in 2007) overfished but not currently experiencing overfishing. North Pacific albacore stocks are not overfished and are not experiencing overfishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seachoice.org/profile/70/view|title=Tuna: Albacore|work=[[SeaChoice]]|accessdate=2007-02-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912080740/http://www.seachoice.org/profile/70/view|archivedate=2007-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Pacific albacore stocks have recently (2007 to 2015) shown a 40% reduction in stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-30/alarming-population-crash-in-southern-albacore/6900728 |title=Alarming population crash in southern albacore tuna prompts catch rethink |accessdate=2015-11-02 |website=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-22/pacific-nations-agree-to-bring-tuna-fishery-under-their-control/5834354 |title=Pacific nations agree to historic tuna fishery pact to protect local industries |accessdate=2015-11-02 |website=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercury levels===
{{main article|Mercury poisoning}}
{{See also|Mercury in fish}}
Like other fish, albacore accumulate [[methylmercury]] in body tissue over time. Methylmercury is removed from the human body naturally, but it may take over a year for the levels to drop significantly. Thus, it may remain in a woman from before she becomes pregnant. Ranging from as low as .027 ppm (parts per million) to .26 ppm, the average total mercury content of albacore is .14 ± .05 ppm. Larger fish tend to [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] higher methylmercury levels. For the most part, there is positive correlation between an albacore's methylmercury measurement and its weight and length.&lt;ref name="Morrissey 2008 41–52"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrissey|first=T., Michael|author2=Rasmussen, Rosalee|author3=Okada, Tomoko|title=Mercury Content in Pacific Troll-Caught Albacore Tuna (Thunnus alalunga)|journal=Journal of Aquatic Food Product Technology|volume=13|issue=4|pages=41–52|doi=10.1300/J030v13n04_04|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J030v13n04_04#.UmipKfmkoc4|accessdate=24 October 2013|date=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albacore caught by the American albacore fishing fleet off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California have far lower mercury levels than in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/docs/OSU_Mercury_Study.pdf|title=NOAA - FishWatch|work=noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albacore caught in this region also show methylmercury levels well below the 1.0 ppm mercury standard set by The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref name="Morrissey 2008 41–52"/&gt; Nevertheless, since mercury does take time to be removed from the body, albacore tuna should be eaten in moderation.

===Popular Culture=== 
In 2018 [[Netflix]] released the first season of Battlefish, a reality show centered around commercial hook and line Albacore fishermen in Washington and Oregon USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wija |first1=Tantri |title=Netflix’s ‘Battlefish’ follows the adventures of tuna fishing boats off the Washington-Oregon border |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/tv/netflixs-battlefish-follows-the-adventures-of-tuna-fishing-boats-off-the-washington-oregon-border/ |website=seattletimes.com |publisher=Seattle Times |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is produced by Pilgrim Media Group which also produces the [[Wicked Tuna]] reality show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Whittaker |first1=Luke |title=In ‘Battlefish,’ blood, guts and albacore |url=http://www.dailyastorian.com/Local_News/20180926/in-battlefish-blood-guts-and-albacore |website=dailyastorian.com |publisher=Daily Astorian |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ambush Bug: Year None''''' is a six-issue [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] written by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Robert Loren Fleming]], and illustrated by Keith Giffen and [[Al Milgrom]]. The first issue, "Hey, You Sank My Battle-Ax!", was published on July 23, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/comics/?cm=9679 |title=''Ambush Bug: Year None'' #1 (of 6) |accessdate=2008-08-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824201857/http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/comics/?cm=9679 |archivedate=24 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DC Comics announced that instead of releasing a sixth issue, the series would skip issue #6 and conclude with issue #7. ''Ambush Bug: Year None'' #7 was released on October 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="dccomics.com"&gt;[http://dccomics.com/dccomics/search/?q=ambush+bug&amp;x=0&amp;y=0] {{Dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The first issue, "Hey, You Sank My Battle-Ax!", revolves around [[Ambush Bug]] trying to solve the murder of Jonni DC, a female version of [[Johnny DC]]. Through the course of the story, Ambush Bug encounters such [[DC Comics]] characters as [[Yankee Poodle]], [[Chang Tzu|Egg Fu]], [[Ace the Bat-Hound]] and [['Mazing Man]]. Through the course of his investigation, he is pursued by his evil sock enemy, Argh!Yle! and his minions bent on Ambush Bug's destruction. Also pursuing him is "Go-Go Chex", a mysterious being whose face is completely covered with the [[checkerboard]] pattern that appeared at the top of DC comic covers during the 1960s; he constantly speaks in 1960s phrases and slang and refers to everyone around him as "Wonder Chick". Occasionally, the [[Source Wall]], as a sentient slab of concrete, appears vacationing across time and space in places where Ambush Bug passes.

The second issue makes fun of [[Zatanna]]'s [[mindwipe]] of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], Rama Kushna, [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]]s (who appear to take the places of all normal, background humans), Babe the Blue Ox from ''[[Jack of Fables]]'', the [[Space Ranger]], the [[Green Lantern Corps]], [[Zook (comics)|Zook]], [[Mister Nebula]] and [[Blue Beetle]]'s death. Go-Go Chex continues to pursue Ambush Bug. In the Mister Nebula segment, he briefly takes on the uniform of the Amber Butane Corps, a lampooning of the Green Lantern Corps that wields a sentient lighter instead of a ring.

In the third issue, Ambush Bug discovers that he and the Dumb Bunny (a member of the [[Inferior Five]]) got married in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] while he was drunk. He spends most of the issue running from one reality to another trying to find a way out of his marriage; along the way he encounters [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] (whom he asks to nullify his marriage in a spoof of the [[Marvel Comics]] storyline "[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]"), [[Darkseid]] (whom he goes to a karaoke bar with), [[Super-Turtle]] (who wreaks massive destruction, à la [[Superboy-Prime]]), Jerro the [[Merman|Merboy]], the [[Odd Man (comics)|Odd Man]] and Go-Go Chex and his assistant Saki Toomi ("Sock it to me").

The fourth issue starts by referencing a mistake made in issue #2, where one page was printed without its dialogue balloons. DC editor [[Dan DiDio]] takes responsibility for the mistake despite having nothing to do with it, a jab at the angry reaction from fans when [[Super Buddies#Fate of the Super Buddies|certain characters]] were changed or killed off without him having anything to do with it. Dan DiDio is crushed and killed by a falling Ambush Bug and Argh!Yle starts to believe that he and Ambush Bug are actually one and the same. The issue continues mostly without Ambush Bug for the first half, focusing on lesser characters Argh!Yle and Mitsu Bishi as a parody of the series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''. In trying to find Ambush Bug they feature the [[Dick Grayson#Robin, The Boy Wonder|Golden Age Robin]], [[Renee Montoya]] and most of the main characters from ''52''. Near the end, Ambush Bug chats with Argh!Yle on [[Wonder Woman]]'s [[Invisible plane|invisible speaker phone]] and confirms that he is alive and is not Dan DiDio. He then gets kidnapped by the Ambush Bug Revenge Squad, who argue over obscure comic book quotations while Ambush Bug gets bored and escapes.

The final issue of the miniseries had been delayed for more than six months for undisclosed reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=3579 | title=And Then I Read: ''Ambush Bug: Year None'' 4-5 | date=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans have speculated that the delay was related to the departure of DC’s Senior Coordinating Editor Jann Jones from the company, as she was included in the story as a character. The final issue of the series was released on October 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="dccomics.com"/&gt;

The '''American Art Association''' was an art gallery and auction house with sales galleries, established in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-art-association-records-6973 |title=American Art Association Records |publisher=Archives of American Art |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first located at 6 East 23rd Street (South Madison Square) in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] and moved to Madison Ave and 56th St. in 1922. It was the first auction house in the U.S. and had a strong presence in New York during the period of American history known as the [[Gilded Age]], hosting some of the cities major art exhibitions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1557506/art-market/282952/France#toc282953 |title=Art market |publisher=Britannia |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The galleries and auctions were devoted to paintings by American artists and also had an Oriental Art Department. The aim of the association was to promote American art through a highly visible, cosmopolitan auction venue.&lt;ref&gt;Bolas, Gerald D. ''The Early Years of the American Art Association.'' 1998. Masters thesis published by University of Michigan. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The American Art Association (AAA) was founded by [[James F. Sutton]] (President of AAA), [[R. Austin Robertson]], and [[Thomas Ellis Kirby|Thomas Kirby]] (1846–1924) in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frick.org/sites/default/files/FindingAids/AmericanArtAssociation.html |title=American Art Association Records |publisher=Frick.org |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Kirby had grown up in Philadelphia and moved his family to New York in 1876, in the years prior to starting the AAA, he worked at various auction firms and importers in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedmaster00amer  |title=Illustrated Catalogue of Master Works |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, Sutton proposed a partnership that would result in the formation of the American Art Association.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Thomas E. "Autobiography." American Art Association Papers. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

During AAA's operation, Sutton, Kirby, Robertson and their staff supervised the sales of hundreds of collections and works of art. R. Austin Robertson traveled to China and Japan to make selections for the Oriental Department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/sites/default/files/FindingAids/AmericanArtAssociation.html MS 15, Series I, Box 6. 6/6]&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, AAA exhibited [[Thomas B. Clarke]]'s collection of American paintings that was a benefit for the National Academy of Design.&lt;ref&gt;Bolas, Gerald D. ''The Early Years of the American Art Association.'' 1998. Masters thesis published by University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; The AAA held its first auction in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-art-association-records-6973&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, after Kirby retired, [[Cortlandt F. Bishop]] (1870–1935), a pioneer aviator and book collector, purchased the American Art Association from Kirby.&lt;ref name="Lehmann‐Haupt1970"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lehmann‐Haupt|first1=Christopher|title=Books of The Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/26/archives/books-of-the-times.html?_r=0|accessdate=4 May 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 October 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Aid for the American Art Association Records, 1877-1924 MS.15|url=https://www.frick.org/sites/default/files/FindingAids/AmericanArtAssociation.html|website=www.frick.org|publisher=[[Frick Collection]]|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abebooks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Early American Furniture and Decorations, Property of Morris Berry, Plainville, Conn.

The '''Annals of Ulster''' ({{lang-ga|'''Annála Uladh'''}}) are [[annals]] of [[History of Ireland|medieval Ireland]]. The entries span the years from [[A.D.]] 431 to A.D. 1540. The entries up to A.D. 1489 were compiled in the late [[15th century]] by the scribe [[Ruaidhrí Ó Luinín]], under his patron [[Cathal Óg Mac Maghnusa]] on the island of Belle Isle on [[Lough Erne]] in the kingdom of [[Fermanagh]]. Later entries (up to A.D. 1540) were added by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=John T., ed.|title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Vol. 1|date=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-1851094400|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=annals+of+ulster+1540&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH4cX46YzWAhUpllQKHYlhAVsQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=annals%20of%20ulster%201540&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entries up to the mid-[[6th Century]] are retrospective, drawing on earlier annalistic and historical texts, while later entries were contemporary, based on recollection and oral history.{{sfnp|Flechner|2013|pp=422&amp;nbsp;ff}} [[Thomas Charles-Edwards|T.M. Charles-Edwards]] has claimed that the main source for its records of the first millennium A.D. is a now lost [[Armagh]] continuation of the [[Chronicle of Ireland]].

The Annals used the [[Irish language]], with some entries in [[Latin]]. Because the Annals copied its sources verbatim, they are useful not just for historians, but also for [[Linguistics|linguists]] studying the evolution of the Irish language.

A century later, the Annals of Ulster became an important source for the authors of the [[Annals of the Four Masters]]. It also informs the Irish text ''[[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib]]''.

The [[Trinity College Library|Library of Trinity College Dublin]] possesses the original manuscript; the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]] has a contemporary copy that fills some of the gaps in the original. There are two main modern English translations of the annals&amp;nbsp;– Mac Airt and Mac Niocaill (1983) and MacCarthy (1893).

==Content==

===Kings===

Several kings are mentioned throughout the Annals of Ulster.  The Annals tend to follow the lives of the kings, including important battles, raids, and their ultimate death.  Between the years of 847 and 879, three different kings are highlighted.  For example:
[[Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid]], the king of the southern Ui Neill clan from 846–862:
*839.6 – First mentioned in the Annals of Ulster having killed Crunnmael son of Fiannamail.
*841.2 – Kills [[Diarmait]]
*843.1 – Mael Sechnaill's father, Mael Ruanaid, dies
*845.7 – Kills his brother Flann
*845.8 – Takes [[Tuirgéis]] prisoner
*846.7 – Suffers heavy losses at hands of [[Tigernach mac Fócartai|Tigernach]]
*847.2 – Begins his reign.
*847.3 – Destroys the Island of [[Loch Muinremor]]
*848.4 – defeats Vikings at [[Forach]]
*849.12 – conducts siege in Crupat
*850.3 – Cinaed, king of Cianacht, with help from foreign forces rebels against Mael Sechnaill
*851.2 – kills Cinaed, king of Cianacht
*851.5 – attends conference in [[Ard Macha]]
*854.2 – took hostages from Mumu at [[Inneóin na nDéise]]
*856.2 – took hostages from Mumu at Caisel
*856.3 – battle against the Vikings
*858.4 – marched against Mumu, took hostages from them and travelled with them "from Belat Gabráin to Inis Tarbnai off the Irish coast, and from Dún Cermna to Ára Airthir."
*859.3 – attends conference at [[Ráith Aeda Meic Bric]] "to make peace and amity between the men of Ireland"
*860.1 – leads army into the north, attacked, but hold position
*862.5 – Dies and is described as "king of all Ireland"&lt;ref name="ucc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001A/|title=The Annals of Ulster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same pattern is followed for Aed mac Neill, the king of the northern Ui Neill clan.  Aed mac Neill appears in the following entries in the Annals of Ulster: 855.3, 856.5, 860.1, 861.1, 862.2, 862.3, 863.2, 864.1, 864.3, 866.4, 868.4, 870.2, 874.4, and finally 879.1

The final entry ends with the entry about his death and includes a poem.  It reads “Aed son of Niall, king of Temair, fell asleep on the twelfth of the Kalends of 20 December Nov at Druim Inasclainn in the territory of Conaille.

1.	(Twelve days before the melodious Kalends 
&lt;br /&gt;
Of December—a harsh company— 
&lt;br /&gt;
A wonderful person died to your loss(?), 
&lt;br /&gt;
Aed of Ailech, over-king of the Irish. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2.	A generous prudent man of shields 
&lt;br /&gt;
Who brought plenty to landed Temair, 
&lt;br /&gt;
Against iron-tipped spears a buckler 
&lt;br /&gt;
From the forge-fire of the land of the sons of Mil.)”&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt;

Just as with the Irish kings, the Annals of Ulster follow the lives of the Viking kings of Dublin.  For example, [[Amlaíb Conung]] (Olaf Konung) is mentioned in the following entries: 853.2, 857.1, 859.2, 863.4, 864.2, 866.1, 867.8, 869.6, 870.6, 871.2, and 875.4

The final entry deviates from the Irish kings and instead tells of the death of  Amlaib’s son, [[Oistin mac Amlaíb|Oistín]] and reads: “Oistín son of Amlaíb, king of the Norsemen, was deceitfully killed by Albann.”&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt;

===Places===

Along with kings and kingdoms, the entries in the Annals of Ulster focus on important places of Ireland such as Armagh, the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland which appears several times throughout the text.  Dublin for example, referred to in the text as either [[Áth Cliath]] or Duiblinn, is described in the Annals of Ulster with entries ranging from the settlement of Dublin by Vikings ("The heathens still at Duiblinn" in 842.2 and "An encampment of the foreigners of Áth Cliath at Cluain Andobuir" in 845.12) to deaths of notable names ("Carlus son of Conn son of Donnchad was killed in Áth Cliath" in 960.2) to Dublin being ruled by the Irish ("The foreigners returned to Áth Cliath and gave hostages to Brian" in 1000.4).&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt;

The town appears 66 different times in the Annals of Ulster and can be found in the following entries:
770.1, 790.2, 841.4, 842.2, 842.7, 845.12, 851.3, 870.2, 871.2 893.4, 895.6, 902.2, 917.4, 919.3, 920.5, 921.5, 921.8, 924.3, 926.6, 927.3, 930.1, 936.2, 938.5, 938.6, 939.1, 942.3, 942.7, 944.3, 945.6, 946.1, 947.1, 950.7, 951.3, 951.7, 956.3, 960.2, 961.1, 978.3, 980.1, 994.6, 995.2, 999.8, 1000.4, 1013.12, 1013.13, 1014.2, 1018.2, 1021.1, 1022.4, 1031.2, 1035.5, 1070.2, 1075.1, 1075.4, 1084.8, 1088.4, 1094.2, 1095.4, 1100.5, 1103.5, 1105.3, 1115.4, 1118.6, 1121.7, 1126.7, and 1128.6&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt;

== Historical context ==

===Vikings in Ireland===

The Annals of Ulster contain a large amount of historical information on the invasions of the [[Vikings]] into Ireland and several specific events are mentioned that are paralleled in other Irish works such as the [[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib]]. The Annals of Ulster documents the Viking invasions one year after the common starting event of the Viking Period, the raiding of [[Lindisfarne#Vikings|Lindisfarne]] in 793, as mentioned by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. The first mentioning of the Vikings is very brief. "794.7 Devastation of all the islands of Britain by heathens,”&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt; yet over the course of the annals their attacks become more specific "807.8 The heathens burned Inis Muiredaig and invade Ros Comáin."&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt;

The Vikings are called several different names throughout the annals: foreigners, dark or fair-foreigners, heathens, Norsemen, Norse-Irish and Danes. It is often unclear if these titles attribute nationalities or certain alliances as they are used intermixed throughout.

The annals mention the foreigners’ beginnings in Ireland as one of plunder and slave taking. According to the annals, the Norsemen took many slaves in their raids. "821.3 Étar was plundered by the heathens, and they carried off a great number of women into captivity."&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt; However, eventually they establish a permanent base in Áth Cliath or Dublin by 841. In "841.4 There was a naval camp at Linn Duachaill from which the peoples and churches of Tethba were plundered. There was a naval camp at Duiblinn from which the Laigin and the Uí Néill were plundered, both states and churches, as far as Sliab Bladma."&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt;

Although the Vikings are portrayed as heathens, the Annals describes strife between the Irish against each other and often the foreigners are depicted as allies to various Irish factions. The depiction of warfare involving the "heathens" is not one-sided; in the annals they are often allied with the Irish against other Irish. Some Irishmen are even accused of doing the same sort of raiding as the Viking invaders. In "847.3 Mael Sechnaill destroyed the Island of Loch Muinremor, overcoming there a large band of wicked men of Luigni and Gailenga, who had been plundering the territories in the manner of the heathens."&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt;

Several famous battles and characters involving the Vikings can be found within the Annals of Ulster. The [[Battle of Brunanburh]] 937.6,&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt; the [[Battle of Tara (Ireland)|Battle of Tara]] 980.1,&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt; and the [[Battle of Clontarf]] 1014.1&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt; are all described in brief detail. Some Viking individuals of note mentioned in the annals with parallels in other historical sources are the foreign chieftain [[Turgeis]], beginning in 845,&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt; Ímar and Amlaíb, the later progenitors of the [[Uí Ímair]],&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt; rulers of Áth Cliath or [[Dublin]]. Irish historical figures included within the text are [[Máel Sechnaill]],&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt; [[Muirchertach]]&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt; son of Niall and [[Brian Boru]].&lt;ref name="ucc" /&gt;

The '''''Annals of the Cakchiquels''''' (in {{lang-es|'''Anales de los Cakchiqueles'''}}, also known by the alternative Spanish titles, '''''Anales de los Xahil''''', '''''Memorial de Tecpán-Atitlán''''' or '''''Memorial de Sololá''''') is a [[manuscript]] written in [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]] by [[Francisco Hernández Arana Xajilá]] in 1571, and completed by his grandson, Francisco Rojas, in 1604.&lt;ref name="Brinton"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brinton, Daniel G. | authorlink=Daniel Garrison Brinton|translator =  Daniel Brinton| title = The Annals of the Cakchiquels | origyear = 1885 |date=2007 |pages=54–55, 59 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20775/20775-h/20775-h.htm |place=Philadelphia |language=Kaqchikel, en | publisher = Project Gutenberg, 2007 }}

The manuscript, initially kept by the Xahil [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] in the town of [[Sololá]] in Guatemala, was later discovered in the archives of the ''San Francisco de Guatemala'' convent in 1844. It was subsequently translated by the abbot [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] in 1855 (the same translator of the [[Rabinal Achí]]), and then passed through several more hands before being published in an English translation by [[Daniel G. Brinton]] in 1885.&lt;ref name="Brinton" /&gt;&lt;!-- Hernández, one of the authors of the manuscript, was the grandson of a noble from [[Iximché]]. --&gt;

The mythical and legendary part of the manuscript, which must have been orally preserved for centuries, was finally collected and preserved by members of the Xahil ''tinamit'' or lineage. The historical narrative continues with the exploits of kings and warriors and their various conquests, the founding of villages, and the succession of rulers up to the time of the Spanish Conquest.

Like the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the ''Annals'' also identifies the almost legendary Tulan as the place from which they all set out, at least at one point in their various migrations. The texts differs from the other sources, such as the ''[[Historia de los Xpantzay de Tecpán Guatemala]]'' and  ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'', but mainly from the ''Popol Vuh'', in that it relates that the Kaqchikel ancestors came to Tulan, ''ch'aqa palow''  "across the sea", from ''r(i) uqajib'al q'ij'', "where the sun descends, the west." The Kaqchikel narrative is quite gloomy, describing the forefather's departure from Tulan accompanied by a negative omen and the presaging of death and dismay. It also refers to the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche' rulers]] forcing the King Q'uicab the Great to leave ''Chaiviar'' ([[Chichicastenango]]), and migrate to the ''Ratzamut Mountains'' to found Iximché, which remained the new Kaqchikel capital until the arrival of the ''[[conquistador]]es''. The Kaqchikel document continues with an account of their journeys and the places through which they passed along the way, ending with a sober, factual account of the Conquest. This is the native story of the Conquest of [[Guatemala]] from the point of view of the vanquished.&lt;!--including a reference to the Kaqchikel king ''Belejep-Qat'', ending its days looking for gold in the rivers.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12274">'''Annual publications''', more often called simply '''annuals''', are [[periodical publication]]s appearing regularly once per [[year]].&lt;ref name="enclib"&gt;"Annuals", in ''[[Encyclopedia of library and information science]]'' (1968), vol. 1, pp. 434–447.&lt;/ref&gt; Although exact definitions may vary, types of annuals include: [[Calendar]]s and [[almanac]]s, [[Trade directory|directories]], [[yearbook]]s, [[annual report]]s, [[proceedings]] and transactions, and [[literary annual]]s.&lt;ref name="enclib"/&gt; A weekly or monthly publication may produce an ''Annual'' featuring similar materials to the regular publication. Some [[encyclopedia]]s have published annual [[supplement (publishing)|supplement]]s that essentially summarize the news of the past year, similar to some newspaper [[yearbook]]s.

To libraries and collectors, annuals present challenges of size (tens or hundreds of volumes) and completeness (acquiring a sequence with no missing volumes). They are handled similar to serial publications, which typically means a single library catalog record for the title, not for individual years. The single record must then indicate which volumes (years) are held.

The mid and late 20th century saw a sharp increase in the publication of annuals, to report scientific results and provide overview, both in ever more specialized topics and in popular summary.&lt;ref name="enclib"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Literary annual}}
[[File:Ada Lovelace 1838.jpg|thumb|right|A hand watercolored etching etched by [[William Henry Mote]]]]
A new form of literary work called the "Annual" was a fad from about 1823 through 1857, and became so popular, that they were soon published up to 17 times a year. British royalty increased their popularity. They closely resemble many college literary "books" just produced for college campus today, except they contained lots of etchings of beautiful women from steel plates. They were the fashion magazines of the day. Later it became fashionable to watercolor the etchings, and the "Annuals" became early coloring books. There was later a backlash against "beauty", and the fad ended, as did steel plate etchings for books.

"The Annual" was a long running fad from 1824 until 1857 which started in England, but spilled over into the USA. Steel plates of the 1820s allowed book publishers to mass-produce pictures. What started out as an "annual book" or a gift for the holidays, turned into something that had up to 17 editions through the year (yet were still called Annuals). Countess Blessington and other royal women contributed to the works, and altered fashion. This fad was sometimes referred to as "beauty", as books with plates of women defined the content.

[[File:Forget Me Not 1823 Boards.jpg|thumb|right|An early annual from 1822/3]]
In one book, the steel plate was damaged and another picture of a woman was simply used as a replacement. The illustrations had often nothing to do with the text content. The content of the text was often of poor quality, and "The American Book of Beauty" contained a story of prison torture with an illustration of a pretty woman with a lapdog. The "American Book of Beauty", also has several copies of the books, with portraits in different orders. One edition of the "Heath's Book of Beauty" was a college project, and contained poems, short stories, etc. 1826 was not a good year for the annuals, because of the [[Panic of 1825]]. In the 1830s you see a sarcastic poem about the Annuals by Thomas Hood (The Battle of the Annuals). Watercolor became popular in the 1830s, and the black and white etchings were the coloring books of the day. In 1842, Volume 1, page 521 of the ''Illustrated London News'' there are sarcastic pictures poking fun at the annuals. In 1844 there was an article referring to it as ''imbecilic mania'', and finally the Obituary for the Annual, appeared in the Art Journal of 1857. The death of the annuals and new photo techniques replacing etching ended most engraver's careers.&lt;ref&gt;Engraved On Steel, Ashgate, Basil Hunnisett, {{ISBN|0-87923-322-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steel Engraved Book Illustration in England, Ashgate, Basil Hunnisett, {{ISBN|0-85967-971-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=49osAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=American%20Book%20of%20Beauty&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Noted Women by Mary Cowden Clarke, published 1858.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gems of Beauty 1840, Publisher: Longman, Rees, Orme, Green, Brown, &amp; Longman, Editor: Countess of Blessington&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yearbooks==
:''For high school and college yearbooks, see [[Yearbook]].''
A yearbook is a volume that summarizes events of the past year.&lt;ref name="enclib"/&gt; One of the earliest is ''[[The Annual Register]]'', published in London since 1758. A forerunner is [[Abel Boyer]]'s ''The Political State of Great Britain'' (38 volumes, 1711–29). Later examples include ''[[The Statesman's Yearbook]]'' (since 1864) and the ''[[Daily Mail Year Book]]'' (since 1901). Two early German titles are ''Europäischer Geschichtskalender'', founded in 1861 by [[Heinrich Schulthess]] and [[Gottlob Egelhaaf]]’s ''Historisch-politische Jahresübersicht'' (28 volumes, 1908–1936).

==Comic books==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Savage Dragon: Sex &amp; Violence]] --&gt;
In the case of comic books, an annual is considered a separate series for purposes of numbering and collectibility;  a particular periodical's ''Annual'' will thus have its own numbering series, or alternately be referred to by the year of its publication (such as ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] '99 Annual'').  A [[comic book]] annual customarily has a larger page count than its monthly counterpart, leaving room for longer single stories, multiple stories in a single annual, and/or "extra" material that the monthly series lacks the space to publish.  These "extras" may include biographical information on featured characters, full-page [[pin-up girl#Other kinds of pin-ups|pin-ups]] of characters, reprints of previously published material, or all-new short stories (often called "back-up" stories).  An annual as a whole was once considered an "extra" in itself, providing story material in addition to the customary twelve issues per year of a monthly series.

Comic book annuals originally were little more than reprint albums, representing stories that had first seen publication in its monthly counterpart, but eventually this changed to annuals featuring primarily all-new material.  Later annuals often featured stories with greater import to the characters featured than in the monthly publication, reflecting the "special" status of their once-yearly publication.  Annuals also on occasion featured the finale of a multi-issue storyline running in the monthly series; conversely, many annuals would showcase [[Stand-alone sequel|stand-alone]] stories that did not fit in with the then-current thrust of the monthly series' storyline.

In the late 1980s and much of the 1990s, annuals published by [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]] were usually released in the summer of the year, and often had a unifying theme, either a similar theme that individual stories were written around, or a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline bringing many of the characters in the individual publishers' [[continuity (fiction)|continuities]] together for a single overall event. In the case of the "crossover" annuals, the number of characters and annuals involved in a crossover story varied. Some were company-wide, incorporating virtually every character in the publisher's [[shared universe]] whose series received an annual edition. Others used smaller groups of characters whose series had some sort of in-story connection, such as series featuring members of teams or "extended families" of characters.

Annuals published by DC and particularly Marvel became fewer and far between in the late 1990s, mainly due to the near-collapse of the comic book industry in the wake of [[Comic book collecting#The speculator boom|the speculator boom]]; annuals were seen as an unnecessary risk in a climate where many monthly publications were in danger of cancellation for lack of sales (especially at Marvel, which filed for [[bankruptcy]] during this time).  When the industry began to recover from the "bust", annuals began re-appearing on occasion, but by no means as regularly as before the "bust", when numbered series of annuals had reached the teens or twenties, indicating over a decade of regular publication.

Currently, the comic book annual is still something of a rarity, its purpose in presenting "extra" material often served by ''Special'' editions that are released at random intervals (usually to fill a gap in a publisher's production schedule) rather than the set yearly schedule of an annual.  In addition, Marvel Comics in particular has adopted a publishing schedule in which thirteen or fourteen issues of an ongoing series will be published within a year, rather than one issue for every month of the year; the material provided in the additional issues per year in effect replaces the material that would see print in an annual.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a large number of annuals are published shortly before the end of each year by companies such as [[D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd|D.C. Thomson]], [[Egmont (media group)|Egmont]] (formerly IPC/[[Fleetway]]), and [[Rebellion Developments]], aimed at the Christmas market. These annuals are generally large-sized hardcover books with over 100 pages and a high colour content. They are normally cover-dated with the following year's date, to ensure that stockists do not remove them from their shelves immediately after the new year.

One of the earliest annuals was issued in 1822. [[Frederic Shoberl]] was the founding editor of [[Rudolf Ackermann|Ackermann]]{{'}}s ‘'[[Forget-Me-Not (annual)|The Forget-me-not]]'’ which was an early ''Annual'', a new type of publication in England.&lt;ref name=hogg&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ddd_pwfFcIAC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=%22forget+me+not%22+annual+ackermann&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ili8oBvLKn&amp;sig=mYAiBdN2Msn0BymRUPUDVUvTGT0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hzgFTLezCc-R4gahkvjLDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22forget%20me%20not%22%20annual%20ackermann&amp;f=false Contributions to annuals and gift-books], James Hogg, Janette Currie, Gillian Hughes, p.xiv, 2006, accessed June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Shoberl continued to edit the annual until 1834. A junior annual ''[[Forget-Me-Not (magazine)|The juvenile Forget-me-not]]'' was published from 1828.

For many years until the near-collapse of the British children's comics market, an annual would be published each year for each of the comic titles published by Thomson and IPC/Fleetway, featuring extra adventures of the comic's current and former characters plus additional material in the form of puzzles, text articles, etc. Annuals were often even published for comics which had themselves ceased publication or been absorbed into other titles, for example ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher]]'' annuals were still being published ten years after the comic itself had been absorbed into ''[[Tiger (comic)|Tiger]]''. Today, this section of the market has been reduced to just a couple of surviving titles.

In addition, annuals are often published centred on sports, toys, currently-popular celebrities, recently released films, and popular TV series.  British annuals are also published featuring American characters such as [[Spider-Man]], often with simplified content aimed at younger readers. As tastes in these areas change, so does the line-up of annuals released each year.  The increasing emphasis in recent years on annuals of this type (as opposed to the "classic" line-up of annuals based on comics) means that sales remain strong, and in fact doubled between 1998 and 2005&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/11/nclaus11.xml Daily Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some annuals have become extremely collectible, especially [[The Beano]], [[The Dandy]], [[Rupert Bear|Rupert]] and [[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Breaking the Code''''' is a 1986 play by [[Hugh Whitemore]] about British [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[Alan Turing]], who was a key player in the breaking of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Enigma code]] at [[Bletchley Park]] during [[World War II]] and a pioneer of computer science. The play thematically links Turing's [[cryptographic]] activities with his attempts to grapple with his [[homosexuality]].

It was adapted as a 1996 [[Breaking the Code (TV movie)|television film]] directed by [[Herbert Wise]], with [[Derek Jacobi]] reprising his stage role as Turing.

==Characters==
* [[Alan Turing]]
* Mick Ross, detective
* Christopher Morcom, Turing's childhood friend (1911&amp;ndash;1930)
* Sara Turing, Turing's mother (1881&amp;ndash;1976)
* Ron Miller, a young man having an affair with Turing (based on Arnold Murray)&lt;ref&gt;The name ''Ronald Miller'' was used by Alan Turing himself in a fragmentary autobiographical short story dated 1954 ([http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/A/13 AMT/A/13 in the Digital Turing Archive]).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dillwyn Knox]], manager at [[Bletchley Park]] recruiting Turing for government service
* Patricia "Pat" Green, a co-worker of Turing's at Bletchley (based on [[Joan Clarke]]; 1917&amp;ndash;1996)

==Performance history==
Following an eight-month run at the [[Theatre Royal, Haymarket]] in [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]] beginning on 21 October 1986, the play ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[New York City]] from 15 November 1987, to 10 April 1988, in both cases starring [[Derek Jacobi]]. The Broadway production also featured [[Jenny Agutter]] in the role of Pat Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Jenny Agutter website | url=http://www.jennyagutter.net/biography.html | accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William A. Henry III, writing in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, described the play as "elegant and poignant".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Henry III|first=William A. |title=Ingenuousness And Genius: Breaking The Code| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966030,00.html| magazine=Time | date= 23 November 1987 |accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadway production was nominated for three [[Tony Award]]s including Best Actor in a Play, Best Featured Actor in a Play, and Best Direction of a Play, and for two [[Drama Desk]] awards, for Best Actor and Best Featured Actor. Following Jacobi's departure, the London production transferred to the [[Comedy Theatre]] with [[John Castle]] as Turing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/realm/mine2/johncastle/Breaking_the_Code.html Breaking the Code on John Castle Fansite]&lt;/ref&gt;

The national première for Italy of the play was translated and directed by [[Luca Giberti]] at the [[Teatro di Genova|Stabile]] Theatre in [[Genoa]], featuring [[Jurij Ferrini]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentelocale.it/16466-jurij-e-tornato-e-anche-luca-giberti/ Interview to director and cast of Italian edition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Festival della Scienza programme entry |url=http://www.festivalscienza.it/it/programma/evento.php?id=172 |accessdate=2012-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519012746/http://www.festivalscienza.it/it/programma/evento.php?id=172 |archivedate=19 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Alan Turing Year|Turing Centenary]] 2012, there were two productions of the play in Germany, at the [[:de:The English Theatre Frankfurt|English Theatre Frankfurt]] and an amateur tour through Germany and the Netherlands by the [[University Players Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;

The play was also staged just before the start of the Alan Turing Year celebrations, in December 2011, at the [[:en:Old Fire Station|Old Fire Station]] in Oxford, by Oxford Theatre Guild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordtheatreguild.com/pages/productions/BTC_2011/about_btc.html "Breaking the Code on Oxford Theatre Guild's Website."] Retrieved on 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was produced at The [[Royal Exchange Theatre]] in 2016, the first major revival of the play in thirty years, with [[Daniel Rigby]] in the role of Alan Turing&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/breaking-the-code&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
{{main|Breaking the Code (TV movie)}}
The play was adapted for television in a 1996 [[BBC]] filmed production, directed by [[Herbert Wise]], and also starring Jacobi, which won a [[Broadcasting Press Guild]] Award and was nominated for two [[BAFTA]] TV awards, for best single drama and best actor, and for a [[GLAAD]] Media Award. It was broadcast in the United States by [[PBS]] on ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]''. A producer's cut was released on DVD in 2012.

'''''Cassell's National Library''''' was a series issued by [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell, Petter, Galpin &amp; Co.]] in London consisting of edited versions of [[English literature]]. The series was edited by [[Henry Morley]], and between 1886 and 1890 it issued 209 weekly volumes.  These were sold for 3d (paperback) or 6d (hardback).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.booksandwriters.co.uk/C/cassell--co-ltd.html List of published books]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18933">The '''Center for Folklife &amp; Cultural Heritage''' (CFCH) is one of three cultural centers within the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/CulturalPrograms |title=Smithsonian Cultural Centers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its motto is "culture of, by, and for the people", and it is a steward and ambassador to cultures around the world. It does this by encouraging understanding and [[Cultural Sustainability|cultural sustainability]] through research, education, and community engagement. The CFCH differs in important aspects from the more conventional museums within the Smithsonian complex. It contains (numerically) the largest collection in the Smithsonian, but is not fully open to the public.&lt;ref group=note&gt;It is open to guest researchers and other visitors by appointment.&lt;/ref&gt; Its budget comes primarily from grants, trust monies, federal appropriations, and gifts, with only a small percentage coming out the main Smithsonian budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folklife.si.edu/mission-and-history/cfch-strategic-plan/smithsonian |title=CFCH Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center is composed of three distinct units. The [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] is planned and implemented annually by the Festival staff at the Folklife center. The Smithsonian [[Folkways Records|Folkways Record label]] comprises a second team working at the center; they produce this non-profit music label with the goal of promoting and supporting the cultural diversity of sound. The third team at CFCH manages and curates the [[Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections]]. While the archive, filled with paper documentation and other memorabilia, is traditionally considered to be museum material, the other two sections exemplify more accurately the direction CFCH is headed, with a "shift from reified and ossified discourses of 'preservation' to more dynamic and ecological models of sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/cultural-sustainability-research-group/smithsonian|title=CFCH Cultural Sustainability Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of collecting and curating objects (items, stuff), both the Festival and the Folkways units at CFCH collect, research, and produce experiences.

The compound name, '''Center for Folklife &amp; Cultural Heritage''', epitomizes an ongoing transition within the field of [[cultural studies]]. In [[concatenated]] form, it documents the shift from '''folklore''' to '''cultural heritage''' that has taken place in academics and in fieldwork within the last 15 years.

The CFCH is just one of several federal institutions to have related mandates. The [[American Folklife Center]], just down the street at the Library of Congress, limits its scope to American Folklife in contrast to the international scope of the CFCH. The [[National Endowment for the Arts]], also headquartered in Washington, D.C., offers support and funding to both new and established art media. As such, it overlaps with topical arts programs brought to the National Mall each summer during the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. The [[National Park Service]] has as one of its objectives the preservation of historic sites, partnering with CFCH in their concerns for the cultural sustainability of both [[Cultural heritage|tangible and natural cultural resources]].

== Terminology ==
A plethora of newly minted compound concepts have been introduced into the vocabulary and discussion of [[:Category:Culture|culture]] since the turn of the century. The topics and research areas that had been labeled as ''folklore'' and ''folklife'' are increasingly rebranded as topics within the purview of [[cultural studies]]. It is this contemporary shift that the CFCH bridges in its compound title of '''Folklife &amp; Cultural Heritage'''.

This linguistic shift can be documented more precisely in the language of the [[UNESCO]] treaties. At a meeting in 1989, they published a '''Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore'''. This paper defines the field as folklore and uses that term throughout its paper.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Folklore (or traditional and popular culture) is the totality of tradition-based creations of a cultural community, expressed by a group or individuals and recognized as reflecting the expectations of a community in so far as they reflect its cultural and social identity; its standards and values are transmitted orally, by imitation or by other means. Its forms are, among others, language, literature, music, dance, games, mythology, rituals, customs, handicrafts, architecture and other arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13141&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO Recommendation 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 2003, the follow-up treaty was entitled the [[Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]]. Once again the subject matter was defined:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intangible Cultural Heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, and skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the space of 15 years on the international playing field '''folklore''' has been rebranded as '''cultural heritage'''. It is this dramatic shift that CFCH bridges in its compound title of '''Folklife &amp; Cultural Heritage'''.

== History ==

This eclectic collection of artifacts and activities came together at the '''Center for Folklife &amp; Cultural Heritage''' through a series of fortuitous and unplanned events. It began with the first [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival|Festival of American Folklife]] in 1967.

In 1964 the new Smithsonian secretary, [[S. Dillon Ripley]], arrived in Washington with an innovative museum concept; he challenged curators to "take the objects out of their cases and make them sing".  To facilitate this, Sec. Ripley appointed James R. Morris as the Smithsonian's first Director of Museum Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/legacy-honorees/james-r-morris/smithsonian |title=Smithsonian Legacy Honoree Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Morris had no professional museum experience. Nevertheless, he proposed to stage an outdoor festival on the [[National Mall]] during the summer, building on his previous career as both performer and manager in the music industry. Using the (by then) well established [[National Folk Festival (United States)|National Folk Festival]] as a model, he wanted to exhibit and celebrate different folk traditions from across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianimpresario.com/resources/Smithsonian_Impresario_Press_Kit.pdf|title=Smithsonian Impresario}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was non-standard for the Smithsonian, and guaranteed to provoke curators well-established inside their elegant, ordered museum buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2016/11/15/remembering-first-smithsonian-folklife-festival|title=First Smithsonian Folklife Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once approved by Ripley, Morris hired [[Ralph Rinzler]] to help him produce this festival for the upcoming summer 1967. Rinzler had previously worked at the Newport Folk Festival, and brought with him both the know-how and connections needed to pull together a new DC folk festival. The first '''Festival of American Folklife''', with a budget of $4,900 and showcasing eighty-four participants, took place over the Fourth of July weekend 1967 on the National Mall and on the plaza of the Museum of History and Technology. By the time of the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial Celebration]] 10 years later, the DC Folklife Festival had been incorporated into the festivities for the national party with activities scheduled throughout the summer.  It had a seven million-dollar budget, lasted twelve weeks and involved five thousand artists from every region in the United States and from thirty-five other nations. Jim Morris and Ralph Rinzler were named ''Washingtonians of the Year''. Following the Bicentennial Festival, Jim Morris went on to other positions in the Smithsonian complex. Ralph Rinzler continued in the Festival organization, originally as part of the Smithsonian's '''Division of Performing Arts''' until a separate '''Office of Folklife Programs''' was created in 1980.

Now that the festival organization and model were well established, Rinzler began to explore other varieties of folklife productions appropriate for a national museum. He spear-headed the protracted negotiations to purchase the [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] music collection from [[Moe Asch]], including both recordings and business files. These were successfully concluded in 1987, and this collection became the core of the [[Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections]], a rich resource for the study of folk culture and music. The recordings were bundled into the [[Smithsonian Folkways]] label.

In 1998, the Festival was renamed the ''Smithsonian Folklife Festival'' to reflect its international interests, and in 1999 the office was renamed the '''Center for Folklife &amp; Cultural Heritage''' to reflect its research and public program functions. Ralph Rinzler worked at the center until his death in 1994.

== Production ==
=== Festival ===
{{main|Smithsonian Folklife Festival}}
Since 1967 the Smithsonian Folklife Festival has enlivened the [[National Mall]] and excited visitors with ongoing performances and demonstrations of contemporary cultural traditions. It has become a national and international model of a research-based presentation of [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Year after year, it continues to bring musicians, artists, performers, craftspeople, workers, cooks, and storytellers into this public forum to demonstrate the skills, knowledge, and aesthetics that embody the creative vitality of community-based traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://festival.si.edu/about-us/mission-and-history/smithsonian|title=Smithsonian Festival Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smithsonian Folkways ===
{{main|Smithsonian Folkways}}
The [[Smithsonian Folkways]] Recordings has as its stated mission to curate and provide public access to each item in their collection of folk music, spoken word, instruction, and sounds from around the world. The record label originated as the Folkways Records of [[Moe Asch]], which were donated to the Smithsonian in 1989 under the unique condition that all records in the collection remain available "forever", regardless of sales. Since then, the label has expanded on Asch's vision of documenting and preserving music and [[soundscapes]] from around the world. It now includes an extensive collection of traditional American music, children's music, and international music.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For a list of individual collections included under the umbrella of Smithsonian Folkways, see {{cite web|url= http://folkways.si.edu/labels|title=Folkways Records Labels}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Smithsonian Folkways has become an important collection to the musical community to access and research these recordings from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://folkways.si.edu/mission-history/smithsonian|title=Folkways Records Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archives ===
{{main|Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections }}
The Archives' holdings were seeded by the business records of the Folkways Record label, which were acquired by the CFCH in 1987, and contain the business files of [[Lead Belly]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Woody Guthrie]] among others. The archive continues to grow in tandem with both the annual Folklife Festival, and the Folkways record label; it serves as the documentation and research foundation for the activities of these other two units of the CFCH. As with all archives, the Folklife Archives is currently working hard to move its entire collection into digital format, thus enabling global access to the artifacts. This includes not only the artifacts which are [[born-digital]] but also older analog forms which require [[Digitizing|reformatting]] for the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://folklife.si.edu/archives#about-the-archives|title=Ralph Rinzler Archives and Collections }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
In alignment with the mission of the Smithsonian Institution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.si.edu/about/mission |title=Smithsonian Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Center for Folklife &amp; Cultural Heritage is actively promoting and supporting research in fields under its purview. Currently there are three main research areas actively sponsored by CFCH.

=== [[Cultural Sustainability]] ===
Introduced as a concept in the [[Brundtland Report]] published in 1987, [[sustainable development]] was originally defined as encompassing three domains: environmental, economic, and social. It posited that these components must work in concert with each other to insure that current development does not impede development in the future. In 2010, a fourth component was added to this model: [[Sustainable development#Culture|culture]]. This component, previously tucked in with social sustainability, was now to considered in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.agenda21culture.net/sites/default/files/files/documents/en/zz_culture4pillarsd_eng.pdf |title=Fourth Pillar}}&lt;/ref&gt; By acknowledging culture to be independent and separate from the social development of individuals, it recognizes the power and role of [[Culture|cultural structures and forms]] to give shape and meaning to a social group.

This is the moment when the CFCH took notice. An active research group was formed to explore and articulate this concept of cultural sustainability. How is this defined, and how is it measured? Their goal is to explore means and indicators for assessing the impacts of culture on sustainable development, to develop best practices for bringing culture into political and social policy, and to share their findings with individuals, communities and policymakers around the world.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For specifics on research questions for this group, see {{cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/cultural-sustainability-research-group/smithsonian|title=CFCH Cultural Sustainability Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the practical implementation of cultural sustainability, CFCH also manages three different projects where the theoretical finding of this research can be put to test in the field. The {{cite web|url=http://folklife.si.edu/cultural-sustainability/my-armenia/smithsonian|title=My Armenia}} project is a collaboration between the people of [[Armenia]], the Smithsonian, and [[USAID]]. In their {{cite web|url=http://folklife.si.edu/cultural-sustainability/smithsonian-artisan-initiative/smithsonian |title=Artisan Initiative}}, CFCH is dedicated to building the sustainability of craft traditions of individuals and groups. A third team involved in the more theoretical work on {{cite web|url=https://folklife.si.edu/cultural-heritage-policy/smithsonian|title=cultural policy}} works  with UNESCO, ministries of culture around the world, as well as local, national, and international governments to recommend and develop policy concepts and language on cultural sustainability.

=== Sustaining Minority Languages in Europe (SMiLE) ===
Working in collaboration with the Smithsonian initiative {{cite web|url= http://recoveringvoices.si.edu|title=Recovering Voices}}, this interdisciplinary research program explores relationships between language revitalization, cultural heritage, and [[Linguistic relativity|traditional cultural transmission]]. How much of the culture of a region is embodied in the actual vocabulary of its language? What unique knowledge is lost when a language has lost its last native speaker? These are some of the issues investigated in this research area, which focuses specifically on the [[indigenous languages|indigenous]] or [[Minority language|minoritized]] languages of Europe. The charge for this inquiry was set forth in 1992 with passage of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], which mandates protection and promotion of historical [[regional language|regional]] and [[minority language]]s in Europe. Spotlighting these questions also brings into sharp relief the shadow side of minority language communities, which are characteristically marked by poverty, isolation, segregation, travel restrictions, and censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.folklife.si.edu/smile|title= Sustaining Minority Languages in Europe (SMiLE)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intangible Cultural Heritage ===
"The past is never dead. It's not even past. " This quote from William Faulkner neatly sums up the work at CFCH. Along with the artifacts of [[material culture]], we are blanketed with artifacts of [[intangible cultural heritage]], including traditions of performance, ritual, music, dance, knowledge, storytelling, and oral transmission. Tradition is always with us, shaping our thoughts, our behavior, our path into the future. This research group brings together thought leaders, both digitally and in person, to explore some of the critical issues facing our nation and the world. This new platform is one of the ways in which the center is working to implement a strategic plan goal of convening conversations on topics of importance. &lt;ref group=note&gt;For a list of events sponsored by this research group, see {{cite web|url=http://folklife.si.edu/cultural-heritage-policy/ICH/events/Smithsonian |title=Intangible Cultural Heritage Events}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these connections with external networks and strategic cultural partners, best practices and challenges emerge to inform the future of cultural heritage policy and practice at the Smithsonian. As one of the "Grand Challenges"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consortia.si.edu/consortia/worldcultures|title=Smithsonian Consortia}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Smithsonian, CFCH strives to be steward and ambassador of cultural connections.

| The modified Arduino IDE allows the compiled user sketch to be uploaded onto the processor either with or without the proprietary [[GNSS]] software. NavSpark has 17 GPIO pins, which include two [[UART]]s, 1 [[I²C]], 1 [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], 1 [[Pulse-width modulation|PWM]], and a trigger. The first UART is usually used by the GNSS software to output [[NMEA 0183]] data, although this can be disabled. This UART communicates over USB through a PL2303 serial converter and the transmit output is also made available on a pin. A 1 [[pulse per second]] signal is produced on a dedicated pin when a valid fix has been made.
There is a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-only version, a combined GPS/[[GLONASS]] version, and a GPS/[[Beidou Navigation Satellite System|Beidou]] version. An adaptor board adds a [[JST connector]] for a [[lithium-ion battery]], a charger for the battery, and a [[Secure Digital|microSD]] card slot connected to the SPI pins.

==Career==
George was born in [[Java, New York|North Java, New York]].  He wrestled for both [[St. Bonaventure University]] and for the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Michigan Hall of Honor 1981 inductee Ed Don George- Wrestling&lt;/ref&gt; He also represented the United States in freestyle wrestling at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam Olympics]], placing 4th in his class (+87&amp;nbsp;kg.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/spwremf0.html Wrestling - Freestyle - heavyweight&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the years 1926-1929, Ed Don George attended the University of Michigan,  with his concentration of study in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;University of Michigan alumni office communication&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, in 1929, at St. Bonaventure University, he graduated with a college degree.&lt;ref&gt;The St. Bonaventure University Athletics Hall of Fame list (1975 inductee)&lt;/ref&gt;

Quick and powerful, he took on the name "Ed Don George" and began his professional career shortly after returning from the Olympics.  He captured the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship (Boston version)|AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] on December 10, 1930, from [[Gus Sonnenberg]]. Double-crossed by [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]] in Los Angeles on April 13, 1931, George dropped the title to the Strangler, but promoter [[Paul Bowser]] maneuvered it back to George, who held it for nearly four years, finally losing it to [[Danno O'Mahony]] on June 30, 1935.  George remained one of the top box office draws of the 1930s, and on April 5, 1937, defeated Al Perreira in Paris to capture the European version of the world title.

In March 1942 he joined the [[United States Navy|US Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;letter from the National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/ref&gt; There he taught hand-to-hand combat to naval air cadets. In December 1945 he left the navy with the rank of [[Commander]].&lt;ref&gt;letter from the National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1940s through the 1950s he promoted numerous wrestling matches in the United States. In the mid 1950s he found himself promoting wrestling at the casinos in [[Havana|Havana, Cuba]] until [[Fidel Castro]] came to power.

In 1949, Ed Don George bought a {{convert|375|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcel just east of North Java, New York where [[Camp O'Ryan]] was situated.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the Wyoming County Clerk's Office, New York State, Liber 262, page 204, recorded on 2nd day of June 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  He then very soon afterwards leased this land for 25 years to the Federal government, which built, in conjunction with New York State, a New York National Guard training site.&lt;ref&gt;"National Guard Has Rifle Range in Wethersfield", Wyoming County Times, Warsaw, NY 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Don George died in [[Ft. Lauderdale, Florida]] on September 18, 1985 and his body buried in the village of North Java, New York. He was inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]] in 1996. In 2006 he was inducted posthumously into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]].

It is often applied as a [[disclaimer]] in situations in which the information to which it is applied is relatively fast-moving. In [[legal term]]s, it seeks to make a statement that information cannot be relied upon, or may have changed by the time of use.

It is regularly used in accounting, to "excuse slight mistakes or oversights."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Rapalje, Robert Linn Lawrence. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rllHAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A Dictionary of American and English Law: With Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws. Also, Containing a Full Collection of Latin Maxims, and Citations of Upwards of Forty Thousand Reported Cases in which Words and Phrases Have Been Judicially Defined Or Construed, Volume 1 (Google eBook)"]''. Frederick D. Linn &amp; Company, 1888
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used when a large amount of information is listed against a product, to state that—to the best of the supplier's knowledge—the information is correct, but that they will not be held responsible if an error has been committed.

On March 18, 2016, after three months research, they published the results of their first joint investigation spurred on by the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, in which they revealed how in spite of security risk warnings, "the EU’s freedom of goods policy facilitated the sale of weapons leading to [the 2015] terror attacks in Paris."&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2016_EU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weapons_terrorists_2016"/&gt; In 2017 working with "over 60 journalists in 14 countries", the EIC published the [[Football Leaks]]—the "largest leak in sports history".&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horizont_2017"/&gt;

== Objective ==
Through "joint reporting and publication", the EIA aims to strengthen the European [[Investigative journalism|transnational investigative journalism]] by joint reporting with the utmost transparency. They exchange documents and articles and coordinate publication, and to improve the tools used in their investigations from one investigation to another—for example in their data processing capabilities, servers, secure forums, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.horizont.net/medien/nachrichten/European-Investigative-Collaboration-Der-Spiegel-gruendet-europaeisches-Research-Netzwerk-139387 |publisher=horizont.net |title=Der Spiegel gründet europäisches Search-Netzwerk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At Dataharvest 2015 and other networking events, discussions related to "establishing this European Network" started with "Jörg Schmitt, Jürgen Dahlkamp, Alfred Weinzierl and Klaus Brinkbäumer from ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' and Stefan Candea from the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism (CRJI).&lt;ref name="EIC_about"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eic.network |title=About |date=2016 |work=EIC |access-date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="journalismfund_2016_EIC"/&gt; Stefan Candea, a founding partner explained how following the terrorist attacks, such as the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], journalists "started to bounce ideas off each other." This led to their first collaborative transnational investigation resulting in the series ''Mapping the Weapons of Terror''.&lt;ref name="EIC_guns_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="journalismfund_2016_EIC"/&gt; Others joined the group, including, "Alain Lallemand from ''[[Le Soir]]'', John Hansen from ''Politiken'', Milorad Ivanovic from ''Newsweek Serbia'', Florian Klenk from ''Falter'', Paula Guisado from ''El Mundo'', Vlad Odobescu from The Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism, Michael Bird from ''The Black Sea'',&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theblacksea.eu/?idT=3&amp;idC=3 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |location=Bucharest, Romania |year=2017 |publisher=The Black Sea |title=Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabrice Arfi from ''[[Mediapart]]'' and Vittorio Malagutti from ''[[L'Espresso]]''.&lt;ref name="EIC_about"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horizont_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.horizont.net/medien/nachrichten/Investigativjournalismus-Spiegel-schafft-ressortuebegreifendes-Recherchenetzwerk-160100 |title=Spiegel schafft multimediales Recherchenetzwerk |first=von Hein |last=David Hein |location=Freitag |date=August 4, 2017 |access-date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, [[NRC Handelsblad]] in the Netherlands had joined along with dozens of European media and over forty investigative journalists.

===The Black Sea===
The Black Sea, led by "award winning journalists and photo-journalists from the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism (CRJI)", is "a web project bringing together journalists, photographers and videographers.&lt;ref name="theblacksea_2017"/&gt;

==Investigations==
===Mapping the Weapons of Terror (March 2016)===

{{quote|That story came about after a meeting at the end of last year. The essentials concerning the network had been agreed on, so then we started bouncing ideas off each other.

After three months of research On March 18, 2016, EIC journalists published "Mapping the Weapons of Terror" in which they revealed how a "shadow gun market" in East Europe fuelled "terrorism in the west, as criminal gangs use legal loopholes and open borders to traffic weapons."&lt;ref name="EIC_guns_2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://eic.network/projects/arms |title=Mapping the Weapons of Terror: East Europe’s shadow gun market is fuelling terrorism in the west, as criminal gangs use legal loopholes and open borders to traffic weapons.|access-date=October 11, 2017 |date=March 18, 2016 |publisher=EIC}}#EICArms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weapons_terrorists_2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mediapart.co.uk/journal/international/180316/arms-de-la-terreur-la-faillite-de-leurope |title=Armes de la terreur: la faillite de l'Europe|date=March 18, 2016 |first1=Fabrice |last1=Arfi |first2=Karl |last2=Laske |first3=Matthieu |last3=Suc |quote="Au nom de la libre circulation des marchandises, Bruxelles a laissé prospérer en Europe un marché de vente d'armes "neutralisées" qui a permis d'alimenter les terroristes de janvier et novembre 2015.

Among those included in the reports are Italian mafia figures, Russian billionaires and the families of both Turkey's president and prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theblacksea.eu/malta-files/|title=The Malta Files|last=TheBlackSea.eu|website=theblacksea.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of Macha''' is the name given to a pair of [[Flag of Argentina|flags of Argentina]] found at a chapel in the hamlet of Titiri, near the village of [[Santiago de Macha|Macha]], north of [[Potosí]], [[Bolivia]]. They are considered to be the first physical flags created by [[Manuel Belgrano]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.en.argentina.ar/_en/culture/C2048-argentinas-flag-day.php |title=Argentina - Argentina´s Flag Day |author= |date=18 June 2010 |work= |publisher=Argentina - Official Promotion Portal for Argentina |accessdate=17 October 2010|quote=The first time the flag was raised in Buenos Aires was the August 23, 1812, in the church tower of St. Nicholas of Bari, current place of the Obelisk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in November 1813 hid the standards to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. They were discovered in 1885. Bolivia kept one of those flags at [[Sucre]]; the other was given to Argentina in 1896 and is currently kept at the [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]]. [[Tucumán Province]] has used it as provincial flag since 2010. The flag preserved in Argentina is a triband of blue, white and blue bands, like the modern flag of Argentina, but the one kept in Bolivia is a triband of white, blue and white.

==History==
{{main|Flag of Argentina}}
The Flag of Argentina was created by Manuel Belgrano during the [[Argentine War of Independence]]. After concluding the [[Paraguay campaign]], he moved to [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] to build artilleries. While being in the village he noticed that both the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] and [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriotic]] forces were using the same colors, [[Spain]]'s yellow and red. He requested to the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]] a new cockade, which was approved by a decree on February 18, 1812. The colours of this cockade were [[white]] and [[light blue]].&lt;ref&gt;Torres, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by this success, he created a flag of the same colours nine days later. The flag was first flown, for the soldiers to swear allegiance to it, on 27 February 1812, on the ''Batería Libertad'' (Liberty Battery), by the [[Paraná River]]. Although it is known that this first flag had white and light blue colours, the design is unknown by historians, and could be either a blue-white-blue triband, or white-blue-white.&lt;ref&gt;Torres, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Belgrano wrote a letter to the Triumvirate to inform it of the new flag, saying that "''...being in need to raise a flag, and not having one, I made it to be done white and light blue according to the colours of the national cockade...''";&lt;ref&gt;"''Siendo preciso enarbolar bandera, y no teniéndola, la mandé hacer blanca y celeste conforme a los colores de la escarapela nacional''" (Belgrano) - Torres, p. 22 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not detail the actual design. Still uninformed of this, the Triumvirate dispatched Belgrano to Salta, to reinforce the [[Army of the North]]. This gave room to another unclear detail: whenever Belgrano left the physical flag in Rosario, or took it with him to the North.&lt;ref&gt;Torres, pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; 

Belgrano dispatched a letter addressed to the First Triumvirate, informing them of the newly created flag. However, unlike with the cockade, the Triumvirate did not accept the use of the flag: the international policy at the time was to state that the government was ruling on behalf of [[Ferdinand VII]] king of Spain captive of Napoleon, whereas the creation of a flag was a clear independentist act. Thus, the triumvirate sent a warning to Belgrano not to fight under the flag, but by the time the reply had arrived, Belgrano had moved to the north, following the previous orders that requested him to strengthen the patriotic position in the Upper Peru after the defeat of [[Juan José Castelli]] at the [[Battle of Huaqui]]. Still unaware about the Triumvirate's refusal, Belgrano raised the flag at [[San Salvador de Jujuy]] and had it blessed by the local church on the second anniversary of the [[May Revolution]]. Belgrano accepted the orders from the Triumvirate by time they arrived to Salta and ended using the flag. As soldiers had already made oaths to the new flag, Belgrano said that he was saving it for the circumstance of a great victory. 
[[File:Bendición de la Bandera en Jujuy.jpg|thumb|left|The priest [[Juan Ignacio Gorriti]] blessing the flag.]]
The First Triumvirate was later replaced by the Second Triumvirate, with a more liberal ideology, who called the [[Asamblea del Año XIII]]. This assembly authorized to use the flag as a [[War flag]], but not as a national one. The first oath to the newly approved flag was on February 13, 1813, next to the [[Salado River (Argentina)|Salado River]], which is also known since then as "''Río Juramento''" ("Oath River"). The first battle fought with the approved flag was the [[Battle of Salta]], a decisive patriotic victory that achieved the complete defeat of royalist [[Pío Tristán]]. The army moved to the north, but was defeated at the battles of [[Battle of Vilcapugio|Vilcapugio]] and [[Battle of Ayohuma|Ayohuma]]. After those defeats, the army retreated to the South. Fearing that the enemy armies got the flags, he left them to the care of the [[parish priest]] of Macha, which hid them behind a [[Saint Teresa of Avila]]'s portrait in a chapel near the small hamlet of Titiri ({{coord|18|57|20|S|65|58|53.1|W}}). Belgrano was summoned back to Buenos Aires, and sent to Europe in diplomatic mission, and the flags was considered to be lost. 

The flags were discovered many decades later, in 1885. The new priest was cleaning and restoring the chapel, and found them. The flags were moved to the "Museum of the Independence" in Sucre, which kept one of the flags. The other was delivered to Argentina in 1896, after a request from Argentine ambassador to Bolivia [[Adolfo Carranza]]. This last one is kept at the [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]], which works in restoring it.

==Preservation==
The [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]] started to restore the Flag in 2007, making a study of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultura.gov.ar/prensa/index.php?info=noticia&amp;id=620 ''El Museo Histórico Nacional restaura la bandera más antigua del país''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; María Pía Tamborini and Patricia Lissa were in charge of the restoration. 

The flag is made of silk, and only the 70% of it remains.&lt;ref name="Nacion"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1141254 ''La bandera de Belgrano vuelve a vivir gracias a la restauración''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was kept under bad conditions over the years, and the silk used was not of high quality either.&lt;ref name="Nacion"/&gt; For this reason, the original colours could not be restored, which were [[indigo blue]] and ivory white. 

The flag is kept inside a closed cabinet, at a room with low lights.  It was made available to the view of the public in 2010, year of the [[Argentina Bicentennial]].

In [[cryptanalysis]], '''gardening''' is the act of encouraging a target to use [[known plaintext]] in an encrypted message. It was a term used at the British Government Code and Cypher School at [[Bletchley Park]], England, during [[World War II]], for schemes to entice the Germans to include particular words, which the British called "[[crib (cryptanalysis)|cribs]]", in their encrypted messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Morris | first = Christopher | year = 1993 | contribution = Navy Ultra's Poor Relations | editor-last = Hinsley | editor-first = F.H. | editor-link = Harry Hinsley | editor2-last = Stripp | editor2-first = Alan | title = Codebreakers: The inside story of Bletchley Park | publication-place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 235 | isbn = 978-0-19-280132-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Smith | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) | title = Station X: The Codebreakers of Bletchley Park | edition = Pan Books | series = Pan Grand Strategy Series | year = 2007 | origyear = 1998 | pages = 71–72 | publisher = Pan McMillan Ltd | location = London | isbn = 978-0-330-41929-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sebag-Montefiore | first = Hugh | author-link = Hugh Sebag-Montefiore | edition = Cassell Military Paperbacks | year = 2004 | origyear = 2000 | title = Enigma: The Battle for the Code | publication-place = London | publisher = Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson | page = 215 | isbn = 978-0297842514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This term presumably came from RAF minelaying missions, or "gardening" sorties.  "Gardening" was standard RAF slang for sowing mines in rivers, ports and oceans from low heights, possibly because each sea area around the European coasts was given a code-name of flowers or vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = MacIsaac | first = James J. | title = Glossary of R.A.F. Slang &amp; terminology | url = http://natureonline.com/37/56-ap4-glossary.html | accessdate = 4 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/ridgewell/90Squadron.htm 90 Squadron]&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is claimed to have been most effective against messages produced by the German Navy's [[Enigma machine]]s. If the Germans had recently swept a particular area for [[Naval mine|mine]]s, and analysts at Bletchley Park were in need of some cribs, they might (and apparently did on several occasions) request that the area be mined again. This would hopefully evoke encrypted messages from the local command mentioning ''Minen'' (German for mines) and/or the location, and perhaps messages also from the headquarters with minesweeping ships to assign to that location, mentioning the same. It worked often enough to try several times.

This [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Crib-based decryption|crib-based decryption]] is an example of a [[chosen-plaintext attack]], because plain text effectively chosen by the British was injected into the ciphertext.

[[File:Grand Larousse du XIXe siècle (2).JPG|thumb|280px|&lt;center&gt;''Grand Larousse du XIXe siècle''.]]
The '''''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle''''' (''Great Universal Dictionary of the 19th Century''), often called the '''''Grand Larousse du dix-neuvième''''', is a French [[encyclopedic dictionary]]. It was planned, directed, published, and to a substantial degree written by [[Pierre Larousse]], though he also relied on anonymous fellow contributors and though he died in 1875, before its completion. The publication of the ''Grand dictionnaire universel'' in 15 volumes of 1500 pages extended from 1866 to 1876. Two supplements were published in 1877 and 1890.

==Description==
Volumes 1-15, covering A-Z, were issued from 1866 to 1876. A supplement (Volume 16) was published in 1877, and a second supplement (Volume 17), in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.org/stream/LarousGrdictionnXIX17bnf/LarousGrdictionnXIX17Sbnf#page/n2026/mode/1up vol. 17, pp. 2023–2024].&lt;/ref&gt; The Larousse firm also published further supplements in the form of a magazine called ''Revue encyclopédique'' (1891-1900) then ''Revue universelle'' (1900-1905).

Unlike [[Émile Littré]]'s contemporary dictionary, the ''Grand Larousse'' is primarily an encyclopedia.  It is opinionated and has a distinctive and personal style.

One such instance of subjectivity appears regarding emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. For Pierre Larousse, what the [[First French Republic|Republic]]'s general had done until the [[18 Brumaire|''coup'' of 18 Brumaire]] was virtuous and glorious, but the ''coup'' and the subsequent rule of the [[French Consulate|consul]] and [[First French Empire|emperor]] were a tyrant's doings. Hence, the ''Grand Larousse du dix-neuvième'' had two entries: one for ''Bonaparte, Napoleon'', who, according to the article, died on the 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799); and one for ''Napoleon'' referring to the consul and emperor. Though it is true that Napoleon Bonaparte "changed" his name to Napoleon I, he only did so at his crowning as emperor, not after the 18 Brumaire ''coup''.

==''Nouveau Larousse illustré''==
The ''[[Nouveau Larousse illustré]]'' was an illustrated encyclopedia published 1897-1904 by [[Éditions Larousse]] and edited by [[Claude Augé]]. It was essentially a scaled-down, updated and more neutral version of the ''Grand Larousse du dix-neuvième''.

The '''''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis''''' or '''''History of the Church of Abingdon''''' (sometimes known by its older printed title of  '''''Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon''''' or occasionally as the '''''Abingdon Chronicle''''') was a medieval chronicle written at [[Abingdon Abbey]] in [[England]] in the 12th century. The Abbey was historically in the county of [[Berkshire]], but since 1974 has been in the county of [[Oxfordshire]].

==Background==

The ''Historia'' is one of a number of monastic histories written during the middle and later parts of the 12th century, when a number of monasteries produced works devoted to recording the histories of their monasteries and local areas. In the south, these included the ''[[Liber Eliensis]]'' of [[Ely Abbey]], the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis]]'' of [[Ramsey Abbey]], the ''[[Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense]]'' of [[Peterborough Abbey]], a history of the see of [[Diocese of Bath and Wells|Bath and Wells]], and the ''[[Chronicon Monasterii de Bello]]'' of [[Battle Abbey]]. The northern histories produced [[foundation stories]] of the various [[Cistercian Order|Cistercian]] houses, along with other works. The southern works, including the ''Chronicon'', are mainly concerned with the various controversies that their religious houses were involved in. The northern histories are less concerned with controversy, and overall are more prone to hagiography.&lt;ref name=Gransden269&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship and contents==

The History of the Church of Abingdon was written by an anonymous author, probably a monk of the Abbey. The History covers approximately 400 years, from the time of King [[Ine of Wessex]] (to whom the first charter in the History is dated in 699) to the end of the reign of King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] in 1154.

Little is known of the author of the document, other than that he was a monk of the Abbey and that he had entered by 1117. According to Sir [[Frank Stenton]], this timing is suggested by the presence of certain passages that are apparently contemporary with  Abbot Faritius, who died that year, and is referred to several times in the first person by the author: “Moreover, we were without an Abbot for four years” and, again concerning Faritius, “we saw him buy more than sixty silk cloths”. Hudson, however, infers that the text may have been revised in the 1160s.&lt;ref name=Hudsonxxv&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. xxv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentation==

Whilst the earliest surviving text of the History is the [[Cotton Claudius]] C IX in the [[British Library]], it has been suggested by Stenton and John Hudson that the author drew upon previously extant works, notably the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Wulfstan’s Life of St. Æthelwold and possibly a now-lost Book of Commemorations.&lt;ref name=Hudsonxxiv&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicle of John of Worcester was also apparently used; Hudson states “An Abingdon manuscript of John of Worcester, in the same hand as the History, does survive”.&lt;ref name=Hudsonxxvii&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

A particular concern in the ''Historia'' is the legendary foundation of the abbey, and the author stressed the fact that the abbey was founded much earlier than its refoundation by [[Æthelwold of Winchester|Æthelwold]] in the 10th century. He based his account in the ''Historia'' on [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s work ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', tracing the first foundation of Abingdon to an Irish monk supposedly named [[Abbán|Abbennus]], who founded the abbey on the Mount of Abbennus in Berkshire. Other sources besides Geoffrey of Monmouth included [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]]'s ''Vita Sancti Æthelwoldi''.&lt;ref name=Gransden273&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Also included was a list of the abbey's relics that had originally been compiled by Abbot [[Faricius]].&lt;ref name=Gransden282&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

However, up until the Norman conquest, the History is primarily concerned with charters and land documents; indeed, Gransden has described it as “little more than an inflated cartulary” . There are rare narrative sections concerning major events, presumably drawn from various chronicles, as mentioned above.&lt;ref name=Gransden272&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing in England c.550 to c.1307'' pp. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

One important part of the ''Historia'' is the description of the collapse of one of the abbey church's towers in 1091. The chronicle records that the monks were celebrating [[matins]], which would normally have been done in the abbey church, but on this occasion, the [[prior]] had decided to have the office celebrated in the [[chapter house]] instead, which allowed all the monks to escape the collapse unharmed.&lt;ref name=Gransden285&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

The Author, although unknown, displays certain partisan opinions of some events. Presumably a monk of English descent (as he could read the Old English of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle), he displays a certain hostility to the Danes &lt;ref name=Hudson221&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 221-227&lt;/ref&gt; but not a particularly hostile one towards Normans in general, except to those who cause the Abbey to suffer, such as the “Imperious Queen” Matilda.&lt;ref name=Hudson225&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In general, as might be expected, he is hostile to all who oppose the Abbey.

==Land Laws==

The history, in its recording of the various land disputes of concern to the Abbey, refers numerous times to Charters or “land-books” .&lt;ref name=Hudson209&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 209, 217&lt;/ref&gt; These were the basis by which land was granted to the Abbey or another individual, usually confirmed by the King in front of witnesses. The volume of witnesses at two of King Edward’s Charters in 1052 (Earls Harold, Leofric and Siward, and four bishops) concerning four hides at Sandford and five hides at Chilton respectively, bears out the importance of witnesses, and also the likelihood of a Royal Court where the charters were signed and witnessed.&lt;ref name=Hudson205&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 205-6&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a practice of leasing land to laymen for “two or three generations”.&lt;ref name=Hudson221/&gt; The Abbey often experienced difficulties in reclaiming such lands. The History points out that during King Edward’s reign this “custom got out of control, to considerable future damage”.&lt;ref name=Hudson219&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 219&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps an allusion to the problems that the Abbey faced when it came to trying to recover Abbey land from later Norman settlers.

There is one explicit example of "an Assembly of high-ranking men" possibly analogous to the land-court of the Abbot after the Norman Conquest.&lt;ref name=Hudsonclx&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. clx, 221&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of the Abbey is highlighted in certain episodes, such as “the Earl Harold’s favour that the Abbot enjoyed in this matter”&lt;ref name=Hudson209/&gt; and the importance of Abbot Ealdred making oaths of loyalty to King William in 1066. The wealth of the Church is inferred by various episodes of looting that went on immediately following the Conquest, one, notably by William’s Queen&lt;ref name=Hudson225&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 225&lt;/ref&gt; and by the calculation of its holding of 624½ hides in 1066 by Holister.&lt;ref name=Hollister13&gt;Hollister ''Monarchy, Magnates and Institutions in the Anglo-Norman World'' pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt; By 1086 this had fallen to 425 &lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;/&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt; hides. For instance, the Abbot was unable to recover lands seized by Henry de Ferrers in the wake of the Conquest.&lt;ref name=Hudson223&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

==What the History tells us about Anglo-Saxon society==

From the History one can discern evidence of a strong English monarchy prior to 1066, with a recognised legal system of charters for land. The diversity of witnesses to the charters bears evidence to a royal court, where magnates from around the country gathered at certain times. The wealth and power of the abbey, and its role in temporal affairs is prominent. Nor is the church afraid to use ecclesiastical powers to get its way, as in the excommunication of Brithwine who had argued with the abbey over land in the 1050s.&lt;ref name=Hudson211&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, however, whilst the charters frequently feature colourful religious threats against breakers of the charter, there is no temporal threat or enforcement. “If anyone brings forth into the open any document previously drawn up with the ink of false greed against this one drawn up above, let it profit neither him nor his avarice, but pierced in perpetuity by a divine sword”  from a charter of Æthelred II.&lt;ref name=Hudson161&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the Conquest in 1066, it is inferred that there was a period of disorder, during which the abbey was looted and “devastation was dispensed indiscriminately throughout the villages”.&lt;ref name=Hudson229&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume I'' pp. 229&lt;/ref&gt; One might safely presume, therefore that such disorder was more unusual under the Anglo-Saxons.

==Printing history==

The ''Historia'' has been published in two editions. One, titled ''Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon'' and containing just the Latin text, was edited by [[Joseph Stevenson]] in two volumes and published by the [[Rolls Series]], London in 1858.&lt;ref name=Graves290&gt;Graves ''Bibliography'' pp. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt; A newer edition, with a translation, has appeared in two volumes, edited by John Hudson and published by [[Oxford University Press]] under their Oxford Medieval Texts series. The second volume appeared first in print, published in 2002. The first volume was published in 2007.&lt;ref name=V1&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume 1''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=V2&gt;Hudson ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis Volume 2''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''King Siliwangi''' or '''Prabu Siliwangi''' ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]: {{Sund|ᮕᮢᮘᮥ ᮞᮤᮜᮤᮝᮍᮤ}}) was a semi-[[Legend|legendary]]  great king of the [[Sunda kingdom|Hindu Sunda kingdom]] prior to the coming of Islam in [[West Java]].&lt;ref name="SNI-II:Zaman Kuno"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro |author2=Nugroho Notosusanto | title=Sejarah Nasional Indonesia: Zaman Kuno | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/sejarah-nasional-indonesia/oclc/318053182 | date=2008 | publisher=Balai Pustaka | ISBN=979407408X | language=Indonesian | accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|415}} 

He is a popular character in ''[[Pantun Sunda]]'' oral tradition, folklores and tales that describe his reign as a glorious era for the [[Sundanese people]]. According to tradition he brought his kingdom greatness and prosperity.

The character of King Siliwangi is semi-[[mythology]] since in Sundanese oral tradition simply identify the great king of Sunda as "King Siliwangi" regardless the era or historical periods. It is difficult to identify the exact historical character that represented in the legend of King Siliwangi. As the result the tale of this king spanned and vary greatly from the mythical era of Sundanese gods to the coming of [[Islam]] in the land of Sunda and the fall of the kingdom. 

Several historic Sundanese kings are suggested as the real character inspired the legend of King Siliwangi. Most popular interpretation linked King Siliwangi with [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]],&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Libraries-Prabu Siliwangi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/object/siris_sil_309146|title=Prabu Siliwangi atau Ratu Purana Prebu Guru Dewataprana Sri Baduga Maharadja Ratu Hadji di Pakwan Padjadjaran, 1474-1513 |author = Moh. Amir Sutaarga|website=Smithsonian Institution|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/bandung-raya/2012/11/01/209470/sri-baduga-sangat-melegenda-dalam-kerajaan-sunda|title=Sri Baduga Sangat Melegenda Dalam Kerajaan Sunda| language=Indonesian |date=1 November 2012|work=Pikiran Rakyat|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other suggested that the legend might be inspired by [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]] instead.&lt;ref name="SNI-II:Zaman Kuno"/&gt;{{rp|415}}

==Etymology==
A linguistical theory suggests that Siliwangi is derived from the [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] words of ''Silih Wangi'', meaning a descendant of King Wangi.

According to [[Kidung Sunda]] and [[Carita Parahyangan]], King Wangi is identified as King [[Sunda Kingdom#Maharaja Lingga Buana|Lingga Buana]], a king of Sunda that died at [[Majapahit]] in 1357 AD in the [[Battle of Bubat]]. [[Hayam Wuruk]], the Majapahit king, intended to marry [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]], a daughter of King Lingga Buana. The Sunda royal family came to Majapahit to marry the princess to Hayam Wuruk. However, [[Gajah Mada]], prime minister of the Majapahit Empire, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit. He demanded  that the princess not be treated as the queen of Majapahit, but merely as a [[concubine]], as a sign of Sunda's submission. Angered by Gajah Mada's insult, the Sunda royal family fought the overwhelming Majapahit forces to the death to defend their honor. After his death, King Lingga Buana was named King ''Wangi'' (king with a pleasant fragrance) because of his heroic deed to defend his kingdom's honor. 

His descendants with the same quality of greatness were called ''Silihwangi'' (successor of Wangi). After the reign of King Wangi (Prebu Maharaja), Kingdom of Sunda saw seven consecutive successor kings, technically all of them are considered as the successor of Wangi (Silihwangi).

Some other historians are of the opinion that Siliwangi is derived from the Sundanese word ''Asilih Wewangi'', meaning changing title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kompasiana.com/diella/591071847697733f40c94a30/napak-tilas-menelusuri-jejak-prabu-siliwangi|title=Napak Tilas Menelusuri Jejak Prabu Siliwangi oleh Diella Dachlan - Kompasiana.com|last=Kompasiana.com|website=www.kompasiana.com|language=id|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend of King Siliwangi==
[[File:Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkartta, Candi Siliwangi Shrine.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A shrine dedicated to King Siliwangi in  the Hindu temple [[Pura (Balinese temple)|Pura]] Parahyangan Agung Jagatkartta, [[Bogor]], [[West Java]].]]

One of the stories tells about prince Jayadewata, the son of Prabu Anggalarang, king of [[Galuh Kingdom|Galuh]], who ruled from Surawisesa Palace in [[Kawali]]). Prince Jayadewata also known as Ratu Purana Prebu Guru Dewataprana.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Libraries-Prabu Siliwangi"/&gt; During his youth the prince was known as ''Raden Pamanah Rasa'' (the archer of feelings of love). The name suggests that he was a charming and strikingly handsome young man. People easily fell in love with him. The tradition says he was a  master of literature, music, dance, and the arts, as well as [[pencak silat]] martial arts and the princely arts of sword fighting and archery.

An [[usurper]] of evil ambition overthrows King Anggalarang and murders him, taking over the throne. The prince Jayadewata is poisoned, drugged, and cast under a black magic spell that caused him to suffer [[amnesia]] and insanity. The powerful but insane prince wandered around and caused trouble in many villages, until Ki Gedeng Sindangkasih, the chief of Sindangkasih village, managed to pacifize him. With the love of Nyi Ambetkasih, Ki Gedeng's daughter, the prince is finally cured from his illness. Prince Jayadewata married Nyi Ambetkasih. Later, prince Jayadewata managed to gain support of the people and succeeded in reclaiming his rightful throne.

==Family==
Besides Ambetkasih, King Siliwangi had other wives, Nyai Subang Larang, Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, and Nyai Aciputih. Nyai Subang Larang was the daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati (today [[Cirebon]]). Nyai Cantring Manikmayang was a princess from a noble family in Galuh. While Nyai Aciputih was the daughter of Ki Dampu Awang, a rich Muslim Chinese merchant.

Nyai Subang Larang was a Muslim woman and a student of the Quro Islamic school in [[Karawang]], and she bore him three children: prince Walangsungsang, princess Rara Santang, and prince Kian Santang. Walangsungsang, later known as Cakrabuana, was the founder of the [[Sultanate of Cirebon]]. Rara Santang married a Muslim Egyptian prince and changed her name to Syarifah Mudaim, while Kian Santang become a famous Muslim [[ulama]] in western Java. The legend of King Siliwangi's Muslim children from Subang Larang explains the change from Hinduism to Islam around the time of the fall of Sunda kingdom. Queen Ambetkasih was childless, and the heir of the throne was the son of Nyai Cantring Manikmayang.

==Animal associations==
Traditions associated King Siliwangi with the mythical [[Javan tiger|tiger]] and sometimes the black and white [[Javan leopard|leopard]], as his guard. According to legends after the Sultanates of Cirebon and Banten sacked the capital of Pakuan Pajajaran, the king refused to convert to Islam, yet he also refused to fight the invading Muslim forces, since the Sultan of Cirebon was his own kin. Tradition tells that after the fall of Pakuan, the last king of Sunda, accompanied by his faithful followers, retreated to [[Mount Salak]] located south of the capital to avoid further bloodshed. Then the king is ''ngahyang'' (he disappeared) to become a [[hyang]] or [[spirit]]. He turned into a mythical beast, the sacred tiger. Tradition mentioned that the King disappeared in Sancang forest, near the southern sea far south in [[Garut Regency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/maung-dan-prabu-siliwangi-mitos-atau-fakta-ckLg|title=Maung dan Prabu Siliwangi: Mitos atau Fakta? - Tirto.ID|last=Teguh|first=Irfan|website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century, the city of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] has been reclaimed by tropical rainforest, and invested by [[Javan tiger|tiger]]. The first Dutch expedition into inland West Java was led in 1687 by Pieter Scipio Van Oostende. He led his team to explore deep south from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] into the remnant of Pakuan and ended on Wijnkoopsbaai (present-day [[Palabuhanratu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Geschiedenis van Indonesië|last=Graaf|first=Hermanus Johannes de|date=1949-01-01|publisher=W. van Hoeve|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Nederlandsch Indie: platen atlas met korten beschrijvenden tekst|last=Volkslectuur|first=Dutch East Indies Kantoor voor de| date=1926-01-01|publisher=Volkslectuur|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the members of his expedition team was mauled by a [[tiger]] in the area, two days earlier. Scipio learned from Lieutenant Tanuwijaya's men from Sumedang that the ruins were the remnants of Pakuan or Pajajaran kingdom. On 23 December 1687, Governor-General Joanes Camphuijs wrote a report; "that the hilted palace and the special exalted silver tablets of the Javanese King of Pajajaran, guarded by a large number of tigers."&lt;ref name="Harimau Pajajaran"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sportourism.id/heritage/saat-ditemukan-singgasana-pajajaran-konon-dijaga-kawanan-harimau|title=Saat Ditemukan, Singgasana Pajajaran Konon Dijaga Kawanan Harimau|website=Sportourism.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report on the tiger sightings also comes from the residents of Kedung Halang and Parung Angsana who accompanied Scipio on this expedition. Perhaps this was the source of the popular beliefs that the Pajajaran king, nobles and guards were  transformed into mythical tigers.&lt;ref name="Harimau Pajajaran"/&gt;

==Possible historic characters==
The compiled legends of King Siliwangi do not always correspond with historical facts and records, since some events are vague and do not correspond to the lifetime of the historic Sri Baduga Maharaja. For example, the fall of Pajajaran occur in later times, during the reign of later Sunda kings, the great-great grandson of Sri Baduga. Some legends seem to simply identify the series of last Sunda kings as Siliwangi. However these legends try to explain the historical events of the Sunda kingdom and its relationship with the Sultanates of Cirebon and Banten.

===Niskala Wastu Kancana===
The legend of King Siliwangi has been around and popularly known in [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] oral tradition of ''[[Pantun Sunda|Carita Pantun]]'' as early as 1518 CE. It was the era of King [[Sri Baduga Maharaja|Jayadewata]]'s reign. Ayatrohaedi, a Sundanese historian argued that it took years for a historical character to gain a revered legendary status, featured in tales and folklores. Thus, it is highly unlikely for a living and ruling character, like Jayadewata, to be revered as such in circulating ''pantun'' poetic verses. He suggested that the real historic character should be the predecessor of Jayadewata, and pointed out that King [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]] was most likely the real historic character behind the legend of King Siliwangi.&lt;ref name="SNI-II:Zaman Kuno"/&gt;{{rp|415}}
 
By the earliest time the legend of King Siliwangi appear, Niskala Wastu Kancana had passed away for about 40 years. So it is reasonable that the cult or veneration of this late king has appeared by this time.&lt;ref name="SNI-II:Zaman Kuno"/&gt;{{rp|415}} In Sundanese ancient tradition of Hinduism mixed with native ancestral worship, a passed away ancestor of great character, is believed had gain a god-like power in the afterlife, and even might be invoked to protect, lend help and interfere with their descendant's affairs.

Niskala Wastu Kancana ruled for 104 years, between 1371–1475. His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity. It is possible that his long lasting reign were fondly remembered by his people as a golden age, thus started a cult or veneration years after his death, and inspired the ''pantun'' poetic verses.&lt;ref name="SNI-II:Zaman Kuno"/&gt;{{rp|392}}

===Ningrat Kancana===
According to ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', the chronicle of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], the Sunda King Siliwangi married to Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati, which corresponds with the port of [[Cirebon]]. They had three children; Prince Walangsungsang born in 1423, Princess Rara Santang born in 1426, and Prince Kian Santang (Raden Sangara) born in 1428.&lt;ref name="Kabupaten"&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://www.cirebonkab.go.id/sekilas-kab-cirebon/sejarah-kabupaten-cirebon
 |title      = Sejarah Kabupaten Cirebon
 |language   = Indonesian

 |accessdate = 16 January 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of Sunda King, the prince did not earned the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the ''prameswari'' ([[queen consort]]). Another reason was probably because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother, Subang Larang whom was a Muslim woman. In 16th century West Java, the state's religion was Hinduism, [[Sunda Wiwitan]] (Sundanese ancestral religion) and Buddhism. It was his half brother, King Siliwangi's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as crown prince.

Ningrat Kancana is also known as Prabu Dewa Niskala. The character described in Cirebon Chronicle ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', as King Siliwangi, both timeline and storyline, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as "Tohaan di Galuh" (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana. Ningrat Kancana however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,"'' which translate as "because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman." The term "outsider woman" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese 
(possibly [[Javanese people|Javanese]]), or even non-Hindu (Muslim) woman. It is possible that the outsider forbidden woman mentioned here was Nyai Subang Larang, a Muslim woman daughter of port master of Muara Jati (Cirebon).

Some historians suggest that this legendary King can be identified with an actual historical figure [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]] or King Jayadewata, as mentioned in [[Batutulis inscription]], he is the son of Rahyang Niskala and the grandson of Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana. Indeed, King Jayadewata is the most widely believed as the real historical character behind the legend of King Siliwangi. In ''pantun'' oral tradition, King Siliwangi often referred as Raden Pamanah Rasa or Ratu Jayadewata, which is the other name of Sri Baduga Maharaja.

One of the ''Pantun'' legends tells vividly about a beautiful royal procession of queen Ambetkasih and her courtiers moving to the new capital of Pakuan Pajajaran, where her husband, King Siliwangi awaits. The character described as King Siliwangi in this verse matched perfectly with the real historic person of King Jayadewata, since he was the king that moved the capital city from [[Kawali]] to [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] in 1482.

===Nilakendra===
Another popular tale of King Siliwangi, is suggesting that he was the last king of Sunda Kingdom. Tradition tells that after the fall of [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Pakuan]], the last king of Sunda, accompanied by a few of his faithful followers, retreated into highland wilderness of [[Mount Salak]] located south of the capital to avoid further bloodshed. It was said that the king retreated instead, to avoid fighting his own kin, since the invading forces of Sultanate Banten and Cirebon were actually his extended relatives. Then the king is ''ngahyang'' (he disappeared) to become a [[hyang]] or [[spirit]]. He turned into a mythical beast, the sacred tiger.

The King Siliwangi mentioned in this tale, matched the real historic character of King Nilakendra or Tohaan di Majaya of Pakuan. It was during his reign that Sunda capital of Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran were captured by Sultan Hasanuddin of Banten. Around 1550s Hasanuddin, sultan of [[The Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] has launched a successful attack to Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital. The surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to mountainous wilderness. To disable the authority of Sunda royal institution, Sultan of Banten seize the sacred stone of ''Palangka Sriman Sriwacana'', and took it as a prized plunder to his capital, the port city of Banten. According to tradition, this sacred stone slab is an essential requirement for enthronement ceremony, thus disabling the surviving house of Sunda royals to properly crowned their new king.

==Legacy==
Through the transmission [[Pantun Sunda]] oral tradition, the Sri Baduga's reign is remembered as the peaceful and prosperous golden age in Sundanese history, as the cultural identity and the source of pride for [[Sundanese people]]. The kings of [[Sultanate of Cirebon]] still trace their ancestry to Sundanese King Siliwangi, it was probably served as the source of legitimacy of their reign in West Java. The [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|TNI]] [[Siliwangi Division|Siliwangi Military Division]] and [[Siliwangi Stadium]] was named after King Siliwangi, the eponymous popular king of Sunda corresponded to Sri Baduga Maharaja. His name is honored as the name of [[West Java]] province museum, [[Sri Baduga Museum]] in [[Bandung]]. [[Balinese people|Balinese]] Hindus built a ''candi'' shrine dedicated to King Siliwangi in the Hindu temple [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta]], [[Bogor]].

'''''Man on the Moon''''' is a 1999 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[comedy-drama]] film about the late American entertainer [[Andy Kaufman]], starring [[Jim Carrey]] as Kaufman. The film was directed by [[Miloš Forman]] and also features [[Danny DeVito]], [[Courtney Love]], and [[Paul Giamatti]].

The story traces Kaufman's steps from childhood through the [[comedy club]]s and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', and his role as [[Latka Gravas]] on the sitcom ''[[Taxi (sitcom)|Taxi]]'', which was popular among viewers but disruptive for Kaufman's co-stars. The film pays particular attention to the various [[In-joke|inside jokes]], [[confidence trick|scams]], put-ons, and [[happening]]s for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running feud with wrestler [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] and his portrayal of the bawdy [[lounge music|lounge singer]] [[Tony Clifton]].

Although the film was unsuccessful commercially and received mixed reviews, Carrey received critical acclaim for his performance and won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]], his second in a row after his award for ''[[The Truman Show]]''. His nomination was in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Musical/Comedy]] category.

The documentary ''[[Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond]]'' was released in 2017 and chronicles Carrey's performance as Kaufman in the film, a performance he maintained during much of the film's production.

==Plot==
Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid "foreign man" character puts on a [[rhinestone]] jacket and does a dead-on [[Elvis impersonation]]. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them.

He catches the eye of talent agent [[George Shapiro]], who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named [[Latka Gravas]]. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit.

Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, [[Tony Clifton]], whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on ''Taxi''. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a "villain character" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, [[Bob Zmuda]]. Once again, the gag is on the audience.

Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the ''Taxi'' set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience "short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire."

Kaufman decides to become a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] — but to emphasize the "villain" angle, he will wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself "Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion." He becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, Lynne Margulies, and they begin a romantic relationship.

Problems arise when an appearance on a live TV comedy show, ABC's ''Fridays'', turns into a fiasco when Kaufman refuses to speak his lines. Also Kaufman feuds publicly with [[Jerry Lawler]], a male professional wrestler, who challenges him to a "real wrestling match", which Kaufman accepts. Lawler easily overpowers and appears to seriously injure Kaufman. Lawler and an injured Kaufman (wearing a neck brace) appear on NBC's ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ostensibly to call a truce, but Lawler insults Kaufman, who throws coffee at the wrestler and spews a vicious tirade of epithets. It is later revealed that Kaufman and Lawler were in fact good friends and staged the entire feud, but Kaufman pays a price when he is banned from ''Saturday Night Live'' by a vote of audience members, weary of his wrestling antics. Shapiro advises Kaufman and Lawler not to work together again, and later calls Kaufman to inform him that ''Taxi'' has been canceled.

After a show at a comedy club, Kaufman calls together Lynne, Zmuda, and Shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of [[lung cancer]] and may die soon. They aren't sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be yet another stunt, with Zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic [[practical joke|prank]]. With little time to live, Kaufman gets a booking at [[Carnegie Hall]], his dream venue. The performance is a memorable success, culminating with Kaufman inviting the entire audience out for milk and cookies. His health deteriorates. Desperate, he heads to the [[Philippines]] to seek a medical miracle through [[psychic surgery]] only to find it a hoax, laughing at the irony. He dies soon after. At his funeral, friends and loved ones sing along to "[[This Friendly World]]" with a video of Kaufman.

One year later, in 1985, Clifton appears at Kaufman's tribute at [[The Comedy Store]]'s main stage, performing "[[I Will Survive]]". The camera pans over the crowd and reveals Zmuda in the audience.

==Production==
''Man on the Moon'' was shot in Los Angeles in the winter of 1998.&lt;ref name=stern&gt;{{cite interview|first=Courtney|last=Love|author-link=Courtney Love|work=The Howard Stern Show|date=December 9, 1999|title=Courtney Love and Samantha Maloney|interviewer=[[Howard Stern]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Courtney Love, Jim Carrey, when playing Kaufman's [[Tony Clifton]] character in the film, would stuff his clothing with [[Limburger cheese]] on the set, something Kaufman had done in his performances of the character.&lt;ref name=stern/&gt;

A documentary, ''[[Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond]]'', that chronicles the production of the film using behind the scenes footage was released in November 2017.

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Man on the Moon (soundtrack)}}
The [[Man on the Moon (soundtrack)|soundtrack for the film]] was written by [[rock music|rock]] band [[R.E.M.]], whose 1992 song "[[Man on the Moon (song)|Man on the Moon]]" (originally written in honor of Kaufman) gave the film its title. The soundtrack also included the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated song "[[The Great Beyond]]", which remains the band's highest-charting single in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/man-on-the-moon-mw0000255991|work=AllMusic|title=Man on the Moon - Original Soundtrack|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film makes a few changes to Kaufman's life story. As Kaufman (played by Carrey) explains in the prologue, "All the most important things in my life are changed around and mixed up for dramatic purposes."

The famous [[Carnegie Hall]] "milk and cookies" [[Andy Kaufman Plays Carnegie Hall|performance]], portrayed in the film as one of his last performances after being diagnosed with cancer, had in fact occurred in 1979, five years before Kaufman's death and well before his diagnosis. Also, the film is deliberately ambiguous over whether Kaufman actually died or if his death was a hoax as some fans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/hoaxes/kaufman.asp |title=Andy Kaufman Is Still Alive? |publisher=snopes.com |date=2014-09-29 |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe.

The film implies that [[Carol Kane]] was a member of the ''Taxi'' cast during the show's first season, which in real life was 1978–79. In actuality, Kane did not make her first appearance on the series until the episode "Guess Who's Coming for Brefnish", which first aired on ABC in January 1980 during the show's second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/taxi-guess-whos-coming-for-brefnish-319871 |title=Taxi: Guess Who's Coming for Brefnish (1980) | work=AllMovie | publisher=RhythmOne | accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film implies that ''Taxi'' was canceled only once. However, the show went on for one more season on NBC.

Other inaccuracies include scenes based around ''SNL'', specifically the first episode's host. Also, the scene where [[Lorne Michaels]] asks the home viewing audience to vote Kaufman off the show happened in 1982, two years after Michaels left the show as executive producer and [[Dick Ebersol]] took over.&lt;ref&gt;Shales, Tom, and James Andrew Miller. (2002). ''Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live''. Boston, MA: Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-316-78146-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After its release, the film attracted some criticism over various events in Kaufman's life that were left out. [[Max Allan Collins]] maintained that the filmmakers did not understand Kaufman, and that the film "does not give Kaufman the credit for his genius, that he had a complete intellectual grasp of what he was up to and a showman's instincts for how to play an audience."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywood.com/news/COMMENTARY_Man_on_the_Moon_Misses_Kaufman/311826 'Man on the Moon' Misses Kaufman] by Max Allan Collins. 6 January 2000. Accessed 31 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, these critics included Kaufman's own father Stanley, who was displeased that little of Andy's early life (before show business) and early career was portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andykaufman.jvlnet.com/realmotm.htm |title=The Real Man on the Moon Speaks |publisher=Andykaufman.jvlnet.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Simon]], executive producer on ''Taxi'', stated in a 2013 interview with [[Marc Maron]] for the ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'' podcast that the portrayal of Andy on the show was "a complete fiction," that Kaufman was "completely professional" and that he "told you Tony Clifton was him." Simon also stated that sources for these stories were mostly from Bob Zmuda and a "little bit of press and hype," but conceded that Kaufman would have "loved" Zmuda's version of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_389_-_sam_simon |title=Episode 389 - Sam Simon — WTF with Marc Maron Podcast |publisher=Wtfpod.com |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 63% based on 118 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Jim Carrey is eerily dead-on in his portrayal of Andy Kaufman, which helps to elevate ''Man on the Moon'' above the script's formulaic biopic cliches."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1093579-man_on_the_moon/ Rotten Tomatoes - Man on the Moon] Retrieved March 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which uses a [[weighted average]], assigned a score of 58 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/man-on-the-moon|title=''Man on the Moon'' reviews|publisher=[[CBS]] |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=Man on the Moon – CinemaScore |work=[[CinemaScore]]|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] wrote for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', "What is most wonderful about "Man on the Moon," a very good film, is that it remains true to Kaufman's stubborn vision. Oh, it brightens things up a little [...] But essentially it stays true to his persona: A guy who would test you, fool you, lie to you, deceive you and stage elaborate deceptions, put-ons and hoaxes."&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt;

''Man on the Moon'' ended a string of Jim Carrey films that had very successful opening weekends, and grossed just $47 million against a budget of $82 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficeguru.com/122799.htm Box Office Guru - Weekend Box Office (December 24 - 26, 1999)] Retrieved 31 March 2007,&lt;/ref&gt; Although the film received mixed reviews from critics, they were near unanimous in their praise for Jim Carrey's portrayal of Andy Kaufman. Carrey won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for his performance, and the film was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy|Best Musical or Comedy]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegoldenglobes.com/yearz/G-1999.html The 57th Annual Golden Globe Awards] Hollywood Foreign Press Association.

'''''Meyers Blitz-Lexikon''''' is a [[German language|German]] print [[encyclopedia]], now in the public domain. It was a concise single-volume version of the long-established [[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon|''Meyers Lexicon'']]. The name refers to the need for very rapid (Blitz = "Lightning") information. It was published to accompany the 15-volume version of the 7th edition of Meyers Lexicon. By limiting the explanations to a few keywords and making heavy use of abbreviations, a large number of entries were compressed into the single portable volume. Even complex topics were explained in just a few sentences. The volume contained eight plates, 2,481 illustrations in the text and 71 coloured panels, forming a 759-page lexicon with over 45,000 entries.

==Background==
Michael Lee-Chin was born in [[Port Antonio]], [[Jamaica]], in 1951 to Aston Lee and Hyacinth Gloria Chen. Both his parents were [[biracial]] African and [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese-Jamaican]]. When Lee-Chin was aged seven, his mother married Vincent Chen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.globeadvisor.com/servlet/GIS.Servlets.WireFeedRedirect?cf=sglobeadvisor/config&amp;vg=BigAdVariableGenerator&amp;date=20030530&amp;archive=gam&amp;slug=CHIN |title=the man...the mom...the myth |accessdate=2006-08-24 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |format= |work= |publisher=Globe Advisor |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chen{{who|date=February 2015}} had a son from a previous relationship, and the couple had a further seven children together, six boys and one girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Life/2004/02/05/Can_a_Billionaire_Be_Nice/ |title=Can a Billionaire Be Nice? - If you don't think so, Michael Lee-Chin may change your mind |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author=Barbara McLintock |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2004-02-05 |format= |work= |publisher=The Tyee |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee-Chin's mother sold [[Avon Products|Avon]] products, and worked as a bookkeeper for various local firms, while his stepfather ran a local grocery store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://experts.about.com/e/m/mi/Michael_Lee-Chin.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418081813/https://experts.about.com/e/m/mi/Michael_Lee-Chin.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-04-18 |title=Michael Lee-Chin: Encyclopedia |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |work= |publisher=About.com |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the local high school, [[Titchfield High School|Titchfield High]], between 1962 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titchfieldhigh.com/ja.htm |title=Titchfield Old Students' Association Newsletter &amp; Events |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= July 2006 |work= |publisher=Titchfield High Alumni Association |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1965, Lee-Chin's first job came working as part of the landscaping team at the Frenchman's Cove Hotel.  The next year, he got a summer job working on the ''Jamaica Queen'' cruise ship, cleaning the engine room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why donate?|url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060307/life/life3.html|publisher=Jamaica Gleaner|accessdate=23 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329023311/http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060307/life/life3.html|archivedate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, he went to Canada on a scholarship program sponsored by the Jamaican government to study [[Civil Engineering]] at [[McMaster University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncb.com/corp_info/bod.asp|title=National Commercial Bank of Jamaica - Board of Directors|accessdate=2006-08-23|author=|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|format=|work=|publisher=|pages=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903222555/http://jncb.com/corp_info/bod.asp|archivedate=3 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globefunddb.theglobeandmail.com/gishome/plsql/gis.fund_pro?fundname=AIC+Cdn+Balanced+Corporate+Cl+(US$)&amp;pi_universe=PUBLIC_FUND |title=Fund Profile AIC - Portfolio Managers |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |format= |work= |publisher=GlobeFunc.com |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He financed his first year at university on his own but after that was able to attend on scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaicaobserver.com/columns/html/20040531T000000-0500_60558_OBS_IF_SHEARER_HAD_REFUSED_LEE_CHIN___.asp |title=If Shearer had refused Lee Chin... |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last=Lowrie-Chin |first=Jean |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1 June 2004 |format= |work= |publisher=''The Jamaica Observer'' |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232744/http://jamaicaobserver.com/columns/html/20040531T000000-0500_60558_OBS_IF_SHEARER_HAD_REFUSED_LEE_CHIN___.asp |archivedate=26 September 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from McMaster, Lee-Chin worked briefly as a road engineer for the Jamaican government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/ua/alumni/gallery/leechin.htm |title=McMaster Alumni Association |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |work= |publisher= |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909080336/http://www.mcmaster.ca/ua/alumni/gallery/leechin.htm |archivedate=9 September 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
but unable to find work in his qualified field (and allegedly, because his Canadian wife did not like living in Jamaica), he returned to Canada where he began graduate studies in business. At first he worked as a bouncer, but later found employment as a financial advisor for [[Investors Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.com/en/main/home.asp?Disp=http://www.aic.com/en/Fund_managers/michael_lee-chin_bio.asp |title=Focus on Michael Lee-Chin |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |format= |work= |publisher=AIC |pages= }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee-Chin spent two years at the Investors Group, in the Hamilton, Ontario office and in 1979, moved to Regal Capital Planners and became regional manager. While at the company, in 1983, he secured a loan from the [[Continental Bank of Canada]] for C$500,000 to purchase a stake in Mackenzie Financial Group and formed Kicks Athletics with Andrew Gayle. By 1987, the investment was worth C$3.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20040206/business/business1.html |title=Michael Lee-Chin - Every mickle makes a muckle - The acquisition king |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author=Dennise Williams |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=6 February 2004 |work= |publisher=''Jamaica Gleaner'' |pages= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127095332/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20040206/business/business1.html |archivedate=27 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Lee-Chin took the proceeds from his Mackenzie investment to buy a [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]-based company called the Advantage Investment Council (a division of AIC Limited) for $200,000. At the time, the company had holdings of around C$800,000. He renamed the company AIC, and developed it to a fund that today controls around C$6 Billion, with hundreds of thousands of investors. Following the acquisition of AIC Limited, Lee-Chin set up the Berkshire group of companies – comprising an investment planning arm, a securities dealership and an insurance operation. By 2007, Berkshire amassed more than C$12 billion of assets under administration. In 2007, Manulife acquired Berkshire from Portland Holdings in exchange for shares, making Portland one of the largest shareholders of Manulife.

In 2009, Lee-Chin sold AIC Limited to Manulife for an undisclosed amount.  The following year, Manulife rebranded the heritage AIC funds and eliminated the AIC name from the mutual fund line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kiladze|first1=Tim|title=Manulife puts its stamp on AIC funds|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/funds-and-etfs/funds/manulife-puts-its-stamp-on-aic-funds/article1378458/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=29 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329030510/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/funds-and-etfs/funds/manulife-puts-its-stamp-on-aic-funds/article1378458/|archivedate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being the founder and Chairman of Portland Holdings Inc., Mr. Lee-Chin is Chairman and Director of Mandeville Holdings Inc. and Executive Chairman, CEO, and Portfolio Manager of Portland Investment Counsel Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/smart-money-capital-management-inc-mandeville-private-client-inc-democratizing-wealth-2229352.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wealthprofessional.ca/opinion/the-rules-of-wealth-217476.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investments 1990 - 2005===
In the late 1980s, AIC suffered from a collapse in the real estate market, in which it had invested. It recovered throughout the early 1990s by maintaining investments in large groups, such as [[Merrill Lynch]] and TD bank (formerly [[Toronto Dominion]]). This caused investments to grow from US$8 million in 1990 to nearly US$8 billion by 1998.

Lee-Chin was reluctant to invest in the dotcom boom, and saw AIC investments lose 8 per cent in value, even as the [[Standard &amp; Poor's|S&amp;P]] gained 56 per cent. Investors moved US$224 million out of AIC's flagship "Advantage Mutual Fund". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' ran an article predicting even more investors to leave the fund, meaning that they would run out of cash and be forced to sell its core holdings. Lee-Chin's response was to sell stock in Coca-Cola, and invest US$65 million into Mackenzie Holdings (the same firm in which he had invested US$400,000 16 years previously). Letters were sent to all 350,000 investors, explaining the strategy. The investors were calmed by the purchase, and the stock was later sold to Investor Group (the same company Lee-Chin had worked for in the 1980s) at more than twice the price AIC had paid for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1365/is_1_33/ai_89648488 |title=Buy, hold, and prosper - Cover Story - investment strategies |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last=Scott |first=Matthew |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=August 2002  |format= |work= |publisher=Black Enterprise |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 and 2001, following the dotcom crash, AIC outperformed the market with 26 per cent growth and 4 per cent decline respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0415/104_2.html |title=Get Rich Slow |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last=Helman |first=Christopher |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=15 April 2002 |work= |publisher=Forbes |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003, AIC was part of a regulatory investigation involving 105 Canadian mutual funds companies. In its review of AIC, investigators found no evidence of late trading and [[market timing]] activity by AIC staff. However, the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] (OSC) did find that over the 1999-2003 period, AIC permitted specific third party investors to engage in market timing trades in AIC Funds that generated profits of $127 million.  In the Settlement Agreement between AIC and the OSC, the OSC stated that "Accordingly, the conduct of AIC in failing to protect fully the best interests of the Relevant Funds in respect of the frequent trading market timing was contrary to the public interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Settlement Agreement: In the Matter of AIC Limited|url=http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/en/10508.htm|website=Ontario Securities Commission|accessdate=29 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717004956/http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/en/10508.htm|archivedate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in December 2004, AIC Limited was forced to return CAD $58.8 million to affected investors, which was the largest penalty imposed on any of the fund companies in the OSC investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Damsell|first1=Keith|title=Questions linger as investigation winds down|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/questions-linger-as-investigation-winds-down/article747904/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=29 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329092034/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/questions-linger-as-investigation-winds-down/article747904/|archivedate=29 March 2015|date=4 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2006, Lee-Chin announced his resignation as CEO of AIC, to be replaced by Jonathan Wellum, AIC's chief investment officer.

In 2005, two investment product managers offering structured products joined the Portland Holdings portfolio, Copernican Capital Corporation has offered retail investment products, primarily sold by brokers, and has raised more than C$800 million, in 10 closed end funds since its launch. Markland Street Asset Management, which launched the Oil Sands Sector Fund, raised C$430 million in one of Canada's largest closed-end IPOs.

===Private life===
In 1974, he married Vera Lee-Chin, a Ukrainian Canadian whom he had met at university. They parted in 1991, and officially separated (though did not divorce) in 1997. Ms. Lee-Chin has since contested the terms of the separation agreement, claiming that Lee-Chin did not disclose his actual wealth at the time of the separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.globeadvisor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/gam/20050530/RFUNDWATCH30 |title=Court reviews Lee-Chin split |accessdate=2006-08-24 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=30 May 2005 |format= |work= |publisher=''Globe Advisor'' |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had three children, Michael Jr., Paul, and Adrian.

Lee-Chin now lives with Sonya Hamilton, with whom he has [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal-twin]] daughters, Elizabeth and Maria, near Hamilton, Ontario.

==Philanthropy==
In 2003, he made headlines when he pledged to donate $30 million to the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) of which a third had been paid as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McArthur|first1=Greg|last2=Taylor|first2=Kate|last3=McNish|first3=Jacquie|title=Crystal Myths: Behind the ROM's philanthropic façade|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/crystal-myths-behind-the-roms-philanthropic-facade/article23653032/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also provided a $10 million gift to the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. The gift established the Michael Lee-Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. The Lee-Chin Institute's purpose is to help current and future business leaders integrate corporate citizenship into business strategy and practices.

In September 2014, Lee-Chin and his family donated $10 million to the Joseph Brant Hospital Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith |first1=Dennis |title=Michael Lee-Chin shares inspiration for largest donation in Burlington's history |url=http://www.insidehalton.com/news-story/4862905-michael-lee-chin-shares-inspiration-for-largest-donation-in-burlington-s-history/ |website=insideHatlon.com |publisher=Metroland Media |deadurl=yes |accessdate=30 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005035548/http://www.insidehalton.com/news-story/4862905-michael-lee-chin-shares-inspiration-for-largest-donation-in-burlington-s-history/ |archivedate=5 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Lee-Chin and family received the 2015 Association of Fundraising Professionals’ (Golden Horseshoe Chapter) National Philanthropy Award in the category of Outstanding Philanthropist&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehalton.com/community-story/6118044-three-burlington-philanthropists-honoured/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current fund growth and difficulties==

===Investment in Caribbean===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, [[Jamaica]] went through a period of financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2002/pn0298.htm |title=IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Jamaica |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=11 September 2002 |work= |publisher=IMF External Relations Department |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lee-Chin saw potential in his native country, and Portland purchased 75 per cent of the National Commercial Bank of Jamaica for 6 billion Jamaican dollars (US$127 million) from the Jamaican Government. In 2003, Senvia Money Services Inc., a global money transfer company, was established. This was followed in 2004, by the acquisition of AIC Financial Group Limited, headquartered in Trinidad.

In 2004, he announced plans to set up the AIC Caribbean Fund with the intention of investing in the entire Caribbean region. The stated aim of the fund is to raise US$1 billion in order to "make investments in businesses located in countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), with an emphasis on Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/Business/html/20060506T210000-0500_104130_OBS_LEE_CHIN_SECURES_US___M_FOR_CARIBBEAN_FUND_.asp |title=Lee Chin secures US$80m for Caribbean fund |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |format= |work= |publisher=''The Jamaica Observer'' |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514193818/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/Business/html/20060506T210000-0500_104130_OBS_LEE_CHIN_SECURES_US___M_FOR_CARIBBEAN_FUND_.asp |archivedate=14 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, it has made a number of large-scale investments.

In 2006, Portland acquired an 85 per cent controlling stake in the United General Insurance Company, the largest auto insurer in Jamaica, and renamed the firm Advantage General Insurance Company. A controlling interest in CVM Communications Group (consisting of radio and television stations and newspapers) was purchased at the same time. Portland partnered with the Canadian [[John Risley|Risley Group]] to form Columbus Communications Ltd – a Barbadian corporation that holds controlling interest in a number of telecommunications providers in the Caribbean including Cable Bahamas Ltd, Caribbean Crossings Ltd, Merit Communications Ltd, and FibralLink Jamaica Ltd.

In the tourism sector, Lee-Chin guided Portland through a number of acquisitions in the Caribbean. Among them were the hospitality operations of the Trident Villas and Spa in Jamaica, [[Reggae Beach]], and Blue Lagoon.

Portland's first acquisition in the health care industry sector was announced in July 2006, when Medical Associates Ltd., a privately held hospital in Kingston, Jamaica, joined the Portland Group.

===Commodities boom===
Similar to the experience of the late 1990s, Lee-Chin again has shied away from investing in commodities and the energy market boom. He has specifically stated that "We [AIC] do not like commodities-type businesses nor most high-tech companies simply because they are implicitly poor enterprises which we would not want to hold for the long term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.com/en/PDFs/AIC5007ENG.pdf#search=%22lee-chin%20aic%20energy%20commodities%22 |title=Messages - the Writings of Michael Lee-Chin |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last=Lee-Chin |first=Michael |authorlink= |format=PDF |work= |publisher=AIC |pages=116 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823140834/http://www.aic.com/en/PDFs/AIC5007ENG.pdf |archivedate=23 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, this strategy has meant that AIC has significantly underperformed the S&amp;P index, but Lee-Chin believes that the current boom is just another bubble. Lee-Chin describes the market since 1990 as "a series of rolling speculations", and now "we see a commodities bubble".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/finance/story.html?id=cd52918d-81bb-4433-90d9-f46a26f40452&amp;k=96424 |title=Lee-Chin sticks to his guns at AIC - Advantage fund focuses on wealth management |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author= |last=Folk |first=Levi |authorlink= |format= |work= |publisher=Canada.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208081840/http://www.canada.com/topics/finance/story.html?id=cd52918d-81bb-4433-90d9-f46a26f40452&amp;k=96424 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=8 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business strategy==
While at Investors Group, he studied the strategies of successful investors, such as [[Warren Buffett]], [[Benjamin Graham]] and [[Kenneth Thomson]]. Their [[buy and hold]] strategy is easily recognisable in the motto of AIC - ''Buy, hold and prosper''.

The '''National Intelligence Priorities Framework''', or '''NIPF''', is a [[classified information|classified]] national [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence]] document used by the top planners of the [[United States Intelligence Community]], such as the [[President of the United States]] and the [[Director of National Intelligence]], that summarizes the United States's intelligence gathering priorities.

The document was first put in use in 2003, but newer versions have been written.

Included in the NIPF's are the [[NSA]]'s foreign surveillance priorities. The top targets currently include [[China]], [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Afghanistan]], but there are many other countries on the list as well as [[Intergovernmental organizations]], such as the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].

* 200 [[History]]
* 300 [[Social sciences]]
* 400 [[Natural sciences]]
* 500 [[Technology]] and [[engineering]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1850">'''Pavao Tijan''' (born in [[Senj]] in 1908 - died in [[Madrid]] in 1997) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] encyclopaedist who spent the latter half of his life in [[Spain]]. 

Tijan was born in [[Senj]] in 1908. He attended the [[University of Zagreb]] where he finished a degree in Croatistics and Slavistics in 1930. He was subsequently a gymnasium professor. He edited ''Hrvatski jezik'' was also a member of the ''[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]'' project. He was a member of the [[Croatian Publishing and Bibliographic Institute]] and edited its publication ''[[Književni tjednik]]''. With the fall of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] in 1945 he fled from the oncoming [[Yugoslav Partisan]] army for fear of reprisal. He and members of his family travelled through [[Austria]] and settled in [[Rome]] where Tijan remained until 1947. From there he travelled to [[Madrid]], which remained his home for the rest of his life.

In 1993, Tijan returned to [[Zagreb]] and [[Senj]] for his first visit to [[Croatia]] in 48 years.&lt;ref name="MVPEI"&gt;[http://www.mvpei.hr/MVP.asp?pcpid=1385&amp;BV=2&amp;BID=160 Works of Pavao Tijan sent from Madrid to Zagreb]&lt;/ref&gt; Tijan was made an honorary citizen of Senj. He died in Madrid in 1997. In 2007, the [[Croatian Government]] had his written works brought to Zagreb from Madrid.&lt;ref name="MVPEI"/&gt;

The '''''petit appartement de la reine''''' ({{IPA-fr|pɛˈtit‿apaʁtəˈmɑ̃dəlaʁɛn|lang|}}) is a suite of rooms in the [[Palace of Versailles]]. These rooms, situated behind the ''[[grand appartement de la reine]]'', and which now open onto two interior courtyards, were the private domain of the [[Queen of France|Queens of France]], [[Maria Theresa of Spain]], [[Marie Leszczyńska]], and [[Marie-Antoinette]] as well as of the [[Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy|duchesse de Bourgogne]] as dauphine.
The rooms in the ''petit appartement de la reine'' have been restored to the condition in which they were left when Marie-Antoinette left Versailles on 6 October 1789, and while the rooms are mostly [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] style, some parts are [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], or [[Rococo]], like the fireplace mantel found in the s''upplément de la bibliothèque'', or the center table in the ''cabinet de la Méridienne'', as well as the mantel clock in the billard room.

==Marie-Thérèse==
At the completion of [[Louis Le Vau|Le Vau’s]] ''enveloppe'', [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Marie-Thérèse]]’s private area consisted of suite of five rooms that opened on the southern side of the ''cour de marbre'' and onto a small interior courtyard — at the time called the ''cour de la reine''.&lt;ref&gt;In 1683, after the death of Marie-Thérèse, the rooms that opened on the ''cour de marbre'' were incorporated into the ''[[appartement du roi]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  In these rooms, Marie-Thérèse led her private and family life.  Very little information survived about the décor or the arrangement of these rooms, owing largely to her early death in 1683 (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;253).

The most significant modifications to the ''petit appartement de la reine'' were made after the marriage of [[Louis XIV|Louis XIV's]] grandson, the duc de Bourgogne, with Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy in 1697.  Shortly after the marriage, in 1699, a suite of three rooms was constructed – known as the ''appartement de nuit du duc de Bourgogne'' (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;210).  These rooms were created for the conjugal visits of the young duc with his wife.  Consisting of a bedroom, cabinet, and garde-robe, this part of the ''petit appartement de la reine'' when constructed in 1699 divided the ''cour de la reine'' into the ''cour de Monseigneur'' to the west and the ''cour de Monsieur'' to the east (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;256).  These rooms also communicated with the ''[[appartement du roi]]'' and formed part of ''petit appartement de la reine'' and were used by the princess until her death in 1712.

==Maria Leszczyńska==

Under [[Marie Leszczyńska]], the ''petit appartement de la reine'' underwent three distinct phases of modification: 1728-1731; 1737–1739; and, 1746-1748.

The 1728-1731 phase resulted in the construction of a ''chambre des bains'' (1740 plan #8); the ''petite galerie'' (1740 plan #7); and an oratory (1740 plan #6) (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;401).

The 1737-1739 phase saw significant redecoration in the ''petite galerie'' with a décor of paneling in green and gold [[vernis Martin]].  At this time, the ''appartement de nuit du duc de Bourgogne'' was remodeled for use by the queen with the construction of the ''grand cabinet intérieur'' (1740 plan #9) and the ''arrière cabinet'' (1740 plan #10), both of which were decorated with intricately carved and painted paneling.  At this time, a number of paintings, most notably by [[François Boucher]] and [[Charles-Antoine Coypel]], were displayed in the ''petit appartement de la reine'' (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;402)

The 1746-1748 phase saw a redecoration of the ''petite galerie''. During this time it was called alternately ''cabinet des chinois'' – owing to the number of [[chinoiserie]] designs by the queen, which she had framed and hung in this room – or ''laboratoire'' – a laboratory where she pursued her hobbies.  At this time, the ''oratoire'' was converted in the ''cabinet de la Méridienne'' with new paneling by [[Jacques Verberckt]].   The ''pièce des bains'' was redecorated with paneling by the [[Rousseau brothers]] and paintings by [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].  The ''grand cabinet d’intérieur'' received new paneling by Verberckt&lt;ref&gt;The decoration of the ''arrière cabinet'' was retained at this time and it this décor that was retained by Marie-Antoinette and which is in place today.&lt;/ref&gt; (Jallut, 1969; Pons, 1992; Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;402-403).

With the death of Marie Leszczyńska in 1768, the ''petit appartement de la reine'' remained vacant until the arrival of the new dauphine, Marie-Antoinette, in 1770.

==Marie-Antoinette==
The fame of the ''petit appartement de la reine'' rests squarely in the hands of the last queen of France during the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''.  The restored state of the rooms seen today at Versailles closely replicate the ''petit appartement de la reine'' as it appeared during [[Marie-Antoinette]]’s day (Verlet, 1937).  Modifications of the ''petit appartement de la reine'' for Marie-Antoinette began in 1779 (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;585).

Marie-Antoinette ordered her favorite architect, [[Richard Mique]] to cover the walls of the ''petit appartement de la reine'' with white satin embroidered with floral [[arabesques]], to give a decorative cohesion to the rooms.  The cost of the fabric was 100,000 ''[[French livres|livres]]''; the hangings were entirely replaced with wood paneling in 1783 (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;586).

In 1781, to commemorate the birth of the first [[Louis-Joseph, Dauphin of France|dauphin]], [[Louis XVI]] commissioned Richard Mique to redecorate the ''cabinet de la Méridienne'' (1789 plan #6) (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;586).  It was in this room that Marie-Antoinette would choose the clothing she would wear that day.&lt;ref&gt;Books containing drawings of the queen’s dresses and other garments would be presented to Marie-Antoinette.  She would indicate her preference by inserting a pin into the page that depicted the dress she wanted to wear.  During the restoration of this room during the 1980s, when the flooring was removed, a number of pins were found.  Apparently, pins had either been dropped or had fallen out of the books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this same year, the ''bibliothèque'' – occupying the site of the ''petite galerie'' of Marie Leszczyńska – (1789 plan #7) and the ''supplément de la bibliothèque'' – occupying the ''pièce des bains'' of Maria Leszczyńska – (1789 plan #8), and, additionally, a room for the ''toilette à l’anglaise''&lt;ref&gt;The term ''toilette à l’anglaise'' refers to a flush toilet, similar to today’s modern convenience.&lt;/ref&gt; a ''pièce des bains'' and a ''salle des bains'' were arranged, opening on the ''cour de Monsieur'' (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;403).

The last major modification to the ''petit appartement de la reine'' occurred in 1783, when Marie-Antoinette ordered a complete redecoration of the ''grand cabinet intérieur''.  The costly embroidered hangings were replaced with carved gilt paneling by Richard Mique.  The new décor caused the room to be renamed the ''cabinet doré'' (Verlet 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;586).

Of all the features of the ''petit appartement de la reine'', the so-called secret passage that links the [[grand appartement de la reine]] with the ''appartement du roi'' is one that has become a legend in the history of Palace of Versailles.  The passage actually dates from the time of Marie-Thérèse, and had always been a suite of service rooms that also served as a private means by which the king and queen could communicate with each other&lt;ref&gt;The only other option would be to cross the public rooms, which were always crowded.&lt;/ref&gt; (1740 plan #1-4; 1789 plan #1-4).  It is true, however, that Marie-Antoinette, who was sleeping in the ''chambre de la reine'' in the ''grand appartement de la reine'', escaped from the Paris mob on the night of 5/6 October 1789 by using this route. The entrance to the so-called secret passage is through a door located on the west side of the north wall of the ''chambre de la reine''.&lt;ref&gt;Link to FLICKR site: https://www.flickr.com/photos/mymuk/4186000704&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7289">The '''Powell-Cotton ethnographic films''' is a collection of over 70 [[ethnographic film|ethnographic]], [[Documentary film|documentary]] and [[wildlife]] films made by the Powell-Cotton family between 1922 and 1973. The films relate exclusively to the family's expeditions in Africa during this time. The original films are held in the [[British Film Institute]] archives, and the [[Powell-Cotton Museum]] own copies contemporaneous with the originals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/5597 Powell-Cotton Photographic Collection Summary, Cornucopia: Museums Libraries Archives Council] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130707072843/http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/5597 |date=2013-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Between 1887 and 1939 [[Percy Powell-Cotton|Major Percy H G Powell-Cotton]] undertook a total of 28 expeditions to Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southernsudan.prm.ox.ac.uk/biography/cotton/ Percy Horace Gordon Powell-Cotton (1866-1940), Southern Sudan, Pitts Rivers Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the extensive collection of game and animal specimens he bought back, Major Powell-Cotton also shot several reels of 16mm film footage whilst out in the bush.

His films mainly depict African game and wildlife, as well as market scenes, craft making and tribal ceremonies from the African rural communities. One particular film, ''Gorilla Drive, Cameroons'', is believed to be the only one of its subject from this date in existence. It shows the mustering of the animals by the local people, their herding and despatch by the natives with spears.&lt;ref name="AxtonColin"&gt;Axton, Colin, Movie Film List, Powell-Cotton Museum, Quex Park, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell-Cotton made 17 films in total, either independently or together with his daughter Diana or wife Hannah. All the films are 16mm black and white silent films, made in a non-narrative documentary style. The major also shot all his films using a handheld, windup Bell &amp; Howell Filmo 70 camera, which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The first recorded use of colour film was in 1950’s in the film ''South Africa: Victoria Falls &amp; Livingstone Game Park'' made by Christopher and Diana Powell-Cotton.&lt;ref name="AxtonColin" /&gt;

Most of the films in the collection were made for private viewing only and for the purposes recording keeping from the expeditions. However, Major Powell-Cotton did present several of his films to the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]] in 1932, including ''Crafts in the Cameroons'' (1931) and ''Osonigbe Juju House and Benin Brass Cutting'' (1931).&lt;ref name="AxtonColin" /&gt;

==Angola==
The most notable films of the collection are those by Major Powell-Cotton’s daughters, [[Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton]] from their expeditions to Angola in 1936 and 1937.

The result of their trips was just under three hours of edited black-and-white 16mm film, accompanied by nearly 3,000 objects and 2,000 photographs. The films portray local ceremonies, craft-working and family life in rural Africa. Together they provide a unique record of the region at a crucial time in its history, before the full impact of the massive cultural changes brought about by missionization and colonial rule.&lt;ref name="aspiremuseum.nsms"&gt;[http://aspiremuseum.nsms.ox.ac.uk/case-study-1-powell-cotton-museum Case-study 1: Powell-Cotton Museum, Oxford Aspire Museums] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130706201930/http://aspiremuseum.nsms.ox.ac.uk/case-study-1-powell-cotton-museum |date=2013-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana and Antoinette filmed their entire footage on a single, small windup Kodak cine camera which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The sisters were not able to review or edit any footage on location, and so were constantly anxious they had not captured the events and activities in Angola successfully. They only edited their footage on their return, and would give private viewings accompanied by music and live narration to family members in their screen room which is now Gallery 4 in the Powell-Cotton museum.&lt;ref&gt;Diana and Antoinette – Angola 1936 &amp; 1937, Gallery 4, Powell-Cotton Museum, Quex Park, Birchington&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions and projects==
Some of the Powell-Cotton films are shown as part of the permanent exhibition at the [[Powell-Cotton Museum]].

The Angolan film collection by the Powell-Cotton sisters was also the focus of the special exhibition ‘Tala! Visions of Angola’ which was held at the Powell-Cotton Museum from May to November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quexmuseum.org/UserFiles/file/Press%20Release/Tala%20PR%20(2).pdf Tala! Visions of Angola, Press Release, Powell-Cotton Museum, April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was awarded National Lottery Heritage Funding and was co-curated with the Angolan Cultural Foundation and the Angolan Embassy. Commenting on the exhibition, the curators said:

“The objects we had access to, were made by somebody’s great grandmother or great grandfather. They deserve to be seen and remembered by their rightful ancestors as well as the wider public. Just as importantly, the Angolan community here in the UK have a right to be involved in the decisions made about the collection. This is after all their history.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quexmuseum.org/home/copy-of-museum.aspx Tala! Visions of Angola, Special Events and Exhibitions, Powell-Cotton Museum, Quex Park, official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with the exhibition, a research project entitled ‘Looking Back to Find Them Looking Forward: The Visionary Powell-Cotton Sisters’ and was in collaboration with the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]], University of Oxford.

The project and exhibition aimed to highlight the importance of the daughters collecting practises and material they brought back, especially their ethnographic films. As Oxford Aspire stated in an article on the project;

‘The sisters’ collecting practice was visionary in that it placed photography and film-making in a central role in the collection of material culture, something few other museum collections were doing at the time. As a result their collection represents a significant part of the film and museum heritage of the county. Until this new project, however, their achievements were not recognised in the galleries of the Powell-Cotton Museum.’&lt;ref name="aspiremuseum.nsms" /&gt;

'''Reifying Desire''' is a six-part video series by artist [[Jacolby Satterwhite]], which was on view in the 2014 Biennial at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. Satterwhite created 230 3D modeled versions of his body, animated figures, and his mothers drawings. He performs in this "utopian and non-political space", combining his public reactions to art history, political histories, and pop culture with his mother's private drawings and inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacolby.com/section/267514_Reifying_Desire.html|title=Jacolby Satterwhite - Reifying Desire|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520100813/http://jacolby.com/section/267514_Reifying_Desire.html|archivedate=2015-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Drawings and diagrams==
Satterwhite’s mother was schizophrenic and stayed home, unemployed, up until his teenage years. As a form of therapy, his mother drew pencil-on-paper drawings and diagrams for her potential product ideas after being inspired by late-night television infomercials. The drawings allowed for a future promise of financial security if they were able to be projected out into the public.

Satterwhite uses these drawings, along with the scrawled-out text accompanying them, and turns them into three-dimensional objects for his video series. Using [[Autodesk Maya]], a 3D-rendering program, the images are digitally traced by hand using a stylus to be then placed into a larger virtual landscape. Satterwhite pairs these drawings with other photographs, family videos, and his own pieces of dance and performance. The culmination of these elements results in an experience exploring memory, personal history, surrealism, narrative, psychology, and reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guernicamag.com/art/a-family-portrait/|title=A Family Portrait|author=Guernica Magazine|work=Guernica / A Magazine of Art &amp; Politics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517153929/https://www.guernicamag.com/art/a-family-portrait/|archivedate=2015-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital avatar==
Satterwhite’s digital avatar performs dance movements in this digitally created utopian realm, combining live action with digital creation. He combines elements of choreographer William Forsythe’s (b. 1949) dance techniques with anything from elements of martial arts and voguing. The body moves at impossible angles, freed from gravitational pull. His mother’s images are connected with his own body, art historical references, digitally rendered bodies, and fantastical structures. The special awareness of the physical realm existing between bodies and objects are reimagined and transformed, along with the world of images, and the shifting relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2014Biennial/JacolbySatterwhite|title=Jacolby Satterwhite|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507101411/http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2014Biennial/JacolbySatterwhite|archivedate=2015-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
From the start, Snoop was known for his [[gangsta rap]]s, [[G-funk]] beats, and reckless lifestyle. His popularity started back when he was a member of [[Death Row Records]], where he released his debut album Doggystyle. The album sold more copies than any debut album ever had, making “Snoop Doggy Dogg” a well-known name.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Eithne. Nuthin’ but a “G” Thang: The Culture and Commerce of Gangsta Rap, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though he was famous for being “gangsta,” Snoop had shown that he wanted peace as well; especially after he just missed a conviction for murder in 1996 which helped him further himself even more from all the conflict happening in the industry around that time.&lt;ref&gt;Raj. “The Day Snoop Dogg &amp; Tupac Stopped Seeing Eye To Eye.” The Smoking Section, May 14, 2013. http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2013/05/snoop-dogg-talks-tupac-beef.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, his peaceful and nonviolent state of mind became more evident, as he decided to begin participating the Rastafari faith, give himself a new name, and take on a new style of music.

==Plot==
As most of those who follow the [[Rastafari]] faith do, Snoop decided to go through a transformation into his new self; his new, Rastafari self.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Charles. ''Becoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica''. NYU Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnated documents Snoop Dogg’s transition into Snoop Lion, which involved him taking a trip to Jamaica to make a reggae album and discover more about the Rastafari faith. The documentary starts out by exploring Snoop’s past; his time on Death Row Records, the loss of his friends Tupac and Nate Dogg, and the murder accusation.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Marlow. “VICE Filmmaker Andy Capper on Snoop Lion Doc, Chief Keef Series, More.” The Daily Beast, March 15, 2013. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/15/vice-filmmaker-andy-capper-on-snoop-lion-doc-chief-keef-series-more.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus then shifts to his spiritual journey and new style of music. While in Jamaica, Snoop collaborated with a few famous reggae artists, including [[Bunny Wailer]] and [[Diplo]], to create the [[Reincarnated (album)|''Reincarnated'']] album, which focuses on love and [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Jonah. “The Lion Smokes Tonight.” ''Rolling Stone'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Wailer was Snoop’s guide throughout the trip, leading him through his journey into Rastafari. The film includes many intimate moments with Snoop, where he discusses his personal thoughts and reasons for becoming Rasta. The documentary also includes the heavy marijuana smoking in which Snoop participated, which is a common practice among Rastafari, and a common stereotype of how they practice their faith as well.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Charles. ''Becoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica''. NYU Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film was directed and produced by [[Andy Capper]] of ''[[Vice Magazine]]''. Capper followed Snoop to Jamaica to record the transformation, and gathered intimate interview footage with him as well. Roughly 200 hours of footage was shot, which was then edited in a two-month span. The documentary was aired at SXSW and The Toronto International Film Festival in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Marlow. “VICE Filmmaker Andy Capper on Snoop Lion Doc, Chief Keef Series, More.” The Daily Beast, March 15, 2013. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/15/vice-filmmaker-andy-capper-on-snoop-lion-doc-chief-keef-series-more.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“‘Reincarnated’ Is Premiering at TIFF | VICE Canada.” VICE.

==Reception==
In a review from ''[[The New York Times]]'', writer Andy Webster states, “enlightenment isn’t as evident here as much as a woozy weariness, perhaps a long-term byproduct of being very, very stoned,” regarding the authenticity of Snoop’s journey throughout the film.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Andy. “Snoop Dogg, Now Snoop Lion, in ‘Reincarnated.’” ''The New York Times'', March 14, 2013, sec. Movies. https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/movies/snoop-dogg-now-snoop-lion-in-reincarnated.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', writer Mikael Wood explains that the documentary does not teach viewers anything new about Snoop, and that it seems like “just another component in the new album's marketing plan.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Mikael. “Review: ‘Reincarnated’ Gets Personal with Snoop Lion.” ''Los Angeles Times'', March 14, 2013. http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/14/entertainment/la-et-ms-snoop-dogg-reincarnated-review-snopp-lion-20130315.&lt;/ref&gt; In two other reviews by Shaka Griffith &lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Shaka. “I’m ‘Putting Up A Resistance’ To Snoop’s Reggae Transformation.” GlobalGrind.com, August 21, 2012. http://globalgrind.com/2012/08/01/putting-resistance-snoop-lion-reggae-transformation-shaka-griffith-blog/.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rich Cline,&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Rich. “Reincarnated.” Accessed January 19, 2014. http://www.contactmusic.com/movie-review/reincarnated.&lt;/ref&gt; there was mention of lack of authenticity as well; neither could say if the transformation should really be taken seriously. After the film was released, Bunny Wailer made a statement where he indicted Snoop of “outright fraudulent use” of the Rastafari faith.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Jonah. “The Lion Smokes Tonight.” ''Rolling Stone'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Road to Morocco''''' is a 1942 American [[comedy film]] starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]], and featuring [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Dona Drake]].  The film, which was written by [[Frank Butler (writer)|Frank Butler]] and Don Hartman and directed by [[David Butler (director)|David Butler]] for [[Paramount Pictures]], is the third of the "''[[Road to …]]''" films. It was preceded by ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941) and followed by ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' (1946). The story is about two fast-talking guys castaway on a desert shore and sold into [[slavery]] to a beautiful princess. The setting is in [[Morocco]].

==Plot==
{{plot|date=November 2011}}
The film opens with a freighter at sea exploding and news announcements. The cause of the explosion is a mystery, with all crew accounted for with the exception of two unidentified stowaways.

Jeff Peters ([[Bing Crosby]]) and Orville 'Turkey' Jackson ([[Bob Hope]]) are seen floating at sea aboard a pile of wreckage. It was Jeff's idea to stow away, but it was Orville 'smoking in the powder room' that caused the explosion. As the two joke about eating one another to survive, they spot land in the distance.

As they sit on the beach, Orville reminds Jeff of his promise to Aunt Lucy, to take care of him. Jeff reminds him that Aunt Lucy died before he could agree.  They are interrupted by a convenient camel, and they hitch a ride.

Once in the city, they are nearly run over by Arabs shooting guns, led by the sheik Mullay Kasim ([[Anthony Quinn]]). Jeff and Orville learn the sheik is pursuing a princess for marriage. Orville is approached by a group of bearers carrying someone in a veiled box. A beautiful hand takes his and then leaves, with Orville in pure bliss. In a restaurant, Jeff and Orville eat heartily, while trying to figure out how to get past the knife-wielding owner without paying. A man ([[Dan Seymour]]) takes Jeff aside and hands over a great deal of money. Orville is happy to be able to pay for the meal, until he learns that Jeff 'sold' him. Orville is furious, especially since neither of them know why the man bought him.  Jeff calms him down and tells Orville he'll buy him back, eventually; and two men throw a hood over Orville and carry him off.

A week later, Jeff is woken by a vision of Aunt Lucy (played by a harp-wielding Bob Hope) who shames him for his act. Jeff says he tried to buy Orville back, but learned he was re-sold to someone else. Aunt Lucy tells him he has to find Orville, and recommends singing Orville's favorite song.

Jeff walks through the street singing, (accompanied by Aunt Lucy's ghost) until a note, with Orville's locket is tossed at him from the palace window. The note, written by Orville, says he's being tortured and warns Jeff of danger. Jeff, thinking Orville is in trouble, scales the palace wall. Hearing a woman singing, Jeff sneaks into the palace and see a lot of beautiful girls dancing for the beautiful Princess Shalmar ([[Dorothy Lamour]]) and singing to a very relaxed Orville.

Jeff storms in and is grabbed by guards. Orville feigns ignorance and tries to send him away. The princess dismisses everyone, except for Jeff. Orville admits the truth, but it's clear he's still mad at Jeff. He says he and the princess are to be married. Jeff is surprised, but the princess says her wise man read the stars and told her to marry Orville. She was the one that passed Orville in the veiled box, and also the one that purchased him. As she plants a passionate kiss on Orville, Jeff decides to stick around; a decision that almost brings him and Orville to blows, but the princess invites Jeff to stay.

As Orville is waited on by beautiful girls, he learns from one of them, Mihirmah ([[Dona Drake]]), the princess was supposed to marry Kasim ([[Anthony Quinn]]), but also tells Orville she loves him too. Jeff breaks up the party and confronts Orville, who has Jeff thrown out.

Jeff wanders the palace singing, an act that attracts the princess and they go on a moonlit walk. Mihirmah tries to get Orville to run away with her. Jeff tries to tell the princess that HE was the one sold and should be marrying her, but he is interrupted by a sword-wielding Orville.

The next morning an angry Kasim confronts Princess Shalmar for marrying someone else. He is prepared to kill Orville but the princess takes him to the wise man Hyder Kahn ([[Vladimir Sokoloff]]). Hyder Khan said he had read the stars and found that Princess Shalmar's first husband is destined to die a violent death within a week of the marriage, and the second husband would be blessed with long life and happiness. The princess tells Kasim that Orville is the first husband, and when he dies, she'll happily marry Kasim and they will live in happiness.  Kasim finally understands and embraces the princess.

Orville finds out about the prophecy and runs to Jeff and convinces him that the princess actually loves him and he's going to run off with Mihirmah. Later that night, Orville is visited and shamed by Aunt Lucy's spirit, but Orville refuses to tell Jeff the truth. Meanwhile, the wise man realizes that he had been misreading the stars due to fireflies in his telescope; his prophecies are incorrect.

Princess Shalmar refuses to marry Jeff, even though Orville is eager to get out of the marriage. The princess sends Orville away to get ready for the wedding.  The wise man runs in and tells the princess and Jeff of the incorrect prophecy.  The princess is happy and tells Jeff now she can marry him and not Kasim. Jeff realizes why Orville was so eager to get out of the marriage, but decides not to tell him. Instead he says the princess changed her mind, and Orville is only too eager to accept. Meanwhile, the wise man's assistant tells Kasim, who rallies his men.

The Princess and Jeff decide to get married in the U. S., accompanied by Orville and Mihirmah but they are confronted by Kasim, who takes the princess and gives Mihirmah to one of his men. Jeff and Orville try to use their 'patty-cake' routine on Kasim, but it backfires. They escape into the palace with the girls but are found and captured.

Kasim takes the women and strands Jeff and Orville in the desert. They wander aimlessly, seeing a [[drive-in|drive-in restaurant]], but it's a mirage. They see a vision of a singing Princess Shalmar, which spurs them onward. They find an oasis which is near Kasim's camp. They try to sneak in, but are captured.  They see another set of horsemen and learn it is an enemy sheik who was invited as a token of peace. They manage to escape and set the two sheiks against each other. In the chaos Jeff and Orville grab the girls and escape.

Later, on a boat home, Orville sneaks into the powder room for a cigarette. There is an explosion and then we see all four afloat a pile of wreckage.  Fortunately, they are near New York harbor.

==Reception==
The film was placed at No. 4 in the list of [[1942 in film|top-grossing movies]] for 1942 in the USA.

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' liked it: "Let us be thankful that Paramount is still blessed with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and that it has set its cameras to tailing these two irrepressible wags on another fantastic excursion, ''Road to Morocco'', which came to the Paramount yesterday. For the screen, under present circumstances, can hold no more diverting lure than the prospect of Hope and Crosby ambling, as they have done before, through an utterly slaphappy picture, picking up Dorothy Lamour along the way and tossing acid wisecracks at each other without a thought for reason or sense...The short of it is that ''Road to Morocco'' is a daffy, laugh-drafting film. And you’ll certainly agree with the camel which, at one point, offers the gratuitous remark, “This is the screwiest picture I was ever in.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowther|first1=Bosley|title=The New York Times|date=November 12, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented: "Crosby, Hope and Lamour have done it again. Their click in ''Road to Singapore'' and ''Road to Zanzibar'' is eclipsed by ''Road to Morocco''... Crosby, of course, is still more or less straighting for Hope’s incessantly steaming gags. The two have never teamed better, nor have they, seemingly, romped with such abandon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variety|date=October 7, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1908">The '''Short Annals of Tirconaill''' is an Irish [[annal]], or annual record, with entries dating from 1241 to 1650, but with numerous gaps, such as 1241 to 1423. Its authors are unknown; historian [[Paul Walsh (priest)|Paul Walsh]] speculated that it had several scribes over the course of some four hundred years, ending in 1650 or the years immediately after.

== Anatomy and physiology ==

=== General [[batoidea]] characteristics ===
Skates are cartilaginous fishes like other [[Chondrichthyes]], however, skates, like rays and other [[Rajiformes]], have a flat body shape with flat [[pectoral fins]] that extend the length of their body.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/fish/discover/rays-skates/anatomy/|title=Ray &amp; Skate Anatomy :: Florida Museum of Natural History|website=www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of the skate's dorsal body is covered by rough skin made of placoid scales. [[Fish scale|Placoid scales]] have a pointed tip that is oriented caudally and are homologous to teeth. Their mouths are located on the underside of the body, with a jaw suspension common to Batoids known as euhyostyly.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-802850-6.00002-3|title=Chondrichthyes 1|last=Berkovitz|first=Barry|last2=Shellis|first2=Peter|pages=5–27|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-802850-6.00002-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skate's [[Gill slit|gill slits]] are located ventrally as well, but dorsal [[Spiracle|spiracles]] allow the skate to be partially buried in floor sediment and still complete respiratory exchange.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bustamante|first=Carlos|last2=Lamilla|first2=Julio|last3=Concha|first3=Francisco|last4=Ebert|first4=David A.|last5=Bennett|first5=Michael B.|date=2012-06-29|title=Morphological Characters of the Thickbody Skate Amblyraja frerichsi (Krefft 1968) (Rajiformes: Rajidae), with Notes on Its Biology|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039963|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=6|pages=e39963|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0039963|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also located on the dorsal side of the skate are their two eyes which allow for predator awareness.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In addition to their pectoral fins, skates have a first and second [[dorsal fin]], [[Fish fin|caudal fin]] and paired [[Pelvic fin|pelvic fins]]. Distinct from their rhomboidal shape is a long fleshy slender tail. While skate anatomy is similar to other Batoidea, features such as their electric organ and mermaids purse create clear distinctions.

=== Skate specific characteristics ===

==== Mermaids purse ====
Skates produce their young in an egg case called [[Egg case (Chondrichthyes)|Mermaids Purse]]. These egg cases have distinct characteristics that are individualized to each species&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mabragaña|first=E.|last2=Vazquez|first2=D. M.|last3=Gabbanelli|first3=V.|last4=Sabadin|first4=D.|last5=Barbini|first5=S. A.|last6=Lucifora|first6=L. O.|date=2017-09-01|title=Egg cases of the graytail skate Bathyraja griseocauda and the cuphead skate Bathyraja scaphiops from the south-west Atlantic Ocean|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.13380/abstract|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=968–974|doi=10.1111/jfb.13380|issn=1095-8649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259293771_Descriptions_Of_Skate_Egg_Cases_Chondrichthyes_Rajiformes_Rajoidei_From_The_Eastern_North_Pacific|title=Descriptions Of Skate Egg Cases (Chondrichthyes: Rajiformes: Rajoidei) From The Eastern North Pacific|last=Ebert|first=David|last2=Davis|first2=Chante|date=2007-01-18|volume=1393}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This makes a great tool for identifying different species of skates. One of these identifiable structures, is the keel. The keel is a flexible ridge that runs along the outside of the structure. Another characteristic is the number of embryos in the egg case. Some species contain only one embryo while others can have up to seven. The size of the fibrous shell around the case is another characteristic. Some species have thick layers on the exterior, however other species don't even have the presence of this layer.

==== Electric organ ====
[[File:Skate EO cross section .png|thumb|The fibers of the skate electric organ are embedded in the muscles located lateral to the notochord in the tail.]]
&lt;p&gt;The [[Electric organ (biology)|electric organ]] (EO) is a characteristic exclusive to aquatic species. Among the Chondrichthyes, the only species to possess electric organs are the electric ray and the skate. Unlike many other electrogenic fishes, the skate is unique in that it has two paired electric organs, which run longitudinal through the tail in the lateral musculature of the notochord.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Macesic, Laura J.; Kajiura. [https://ac-els-cdn-com.ezproxy.plu.edu/S0944200609000415/1-s2.0-S0944200609000415-main.pdf?_tid=6c0aa05d-3fe2-4e48-b54c-8ea6e8ec16f0&amp;acdnat=1520660619_b15532925236ba6af4e8155355cb1be0 "Electric organ morphology and function in the lesser electric ray, Narcine brasiliensis"] (PDF). ''Zoology''. '''112''': 442–450 – via ScienceDirect.&lt;/ref&gt; The impulses put out by the electric organs of the skate are considered to be weak, asynchronous, long-lasting signals.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koester|first=David M.|title=Anatomy and motor pathways of the electric organ of skates|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ar.a.10076|journal=The Anatomical Record|volume=273A|issue=1|pages=648–662|doi=10.1002/ar.a.10076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the anatomy of the skate EO is now commonly studied and well understood, there is not enough strong evidence to suggest what the actual function of the EO is. Some research suggests the electric impulses are too weak to be a mechanism used for defense or hunting. It is also too irregular to be useful for electrolocation purposes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The most reasonable explanation in the literature suggests that the electric organ discharges may be used as a form of communication used for reproduction purposes. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
== Behavior and ecology ==

=== Diet / Feeding ===
The majority of skates feed on bottom dwelling animals, such as shrimp, crab, oyster, clams, and other invertebrates. To feed on these animals they have grinding plates in their mouths. Filter feeding rays that eat plankton have [[Gill raker|gill rakers]].  Skates are an influential part of the food webs of demersal marine communities. They utilize similar resources to those of other upper trophic-level marine predators, such as seabirds, marine mammals, and sharks. The flattened body shape, ventral eyes and well developed spiracles of the skate allows them to live benthically, buried in the sediment or using a longitudinal undulation of the pectoral fins known as Rajiform locomotion to glide along the water floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/308649613|title=Fins into limbs : evolution, development, and transformation|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Hall, Brian K. (Brian Keith), 1941-|isbn=9780226313405|location=Chicago|oclc=308649613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research suggests that some species of skates, in addition to their [[Fish locomotion|Rajiform locomotion]], use their pelvic fins to perform ambulatory locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucifora|first=Luis O.|last2=Vassallo|first2=Aldo I.|date=2002-09-01|title=Walking in skates (Chondrichthyes, Rajidae): anatomy, behaviour and analogies to tetrapod locomotion|url=https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/77/1/35/2639754|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=77|issue=1|pages=35–41|doi=10.1046/j.1095-8312.2002.00085.x|issn=0024-4066}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of locomotion performed by the skate is being explored as a possible origin for our own development of walking by looking for similar neural pathways used for movement between skates and animals walking on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jung|first=Heekyung|last2=Baek|first2=Myungin|last3=D’Elia|first3=Kristen P.|last4=Boisvert|first4=Catherine|last5=Currie|first5=Peter D.|last6=Tay|first6=Boon-Hui|last7=Venkatesh|first7=Byrappa|last8=Brown|first8=Stuart M.|last9=Heguy|first9=Adriana|date=2018-02|title=The Ancient Origins of Neural Substrates for Land Walking 3|journal=Cell|volume=172|issue=4|pages=667–682.e15|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.013 |pmc=5808577|pmid=29425489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution and habitats ===
Skates are primarily found from the intertidal down to depths greater than 3,000 meters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=David A.|last2=Compagno|first2=Leonard J. V.|date=2007-10-01|title=Biodiversity and systematics of skates (Chondrichthyes: Rajiformes: Rajoidei)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-007-9247-0|journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes|language=en|volume=80|issue=2-3|pages=111–124|doi=10.1007/s10641-007-9247-0|issn=0378-1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are most commonly found along outer continental shelves and upper slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=David A.|last2=Bizzarro|first2=Joseph J.|date=2007-10-01|title=Standardized diet compositions and trophic levels of skates (Chondrichthyes: Rajiformes: Rajoidei)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-007-9227-4|journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes|language=en|volume=80|issue=2-3|pages=221–237|doi=10.1007/s10641-007-9227-4|issn=0378-1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically more diverse at higher latitudes and in deep-water. In fact, skates are the only cartilaginous fish taxon to exhibit more diversity of species at higher latitudes. A cool, temperate to polar water in the deep sea can be a favorable environment for skates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=David|last2=Davis|first2=Chante|date=2003|title=Descriptions of skate egg cases (Chondrichthyes: Rajiformes: Rajoidei) from the eastern North Pacific|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Ebert5/publication/312078878_Descriptions_of_skate_egg_cases_Chondrichthyes_Rajiformes_Rajoidei_from_the_eastern_North_Pacific/links/5870868f08ae8fce491df2f1/Descriptions-of-skate-egg-cases-Chondrichthyes-Rajiformes-Rajoidei-from-the-eastern-North-Pacific.pdf|journal=Zootaxa|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the water becomes more shallow and warmer, skates are seen to be replaced by stingrays. Skates are absent from brackish and freshwater environments. However, there is a single estuarine species that has been found in Tasmania, Australia. Some skate fauna have been found inhabiting areas of rock cobble and high rocky relief.

== Lifecycle ==
[[File:Big skate 4 embryos.jpg|thumb|Four developing embryos located in an opened [[big skate]] [[Egg case (Chondrichthyes)|egg case (mermaid's purse)]]]]

=== Reproduction ===
Skates mate at the same nursery ground each year. In order to fertilize the egg, males use [[Clasper|claspers]], a structure attached to the pelvic fins. The claspers allow them to direct the flow of semen into the female's [[cloaca]]. Skates are [[Oviparity|oviparous]], meaning they lay eggs with very little development in the mother. This is one major difference from rays, which are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], meaning they give birth to live young. When a female skate is fertilized, a protected case forms around the embryo called an [[Egg case (Chondrichthyes)|egg case]], or more commonly mermaid's purse. This egg case is then deposited out of the mother's body onto the ocean floor where the skates develop for up to 15 months before they enter the external environment.

Skates belong to the ancient lineage of [[cartilaginous fish]]es. Fossil [[Dermal denticle|denticle]]s (tooth-like scales in the skin) resembling that of today's [[chondrichthyan]]s date at least as far back as the [[Ordovician]], with the oldest unambiguous fossils of [[cartilaginous fish]] dating from the middle [[Devonian]]. A [[clade]] within this diverse family, the [[Neoselachii]], emerged by the [[Triassic]], with the best-understood neoselachian fossils dating from the [[Jurassic]]. This [[clade]] is represented today by [[shark]]s, [[sawfish]], [[ray (fish)|ray]]s and skates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/basalfish/chondrofr.html UCMP Berkeley "Chondrichthyes: Fossil Record"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy ==
Skates have more valid species (574) than any other group of cartilaginous fishes. Since 1950, 126 skate species have been discovered. Five scientists take credit for the rapid increase of findings. The [[Rajiformes|Rajidae]] are considered monophyletic because of their similarity in appearance. There are 13 genera and about 245 valid species. However, there is little information about the diets of about 24% of these species. There are at least 45 dubious species of skates worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The skate belongs to the class [[Chondrichthyes]]. This class consists of all the cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and stingrays. Chondrichthyes is divided into two subclasses, the one including skates, rays, and shark is the subclass [[Elasmobranchii]]. Skates are the most diverse [[Elasmobranchii|elasmobranch]] group, comprising over 20% of the known species. The number of species is likely to increase as taxonomic issues are resolved and new species are identified.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Skates versus stingrays==
Skates are like stingrays in that they have five pairs of gill slits that are located ventrally, which means on the underside of their body (unlike sharks that have their gills located on their sides). Skates and rays both have pectoral fins that are flat and expanded, which are typically fused to the head. Both skates and stingrays typically have their eyes on top of their head. Skates also share similar feeding habits with rays.

Skates are different from rays in that they lack a whip-like tail and stinging spines. However, some skates have electric organs located in their tail. The main difference between skates and rays is that skates lay eggs, whereas rays give birth to live young.

Moreover, skates can be more abundant than rays, and are fished for food in some parts of the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marine Biology 10th Edition|last=Castro|first=Peter|last2=Huber|first2=Michael|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2017|isbn=978-1-259-25199-3|location=Singapore|pages=155–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Rajidae swmimming.jpg|thumb|right|Skates swim with their pectoral fins]]

==Conservation==
Skates have slow growth rates and, since they mature late, low reproductive rates. As a result, skates are vulnerable to [[overfishing]] and appear to have been overfished and are suffering reduced population levels in many parts of the world. The [[barndoor skate]], ''Dipturus laevis'', is currently listed with the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] as vulnerable due to being severely overfished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/gallery/descript/bigskate/bigskate.html Florida Museum of Natural History]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the [[barndoor skate]], [[bottlenose skate]], and [[maltese skate]] to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suomalaisen Sana-Lugun Coetus''' (1745) by [[Daniel Juslenius]] was the first comprehensive dictionary of the [[Finnish language]]. It contains about 16 000 words of the Finnish language, at the end of which is a Swedish list of words. The dictionary contains a lot of artificial neologisms from the 18th century.

The dictionary was republished in 1917 by Salomon Kreander and Juhana Canstrén and edited by A.V. Koskimies. A facsimile of the dictionary was published in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jyu.fi/fennicum/arvokirjat/sanaluguncoetus.htm Suomalaisen Sana-Lugun Coetus] (Fennicumin arvokirjat) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050214024907/http://www.jyu.fi/fennicum/arvokirjat/sanaluguncoetus.htm archived]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is credited for inventing the [[Professional wrestling holds#Dragon sleeper|dragon sleeper]] and the [[Suplex#Full nelson suplex|dragon suplex]]. He is also the owner and founder of the [[Dradition]] wrestling promotion. Fujinami is most well known for his long tenure with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], where he was a six-time [[IWGP Heavyweight Champion]]. In 2015, Fujinami was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], while also signing on as an ambassador for the company. [[Bret Hart]] said of Fujinami: "I always wanted to be the great wrestler that Tatsumi Fujinami was".&lt;ref&gt;''Bret Hitman Hart – The Dungeon Collection'' (Documentary film). U.S.A; Canada: WWE (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Japanese Wrestling Association (1971–1972) ===
Fujinami started in the old [[Japanese Wrestling Association]] (JWA) under [[Antonio Inoki]]'s wing at the age of 17. When Inoki was fired from JWA in 1971, Fujinami and a few others followed him in forming a new promotion, [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]. Inoki, Fujinami, [[Osamu Kido]] and [[Kotetsu Yamamoto]] are recognized as NJPW's founding fathers.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1972–2006) ===
In those early days, he served as opponent for debuting rookies, such as [[Tetsuo Sekigawa|Mr. Pogo]], [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]] and [[Gran Hamada]]. Fujinami, Fujiwara, Hamada and three other rookies competed in the 1974 ''[[Karl Gotch]] Cup'' (a tournament for rookies, forerunner to the later ''Young Lions Cup'').

In the late 1970s, Fujinami was sent abroad, to [[Mexico]]'s [[Universal Wrestling Association]] and to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] in the U.S. In the late 1970s he went to the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) where he first made a name for himself. He won his first title, the [[WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship|WWWF Junior Heavyweight Championship]], on January 23, 1978, by defeating [[José Estrada Sr.|José Estrada]] in [[Madison Square Garden]],&lt;ref name=SlamQuestions&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2017/04/20/22719032.html|title=10 questions with Tatsumi Fujinami|last=Oliver|first=Greg|date=2017-04-20|accessdate=2017-05-15|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwi-online.com/pages/wrestlingyears.html Untitled Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and brought it to Japan, establishing it as the premier junior heavyweight title in Japan. In 1981, he was moved to the heavyweight division to make room for [[Satoru Sayama|Tiger Mask]] in the junior heavyweight division.&lt;ref name=SlamQuestions/&gt; Fujinami would be the first wrestler to be successful in both the junior heavyweight and heavyweight divisions.

1988 proved to be Fujinami's banner year. On May 8, he defeated [[Big Van Vader]] by disqualification, to win the title vacated by Antonio Inoki. However, within days, the title was held up after he fought [[Riki Choshu]] to a no contest; he would win the title back a month later in the rematch. In October, he won the [[NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship]], and he ended the year by winning the [[WCWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in December.

1989 proved to be a heartbreaking year for Fujinami. In April, he vacated the title to be determined in a tournament at New Japan's first [[Tokyo Dome]] show; he would lose to eventual winner Big Van Vader in the semi-finals. In June, during a match with Vader, Fujinami suffered a severe back injury and pulled a hernia. He wouldn't wrestle at all until he returned in September 1990, changing his kanji from "辰巳" to "辰爾" (both are pronounced Tatsumi).

In December 1990, he regained the title he never lost, the IWGP Heavyweight title from Choshu. His reign was short-lived, as he lost the title to Vader a month later. Fujinami rebounded by regaining the title two months later. Within days, Fujinami made history, as he defeated [[Ric Flair]] to win the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], making him the very first man to hold the IWGP and NWA World titles simultaneously.

His "most remembered" match in the U.S. was when he defended his NWA World Heavyweight title against [[Ric Flair]] in a title vs. title re-match at the first ever [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] [[SuperBrawl I]] in [[Florida]] after a controversial match in [[Japan]] that March.  Flair retained his WCW Championship and regained Fujinami's NWA title by a school boy pin with a handful of tights.

In 1993, Fujinami won the [[G1 Climax]] tournament, defeating [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]], [[Osamu Kido]], [[Keiji Mutoh]], and [[Hiroshi Hase]] to win the tournament. In April 1994, he defeated [[Shinya Hashimoto]] to win his fifth IWGP Heavyweight title, but lost it back to Hashimoto three weeks later. In January 1997, he reunited with Kengo Kimura to win the IWGP Tag Team titles from [[Masahiro Chono]] and [[Hiroyoshi Tenzan]]. They would hold onto the belts for over three months before losing them to Riki Choshu and [[Kensuke Sasaki]]. In April 1998, Fujinami won his sixth and final IWGP Heavyweight title by defeating Sasaki. He would hold onto the belt for over four months, before losing the title to Chono.

In recent years Fujinami has decreased his work load upon being named President of NJPW in 1999 (he was nevertheless ousted in 2004). His last title reign in NJPW was an [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] with disciple [[Osamu Nishimura]] in October 2001, and his last title shot ever was a [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]] bout against [[Keiji Mutoh]] in December of the same year (Mutoh had not affiliated himself exclusively with AJPW at the time).

In 2006, after nearly 35 years in the company, Fujinami left NJPW, after giving an ultimatum of either Riki Choshu leave or Fujinami leave. New Japan stuck with Choshu, causing Fujinami to leave. Another veteran and Fujinami's long-time tag team partner, [[Kengo Kimura]], would follow suit.

=== Muga World Pro Wrestling / Dradition (2006–present) ===
Recently he and Nishimura began running their [[Dradition|Muga promotion]] again, focusing on pure catch wrestling which seems to have been relegated by NJPW. In a tag team dream match, Fujinami, along with his close friend Nishimura beat [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] and [[Go Shiozaki]] in the main event of the first "Muga World" show. The name of Fujinami's new promotion has since been changed to Dradition, after the departure of Nishimura.

===Dramatic Dream Team (2012)===
On August 18, 2012, Fujinami won his first title in eleven years, when he took part in [[Dramatic Dream Team]]'s 15th anniversary event in [[Nippon Budokan]], during which he and [[Kyohei Mikami|Mikami]] defeated [[Kudo (wrestler)|Kudo]] and [[Makoto Oishi]] for the [[KO-D Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=DDT081812/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/fight/headlines/20120819-00000016-dal-fight.html|script-title=ja:藤波が11年ぶり戴冠！武道館で躍動|date=2012-08-19|work=Sports Navi|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=2012-08-19|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823093319/http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/fight/headlines/20120819-00000016-dal-fight.html|archivedate=2012-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujinami remains an active competitor even at the age of 63 and shows little sign of slowing down.

'''''The Barbecue Bible''''' by [[Steven Raichlen]] (1998, [[Workman Publishing|Workman]]), is the flagship title in a series of cookbooks written on [[grilling]], [[barbecue]], and other forms of [[outdoor cooking]]. Rather than focusing specifically on one style of barbecue, Raichlen documented four years worth of travels along what he considered the great "barbecue belts" in the world, which he categorized as North America/Caribbean, South America, Central Asia/Middle East, Mediterranean Europe, the western regions of Africa from Morocco to South Africa, and the eastern Pacific Rim from Korea to Indonesia. In addition to grill recipes for both meat and vegetables, the book includes substantial information on side dishes, drinks, and desserts, as well as numerous sidebars detailing Raichlen's experiences while researching the book.

The second edition of the flagship book was released in May 2008, and incorporated substantial amounts of color photography in a style similar to the earlier ''How To Grill'' book.

The books do not tie in directly to Raichlen's television show ''Barbecue U'', although they do share the same subject matter.

==Other books in series==
In addition to the first book in 1998, the ''Barbecue Bible'' series includes several more in-depth single or narrow-subject books:

*''Barbecue Bible: Sauces, Rubs and Marinades'' (2000, {{ISBN|0-7611-1979-5}});
*''How To Grill'' (2001, {{ISBN|0-7611-2014-9}}), with step-by-step photography demonstrating live-fire cooking techniques;
*''[[beer can chicken|Beer Can Chicken]]'' (2002, {{ISBN|0-7611-2016-5}}), focusing on unusual and off-beat grilling recipes;
*''BBQ USA'' (2003, {{ISBN|0-7611-2015-7}}), focusing strictly on [[cuisine of the United States|United States barbecue]];
*''Raichlen's Indoor Grilling'' (2004, {{ISBN|0-7611-3335-6}}), focusing on grilling techniques using [[contact grill]]s and grill pans for indoor use;
*''Raichlen on Ribs, Ribs, Outrageous Ribs'' (2006, {{ISBN|0-7611-4211-8}}).

The '''Third County Courthouse''' is an 1837 [[Greek Revival]] building at 302 Center Street in [[Historic Richmond Town]], near the geographic center of [[Staten Island, New York]]. Preceded by two smaller [[courthouse]]s, it was the Richmond County Courthouse during most of the nineteenth century and was in use until 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicrichmondtown.org/village-map/36-village-map/44-villagemap|title=Village Map|work=[[Historic Richmond Town]]|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was replaced by the [[Richmond County Courthouse (Staten Island, New York)|Richmond County Courthouse]] in [[St. George, Staten Island|St. George]].

The building is the oldest extant structure in [[New York City]] built primarily as a courthouse. A jail used to be adjacent. The building was the site of the sensational 1844 trial of Polly Bodine, who was accused of murdering her husband's sister and niece and setting fire to their house, a case commented on by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[P. T. Barnum]], among others. The packed trial resulted in a hung jury and then an early case of [[change of venue]], first to [[Manhattan]], which resulted in a conviction, later overturned, and then to [[Newburgh, New York]], where Bodine was acquitted.&lt;ref name=NYLL&gt;Robert Pigott.

The '''''United States Reports''''' are the official record ([[law report]]s) of the rulings, orders, case tables (list of every case decided), in alphabetical order both by the name of the petitioner (the losing party in lower courts) and by the name of the respondent (the prevailing party below)), and other proceedings of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. ''United States Reports'', once printed and bound, are the final version of [[judicial opinion|court opinions]] and cannot be changed. Opinions of the court in each case are prepended with a headnote prepared by the [[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States|Reporter of Decisions]], and any concurring or dissenting opinions are published sequentially. The Court's Publication Office oversees the binding and publication of the volumes of ''United States Reports'', although the actual printing, binding, and publication are performed by private firms under contract with the [[United States Government Publishing Office]].

==Citation==
For lawyers, citations to ''United States Reports'' are the standard reference for Supreme Court decisions. Following ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook]]'', a commonly accepted citation protocol, the case [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown, et al., v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'']], for example, would be cited as:

: ''Brown v. Bd. of Educ.'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954).

This citation indicates that the decision of the Court in the case entitled ''Brown v. Board of Education'', as abbreviated in ''Bluebook'' style, was decided in 1954 and can be found in [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 347|volume 347]] of the ''United States Reports'' starting on page 483.

==History==
The early volumes of the ''United States Reports'' were originally published privately by the individual [[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Reporters]]. As was [[Nominate reports|the practice in England]], the reports were designated by the names of the reporters who compiled them: ''Dallas's Reports'', ''Cranch's Reports'', etc.

The decisions appearing in the entire [[United States Reports, volume_1|first volume]] and most of the second volume of ''United States Reports'' are not decisions of the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Instead, they are decisions from various [[Pennsylvania]] courts, dating from the colonial period and the first decade after Independence. [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]], a lawyer and journalist, of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], had been in the business of reporting these cases for newspapers and periodicals. He subsequently began compiling his case reports in a bound volume, which he called ''Reports of cases ruled and adjudged in the courts of Pennsylvania, before and since the Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Morris and O'Connor, Sharon H. ''A Guide to the Early Reports of the Supreme Court of the United States'', (Fred B. Rothman &amp; Co, Littleton Colorado, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; This would come to be known as the first volume of ''Dallas Reports''.

When the United States Supreme Court, along with the rest of the new Federal Government moved, in 1791, from New York City to the nation's temporary capital in Philadelphia, Dallas was appointed the Supreme Court's first unofficial, and unpaid, [[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Reporter]]. (Court reporters in that age received no salary, but were expected to profit from the publication and sale of their compiled decisions.) Dallas continued to collect and publish Pennsylvania decisions in a second volume of his Reports. When the Supreme Court began hearing cases, he added those cases to his reports, starting towards the end of the second volume, ''2 Dallas Reports'', with ''[[West v. Barnes]]'' (1791). Dallas went on to publish a total of four volumes of decisions during his tenure as Reporter.

When the Supreme Court moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1800, Dallas remained in Philadelphia, and [[William Cranch]] took over as unofficial reporter of decisions. In 1817, Congress made the Reporter of Decisions an official, salaried position,&lt;ref&gt;Act of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 63, {{usstat|3|376}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although the publication of the Reports remained a private enterprise for the reporter's personal gain. The reports themselves were the subject of an early copyright case, ''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', in which former reporter [[Henry Wheaton]] sued then current reporter [[Richard Peters (reporter)|Richard Peters]] for reprinting cases from ''Wheaton's Reports'' in abridged form.

In 1874, the U.S. government began to fund the reports' publication ({{usstat|18|204}}), creating the ''United States Reports''. The [[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States#List_of_Reporters|earlier, private reports]] were retroactively numbered volumes 1–90 of the ''United States Reports'', starting from the first volume of ''Dallas Reports''.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kermit, ed. ''Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'' (Oxford 1992), p 215, 727&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, decisions appearing in these early reports have dual citation forms: one for the volume number of the United States Reports; and one for the set of nominate reports. For example, the complete citation to ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' is 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819).
