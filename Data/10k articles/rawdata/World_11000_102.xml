'''Al-Resalah''' ({{lang-ar|قناة الرسالة}}; ''The Message'') is an Arabic language [[satellite television]] channel "to present true [[Islam]]".&lt;ref&gt;owner Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal during the station’s launch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEB Journal"/&gt;

It is funded by Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], recorded in all over the [[United Arab Emirates]] to [[Morocco]] and [[Kuwait]], and broadcast from [[Cairo]]. Al-Resalah has slots on the [[Arabsat]] and [[Nilesat]] satellites, serving primarily the [[Middle East]], but [[North Africa]] and Europe as well.

The General Manager of Al Resalah was [[Tareq Al-Suwaidan]], a former host at the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]] (MBC) and a leading member of the Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banking.senate.gov/_files/clarke.pdf Statement of Richard A. Clarke Before the United States Senate Banking Committee] 22 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Tareq Al-Suwaidan was fired from his job in August 2013 by the channel's owner, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, because of Al-Suwaidan's support for the Moslem Brotherhood.&lt;ref name="Al-Suwaidan_dismissal_BBC_20130818"&gt;{{cite news

The head of Al Resalah’s programming in Egypt is [[Ahmed Abu Haiba]], the original producer of [[Amr Khaled]]’s first television program.&lt;ref name="TBS16"&gt;[http://www.tbsjournal.com/Otterman.html Fatwas and Feminism: Women, Religious Authority, and Islamic TV] By Sharon Otterman, TBS 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
The channel's advisory committee includes Sheikh Abdullah Bin Sulaiman Al-Manai (Senior [[Ulema]] Commission, [[Saudi Arabia]]); Dr. Abdallah Omar Naseef (president of the Muslim World Congress); Dr. Hamed Ahmad Al-Refaie (secretary-general of the MWC and president of the International Islamic Forum for Dialogue); Dr. Abdullah Al-Muslih ([[Commission on Scientific Signs in the Quran and Sunnah]]); Sheikh Ali Al-Nashwan (executive manager of the prince's [[Kingdom Holding Company]]'s Humanitarian Division, and religious advisor to the prince); Dr. Abdulaziz Al-Askar (former head of the media department at [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]]); and Dr. Walid Arab Hashem ([[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia|Shura Council]] member).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Saudi Gazette]], March 7, 2006 cited by [http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=subjects&amp;Area=jihad&amp;ID=SP111806 Memri]&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Resalah’s website features a list of fatwas by Egypt’s preacher [[Yusuf Al Qaradawi]] approving music videos, [[SMS]] chatting and hosting non-veiled women on its shows.&lt;ref name="MEB Journal"&gt;[http://www.mebjournal.com/component/option,com_magazine/func,show_article/id,160/ Religious broadcasters avoid confrontation] by Ayat Basma, MEB Journal, Jan Feb 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IslamOnline]] noted that [[Iqraa TV]] was the first [[Islamic]] channel created, followed by others such as [[Al-Fajr TV]] and [[Al-Manar]], but that Al-Resalah had "taken things a step further, pushing forth into the wider realm of entertainment media".
Al-Suwaidan too speaks of a nascent revival that has started not only in Muslim countries, but also within Muslim minorities, and that Al-Resalah hopes to contribute to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1158658444149&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout Hold Your Breath for a Coming Resalah] By  Sarah Sharaf, [[IslamOnline]] Mar. 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2008 al-Suwaidan explained that Al-Resalah began with a wide range of programmes, but in the end concentrated on religious features, aiming to be within the top ten by [[Ramadan]] 2008.
He claimed that after only one and a half years, Al-Resalah ranks at 18 out of 400 Arab satellite channels and at number one of religious channels outside of Saudi Arabia. The [[target audience]] is Arab, young and female: according to al-Suwaidan, 70% of the viewers are women&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Suwaidan-Conte.php “Islamic and yet modern television” Tareq Al-Suwaidan, producer of Al-Risala] interviewed by Daniela Conte, 5 Feb 2008&lt;/ref&gt; (60% according to Abu Haiba&lt;ref name="TBS16"/&gt;).

Some members of the [[Egypt]]ian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] have expressed enthusiasm for the station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0502/p01s04-wome.html The new Muslim TV: media-savvy, modern, and moderate] Ursula Lindsey, The Christian Science Monitor, May 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[MEMRI]], a nonprofit press monitoring and analysis organization with headquarters in Washington, DC, has accused al-Reslah of airing anti-Western, [[anti-Semitic]], and pro-Al Qaida content.&lt;ref name="nysun20060621"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/34836 |title=Saudi Billionaire Prince's Hate TV |first=Steven |last=Stalinsky |newspaper= The New York Sun |date=June 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''briščina''&lt;ref&gt;Rigler, Jakob. 1986. ''Razprave o slovenskem jeziku''. Ljubljana: Slovenska matica, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Slovene dialects|Slovene dialect]] in the [[Littoral dialect group]],&lt;ref name="Toporisic"&gt;Toporišič, Jože. 1992. ''Enciklopedija slovenskega jezika''. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; spoken northwest of [[Gorizia]] and [[Nova Gorica]] in [[Slovenia]] and [[Italy]].

It is spoken on a territory with around 6,000 Slovene speakers, most of whom have a degree of knowledge of the dialect. 

== Geographical extension ==
The dialect is spoken west of the [[Soča]] River in the [[Gorizia Hills]] ({{lang-sl|Goriška brda}} or ''Brda''), extending from north of [[Anhovo]] to north of [[Gorizia]].

In Slovenia, the dialect is spoken  in most of the territory of the [[Municipality of Brda]] (except for its northwesternmost strip, where the [[Natisone Valley dialect]] is spoken) and in the westernmost part of the Municipality of [[Kanal ob Soči]]. 

In [[Italy]], it is spoken in the northeastern area of the [[Province of Gorizia]], in the municipalities of [[San Floriano del Collio]], and in part of the municipalities of [[Cormons]] and [[Dolegna del Collio]]. It is also spoken in the western suburbs of the town of [[Gorizia]] (Podgora, Piuma, [[Oslavia]]).

==Phonological and morphological characteristics==
The Brda dialect does not have [[pitch accent]], unlike the nearby [[Natisone Valley dialect|Natisone Valley]] and [[Torre Valley dialect]]s. The dialect shows the development of ''ə'' &gt; ''a'' and ''e'', and nasal ''e'' &gt; ''a'', and some degree of influence from the [[Karst dialect]]. The dialect shows general features associated with [[Venetian Slovenia]]n dialects such as soft ''ľ'' &gt; ''j'' and ''-m'' &gt; ''-n''. The sequence ''čre-'' is pronounced ''čere-'', and the 3rd person plural verbal ending ''-ojo'' is typical.&lt;ref name="Toporisic"/&gt;

The '''Cammell Laird Shipyard occupation''' was a 1984 [[labor dispute]] that was started as the result of [[Layoff|compulsory redundancies]] at the shipyard. It involved the occupation of two vessels to prevent them being removed. The vessels were the Royal Navy Frigate [[HMS Edinburgh (D97)|HMS Edinburgh]] and the Gas Accommodation Rig 'AV-1'.

[[File:Roma-Via dei fori imperiali.jpg|thumb|Rome, the imperial capital at the height of the territorial expansion]]

'''''Roma Caput Mundi''''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase taken to mean "Rome capital of the world" and "Roma capitale del mondo" in Italian (literally: "head of the world";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latin-phrases.co.uk/dictionary/c/ |title=Dictionary of Latin Phrases and Proverbs: C |publisher=Latin-phrases.co.uk |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[:wiktionary:capital|capital]], [[:wiktionary:capitol|capitol]]). It originates out of a [[classical antiquity|classical European]] understanding of the [[Ecumene|known world]]: [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and [[Southwest Asia]].

==Rome==

|footer=[[Via dei Fori Imperiali]], [[Via della Conciliazione]] and [[Via del Corso]]. The term [[First Rome]] is used to refer to the '''Rome of the emperors''', [[Papal States|Second Rome]] refers to the '''Rome of the Popes''', and third Rome refers to the [[Rome of the people]] (as [[capital city]] of [[Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://students.washington.edu/ageparke/rome.htm Rome Seminar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204065057/http://students.washington.edu/ageparke/rome.htm |date=4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The influence of Rome in the ancient world began to grow around the 2nd century BC as the Republic expanded across Southern Europe and North Africa. For the next five centuries, Rome would govern much of the known world (of traditional Greco-Roman geography). The cultural influence of the local language of Rome ([[Latin Language|Latin]]) as well as Roman art, architecture, law, religion, and philosophy was significant. The city of [[Rome]] adopted as its nickname ''Caput Mundi'', attributing this to its perception of an enduring power of [[Ancient Rome]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==Constantinople==

[[Constantinople]] was built as the second Rome by [[Emperor Constantine]] in 330 AD.

The [[Byzantine Empire]] lasted for over a thousand years with the center always at Constantinople, except between 1204 and 1261, when it was centered in the capitals of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], and [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. The city was seen as the "Capital of the World" because of its prime trading position in the center of the medieval world. This privileged position continued even as the capital of the Ottoman Empire. The city was also the center of half of the [[Christian world]] as the seat of the Patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox church]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] is quoted as saying, "If the Earth were a single state, Constantinople would be its capital."
Today, the city's name is [[Istanbul]].

==London==
The capital of the [[British Empire]] was [[London]] - though the empire has since passed, London is one of the world's leading business, financial, and cultural centres, and its influence in politics, education, technology, entertainment, media, fashion and the arts all contribute to its status as a major [[global city]]. Many of the world's largest corporations have their headquarters in London, the city taking a central role as a part of the wider global economy. In addition London in time and on maps is on the [[Prime Meridian]], running directly through [[Greenwich]] (also known as the Greenwich Meridian), with its time zone as [[GMT+0]] ([[UTC+0]]). The decision made at the [[International Meridian Conference]] was due to the dominance of the [[British Empire]]; for logistical reasons, and because the United Kingdom and London remain a major global influence, this position of the Prime Meridian remains.

London is one of the world's largest financial centres.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.longfinance.net/media/documents/GFCI_24_final_Report_7kGxEKS.pdf] Accessed October 7, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, London has been ranked as the world's capital city in terms of culture, business, Technological readiness and overall economic clout,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-releases/2014/london-tops-pwcs-cities-of-opportunity-study.jhtml&lt;/ref&gt; as well as attracting the most foreign investment of any global city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/business-news/london-attracts-most-foreign-investment-of-any-other-city/1923.article&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation of numerous iconic landmarks, such as [[Big Ben]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Tower Bridge]], the [[Houses of Parliament]], and [[Buckingham Palace]], as well as modern architecture such as the [[30 St Mary Axe|Gherkin]], [[The Shard]], the [[London Eye]] and the [[The O2 (London)|O2]] drew approximately 16.7 million international tourists in 2013, establishing London as the most visited city in the world for international tourists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-overtakes-paris-to-become-worlds-most-popular-destination-for-foreign-tourists-9340154.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans for Berlin==
[[Adolf Hitler]], the dictator of the [[Third Reich]], as part of his proposed [[New Order (political system)|New Order]], planned to make [[Berlin]] the "Caput Mundi", directing [[Albert Speer]] to  formulate the ''[[Welthauptstadt Germania]]''—a plan to rebuild Berlin in an [[Reich|Imperial]] [[Nazi architecture|architectural style]]. The central edifice of Berlin would have been the [[Volkshalle]], from which Hitler would have issued his Imperial decrees as [[Occupied Europe|the absolute ruler of Europe]].

==New York City==
[[New York City]], the most populous city in the [[United States]], is sometimes described by the [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase "''Novum Caput Mundi''" ("New Capital of the World"); or more commonly by the English phrase, "Capital of the World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lmec/html/about/nycapital.shtml |title=About New York City |publisher=The City of New York |accessdate=May 1, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407134046/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lmec/html/about/nycapital.shtml |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/nycdata/forward.htm|title=FORWARD New York – Capital of the Modern World|author=Eugene J.

The '''Confederazione dei Comitati di Base''' (Cobas) is a [[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]]&lt;ref name="Gall1995"/&gt; [[national trade union center|trade union center]] in [[Italy]]. It was formed in the late 1980s by members who were dissatisfied with the leadership of the three main Italian confederations ([[CGIL]], [[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions|CISL]] and [[Italian Labour Union|UIL]]). Many of its members see it as [[syndicalist]], but it has also courted the [[Trotskyist]] group, the [[League for the Fifth International]] with whom it shared a platform at the anti-G8 protests in [[Rostock]] in 2007.

Cobas regard themselves as [[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] unions in contrast to the traditional, hierarchical unions that impose compromises on their members.&lt;ref name="Gall1995"&gt;Gall (1995) quotation: {{quotation|[...] unofficial rank and file committees, Comitati di Base, known as Cobas, who have been at the forefront organising militant strike action in many industrial sectors since 1987. The COBAS have led strikes of railway workers, teachers, airport workers and bank workers as well as being heavily involved in organising general strikes and demonstrations against the government's austerity measures. For example, in 1992, they alone, and against the Italian Communist Party, organised a 300,000 strong demonstration in Rome against rising unemployment and have called for half-day general strikes to be extended.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamble2007p209"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable "rank and file" labor unions exist in France: the [[Fédération Syndicale Unitaire]] (FSU), and the [[Solidaires Unitaires Démocratiques]] (SUD) and their confederation in the [[Union syndicale G10 Solidaires|Group of 10]].&lt;ref name="Gamble2007p209"&gt;Gamble (2007) p.209&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[factory councils]] became more and more popular during the 1970s, and their co-existence with the traditional unions increased unionization. In 1978, the mainstream unions recentralised power to prevent rank-and-file practices and rules outside of their control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SY1N3d-O-rgC&amp;pg=PA471 Changing industrial relations in Europe By Anthony Ferner, Richard Hyman](1998) p.471&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CNT-F''' ('''Confédération nationale du travail''') or National Confederation of Labour is a [[France|French]] [[anarcho-syndicalist]] union.

It was founded in 1946 by [[Spain|Spanish]] [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]] in exile, and former members of [[Confédération Générale du Travail-Syndicaliste Révolutionnaire]] (CGT-SR), its name is derived from the Spanish CNT, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]].

== Division ==
[[Image:CNT - Anti-EPR demonstration in Toulouse 0206 2007-03-17.jpg|thumb|CNT-F]]
Nowadays, two French organisations share the name CNT:

* the ''CNT-Vignoles'' (or ''CNT-f''), from the name of the street where their main office in Paris is located. It contains the most members of the two organisations.

They decline the term [[anarchist]], preferring to call themselves "[[revolutionary]] [[Trade union|unionist]]" (''syndicalistes révolutionnaires'').&lt;ref name=Chatsnoirs&gt;Bénédicte Rallu, [http://www.politis.fr/article1293.html Le réveil des chats noirs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219225836/http://www.politis.fr/article1293.html |date=2005-12-19 }}, ''[[Politis (France)|Politis]]'', 4 April 2005 (Interviews of members of the CNT-Vignoles {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They accept the terms of the 1906 [[Charter of Amiens]], the Charter of Lyon (1926) and the charter of Paris (1946).

They also accept participation in the professional elections and collaboration with others unions.

* the ''CNT-AIT''. This is the French section of the [[International Workers Association]] (IWA).
They define themselves as anarchosyndicalist, while they have clear influences from [[council communism]], worker anarchism of the [[Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]] (FORA) and the [[Situationist International]].

'''Elections in Monaco''' gives information on [[election]] and election results in [[politics of Monaco|Monaco]]. 

Monaco elects on national level a [[legislature]] (parliament). The '''[[National Council of Monaco|National Council]]''' (''Conseil National'') has 24 members, elected for a five-year term, 16 elected by a winner-take-all plurality system, and the other 8 by [[proportional representation]]. Each voter may cast a ballot with up to 16 candidates' names. First, the 16 individuals with the most votes are elected. Then, votes are counted by party groups to fill the remaining 8 seats. E.g., if a party polled 51% of the votes it would probably win 20 out of 24 seats (all 16 of the winner-take-all seats and then 4 of the 8 proportional seats).

[[File:Badge of Tasmania.svg|thumb|100px|The state badge]]
The current state '''flag of Tasmania''' was officially adopted following a proclamation by [[Tasmania]]n colonial [[Governor of Tasmania|Governor]] [[Frederick Aloysius Weld|Sir Frederick Weld]] on 25 September 1876, and was first published in the ''Tasmanian Gazette'' the same day. The governor's proclamation here were three official flags, they being the Governor's flag, the Tasmania Government vessel flag, and a Tasmania merchant flag. Up until 1856 when Tasmania was granted [[responsible government|responsible self-government]], the [[Union flag]] and the [[British ensign]] were primarily used on state occasions.&lt;ref name="Tasmania, flag of."&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355542/flag-of-Tasmania  | title = Tasmania, flag of. | accessdate =2008-09-10| year= 2008 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag consists of a [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] British [[Blue Ensign]] with the state badge located in the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]]. The badge is a white disk with a red lion passant in the centre of the disk. There is no official record of how the lion came to be included on the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/divisions/executive/protocol_office/flags/tasmanian_flag |title=Tasmanian flag |accessdate=2008-09-17 |last=The Department of Premier and Cabinet |date=5 September 2008 |work= |publisher=tas.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where this design originated from is unknown, but it is assumed that the red lion is a link with England. This flag has remained almost unchanged since 1875, with only a slight change of the style of the lion when the flag was officially adopted by the government in 1975, although this was a mistake, as it had already been officially gazetted by the colonial government in 1876.&lt;ref name="Tasmania, flag of."/&gt;

==History==
Following the establishment of permanent British [[sovereignty|sovereign]] possession of the lands of Tasmania. Tasmania was granted [[responsible government|responsible self-government]] in 1856, but the colony did not receive its own flag until [[Queen Victoria]] had first proposed on 7 August 1869, that the colony of Tasmania (and the other Australian colonies) should adopt a [[Union flag]] defaced in the centre with the State Badge.&lt;ref name="members.iinet.net.au"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://members.iinet.net.au/~rwatson1/tasflag/ | title =Following The Tasmanian Flag. Its history and meaning| accessdate =2008-09-10| year= 2002| publisher =| language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the official adoption of a local flag, an unofficial merchant ensign was occasionally used.
[[File:Van Diemen's Land Unofficial Merchant Ensign before 1875.svg|thumb|Unofficial merchant ensign used occasionally before the colony adopted an official flag]]
[[File:1875 flag of Tasmania.svg|thumb|Flag of Tasmania, 9–23 November 1875]]
The first local flag of Tasmania was adopted by proclamation of Tasmanian colonial [[Governor of Tasmania|Governor]] [[Frederick Aloysius Weld|Sir Frederick Weld]] on 9 November 1875.  The flag had a white cross on a blue field, in the [[Flag terminology|canton]] was the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]], and in the fly was five five-pointed stars of the [[Crux|Southern Cross]].  The British [[Blue Ensign]] and [[Red Ensign]] (for use respectively by government vessels and by those privately owned) were to have a white cross added. At the fly end of each flag a Southern Cross was to be formed of white stars added above and below the horizontal arm of the cross. Two weeks later, on 23 November, those flags were officially abandoned because [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in London made it clear that only a single badge could be placed at the fly end of the ensign, as set out by rule of the [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]].&lt;ref name="Tasmania, flag of."/&gt;

A year later the Tasmanian government decided, with the British Admiralty's approval, that the badge for the colony would be a red lion on a white disk. Originally the lion was to be gold in colour, above a golden torse, which the new flag omitted in favour of a more traditional red.

A British Blue Ensign with the badge served Tasmanian government vessels, and privately owned vessels were to fly an un-defaced British Red Ensign. After Tasmania became a state on 1 January 1901, the Tasmanian Blue Ensign was rarely used, and was reserved for official purposes. Most vessels soon preferred to fly the [[Australian Red Ensign]].&lt;ref name="members.iinet.net.au"/&gt;

On 3 December 1975, a government proclamation by [[Governor of Tasmania|Governor]] [[Stanley Burbury|Sir Stanley Burbury]], and endorsed by [[Premier of Tasmania|Premier]] [[Bill Neilson]] established it as the official Tasmanian flag, although it had technically already been 'officially' adopted when it was gazetted in 1876. Since that time it has been acceptable for private citizens to use the flag, although it is uncommon to see them doing so.&lt;ref name="members.iinet.net.au"/&gt;

==Devices==
The flag of Tasmania has two distinct symbols, the [[Union Flag]] (also known as the ''Union Jack''), and the [[List of Australian states and territories symbols|State Badge of Tasmania]].

As with the [[Flag of Australia]], the Union Flag is thought locally to symbolise Australia's history as six British colonies and the principles upon which the [[Australian Federation]] is based, Australian Flag Society&lt;ref&gt;Source: Australian Flag Society&lt;/ref&gt; although a more historic view sees its inclusion in the design as demonstrating loyalty to the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;Evans, I. 1918. ''The history of the Australian flag''. Evan Evans, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Unlike the national flag, the flag of Tasmania is not enshrined and protected by any acts of [[Parliament of Tasmania|state]] or [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth]] government. As a result, there are no official legal requirements for the construction of the flag of Tasmania. However tradition and decorum dictate that is should be:
# the Union Jack occupying the upper quarter next the staff;
# the fly is to be wholly blue, in line with the British Blue Ensign;
# the State Badge is to be situated with its centre halfway between the edge of the canton and the end of the fly, and a third of the distance from the bottom of the flag;

==Colours==
The colours of the flag, although not specified by the Flags Act, have been given the same [[Pantone]] specifications as the national flag. The Australian Government's ''Style Manual for Authors, Editors and Printers'' also gives [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] and [[RGB color model|RGB]] specifications for depicting the flag in print and on screen respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Style Manual for Authors, Editors and Printers|edition= 6th|year=2002 |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=  Milton, Qld.|isbn=0-7016-3648-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Governor of Tasmania]], being the representative of the Tasmanian head of state, the [[Queen of Australia]], is officially granted a flag for use on all official occasions. It is identical in design and construction to the flag of Tasmania, except that it features a [[St. Edward's Crown]] above the badge to represent vice-regal power.
When the Governor of Tasmania is resident at [[Government House, Hobart|Government House]] it is flown from the roof, and it is also used as a car flag. The Governor of Tasmania's flag was officially adopted in February 1977 by an act of the [[Parliament of Tasmania]].

'''Green Fins''' is an approach to sustainable marine tourism activities operating in [[South East Asia]], [[Caribbean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] that works with business operators, communities and governments. It helps to implement environmental standards for the diving and snorkelling industry through a code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenfins.net/content/uploads/COC%20-%20greenfins.net%20-%20English.pdf code of conduct] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920073013/http://greenfins.net/content/uploads/COC%20-%20greenfins.net%20-%20English.pdf |date=20 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall aim of the initiative is to mitigate damaging impacts to the marine environment from the marine tourism sector and improve sustainability. The code of conduct is a set of 15 points designed to tackle the most common and detrimental effects of SCUBA diving and snorkelling activities on the habitat in which they operate.&lt;ref name="code" /&gt;

==The Green Fins Approach==
Dive centers and snorkel tour operators sign a membership form pledging to adhere to the Code of Conduct. Trained Green Fins assessors visit members annually to assess their compliance to the Code of Conduct and provide consultations for improvement, and environmental training to all staff at the member centre to support and build the capacity of those individuals to reduce their environmental impacts. Members often receive printed materials to support their efforts to reduce impacts to the marine environment including the Green Fins ICONS, which visually outline best practices for divers and snorkellers. These materials are available in many different languages.
[[File:Divers coming into contact with coral.jpg|thumbnail|Divers coming into contact with coral]]

==History==
Green Fins was established in 2004 as an initiative by the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) and was first implemented by the Secretariat of the Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA).&lt;ref name="icran" /&gt; Green Fins was initiated and coordinated by COBSEA's secretariat as part of the effort to increase public awareness with an overall aim to better management practices that will contribute to the [[Marine conservation|conservation]] of [[coral reefs]] (and other associated marine [[ecosystems]] such as seagrass beds and mangroves) and reduce current unsustainable tourism practices.&lt;ref name="cobsea" /&gt;

==Present==
Currently there are eight active member countries of the Green Fins initiative with Singapore also supporting the initiative. [[Thailand]] and the [[Philippines]] started in 2004, [[Indonesia]] in 2007 and [[Malaysia]] in 2008, the [[Maldives]] and [[Vietnam]] starting in 2013 and the [[Dominican Republic]] in 2018. Each individual country is autonomous, running the approach to their governments own targets and objectives to fulfil the mission statement. This is done under the supervision of the Network Leader with the Network Leader Assistant as a supporting role. The position of the Network Leader is usually fulfilled by government staff who work under a relevant department overseeing the protection and control of either marine habitats or tourism.

The initiative is supported by the UK [[Charitable organization|charity]] The Reef-World Foundation. Their role as International Coordinators of the project is to assist countries with training and technical assistance under the direction of [[UNEP]] whilst helping to promote the countries various projects and successes on a global scale. In addition to this, Reef-World are also tasked with looking for additional funding to support the implementation and continued training of those that manage Green Fins in their respective countries. The Reef-World Foundation developed the Green Environmental Assessment Rating System (GEARS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reef-world.org/about_us.htm#GEARS&lt;/ref&gt; to enable a results-based management approach through the Green Fins assessments that take place. The GEARS system allows a simple monitoring system that is able to measure the success of several objectives or milestones required to reach the overall goal enabling a results-based management approach . It does this with a green/yellow/red rating system, based on a weighted score for each objective, allowing for industry wide problems to be easily isolated and monitored.

In December 2012, The Reef-World Foundation in partnership with UNEP was successfully awarded a grant through the [[IUCN]] Mangroves for the Future Regional initiative. This saw the Green Fins network expand to [[Vietnam]] and the [[Maldives]] over a two-year project ending in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mangrovesforthefuture.org/grants/regional-initiatives/protecting-marine-ecosystems-in-mff-countries-using-the-green-fins-approach/&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013 a research paper was accepted by the scientific journal Ocean and Coastal Management titled “The Green Fins approach for monitoring and promoting environmentally sustainable scuba diving operations in South East Asia” and was published in Volume 78, June 2013, pages 35–44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569113000719 | doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2013.03.004 | volume=78 | title=The Green Fins approach for monitoring and promoting environmentally sustainable scuba diving operations in South East Asia | journal=Ocean | pages=35–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this paper are from The Reef-World Foundation with co-authors from Green Fins Thailand based at the Phuket Marine Biological Centre (PMBC), Phuket, Thailand.

January 2014 saw the launch of the Green Fins website,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mangrovesforthefuture.org/news-and-media/news/asia-region/2014/mff-unep-regional-project-green-fins-goes-digital/&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to provide a platform of information for Green Fins members, volunteers and coordinators of the initiate, government staff who help manage the project in their country and the general public who can download materials (posters, videos, leaflets, guidelines) to help provide educational information to divers, snorkellers and dive centre staff. The website also provides tourists the chance to search for Green Fins members and to view the environmental scores of diving areas as an average, helping them to decide which are the most environmentally friendly businesses and areas to dive or snorkel in.

The Green Fins initiative is free to join and all dive operators have the opportunity to be involved in the approach to help in battling to reduce their negative impacts.&lt;ref name="reefworld" /&gt; There are no costs involved in joining but members are expected to enter into the spirit that they can always improve their management policies in an effort to adhere to the Code of Conduct and protect the marine environment.

==Outreach and Environmental Activities==
Green Fins encourages dive centres to engage staff, tourists, local businesses and communities in environmental activities such as beach and reef clean ups.&lt;ref name="ziza" /&gt; Reef monitoring is also promoted, Green Fins does not endorse a particular methodology leaving it to the choice of the dive centre depending on the resources available to them.

Several spin-off projects may be run alongside the annual assessments to further promote marine conservation, these have included 'Say No to Plastic' awareness campaigns, shark awareness with local communities and schools, and marine conservation education programs with local fishing communities. In 2012, Green Fins ran the first Green Fins Ambassador Program in Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro, Philippines. The program works with the most enthusiastic dive guides in the area, providing them with additional environmental training and encouraging these individuals to be environmental ambassadors within the diving, and surrounding communities. The pilot program was a huge success and has now been replicated in Moalboal and Malapascua, Cebu, Philippines, with plans to reach out to other diving locations.

[[File:Prizor iz filma v V kraljestvu Zlatoroga (2).jpg|thumbnail|Scene from the film]]
'''''In the Kingdom of the Goldhorn''''' ({{lang-sl|V kraljestvu Zlatoroga}}) was the first [[List of Slovenian films|Slovene]] [[feature film]]. It was filmed in 1928 and 1929 and was directed, shot and edited by [[Janko Ravnik]]. It was a [[silent film]] shot in the [[black-and-white]] technique. The film was produced by the mountaineering club [[Skala (mountaineering club)|Skala]] and was 107 minutes long. Only about two thirds of the original {{convert|31|mm|adj=on}} film, i.e. the shortened 76-minute version, have been preserved until today.

The screenplay was written by [[Juš Kozak]]. The story tells about a trip by a student, a railway worker and a peasant to the [[Julian Alps]], the people they meet on their way, and their ascent to [[Mt. Triglav]]. The film features the mountaineers {{Interlanguage link multi|Joža Čop|sl}} (''Roban'') and {{Interlanguage link multi|Miha Potočnik|sl}} (''Klemen'').

''In the Kingdom of the Goldhorn'' was released on 29 August 1931 in [[Grand Hotel Union]] in Ljubljana. It was well received by the public, but criticised in reviews as amateurish. The last time the film was shown to the wider public was on its 80th anniversary in Grand Hotel Union in August 2011. A commemorative stamp with a motif from the film was published by the [[Post of Slovenia]] on this occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/film/foto-80-let-prvega-slovenskega-igranega-celovecerca-v-kraljestvu-zlatoroga/265072 |title=Foto: 80 let prvega slovenskega igranega celovečerca V kraljestvu zlatoroga |language=Slovenian |trans-title=80 Years of the First Slovene Played Feature Film ''In the Kingdom of the Goldhorn'' |work==MMC RTV Slovenija |date=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Industrial Relations Institute''' was an international organisation that existed from 1925 to 1947.

The first proposal to establish an organisation for the "study and improvement of human conditions in industry" arose in the First International Conference on Industrial Welfare at the Chateau d' Argeronne, [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]], [[France]] in 1922.&lt;ref name=RO&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldenziel|first1=Ruth|title=Gender and scientific management – Women and the history of the International Institute for Industrial Relations, 1922‐1946|journal=Journal of Management History|date=2000|volume=6|issue=7|pages=323-342}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The institute was led by [[Mary van Kleeck]], an American social reformer, and [[Mary Fleddérus]], a Dutch activist,&lt;ref name=RO/&gt; and approached [[scientific management]] from a particular perspective: what they termed the [[human factor]]. From the outset it had close links with women's organisations such as the [[World YWCA|World Young Women's Christian Association]] and the [[Women's Trade Union League]].

It was founded by four distinct groups of activists:&lt;ref name=RO/&gt;
# State employed women factory inspectors
# World Young Women's Christian Association activists involved in industrial reform
# women employed by industrial welfare units
# enlightened industrialists employing large numbers of women

==Congresses==
===First Congress, Vlissingen 1925===
The first congress was held in [[Vlissingen]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=RO/&gt; This was entitled "The International Industrial Welfare (Personnel) Congress".&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=Benny|title=The IRI and its Swedish Connection|journal=American Studies in Scandinavia|date=2007|volume=39|issue=1|pages=13-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was established and agreed to fold a congress every third year.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; [[Kerstin Hesselgren]] was elected President with three vice presidents: [[Cees van der Leeuw]], the dutch industrialist, Renee de Montmort from France, and Louise Odencrantz from the USA.

===Second Congress, Cambridge 1928===
The Second Congress was held in [[Girton College]] [[Cambridge]], 27 June - 2 July. The theme was the "Fundamental Relationships between all Sections of the Industrial Community."&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; Kerstin Hesselgren resigned as President and Dorothy Cadbury as Treasurer. Cees van der Leeuw became the new president with Charles E. Jacob as treasurer.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

===Third Congress, Amsterdam 1931===
The organisation sponsored [[Otto Neurath]]'s presentation "Das gegenwärtige Wachstum der Produktionskapazität der Welt" at the [[Amsterdam]] conference of 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Neurath |first1=Otto |title=Empiricism and Sociology |date=1973 |publisher=Riedel |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-90-277-0259-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Kleeck was the institute's associate director from 1928–1946.&lt;ref name=SWHP&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClurken|first1=Kara M.|title=van Kleeck, Mary|url=http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/people/van-kleeck-mary/|website=Social Welfare History Project|publisher=The Social Welfare History Project|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sino-Latvian relations''' dates back to 1923 when the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] recognized [[Latvia]] ''de jure''. After the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupation of Latvia in 1940]], the ROC is one of the few countries that did not recognize Latvia's incorporation into the Soviet Union. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Latvia never re-established relations with the ROC after restoring its independence in 1991 and later established relations with the [[China|People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/09/17/Despite-Beijings-displeasure-Latvia-plans-to-establish-ties-with-Taiwan/3385716702400/&lt;/ref&gt; However, in its place, Latvia operates the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]] in [[Riga]] and the Taipei Mission in the Republic of Latvia in [[Taipei]].

"'''Let's Get Loud'''" was the [[Estonia]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]], performed in English by [[Suntribe]]. The author of the music and lyrics was [[Sven Lõhmus]].

As Estonia had not qualified for the final in their previous appearance, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed twelfth (following Belgium's [[Nuno Resende]] with "[[Le grand soir (song)|Le grand soir]]" and preceding Norway's [[Wig Wam]] with "[[In My Dreams (Wig Wam song)|In My Dreams]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 31 points, placing 20th in a field of 25 songs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2005 Semi-Final|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=157|website=Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and failing to qualify for the final - additionally, forcing Estonia to enter the Contest at the semi-final stage at their next appearance.

[[Suntribe]] was put on by the composer [[Sven Lõhmus]] just for the occasion, the follow-up single months after the Eurovision failed short to enter the charts. The band consisted of [[Mari-Leen Kaselaan]], [[Janika Vilipo]], [[Rebecca Kontus]], [[Laura Põldvere]] and [[Daana Ots]].

It was succeeded as [[Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Estonian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 Contest]] by [[Sandra Oxenryd]] with "[[Through My Window]]".

'''Mazoo and the Zoo''' is a [[Greece|Greek]] music group that performs songs for children in Greece.

==The Group==
Manos Vafiadis is the composer and author (lyrics) of the most popular Greek CD ''Mazoo and the Zoo'' . Mazoo and the Zoo also has three other members [[Tereza Sassou]] and the siblings Efthimis Kokkinaras and Artemis Kokkinara. They came together three years ago and at first they were the presenters of kids' shows in the Greek channel Alter. After a while they signed a music contract with Alter's music label Kid's Songs and they recorded their first album. Their songs are short funny stories about animals. The trio sings and also makes the video clips which are broadcast on Alter. Both their albums reached #1 at the [[IFPI]] Greek albums charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpi.gr/chart05.htm Top 50 Ελληνικών Aλμπουμ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428000000/http://www.ifpi.gr/chart05.htm |date=April 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the band had their own theatrical show. They perform on weekends on the stage of the Aliki theatre in Athens.

'''Oasis''' is a piece of [[Computer software|software]] developed by the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) that converts [[Sound|audio]] signals such as [[cellular telephone|cellphone]] calls and [[television]] and [[radio]] [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s into readable and searchable text. It is designed to [[Artificial intelligence|intelligently]] analyze an audio signal such as a cellphone call in order to identify and label each speaker (Male 1, Male 2, Female 1, and so forth). Oasis is also able to intelligently reference terms, such as by linking "[[car bomb]]" with "[[terrorism]]". Oasis will eventually be able to recognize key languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], as well as [[English language|English]].

The positions of '''[[Plenipotentiary]] on European Integration to the Regional Governor''' (Pełnomocnik Wojewody ds. Europejskich) were gradually established in [[Poland]] between 1996 and 1999 in all of Poland’s then 49 regions, or [[voivodeship]]s (województwa). This step was taken in the wake of Poland’s 1994 application for membership in the [[European Union]] in order to prepare the Polish administration and society at large for the process of European integration and Poland’s eventual joining the EU (which took place in 2004). In early 1996, Regional Governor of the [[Opole Voivodeship]] (Wojewoda Opolski), [[Ryszard Zembaczyński]], appointed [[Tomasz Kamusella]] as the first-ever Plenipotentiary of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;Integracja europejska a Śląsk Opolski [European Integration and Opole Silesia] (pp 6–12). 1997.

'''Shortwave broadcasting in the United States''' allows private ownership of commercial and [[public radio|non-commercial]] [[shortwave]] stations that are not relays of existing [[AM radio|AM/MW]] or [[FM radio]] stations, as are common in Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania except Australia and Latin America. In addition to private broadcasters, the United States also has government broadcasters and relay stations for international public broadcasters.  Most privately owned shortwave stations have been religious broadcasters, either wholly owned and programmed by [[Roman Catholic]] and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestant]] charities or offering [[brokered programming]] consisting primarily of religious broadcasters. To better reach other continents of the world, several stations are located in far-flung US territories. Shortwave stations in the USA are not permitted to operate exclusively for a domestic audience; they are subject to [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] and power requirements to reach an [[international broadcasting|international audience]].

== Non-religious private broadcasters ==

While many private shortwave broadcasters in the United States are operated by religious groups or carry mostly religious programming, there have also been attempts at starting non-religious shortwave stations.

Two such stations were [[WRNO (shortwave)|WRNO]] in [[New Orleans]] and [[KUSW]] in [[Salt Lake City]], both of them with a [[rock and roll]] music format.  Both stations were well received by shortwave listeners, but could not make the format successful in the long run.  KUSW was eventually sold to the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and converted into religious broadcaster [[KTBN (shortwave)|KTBN]].  WRNO kept its rock &amp; roll format going for most of the 1980s but eventually switched formats to selling brokered airtime to political and religious broadcasts, suffered a damaged transmitter, and eventually ceased broadcasting following the death of its owner, [[Joe Costello (broadcaster)|Joe Costello]]. WRNO was acquired by Dr. Robert Mawire and Good News World Outreach in 2001. After installing a new transmitter, the station was within just days of returning to the air when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 29, 2005. The new transmitter was spared from flood waters, but the antenna was severely damaged by high winds. WRNO finally returned to broadcasting in 2009, operating 4 hours per day. On March 13, 2010, WRNO began transmitting a weekly religious broadcast in Arabic for a portion of its broadcast schedule.

A notable exception is [[WBCQ (SW)|WBCQ]], a non-religious private station operated by [[Allan Weiner]] in Maine. WBCQ has been a success by brokering much of their airtime to religious programs like [[Brother Stair]], while also carrying some music and entertainment programs.

[[WRMI]] in Miami, Florida also airs several non-religious programs, including relays of international news stations.

== Pirate radio ==
Numerous [[pirate radio]] stations have operated sporadically in or just outside the shortwave broadcast bands.  Most are operated by hobbyists for the amusement of DX'ers with broadcasts typically only a few hours in length.

Few American pirates are political or controversial in their programming.  Pirates have tended to cluster in unofficial "pirate bands" based on the current schedules of licensed shortwave stations and the retuning of [[amateur radio]] transmitters to operate outside the "ham" radio bands.

Most pirate activity takes place on weekends or holidays, [[Halloween]] and [[April Fool's Day]] being traditional favorites of pirates. Most broadcasts are only a few minutes to a few hours at a time. One notable exception was [[Radio Newyork International]], a short-lived attempt to establish a permanent broadcasting station operating from [[international waters]].

Some European nations have recently begun allowing privately owned shortwave stations on a far more limited scale.

{{Slavery}}
[[File:Zanzslgwch.jpg|thumb|A [[Zanj]] slave gang in [[Zanzibar]] (1889).]]
'''Slavery''' has historically been widespread in Africa, and still continues [[Slavery in modern Africa|today]] in some countries.

Systems of servitude and [[slavery]] were common in parts of [[Africa]], as they were in much of the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. In many African societies where slavery was prevalent, the enslaved people were not treated as [[Slavery#Chattel slavery|chattel slaves]] and were given certain rights in a system similar to [[indentured servitude]] elsewhere in the world. When the [[Arab slave trade]] and [[Atlantic slave trade]] began, many of the local slave systems began supplying captives for slave markets outside Africa.&lt;ref name="Lovejoy-2012" /&gt;

Slavery in historical Africa was practiced in many different forms: [[Debt slavery]], enslavement of war captives, military slavery, and criminal slavery were all practiced in various parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Give Me Liberty: An American History|year=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery for domestic and court purposes was widespread throughout Africa. Plantation slavery also occurred primarily on the eastern coast of Africa and in parts of West Africa. The importance of domestic plantation slavery increased during the 19th century due to the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade. Many African states dependent on the international slave trade reoriented their economies towards legitimate commerce worked by slave labor.&lt;ref name=Austin&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin |first= Gareth |title=The Cambridge World History of Slavery: Volume 4, AD 1804–AD 2016 |year=2017 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location=New York |pages=|editor1=David Eltis |editor2=Stanley L. Engerman |editor3= Seymour Drescher |editor4=David Richardson |chapter= Slavery in Africa, 1804-1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of slavery==
Multiple forms of slavery and servitude have existed throughout African history and were shaped by indigenous practices of slavery as well as the [[Slavery in ancient Rome|Roman institution of slavery]]{{cn|date=August 2017}} (and the later [[Christian views on slavery]]), the [[Islamic views on slavery|Islamic institutions of slavery]] via the [[Arab slave trade]], and eventually the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt;
Slavery was a part of the economic structure of African societies for many centuries, although the extent varied.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt;
[[Ibn Battuta]], who visited the ancient kingdom of Mali in the mid-14th century, recounts that the local inhabitants vied with each other in the number of slaves and servants they had, and was himself given a slave boy as a "hospitality gift."&lt;ref&gt;Noel King (ed.), ''Ibn Battuta in Black Africa'', Princeton 2005, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In sub-Saharan Africa, the slave relationships were often complex, with rights and freedoms given to individuals held in slavery and restrictions on sale and treatment by their masters.&lt;ref name=Fage /&gt; Many communities had hierarchies between different types of slaves: for example, differentiating between those who had been born into slavery and those who had been captured through war.&lt;ref name=Rodney /&gt;

{{Quote box
 |quote  = "The slaves in Africa, I suppose, are nearly in the proportion of three to one to the freemen. They claim no reward for their services except food and clothing, and are treated with kindness or severity, according to the good or bad disposition of their masters. Custom, however, has established certain rules with regard to the treatment of slaves, which it is thought dishonourable to violate. Thus the domestic slaves, or such as are born in a man’s own house, are treated with more lenity than those which are purchased with money. ... But these restrictions on the power of the master extend not to the care of prisoners taken in war, nor to that of slaves purchased with money.  All these unfortunate beings are considered as strangers and foreigners, who have no right to the protection of the law, and may be treated with severity, or sold to a stranger, according to the pleasure of their owners."

The forms of slavery in Africa were closely related to [[kinship]] structures. In many African communities, where land could not be owned, enslavement of individuals was used as a means to increase the influence a person had and expand connections.&lt;ref name=Snell /&gt; This made slaves a permanent part of a master's lineage and the children of slaves could become closely connected with the larger family ties.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt; Children of slaves born into families could be integrated into the master's kinship group and rise to prominent positions within society, even to the level of chief in some instances.&lt;ref name=Rodney /&gt; However, stigma often remained attached and there could be strict separations between slave members of a kinship group and those related to the master.&lt;ref name=Snell&gt;{{cite book|last=Snell|first=Daniel C.|title=The Cambridge World History of Slavery|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=4–21|editor=Keith Bradley and Paul Cartledge|chapter=Slavery in the Ancient Near East}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chattel slavery===
[[Slavery#Chattel slavery|Chattel slavery]] is a specific servitude relationship where the slave is treated as the property of the owner. As such, the owner is free to sell, trade, or treat the slave as he would other pieces of property and the children of the slave often are retained as the property of the master.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt; There is evidence of long histories of chattel slavery in the Nile river valley and Northern Africa, but evidence is incomplete about the extent and practices of chattel slavery throughout much of the rest of the continent prior to written records by Arab or European traders.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;.

===Domestic service===
Many slave relationships in Africa revolved around domestic slavery, where slaves would work primarily in the house of the master but retain some freedoms. Domestic slaves could be considered part of the master's household and would not be sold to others without extreme cause. The slaves could own the profits from their labour (whether in land or in products), and could marry and pass the land on to their children in many cases.&lt;ref name=Rodney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodney|first=Walter|title=African Slavery and Other Forms of Social Oppression on the Upper Guinea Coast in the Context of the Atlantic Slave-Trade|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1966|volume=7|issue=3|pages=431–443|jstor=180112|doi=10.1017/s0021853700006514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pawnship===
[[Pawn (law)|Pawnship]], or debt bondage slavery, involves the use of people as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to secure the repayment of [[debt]]. Slave labor is performed by the [[debtor]], or a [[Kinship|relative]] of the debtor (usually a child). Pawnship was a common form of collateral in West Africa. It involved the pledge of a person, or a member of that person's family, to service another person providing [[Credit (finance)|credit]]. Pawnship was related to, yet distinct from, slavery in most conceptualizations, because the arrangement could include limited, specific terms of service to be provided and because kinship ties would protect the person from being sold into slavery. Pawnship was a common practice throughout West Africa prior to European contact, including amongst the [[Akan people]], the [[Ewe people]], the [[Ga people]], the [[Yoruba people]], and the [[Edo people]] (in modified forms, it also existed amongst the [[Efik people]], the [[Igbo people]], the [[Ijaw people]], and the [[Fon people]]).&lt;ref name="Lovejoy and Richardson"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Business of Slaving: Pawnship in Western Africa, c. 1600–1810|journal=The Journal of African History|year=2001|volume=42|issue=1|pages=67–89|author=Paul E. Lovejoy and David Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military slavery===
[[File:Victims for sacrifice-1793.jpg|thumb|250px|Slaves for sacrifice at the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey]] – from ''[[Archibald Dalzel|The history of Dahomy, an inland Kingdom of Africa]]'', 1793.]]
Military slavery involved the acquisition and training of conscripted military units which would retain the identity of military slaves even after their service.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Douglas H.|title=The Structure of a Legacy: Military Slavery in Northeast Africa|journal=Ethnohistory|year=1989|volume=36|issue=1|pages=72–88|doi=10.2307/482742|jstor=482742}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slave soldier groups would be run by a ''Patron'', who could be the head of a government or an independent warlord, and who would send his troops out for money and his own political interests.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;

This was most significant in the Nile valley (primarily in Sudan and Uganda), with slave military units organized by various Islamic authorities,&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt; and with the war chiefs of Western Africa.&lt;ref name=Wylie&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wylie|first=Kenneth C.|title=Innovation and Change in Mende Chieftaincy 1880–1896|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1969|volume=10|issue=2|jstor=179516|pages=295–308|ref=harv|doi=10.1017/s0021853700009531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military units in Sudan were formed in the 1800s through large-scale military raiding in the area which is currently the countries of Sudan and South Sudan.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;

===Slaves for sacrifice===
[[Human sacrifice#West Africa|Human sacrifice]] was common in West African states up to and during the 19th century. Although archaeological evidence is not clear on the issue prior to European contact, in those societies that practiced human sacrifice, slaves became the most prominent victims.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt;

The [[Annual customs of Dahomey]] was the most notorious example of human sacrifice of slaves, where 500 prisoners would be sacrificed. Sacrifices were carried out all along the West African coast and further inland. Sacrifices were common in the [[Benin Empire]], in what is now [[Ghana]], and in the small independent states in what is now southern [[Nigeria]]. In the [[Ashanti Region]], human sacrifice was often combined with [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Williams (1988) The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 21, No. 3. (1988), pp.&amp;nbsp;433–441&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Rummel (1997)"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N1j1QdPMockC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Death by government]''". Transaction Publishers. p.63. {{ISBN|1-56000-927-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local slave trade===
Many nations such as the [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti]] of present-day [[Ghana]] and the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of present-day [[Nigeria]] were involved in slave-trading. Groups such as the [[Imbangala]] of [[Angola]] and the [[Nyamwezi people|Nyamwezi]] of [[Tanzania]] would serve as intermediaries or roving bands, waging war on African states to capture people for export as slaves. Historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood have provided an estimate, that of the Africans captured and then sold to Europeans around 90% of those who were shipped in the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref name="Ending the Slavery Blame-Game" /&gt; [[Henry Louis Gates]], the Harvard Chair of African and African American Studies, has stated that "without complex business partnerships between African elites and European traders and commercial agents, the slave trade to the New World would have been impossible, at least on the scale it occurred."&lt;ref name="Ending the Slavery Blame-Game"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp|author=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|title=Ending the Slavery Blame-Game|accessdate=2012-03-26 |archiveurl = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery practices throughout Africa==
Like most other regions of the world, slavery and forced labor existed in many kingdoms and societies of Africa for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=Manning-1983&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manning|first=Patrick|title=Contours of Slavery and Social Change in Africa|journal=American Historical Review|year=1983|volume=88|issue=4|pages=835–857|doi=10.2307/1874022|jstor=1874022}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Fage /&gt; According to Ugo Kwokeji, early European reports of slavery throughout Africa in the 1600s are unreliable because they often conflated various forms of servitude as equal to chattel slavery.&lt;ref name=Nwokeji&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwokeji|first=G.

The best evidence of slave practices in Africa come from the major kingdoms, particularly along the coast, and there is little evidence of widespread slavery practices in stateless societies.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fage&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fage|first=J.D.|title=Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Context of West African History|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1969|volume=10|issue=3|pages=393–404|doi=10.1017/s0021853700036343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rodney /&gt; Slave trading was mostly secondary to other trade relationships; however, there is evidence of a trans-Saharan slave trade route from Roman times which persisted in the area after the fall of the Roman empire.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt; However, kinship structures and rights provided to slaves (except those captured in war) appears to have limited the scope of slave trading before the start of the Arab slave trade and the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref name=Fage /&gt;

Chattel slavery had been legal and widespread throughout [[North Africa]] when the region was controlled by the [[Roman Empire]] (145 BC – ca. 430 AD and by the Eastern Romans from 533 to 695). A slave trade bringing Saharans through the desert to North Africa, which existed in Roman times, continued and documentary evidence in the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] shows it to have been regulated there by treaty.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=J.|title=Islam, Archaeology and Slavery in Africa|journal=World Archaeology|year=2001|volume=33|issue=1|pages=44–60|jstor=827888|doi=10.1080/00438240126645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chattel slavery persisted after the fall of the Roman empire in the largely Christian communities of the region. After the Islamic expansion into most of the region, the practices continued and eventually, the chattel form of slavery spread to major societies on the southern end of the Sahara (such as Mali, Songhai, and Ghana).&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt;

The [[Middle Age|medieval]] slave trade in [[Europe]] was mainly to the East and South: the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Muslim World]] were the destinations, [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] an important source of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24159 |title=Historical survey &gt; The international slave trade |publisher=Britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery in medieval Europe]] was so widespread that the Roman Catholic Church repeatedly prohibited it—or at least the export of Christian slaves to non-Christian lands was prohibited at, for example, the [[Council of Koblenz]] in 922, the [[Council of London (1102)|Council of London]] in 1102, and the [[Council of Armagh]] in 1171. Because of religious constraints, the [[slave trade]] was carried out in parts of Europe by Iberian [[Jew]]s (known as [[Radhanites]]) who were able to transfer slaves from pagan [[Central Europe]] through Christian [[Western Europe]] to Muslim countries in [[Al-Andalus]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=693&amp;letter=C#2276 |title=Routes of the Jewish Merchants Called Radanites |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date=14 November 1902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mamluks]] were [[Ghilman|slave soldiers]] who converted to [[Islam]] and served the [[Muslim]] [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] [[Sultan]]s during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first Mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th century [[Baghdad]]. Over time, they became a powerful military [[caste]], and on more than one occasion they seized power for themselves, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250–1517. From 1250 Egypt had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] Turk origin. [[White people|White]] enslaved people from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corps of troops eventually revolting in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |publisher=Sunnahonline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Davis between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by [[Barbary pirates]] and sold as slaves to [[North Africa]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert C.

{{quote|"There are no records of how many men, women and children were enslaved, but it is possible to calculate roughly the number of fresh captives that would have been needed to keep populations steady and replace those slaves who died, escaped, were ransomed, or converted to Islam. On this basis it is thought that around 8,500 new slaves were needed annually to replenish numbers - about 850,000 captives over the century from 1580 to 1680.  By extension, for the 250 years between 1530 and 1780, the figure could easily have been as high as 1,250,000."&lt;ref name=Earle&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/11/highereducation.books|title=New book reopens old arguments about slave raids on Europe|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=2004-03-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-11|last2=correspondent|first2=Africa|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Davis' numbers have been disputed by other historians, such as David Earle, who cautions that true picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe and black people from west Africa.&lt;ref name=Earle/&gt;

In addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries, or millennia. Hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records. Middle East expert, John Wright, cautions that modern estimates are based on back-calculations from human observation.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Trans-Saharan Slave Trade|last=Wright|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such observations, across the late 1500s and early 1600s observers, estimate that around 35,000 European Christian slaves held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli, Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and coastal villagers. However, most of these captives were people from lands close to Africa, particularly Spain and Italy.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml|title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast|last=Davis|first=Robert|date=17 Feb 2011|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coastal villages and towns of [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|Mediterranean islands]] were frequently attacked by the pirates and long stretches of the Italian and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants; after 1600 Barbary pirates occasionally entered the Atlantic and struck as far north as [[Iceland]]. The most famous corsairs were the Ottoman [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa]] ("Redbeard"), and his older brother [[Aruj|Oruç]], [[Turgut Reis]] (known as [[Dragut]] in the West), [[Kurtoğlu Muslihiddin Reis|Kurtoğlu]] (known as [[Kurtoğlu Muslihiddin Reis|Curtogoli]] in the West), [[Kemal Reis]], [[Salih Reis]] and [[Murat Reis the Older|Koca Murat Reis]].&lt;ref name=Grabmeier /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml |title=BBC – History – British Slaves on the Barbary Coast |publisher=Bbc.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1544, [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] captured [[Ischia]], taking 4,000 prisoners in the process, and deported to [[slavery]] some 9,000 inhabitants of [[Lipari]], almost the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richtel |first=Matt |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/09/26/trsic_ed3_.php |title=The mysteries and majesties of the Aeolian Islands |publisher=''International Herald Tribune'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1551, Dragut enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island [[Gozo]], between 5,000 and 6,000, sending them to [[Libya]]. When pirates sacked [[Vieste]] in southern Italy in 1554 they took an estimated 7,000 slaves. In 1555, Turgut Reis sailed to [[Corsica]] and ransacked [[Bastia]], taking 6000 prisoners. In 1558 Barbary corsairs captured the town of [[Ciutadella]], destroyed it, [[murder|slaughtered]] the inhabitants and carried off 3,000 survivors to [[Istanbul]] as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holidays2menorca.com/history.php |title=History of Menorca |publisher=Holidays2menorca.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207215521/http://www.holidays2menorca.com/history.php |archivedate=7 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1563 Turgut Reis landed at the shores of the province of [[Granada]], Spain, and captured the coastal settlements in the area like [[Almuñécar]], along with 4,000 prisoners.

Slavery was common along the Upper [[Congo River]], and in the second half of the 18th century the region became a major source of slaves for the [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic Slave Trade]], when high slave prices on the coast made long-distance slave trading profitable. When the Atlantic trade came to an end, the prices of slaves dropped dramatically, and the regional slave trade grew, dominated by [[Bangi language|Bobangi]] traders. The Bobangi also purchased a large number of slaves with profits from selling ivory, who they used to populate their villages. A distinction was made between two different types of slaves in this region; slaves who had been sold by their kin group, typically as a result of undesirable behavior such as adultery, were unlikely to attempt to flee. In addition to those considered socially undesirable, the sale of children was also common in times of famine. Slaves who were captured, however, were likely to attempt to escape and had to be moved hundreds of kilometers from their homes as a safeguard against this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=River of Wealth, River of Sorrow: The Central Zaire Basin in the Era of the Slave and Ivory Trade, 1500-1891|last=Harms|first=Robert W.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1981|isbn=978-0300026160|location=New Haven|pages=28–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slave trade had a profound impact on this region of Central Africa, completely reshaping various aspects of society. For instance, the slave trade helped to create a robust regional trade network for the foodstuffs and crafted goods of small producers along the river. As the transport of only a few slaves in a canoe was sufficient to cover the cost of a trip and still make a profit, traders could fill any unused space on their canoes with other goods and transport them long distances without a significant markup on price. While the large profits from the Congo River slave trade only went to a small number of traders, this aspect of the trade provided some benefit to local producers and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=River of Wealth, River of Sorrow|last=Harms|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of slavery were practiced in diverse ways in different communities of West Africa prior to European trade.&lt;ref name=Manning-1983 /&gt; With the development of the trans-[[Sahara|Saharan]] slave trade and the economies of gold in the western [[Sahel]], a number of the major states became organized around the slave trade, including the [[Ghana Empire]], the [[Mali Empire]], and [[Songhai Empire]].&lt;ref name=Meillassoux&gt;{{cite book|last=Meillassoux|first=Claude|title=The Anthropology of Slavery: The Womb of Iron and Gold|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other communities in West Africa largely resisted the slave trade. The [[Mossi Kingdoms]] tried to take over key sites in the trans-Saharan trade and, when these efforts failed, the Mossi became defenders against slave raiding by the powerful states of the western Sahel. The Mossi would eventually enter the slave trade in the 1800s with the Atlantic slave trade being the main market.&lt;ref name=Meillassoux /&gt;

In the [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]] region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was enslaved. In early [[Islamic]] states of the western Sahel, including [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]] (750–1076), [[Mali Empire|Mali]] (1235–1645), [[Bamana Empire|Segou]] (1712–1861), and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] (1275–1591), about a third of the population were enslaved. In [[Sierra Leone]] in the 19th century about half of the population consisted of enslaved people. Among the [[Vai people|Vai]] people, during the 19th century, three quarters of people were slaves. In the 19th century at least half the population was enslaved among the [[Duala people|Duala]] of the [[Cameroon]] and other peoples of the lower [[Niger river|Niger]], the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]], and the Kasanje kingdom and [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] of [[Angola]]. Among the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] a third of the population consisted of enslaved people. The population of the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] (1600–1800) was about a third-enslaved. It was perhaps 40% in [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] (1580–1890). Between 1750 and 1900 from one- to two-thirds of the entire population of the [[Fulani jihad]] states consisted of enslaved people. The population of the [[Sokoto]] caliphate formed by [[Hausa people|Hausas]] in the northern [[Nigeria]] and Cameroon was half-enslaved in the 19th century. Slavery was widespread among [[Taureg]] peoples and lasted until at least 1975.

With sea trade from the eastern [[African Great Lakes]] region to Persia, China, and India during the first millennium AD, slaves are mentioned as a commodity of secondary importance to gold and ivory. When mentioned, the slave trade appears to be of a small-scale and mostly involve slave raiding of women and children along the islands of [[Kilwa Kisiwani]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Pemba Island|Pemba]].&lt;ref name=Kusimba&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kusimba|first=Chapurukha M.|title=The African Archaeological Review|journal=Archaeology of Slavery in East Africa|year=2004|volume=21|issue=2|pages=59–88|jstor=25130793|doi=10.1023/b:aarr.0000030785.72144.4a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians Campbell and Alpers argue that there were a host of different categories of labor in [[Southeast Africa]] and that the distinction between slave and free individuals was not particularly relevant in most societies.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Alpers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Gwyn|last2=Alpers|first2=Edward A.|title=Introduction: Slavery, forced labour and resistance in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia|journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition|year=2004|volume=25|issue=2|pages=ix–xxvii|doi=10.1080/0144039042000292992}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with increasing international trade in the 18th and 19th century, Southeast Africa began to be involved significantly in the Atlantic slave trade; for example, with the king of Kilwa island signing a treaty with a French merchant in 1776 for the delivery of 1,000 slaves per year.&lt;ref name=Kusimba /&gt;

At about the same time, merchants from [[Oman]], [[India]], and Southeast Africa began establishing plantations along the coasts and on the islands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Unveiling Zanzibar's unhealed wounds | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8167390.stm | newspaper=BBC News | date=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide workers on these plantations, slave raiding and slave holding became increasingly important in the region and slave traders (most notably [[Tippu Tip]]) became prominent in the political environment of the region.&lt;ref name=Kusimba /&gt; The Southeast African trade reached its height in the early decades of the 1800s with up to 30,000 slaves sold per year.

In the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]] of Africa (around present-day [[Uganda]]), linguistic evidence shows the existence of slavery through war capture, trade, and pawning going back hundreds of years; however, these forms, particularly pawning, appear to have increased significantly in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoenbrun|first=David|title=Slavery in the Great Lakes Region of East Africa|year=2007|publisher=James Currey Ltd.|location=Oxford, England|pages=38–74|chapter=Violence, Marginality, Scorn &amp; Honor: Language Evidence of Slavery in the Eighteenth Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave relationships in Africa have been transformed through three large-scale processes: the Arab slave trade, the Atlantic slave trade, and the slave emancipation policies and movements in the 19th and 20th century. Each of these processes significantly changed the forms, level, and economics of slavery in Africa.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Lovejoy|first=Paul E.|title=Transformations of Slavery: A History of Slavery in Africa|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave practices in Africa were used during different periods to justify specific forms of European engagement with the peoples of Africa. Eighteenth century writers in Europe claimed that slavery in Africa was quite brutal in order to justify the Atlantic slave trade. Later writers used similar arguments to justify intervention and eventual colonization by European powers to end slavery in Africa.&lt;ref name=Klein-1978&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Martin A.|title=The Study of Slavery in Africa|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1978|volume=19|issue=4|pages=599–609|doi=10.1017/s0021853700016509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africans knew of the harsh slavery that awaited slaves in the New World. Many elite Africans visited Europe on slave ships following the prevailing winds through the New World. One example of this occurred when Antonio Manuel, Kongo’s ambassador to the Vatican, went to Europe in 1604, stopping first in Bahia, Brazil, where he arranged to free a countryman who had been wrongfully enslaved. African monarchs also sent their children along these same slave routes to be educated in Europe, and thousands of former slaves eventually returned to settle Liberia and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name="Ending the Slavery Blame-Game"/&gt;

===Trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean trade===
{{main article|Arab slave trade}}
[[File:Arabslavers.jpg|thumb|Nineteenth-century engraving of [[Arab]] slave-trading caravan transporting African slaves across the [[Sahara]].]]
The Arab slave trade, established in the eighth and ninth centuries AD, began with small-scale movement of people largely from the eastern Great Lakes region and the Sahel.  Islamic law allowed slavery but prohibited slavery involving other pre-existing Muslims; as a result, the main target for slavery were the people who lived in the frontier areas of Islam in Africa.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt; The trade of slaves across the Sahara and across the Indian Ocean also has a long history beginning with the control of sea routes by [[Afro-Arab]] traders in the ninth century. It is estimated that, at that time, a few thousand enslaved people were taken each year from the Red Sea and Indian Ocean coast. They were sold throughout the [[Middle East]]. This trade accelerated as superior ships led to more trade and greater demand for labour on [[plantation]]s in the region. Eventually, tens of thousands per year were being taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Donnelly Fage|author1-link=John Donnelly Fage|author2=William Tordoff |title=A History of Africa |url= |location=Budapest |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=258 |edition=4 |date=December 2001 |isbn=978-0415252485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Swahili Coast]], the Afro-Arab slavers captured [[Bantu peoples]] from the interior and brought them to the littoral.&lt;ref name="Lodhi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lodhi|first=Abdulaziz|title=Oriental Influences in Swahili: a study in language and culture contacts|year=2000|publisher=Acta Universitatis Gothoburgensis|isbn=978-9173463775|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZcLAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tannenbaum"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edward R.

This changed the slave relationships by creating new forms of employment by slaves (as eunuchs to guard harems and in military units) and creating conditions for freedom (namely conversion—although it would only free a slave's children).&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;  Although the level of the trade remained relatively small, the size of total slaves traded grew to a large number over the multiple centuries of its existence.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt; Because of its small and gradual nature, the impact on slavery practices in communities that did not convert to Islam was relatively small.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt; However, in the 1800s, the slave trade from Africa to the Islamic countries picked up significantly. When the European slave trade ended around the 1850s, the slave trade to the east picked up significantly only to be ended with European colonization of Africa around 1900.&lt;ref name=Manning-1990&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Patrick|title=Slavery and African Life: Occidental, Oriental, and African Slave Trades|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1500 and 1900, up to 17 million Africans slaves were transported by Muslim traders to the coast of the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, and North Africa.&lt;ref name="bbcFocus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1523100.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Focus on the slave trade|date=3 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814, Swiss explorer [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|Johann Burckhardt]] wrote of his travels in [[Egypt]] and [[Nubia]], where he saw the practice of slave trading: "I frequently witnessed scenes of the most shameless indecency, which the traders, who were the principal actors, only laughed at. I may venture to state, that very few female slaves who have passed their tenth year, reach Egypt or Arabia in a state of virginity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burckhardt/john_lewis//nubia/chapter2.html Travels in Nubia, by John Lewis Burckhardt] (ebook).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Livingstone]] wrote of the slave trade: "To overdraw its evils is a simple impossibility ... We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path. [Onlookers] said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead ... We came upon a man dead from starvation ... The strangest disease I have seen in this country seems really to be broken heartedness, and it attacks free men who have been captured and made slaves." Livingstone estimated that 80,000 Africans died each year before ever reaching the slave markets of [[Zanzibar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chi.gospelcom.net/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps111.shtml David Livingstone; Christian History Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050307091850/http://chi.gospelcom.net/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps111.shtml |date=7 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilotguides.com/destination_guide/africa/tanzania_and_zanzibar/slave_trade.php |title=The blood of a nation of Slaves in Stone Town |author=Susi O'Neill |website=www.pilotguides.com |publisher=[[Globe Trekker]] |access-date=29 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225051221/http://www.pilotguides.com/destination_guide/africa/tanzania_and_zanzibar/slave_trade.php |archivedate=25 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mwachiro |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6510675.stm |title=BBC Remembering East African slave raids |publisher=BBC News |date=30 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zanzibar |url=http://uk.geocities.com/goldenmaggot.t21@btinternet.com/zanzibar.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmCtlBDt?url=http://uk.geocities.com/goldenmaggot.t21@btinternet.com/zanzibar.html |archivedate=25 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zanzibar was once East Africa's main slave-trading port, and under Omani Arabs in the 19th century as many as 50,000 slaves were passing through the city each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/data/2001/10/01/html/ft_20011001.6.html |title=Swahili Coast |publisher=.nationalgeographic.com |date=17 October 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade took place across the Atlantic Ocean from the 15th through to the 19th centuries. The Atlantic slave trade was significant in transforming Africans from a small percentage of the global population of slaves in 1600 into the overwhelming majority by 1800.&lt;ref name=Manning&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manning|first=Patrick|title=The Slave Trade: The Formal Demography of a Global System|journal=Social Science History|year=1990|volume=14|issue=2|pages=255–279|doi=10.2307/1171441|jstor=1171441}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slave trade was transformed from a marginal aspect of the economies into the largest sector in a relatively short span. In addition, [[Plantation economy|agricultural plantations]] increased significantly and became a key aspect in many societies.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt; Finally, it transformed the traditional distribution of the slave practices.

The first Europeans to arrive on the coast of [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]] were the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]; the first European to actually buy enslaved Africans in the region of Guinea was [[Antão Gonçalves]], a Portuguese explorer in 1441 AD. Originally interested in trading mainly for [[gold]] and [[spice]]s, they set up colonies on the uninhabited islands of [[São Tomé]]. In the 16th century the Portuguese settlers found that these volcanic islands were ideal for growing [[sugar]]. Sugar growing is a labour-intensive undertaking and Portuguese settlers were difficult to attract due to the heat, lack of infrastructure, and hard life. To cultivate the sugar the Portuguese turned to large numbers of enslaved Africans. [[Elmina Castle]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], originally built by African labour for the Portuguese in 1482 to control the gold trade, became an important depot for slaves that were to be transported to the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;John Henrik Clarke.

The [[Atlantic slave trade]] peaked in the late 18th century, when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement is misleading and implies that slave traders conducted interior raids while the reference states small numbers captured in coastal area|date=September 2017}} The increase of demand for slaves due to the expansion of European colonial powers to the [[New World]] made the slave trade much more lucrative to the West African powers, leading to the establishment of a number of actual [[African empires|West African empires]] thriving on slave trade.
These included the [[Oyo empire]] ([[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), [[Kong Empire]], [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]], [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], [[Kingdom of Koya]], [[Kingdom of Khasso]], [[Kaabu|Kingdom of Kaabu]], [[Fante Confederacy]], [[Ashanti Confederacy]], and the kingdom of [[Dahomey]].

When European powers began to stop the Atlantic slave trade, this caused a further change in that large holders of slaves in Africa began to exploit enslaved people on plantations and other agricultural products.&lt;ref name=Gueye&gt;{{cite book|last=Gueye|first=Mbaye|title=The African Slave Trade from the Fifteenth to the Nineteenth Century|year=1979|publisher=UNESCO|location=Paris|pages=150–163|chapter=The slave trade within the African continent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts by Europeans against slavery and the slave trade began in the late 18th century and had a large impact on slavery in Africa. Portugal was the first country in the continent to abolish slavery in metropolitan Portugal and [[Portuguese India]] by a bill issued on 12 February 1761, but this did not affect their colonies of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Portuguese Africa]]. France abolished slavery in 1794. However, slavery was again allowed by [[Napoleon]] in 1802 and not abolished for good until 1848. In 1803, [[Denmark-Norway]] became the first country from Europe to implement a ban on the slave trade. Slavery itself was not banned until 1848.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez&gt;{{cite book|author=Junius P.

This law allowed stiff fines, increasing with the number of slaves transported, for captains of slave ships. Britain followed this with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] which freed all slaves in the British Empire. British pressure on other countries resulted in them agreeing to end the slave trade from Africa. For example, the [[1820 U.S. Law on Slave Trade]] made slave trading [[piracy]], punishable by [[capital punishment|death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/08trouvadore/background/piracy/piracy.html|title=The U.S. Navy and the Anti-Piracy Patrol in the Caribbean|last=Carrell|first=Toni L|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Ottoman Empire]] abolished slave trade from Africa in 1847 under British pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehûd R.

By 1850, the year that the last major Atlantic slave trade participant (Brazil) passed the [[Eusébio de Queirós Law]] banning the slave trade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJdaM325m8IC&amp;pg=PA110 |title=A Concise History of Brazil|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=4 June 2011|isbn=9780521565264|date=1999-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the slave trades had been significantly slowed and in general only illegal trade went on. Brazil continued the practice of slavery and was a major source for illegal trade until about 1870 and the abolition of slavery became permanent in 1888 when Princess [[Isabel of Brazil]] and Minister [[Rodrigo Silva (politician)|Rodrigo Silva]] (son-in-law of senator Eusebio de Queiroz) banned the practice.&lt;ref name=Manning-1990 /&gt; The British took an active approach to stopping the illegal Atlantic slave trade during this period. The [[West Africa Squadron]] was credited with capturing 1,600 slave ships between 1808 and 1860, and freeing 150,000 Africans who were aboard these ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml|title=Sailing Against Slavery|last=Loosemore|first=Jo|date=8 July 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against ‘the usurping [[Oba of Lagos|King of Lagos]]’, deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.

According to Patrick Manning, internal slavery was most important to Africa in the second half of the 19th century stating "if there is any time when one can speak of African societies being organized around a slave mode production, [1850–1900] was it". The abolition of the Atlantic slave trade resulted in the economies of African states dependent on the trade being reorganized towards domestic plantation slavery and legitimate commerce worked by slave labor. Slavery before this period was generally domestic.&lt;ref name=Manning-1990 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Austin/&gt;

The continuing [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]] in Europe became an excuse and a [[casus belli]] for the European conquest and colonization of much of the African continent.&lt;ref name=Klein-1978 /&gt; It was the central theme of the [[Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889-90]]. In the late 19th century, the Scramble for Africa saw the continent rapidly divided between Imperialistic European powers, and an early but secondary focus of all [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. Following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves in French West Africa fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klein, ‘Slave Descent and Social Status in Sahara and Sudan’, in Reconfiguring Slavery: West African Trajectories, ed. Benedetta Rossi (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2009), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In Madagascar over 500,000 slaves were freed following French abolition in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history. New York: CRC Press, p. 878&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this pressure, Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932, [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900, and the rest of the Sahel in 1911. Colonial nations were mostly successful in this aim, though slavery is still very active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression, even as they, in the case of Egypt, hired European soldiers like [[Samuel White Baker]]'s expedition up the Nile. Slavery has never been eradicated in Africa, and it commonly appears in African states, such as [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Sudan]], in places where law and order have collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/africa/sudanupdate.htm|title=Slavery and Slave Redemption in the Sudan|date=March 2002|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although outlawed in all countries today, slavery is practiced in secret in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2010401.stm|title=Millions 'forced into slavery'|date=27 May 2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 30 million victims of slavery worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/17/world/global-slavery-index/ India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria on slavery's list of shame, says report]".

===Demographics===

Slavery and the slave trades had a significant impact on the size of the population and the gender distribution throughout much of Africa. The precise impact of these demographic shifts has been an issue of significant debate. The Atlantic slave trade took 70,000 people, primarily from the west coast of Africa, per year at its peak in the mid-1700s.&lt;ref name=Manning-1990 /&gt; The Arab slave trade involved the capture of peoples from the continental interior, who were then shipped overseas through ports on the Red Sea and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Gcam"/&gt; It peaked at 10,000 people bartered per year in the 1600s.&lt;ref name=Manning-1990 /&gt; According to Patrick Manning, there were consistent population decreases in large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa as a result of these slave trades. This population decline throughout West Africa from 1650 until 1850 was exacerbated by the preference of slave traders for male slaves.&lt;ref name=Manning-1990 /&gt; In eastern Africa, the slave trade was multi-directional and changed over time. To meet the demand for menial labor, [[Zanj]] slaves captured from the southern interior were sold through ports on the northern seaboard in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries to customers in the [[Nile Valley]], [[Horn of Africa]], [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Persian Gulf]], [[India]], [[Far East]] and the [[List of islands in the Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean islands]].&lt;ref name="Gcam"&gt;Gwyn Campbell, ''The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia'', 1 edition, (Routledge: 2003), p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extent of slavery====
The extent of slavery within Africa and the trade in slaves to other regions is not known precisely. Although the Atlantic slave trade has been best studied, estimates range from 8 million people to 20 million.&lt;ref name="Curtin1972"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curtin|first=Philip D.|title=The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4uEWu0GwwhkC&amp;pg=PR5|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=1972|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-05403-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database estimates that the Atlantic slave trade took around 12.8 million people between 1450 and 1900.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name="TAST Database"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade |url=http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/index.faces |publisher=Emory University |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325095837/http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/index.faces |archivedate=25 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slave trade across the Sahara and Red Sea from the Sahara, the Horn of Africa, and East Africa, has been estimated at 6.2 million people between 600 and 1600.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt; Although the rate decreased from East Africa in the 1700s, it increased in the 1800s and is estimated at 1.65 million for that century.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy-2012 /&gt;

Estimates by Patrick Manning are that about 12 million slaves entered the Atlantic trade between the 16th and 19th century, but about 1.5 million died on board ship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About 10.5 million slaves arrived in the Americas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Besides the slaves who died on the Middle Passage, more Africans likely died during the slave raids in Africa and forced marches to ports. Manning estimates that 4 million died inside Africa after capture, and many more died young.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Manning's estimate covers the 12 million who were originally destined for the Atlantic, as well as the 6 million destined for Asian slave markets and the 8 million destined for African markets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Patrick Manning, "The Slave Trade: The Formal Dermographics of a Global System" in Joseph E. Inikori and Stanley L. Engerman (eds), ''The Atlantic Slave Trade: Effects on Economies, Societies and Peoples in Africa, the Americas, and Europe'' (Duke University Press, 1992), pp. 117-44, [https://books.google.com/books?id=abvkqNGSTZ0C&amp;pg=PA119 online at pp. 119-20.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debate about demographic effect====
[[File:Slavezanzibar2.JPG|thumb|160px|Photograph of a slave boy in [[Zanzibar]]. 'An Arab master's punishment for a slight offence.' c. 1890.]]
The demographic effects of the slave trade are some of the most controversial and debated issues. [[Walter Rodney]] argued that the export of so many people had been a demographic disaster and had left Africa permanently disadvantaged when compared to other parts of the world, and that this largely explains that continent's continued poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney, Walter, ''How Europe Underdeveloped Africa'', London: [[Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications]], 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; He presents numbers that show that Africa's population stagnated during this period, while that of Europe and Asia grew dramatically. According to Rodney all other areas of the economy were disrupted by the slave trade as the top merchants abandoned traditional industries to pursue slaving and the lower levels of the population were disrupted by the slaving itself.

Others have challenged this view. [[J. D. Fage]] compared the number effect on the continent as a whole. David Eltis has compared the numbers to the rate of [[emigration]] from [[Europe]] during this period. In the 19th century alone over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas, a far higher rate than were ever taken from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;David Eltis, ''Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic Slave Trade'', Oxford University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others in turn challenged that view. [[Joseph E. Inikori]] argues the history of the region shows that the effects were still quite deleterious. He argues that the African economic model of the period was very different from the European, and could not sustain such population losses. Population reductions in certain areas also led to widespread problems. Inikori also notes that after the suppression of the slave trade Africa's population almost immediately began to rapidly increase, even prior to the introduction of modern medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Inikori, "Ideology versus the Tyranny of Paradigm: Historians and the Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade on African Societies", ''African Economic History'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on the economy of Africa===

There is a longstanding debate amongst analysts and scholars about the destructive impacts of the slave trades.&lt;ref name=Manning-1983 /&gt; It is often claimed that the slave trade undermined local economies and political stability as villages' vital labour forces were shipped overseas as slave raids and civil wars became commonplace. With the rise of a large commercial slave trade, driven by European needs, enslaving your enemy became less a consequence of war, and more and more a reason to go to war.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The slave trade, it is claimed, impeded the formation of larger ethnic groups, causing ethnic factionalism and weakening the formation for stable political structures in many places. It also is claimed to have reduced the mental health and social development of African people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Nunn| first = Nathan|title = The Long-Term Effects of Africa's Slave Trades | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 123 | issue = 1 | pages = 139–1745 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts|MA]] |year=2008 | url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nunn/files/the_long_term_effects.pdf | doi = 10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.139 | id = | accessdate =10 April 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to these arguments, J. D. Fage asserts that slavery did not have a wholly disastrous effect on the societies of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Fage, J. D. ''A History of Africa''. Routledge, 4th edition, 2001, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were an expensive commodity, and traders received a great deal in exchange for each enslaved person. At the peak of the slave trade hundreds of thousands of muskets, vast quantities of cloth, gunpowder, and metals were being shipped to Guinea. Most of this money was spent on British-made firearms (of very poor quality) and industrial-grade alcohol. Trade with Europe at the peak of the slave trade—which also included significant exports of gold and [[ivory trade|ivory]]—was some 3.5 million pounds Sterling per year. By contrast, the trade of the [[United Kingdom]], the economic superpower of the time, was about 14 million pounds per year over this same period of the late 18th century. As [[Patrick Manning (Professor)|Patrick Manning]] has pointed out, the vast majority of items traded for slaves were common rather than luxury goods. Textiles, iron ore, currency, and salt were some of the most important commodities imported as a result of the slave trade, and these goods were spread within the entire society raising the general standard of living.&lt;ref name=Manning-1983 /&gt;

===Effects on Europe's economy===
[[Karl Marx]] in his economic history of capitalism, ''[Das Kapital]'', claimed that "...the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins [that is, the slave trade], signalled the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production." He argued that the slave trade was part of what he termed the "primitive accumulation" of European capital, the non-capitalist accumulation of wealth that preceded and created the financial conditions for Britain's industrialisation and the advent of the capitalist mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch31.htm "Chapter Thirty-One: Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist"], ''Das Kapital: Volume 1'', 1867.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Williams]] has written about the contribution of Africans on the basis of profits from the slave trade and slavery, arguing that the employment of those profits were used to help finance Britain’s industrialisation. He argues that the enslavement of Africans was an essential element to the Industrial Revolution, and that European wealth was, in part, a result of slavery, but that by the time of its abolition it had lost its profitability and it was in Britain's economic interest to ban it.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Williams, ''Capitalism &amp; Slavery'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1944), pp. 98–107, 169–177, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Inikori has written that the British slave trade was more profitable than the critics of Williams believe. Other researchers and historians have strongly contested what has come to be referred to as the "Williams thesis" in academia: [[David Richardson (historian)|David Richardson]] has concluded that the profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;David Richardson, "The British Empire and the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1660–1807," in P. J. Marshall (ed.), ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998), pp. 440–464.&lt;/ref&gt; and economic historian [[Stanley Engerman]] finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., shipping costs, slave mortality, mortality of whites in Africa, defense costs) or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the British economy during any year of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name="The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3113341|author=Stanley L. Engerman|title=The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century|journal=Business History Review|volume=46|issue=4|pages=430–443|doi=10.2307/3113341|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Richard Pares]], in an article written before Williams’ book, dismisses the influence of wealth generated from the West Indian plantations upon the financing of the Industrial Revolution, stating that whatever substantial flow of investment from West Indian profits into industry there was occurred after emancipation, not before.&lt;ref name="The Economic Factors in the History of the Empire"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=2590147|author=Richard Pares|title=The Economic Factors in the History of the Empire|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=7|issue=2|pages=119|doi=10.2307/2590147|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findlay and O'Rourke noted that the figures presented by O'Brien (1982) to back his claim that "the periphery was peripheral" suggest the opposite, with profits from the periphery 1784–1786 being £5.66 million when there was £10.30 million total gross investment in the British economy and similar proportions for 1824–1826. They note that dismissing the profits of the enslavement of human beings from significance because it was a "small share of national income", could be used to argue that there was no industrial revolution, since modern industry provided only a small share of national income and that it is a mistake to assume that small size is the same as small significance. Findlay and O'Rourke also note that the share of American export commodities produced by enslaved human beings, rose from 54% between 1501 and 1550 to 82.5% between 1761–1780.&lt;ref name="Findlay&amp;O'Rourke"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Findlay |first1=Ronald |last2= O'Rourke |first2=Kevin H. |title= Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium |date=2009 |publisher= Princeton University Press |location= Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691143279 |pages= 334–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seymour Drescher and Robert Anstey argue the slave trade remained profitable until the end, because of innovations in agriculture, and that moralistic reform, not economic incentive, was primarily responsible for abolition.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Ward. "The British West Indies in the Age of Abolition" in P.J. Marshall (ed.), ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998), pp. 415–439.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar debate has taken place about other European nations. The French slave trade, it is argued, was more profitable than alternative domestic investments, and probably encouraged [[capital accumulation]] before the Industrial Revolution and [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Daudin, "Profitability of slave and long distance trading in context: the case of eighteenth century France", ''Journal of Economic History'', vol. 64, number 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy of racism===
[[Maulana Karenga]] states the effects of the Atlantic slave trade in African captives: "[T]he morally monstrous destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among people of today".  He says that it constituted the destruction of culture, language, religion and human possibility.&lt;ref name="Ethics on Reparations"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/ethics%20of%20the%20holocaust.html |publisher="[[Ron Karenga]]" |title= Engaging the Holocaust of Enslavement}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''War termination''' is the study of how wars end, including theories of how wars can and should be ended. 

In comparison to other aspects of war, war termination has received relatively less study. According to Fred Charles Iklé, "[H]istorians, foreign affairs experts, and military strategists have devoted far more thought to the question of how and why wars begin."&lt;ref&gt;Iklé, p.vii&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea is echoed by [[Gideon Rose]], who writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For all endgames' drama and historical importance, however, they have received far less attention than other phases of war. A few books look at the ends of individual wars, and there is a small academic literature on what political scientists call war termination. But in general, endgames have been as neglected by scholars as they have been by policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In studying the factors which constrain and shape the actions of decision-makers and strategists in ending wars, there are three major schools of thought:

#Realism, which considers that a nation's foreign policy is primarily concerned with security issues, and sees '''[[power politics|international power politics]]''' as the most important factor;
#Those who see '''internal factors''', such as [[political ideology]] and domestic politics, as the primary factors;
#Those who consider '''psychological factors''', such as the personalities of a country's leaders, and the society's experiences in the most recent war, as most instrumental in shaping those leaders' actions in the endgame.&lt;ref name=Rose5&gt;Rose, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories, such as [[neoclassical realism]], combine these factors to one extent or another.&lt;ref name=Rose5 /&gt;

==Theories of war termination==
War termination is coercive bargaining &lt;ref&gt;Slantchev, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and it only comes to an end when two interacting sides can agree upon their relative strength and credibly commit to a settlement (Stanley and Sawyer, 2009). According to Slantchev’s Principle of Convergence, in order for that to happen, both players must have enough information about the other’s strengths and about what they are willing to concede. Once expectations about the outcomes of war converge sufficiently, a bargaining space is created so that a negotiated settlement can be reached. &lt;ref&gt;Slantchev, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}}

The battlefield is one of the main sources of information about the enemy, says Slantchev. It is in warfare that one discovers how far belligerents are willing to go and what chances one has against the other. Players will delay agreement until they have enough information about their prospects, thus avoiding settling on bad terms. Once they learn enough about the other, then warfare becomes irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Slantchev, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}}
 
According to the author, another important way of gathering information about the opponent is the way he behaves on the negotiation table. "Since readiness to talk can be so revealing, it may provide a good rationale for delaying explicit diplomacy until after an armistice. (…) For example, making an unreasonable demand signals strength but defeat in battle reveals weakness."

Provided with the new information acquired from the battlefield and from the negotiation table, players are then capable of adjusting their expectations about the outcomes of war. Once they are convergent enough, the bargaining space is created and conflict can come to an end through a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Slantchev, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}}

The adjustment of expectations, however, can also come from a change in the foreign policy leadership itself, or as Stanley and Sawyer (2009) would say, from domestic coalition shifts. A "domestic governing coalition" is "the elite foreign policy decision-making group in each belligerent government," that is, the actors who have the power to decide whether a country engages in war or if it ends it. A "domestic coalition shift," as the authors define it, is either "(1) a consequential change in the identity of the decision makers or (2) a substantive change in the type of government." In other words, domestic aspects of the players, such as their type of regime and their leaders' characteristics, can affect war termination.

Having the domestic coalition in mind, according to The Equifinality of War theory, there can be three kinds of obstacles to peace. The first one is a matter of preference: if decision makers do not want to stop the war, be it for personal stakes, reputation, or security (when the costs of not engaging are higher than going to war, for instance), there is no place for negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley and Sawyer, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}}

The second obstacle has to do with information: if leaders receive poor quality information or if there is a problem in the way this information is interpreted, they are not aware of the fact that they should end the war.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley and Sawyer, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, there is the risk of entrapment, which can be defined as decision makers wanting to end the war, having all the information needed to do so, but not being able to do it, due to "internal or external hawkish constituencies." The more entrenched war becomes, the harder it is to end it.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley and Sawyer, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}}
	
If war termination demands that at least one side changes its expectations about the outcomes of war, then a domestic coalition shift may accelerate this process and overcome the obstacles to peace, say Stanley and Sawyer. "The coalition shift allows different political actors — with different interests, assessments of the war, and constituencies — to take power."

The Principle of Convergence, the Equifinality of War  and every other theory of war termination make one assumption: that at some point, a negotiation with the enemy is going to be possible, acceptable and, in the end, desirable. Regardless of the information gathered in warfare, there is eventually going to be room for diplomacy. Negotiation is paramount for the achievement of peace as defined by Clausewitz: the acceptance by the belligerents that the war results are final, not something that can be changed by violence when more favourable circumstances appear.&lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, 1832&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}}

{{EU history}}
The '''Western European Union''' ('''WEU''') was the international organisation and military alliance that succeeded the [[Western Union (alliance)|Western Union]] (WU) after the 1954 amendment of the 1948 [[Treaty of Brussels]]. The WEU implemented the [[Treaty of Brussels#Modification|Modified Brussels Treaty]]. The WEU member states were also allies of the [[United States]] (the [[Western Bloc]] and [[NATO]] members) during the [[Cold War]] through the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).

At the turn of the 21st century, after the end of the Cold War, WEU tasks and institutions were gradually transferred to the [[European Union]] (EU), providing central parts of the EU's new military component, the [[Common Security and Defence Policy|European Security and Defence Policy]] (ESDP). This process was completed in 2009 when a solidarity clause between the [[member states of the European Union]], which was similar (but not identical) to the WEU's mutual defence clause, entered into force with the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]. The states party to the Modified Treaty of Brussels consequently decided to terminate that treaty on 31 March 2010, with all the WEU's remaining activities to be ceased within 15 months. On 30 June 2011, the WEU was officially declared defunct.&lt;ref name="terminate"&gt;[http://www.weu.int/Declaration_E.pdf Statement of the Presidency of the Permanent Council of the WEU on behalf of the High Contracting Parties to the Modified Brussels Treaty – Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom], WEU 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
{{Further|Treaty of Brussels|Western Union (alliance)}}
The Treaty of Brussels was signed by the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]] on 17 March 1948, establishing the [[Western Union (alliance)|Western Union]] (WU) - an intergovernmental defence alliance that also promoted economic, cultural and social collaboration.

The need to back up the commitments of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] with appropriate political and military structures led to the creation of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO). In December 1950 the parties to the Treaty of Brussels decided to transfer the headquarters, personnel, and plans of the [[Western Union]] Military Organisation (WUDO) to NATO, whose [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) took over responsibility for the defence of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1957/feb/18/brussels-treaty-organisation-resolution Hansard extract] 18 February 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ElusiveQuest&gt;{{cite book |title= The elusive quest for European security: from EDC to CFSP |last= Duke |first= Simon |year= 2000 |publisher= [[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location= Basingstoke, UK |isbn= 978-0-312-22402-8 |pages= 13–14 |url= http://us.macmillan.com/theelusivequestforeuropeansecurity |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DYK&gt;{{cite web | title= Did you know that Europe already had a defensive military alliance prior to NATO? | url= http://www.aco.nato.int/page20923100.aspx | work= [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Allied Command Operations (ACO)]] | publisher= [[NATO]] | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;{{cite book |title= NATO 1948: the birth of the transatlantic Alliance |last= Kaplan |first= Lawrence S. |year= |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.]] |location= [[Lanham, Maryland]] |isbn= 0-7425-3917-2 |pages= 139–165 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UV-ti1sYcbcC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%http://www.rowmanlittlefield.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=^DB/CATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0742539172 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Brussels Treaty Organisation (Resolution) |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1957/feb/18/brussels-treaty-organisation-resolution |work= [[Hansard]] |publisher= [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] |location= [[London]] |format= |volume=565 |id=cc19-20W |date= 18 February 1957 |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of NATO, along with the signing of a succession of treaties establishing the [[OECD|Organisation for European Economic Cooperation]] (April 1948), the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (April 1949), the [[Council of Europe]] (May 1949) and the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (April 1951), left the Treaty of Brussels and its Western Union devoid of authority.

===1954-1984: A largely dormant organisation is established===
{{Further|London and Paris Conferences|Treaty of Brussels#Modification}}
[[File:Flag of the Western European Union (1993-1995).svg|thumb|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]] First, 9-star flag (1993–1995)]]
The Western Union's founding [[Treaty of Brussels]] was amended at the 1954 [[London and Paris Conferences#Paris|Paris Conference]] as a result of the failure of the [[Treaty establishing the European Defence Community]] to gain French ratification: The [[General Treaty]] ({{lang-de|Deutschlandvertrag}}) of 1952 formally named the EDC as a prerequisite of the end of Allied occupation of Germany, and there was a desire to include Germany in the Western defence architecture. The Modified Brussels Treaty (MBT) transformed the Western Union into the Western European Union, at which point Italy and Germany were admitted. Although the WEU established by the Modified Brussels Treaty was significantly less powerful and ambitious than the original Western Union, German membership of the WEU was considered sufficient for the occupation of the country to end in accordance with the General Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Text of Modified Brussels Treaty on the WEU website at http://www.weu.int/Treaty.htm#1 (Accessed 22 Feb 18)&lt;/ref&gt;

The signatories of the Paris Agreements stated their three main objectives in the preamble to the  Modified Brussels Treaty:
* To create in Western Europe a firm basis for European economic recovery;
* To afford assistance to each other in resisting any policy of aggression;
* To promote the unity and encourage the progressive integration of Europe.

The social and cultural aspects of the Treaty of Brussels were handed to the Council of Europe (CoE) to avoid duplication of responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/en/collections/unit-content/-/unit/02bb76df-d066-4c08-a58a-d4686a3e68ff/9059327f-7f8a-4a74-ac7e-5a0f3247bcd3/Resources#73277207-d250-41c5-8960-1d8bce9f11aa_en&amp;overlay The Western European Union] On CVCE website&lt;/ref&gt; This, in addition to the existence of NATO, marginalised the WEU, and caused it to be largely defunct.

On 1 January 1960 in accordance with the decision taken on 21 October 1959 by the Council of Western European Union and with Resolution(59)23 adopted on 16 November 1959 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, the WEU activities in social and cultural areas (Social Committee, Public Health Committee, Joint Committee on the Rehabilitation and Resettlement of the Disabled and Cultural Committee) were transferred to the Council of Europe which was already running programmes in these fields. The European Universities Committee (see CM(60)4; C(59)127 and CM(59)130) was transferred to the Council of Europe separately from the rest of WEU cultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/documents-records-archives-information/timeline-1948#{"19133186":[0]}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984 – 1998: Reactivation, strengthening===
From the late 1970s onwards, efforts were made to add a security dimension to the [[European Communities]]' [[European Political Cooperation]] (EPC). Opposition to these efforts from Denmark, Greece and Ireland led the remaining EC countries - all WEU members - to reactivate the WEU in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/06/0616/jargon.shtml|title=BBC Politics 97|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this point there had been minimal use of the provisions of the Modified Brussels Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/pa/research/wessel/wessel26.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Petersberg-077.JPG|thumb|[[Hotel Petersberg]], where the Petersberg tasks were defined in 1992.]]
In 1992, the WEU adopted the [[Petersberg Declaration]], defining the so-called ''Petersberg tasks'' designed to cope with the possible destabilising of Eastern Europe. The WEU itself had no standing army but depended on cooperation between its members. Its tasks ranged from the most modest to the most robust, and included [[Humanitarian]], rescue and [[peacekeeping]] tasks as well as tasks for combat forces in [[crisis management]], including [[peacemaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/petersberg_tasks_en.htm|title=EUROPA – Glossary – Petersberg tasks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1996 NATO ministerial meeting in Berlin, it was agreed that the Western European Union would oversee the creation of a European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI) within NATO structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/comm/1996/9606-brl/9606-brl.htm|title=NATO Ministerial Meetings Berlin – 3–4 June 1996&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESDI was intended as a European 'pillar' within NATO, partly to allow European countries to act militarily where [[NATO]] wished not to, and partly to alleviate the United States' financial burden of maintaining [[military base]]s in Europe, which it had done since the [[Cold War]]. The Berlin agreement allowed European countries (through the WEU) to use NATO assets if it so wished.

===1998 – 2009: Transfer of tasks to the EU===
{{Further|Common Security and Defence Policy}}
In 1998 the United Kingdom, which had traditionally opposed the introduction of European autonomous defence capacities, signed the [[Saint-Malo declaration]]. This marked a turning point as the declaration endorsed the creation of a European security and defense policy, including a European military force capable of autonomous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Franco–British St. Malo Declaration (4 December 1998)|url = http://www.cvce.eu/obj/franco_british_st_malo_declaration_4_december_1998-en-f3cd16fb-fc37-4d52-936f-c8e9bc80f24f.html|accessdate = 2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was a response to the [[Kosovo War]] in the late 1990s, in which the EU was perceived to have failed to intervene to stop the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Saint-Malo Declaration and its impact on ESDP after 10 years - Defence Viewpoints from UK Defence Forum|url = http://www.defenceviewpoints.co.uk/articles-and-analysis/the-saint-malo-declaration-and-its-impact-on-esdp-after-10-years|website = www.defenceviewpoints.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-08-18|last = Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns were voiced that an independent European security pillar could undermine NATO; In response to St. Malo, the former US-Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] put forth the three famous D's: no duplication of what was done effectively under NATO, no decoupling from the US and NATO, and no discrimination against non-EU members such as Turkey.

[[File:Javier Solana 1999.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]] [[Javier Solana]] (September 1999)]]
The [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], which entered into force in 1999, transferred the WEU's Petersberg tasks to the EU, and stated that the EU's European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), replacing the WEU's ESDI, would be 'progressively framed' on the basis of these tasks.

In June 1999, the [[List of European Councils#Cologne 1999|Cologne European Council]] decided to incorporate the role of the WEU within the EU, effectively abandoning the WEU. The Cologne Council also appointed [[Javier Solana]] as the [[High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy]] to help progress both the [[CFSP]] and the ESDP. On 20 November 1999 Solana was also appointed Secretary-General of the WEU. His being head of both organisations permits him to oversee the ongoing transfer of functions from the WEU to the EU.

In 2002 the Berlin agreement from 1996 was amended with the so-called [[Berlin Plus agreement]], which allowed the EU to also draw on some of NATO's assets in its own peacekeeping operations.

Originally, under the [[Amsterdam Treaty]], the WEU was given an integral role in giving the EU an independent defence capability, playing a major role in the [[Petersberg tasks]]; however that situation is changing. On 13 November 2000, WEU Ministers met in [[Marseille]] and agreed to begin transferring the organisation's capabilities and functions to the European Union, under its developing [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) and [[Common Security and Defence Policy]] (CSDP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weu.int/documents/001113en.pdf Marseille Declaration 2000] weu.int&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, on 1 January 2002, the WEU's Security Studies Institute and the Satellite Centre were transferred to the EU and became the [[European Union Institute for Security Studies]] and the [[European Union Satellite Centre]]. Notably, the role given to the WEU in the Amsterdam Treaty, was removed by the [[Nice Treaty]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] has provisions for cooperation between the EU and both NATO (including the [[Berlin Plus agreement]]) and the WEU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st06/st06655.en08.pdf|title=CONSOLIDATED VERSIONS OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION AND THE TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Protocol 10 and 11|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/western_european_union_en.htm Western European Union (WEU)] europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt; However the defence commitment, of Article 4 of the Brussels Treaty, has not been subsumed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/esdp/index.htm EU Security Policy &amp; the Role of the European Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701193610/http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/esdp/index.htm |date=1 July 2007 }} ec.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt; Article 42(7) of the Treaty of the European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon, could be viewed as incorporating that defence commitment into the EU framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldselect/ldeucom/62/6212.htm#a234|title=House of Lords - European Union - Tenth Report|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Lords|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union Institute for Security Studies]] (EUISS) and [[European Union Satellite Centre]] (EUSC), both established to function under the EU's CFSP [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar]], were both replacements to the ''Western European Union Institute for Security Studies'' and the ''Western Union Satellite Centre'' which had been established to function in connection to the WEU.

With the transfer of responsibilities, the WEU's Parliamentary assembly was urged to dissolve itself, as it had a mandate to supervise WEU politics, not the EU's CSDP politics. But the Assembly saw itself as playing an important role, particularly with greater right of scrutiny, membership, experience and expertise in defence policy. Therefore, it renamed itself the "Interim European Security and Defence Assembly" and urged the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Convention]] to include it as a second chamber within the EU's institutional framework. Hence it argued it could effectively scrutinise the CSDP, help improve EU-NATO relations and be more suited, being composed of national parliamentarians, to the intergovernmental style of the CSDP.

However, with the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] aiming to streamline and simplify the EU's foreign policy, for example combining the two main foreign policy posts, it was not seen as wise to then create a separate double legislature for the CFSP, instead, the [[European Parliament]] was granted greater scrutiny over foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iss.europa.eu/occasion/occ57.pdf Occasional Paper n.57: The democratic legitimacy of the European Security and Defence Policy] European Union Institute for Security Studies, April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 – 2011: Dissolution===
{{Further|Treaty of Lisbon}}
In 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] took over the WEU's mutual defence clause.&lt;ref name="terminate"/&gt; There was much discussion about what to do with the WEU following the introduction of Lisbon, including plans to scrap it.&lt;ref name=Rettman /&gt; On 30 March 2010 in a Written Ministerial Statement UK's [[Foreign Office]] Minister [[Chris Bryant]] gave notice that the UK intended to withdraw from the Western European Union within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=PressS&amp;id=21976547 |title=Announcements - GOV.UK |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2010 the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Foreign Affairs Ministry]] announced Germany's intention to withdraw from the Modified Brussels Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/de/Europa/Aussenpolitik/ESVP/100331WEUKuendigung,navCtx=21914.html |title=diplo - Startseite - HTTP Status 404 |language=de |publisher=Auswaertiges-amt.de |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Spanish Presidency of the WEU, on behalf of the 10 Member States of the Modified Brussels Treaty, announced the collective decision to withdraw from the Treaty and to close the WEU organisation by June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maec.es/es/MenuPpal/Actualidad/NoticiasMAEC/Paginas/20100331_not1.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219035147/http://www.maec.es/es/MenuPpal/Actualidad/NoticiasMAEC/Paginas/20100331_not1.aspx |date=19 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2011 the WEU officially  ceased to exist.

==Organisation==
The WEU was headquartered in [[Brussels]], with a staff of 65 and an annual budget of €13.4 million.&lt;ref name=Rettman&gt;Rettman, Andrew (3 September 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28615 European defence league poised for debate on dormant pact], EU Observer accessed 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was composed of the Council of the WEU (the Council) and the Assembly of the WEU (the Assembly).

===Council of Ministers===
The WEU was led by a Council of Ministers, assisted by a Permanent Representatives Council on the ambassadorial level.

===Parliamentary Assembly===
{{Main|Assembly of the Western European Union}}
[[File:Flag of the Assembly of the Western European Union.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Assembly of the Western European Union|WEU Assembly]]]]
A [[Assembly of WEU|Parliamentary Assembly]] (composed of the delegations of the member states to the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]]) supervised the work of the Council, but it did not have any obligations on the Council. The Assembly of WEU was a consultative institution.

===Western European Armaments Group===
The Independent European Program Group (IEPG) was established as a forum for armaments cooperation in 1976 with the aim of creating a European Armaments Agency. Since 1993 the WEU armaments cooperation forum has been known as Western European Armaments Group (WEAG). Its membership reached 19 in 2000: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The body closed on 23 May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weu.int/weag/|title=Western European Armaments Group|website=www.weu.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western European Armaments Organisation===
The Western European Armaments Organisation (WEAO) was intended as an Armaments Agency but operations were limited to a research cell. It provided support services in defence research and technology. It was created in 1996, and closed in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weao.weu.int/site/index.php WEAO Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524133139/http://www.weao.weu.int/site/index.php |date=24 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These agencies were taken over by the [[European Defence Agency]]. Other transferred bodies include the [[European Union Institute for Security Studies|Institute for Security Studies]] and the [[European Union Satellite Centre|Satellite Centre]].

===Institute for Security Studies===
The Western European Union Institute for Security Studies (presently the [[European Union Institute for Security Studies]]).

===Satellite Centre===
The Western European Union Satellite Centre (presently the [[European Union Satellite Centre]]).

===European Operational Rapid Force===
On 15 May 1995, the Council of Ministers of the WEU met in Lisbon. During this meeting a declaration of the creation of the European Operational Rapid Force ([[Eurofor]]) was made by France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Eurofor became operational in June 1998 as a task force of the Western European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurofor.it Eurofor] eurofor.it&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation==

'''Wezombeli''', the national [[Scouting]] organization of the [[Comoros]], was founded in 1975, and became a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] in 1990. The coeducational Wezombeli has 1,725 members as of 2004.

The development of Scouting has been hampered by civil unrest and lack of political stability in the country.

The Scout association has four sections: 
* Louveteaux ([[Cub Scouts]])
* Scouts
* Scouts Aînés (Senior Scouts)
* Routiers ([[Rover Scouts]]).
The Routiers branch is open to boys and girls. 

The [[Scout Motto]] is ''Uwe Tayari'', ''Be Prepared'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and ''Sois Prêt'', ''Be Prepared'' in French.
