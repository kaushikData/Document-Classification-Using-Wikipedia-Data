== Timeline ==

===October 2015 - Saada airstrike===
Doctors Without Borders reported that a Saudi Arabian-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|coalition]] airstrike on 26 October 2015&lt;ref name="urlExposed: British-made bombs used on civilian targets in Yemen | Amnesty International UK"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/exposed-british-made-bombs-used-civilian-targets-yemen |title=Exposed: British-made bombs used on civilian targets in Yemen &amp;#124; Amnesty International UK |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; had completely destroyed the [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] hospital in [[Saada]], in northwestern [[Yemen]], including the operating room.  The first strike hit an unused part of the hospital, so the facility was completely evacuated at once.  There were no direct casualties. The spokesman for the [[coalition forces]], Brig-Gen [[Ahmad Asiri (general)|Ahmed al-Asiri]], disclaimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34645469|title=Yemen conflict: MSF hospital destroyed by air strikes|date=27 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"With the hospital destroyed, at least 200,000 people now have no access to lifesaving medical care", MSF said.  "This attack is another illustration of a complete disregard for civilians in Yemen, where bombings have become a daily routine," said Hassan Boucenine, MSF head of mission in Yemen.  The GPS coordinates of the only hospital in the Haydan district were regularly shared with the Saudi-led coalition, and the roof of the facility was clearly identified with the MSF logo, he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/28/c_134756413.htm "MSF hospital in Yemen bombed by airstrike", ''Xinhua'' (2015-10-28)]&lt;/ref&gt; Abdallah al-Mouallimi, the Saudi ambassador to the United Nations, said the coordinates were inaccurate, although he admitted that the airstrike was "a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-saudi-arabia-admits-bombing-msf-hospital-in-yemen-but-faults-msf|title=Exclusive: Saudi Arabia Admits Bombing MSF Hospital in Yemen — But Faults MSF - VICE News|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNICEF said the hospital in Saada was the 39th health center hit in Yemen since March, when the violence escalated. MSF reports that the Saudi-led coalition, supported by the British military, has been bombing hospitals across Yemen for the past 10 months. As many as 130 health facilities have been hit. "More children in Yemen may well die from a lack of medicines and healthcare than from bullets and bombs," its executive director Anthony Lake said in a statement.  He added that critical shortages of fuel, medication, electricity and water could mean many more will close. [[Amnesty International]] said the strike may amount to a war crime and called for an independent investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/27/us-yemen-security-idUSKCN0SL0VK20151027 Noah Browning, "Yemeni MSF hospital bombed, Saudi-led coalition denies responsibility", ''Reuters'' (October 27 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/10/28/doctors-without-borders-says-saudi-led-airstrikes-bomb-yemen-hospital/ "Doctors Without Borders says Saudi-led airstrikes bomb Yemen hospital", ''Associated Press'' (October 28, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 2015 - Taiz airstrike===
On December 3, 2015 an airstrike by the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] hit a health center in [[Taiz]], wounding nine people. Two hospital staff were among the wounded.  "The bombing of civilians and hospitals is a violation of international humanitarian law," said Jerome Alin, head of MSF head of mission in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/yemen-nine-wounded-saudi-led-coalition-airstrike-msf-clinic-taiz|title=Yemen: Nine Wounded in Saudi-Led Coalition Airstrike on MSF Clinic in Taiz|date=3 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-supported-hospital-bombed-northern-yemen  "MSF-Supported Hospital Bombed in Northern Yemen", MSF (Update January 11 2016)].&lt;/ref&gt;
===January 2016 - Razeh district airstrike===
On January 10, 2016, Shiara Hospital, supported by MSF in Razeh district, [[Saada Governorate]], Northern Yemen, was hit by a projectile and shrapnel from the Saudi-led coalition.  Six people died and another 7 were injured, including three MSF staff, two of them in critical condition. Several buildings at the medical facility collapsed after the attack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/world/middleeast/hospital-aided-by-doctors-without-borders-is-bombed-in-yemen.html|title=Hospital Aided by Doctors Without Borders Is Bombed in Yemen|date=11 January 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tran, "Four patients among dead after explosion at hospital in Yemen", The Guardian (January 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Withnall, "Attacks on hospitals mean people in Yemen are now too scared to go for treatment, MSF says", The Independent (January 19, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; although the critical areas of the hospital were not destroyed.  The rocket hit a corridor leading from the main gate to the hospital buildings, with a metal fence alongside. The wounded were hit by shrapnel from the missile, and also by shards of metal from the fence. The injuries were brutal. Vickie Hawkins, Executive Director of MSF-UK, said, "... there is a risk that "errors" in war situations will become normalised—just as "collateral damage" has been normalised in people’s minds since the first Gulf War. This would provide the perfect alibi for armies to shrug off accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It perpetuates impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/yemen-even-war-hospitals-should-be-places-refuge-and-healing|title=Yemen: Even in War, Hospitals Should Be "Places of Refuge And Healing"|date=19 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate attack by the Saudi-led coalition, an airstrike was reported to have hit a center for the blind in the capital Sana'a, resulting in multiple injuries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/01/05/saudi-coalition-just-bombed-a-center-for-the-blind-in-yemen/|title=Saudi Coalition Just Bombed a Center for the Blind in Yemen|last=Devereaux|first=Ryan|date=2016-01-05|website=The Intercept|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39651265|title=Saudi blacklist call over Yemen attacks|date=2017-04-20|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===August 2016 - Abs district hospital airstrike===
On August 15, 2016, after the collapse of a UN-sponsored cease-fire, an airstrike by the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] destroyed a hospital operated by Yemen's Ministry of Health and supported by MSF and UNICEF in [[Abs District]], [[Hajjah Governorate]] in northwestern Yemen.  The bombardment struck the hospital's triage area near the emergency room and killed at least 19 and wounded 24 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/airstrike-hits-doctors-without-borders-hospital-in-yemen/ Noah Browning and Tom Brown, "Airstrike Hits Doctors Without Borders Hospital in Yemen", '''Scientific American'''.

===June 2018 - Airstrike on cholera treatment center in Abs===
Doctors Without Borders reported that a Saudi Arabian [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|coalition]] airstrike struck a new [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] cholera treatment center in [[Abs_(Yemen)|Abs]], in northwestern [[Yemen]]. Doctors Without Borders reported that they had provided GPS coordinates to The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on twelve separate occasions, and had received nine written responses confirming receipt of those coordinates &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/yemen-airstrike-hits-msf-cholera-treatment-center-abs|title=Yemen: Airstrike hits cholera treatment center in Abs|date=12 June 2018|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[category theory]], the '''anamorphism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀνά|ἀνά]]}} "upwards" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]]}} "form, shape") of a [[coinduction|coinductive type]] denotes the assignment of a [[coalgebra]] to its unique [[morphism]] to the [[Initial algebra|final coalgebra]] of an [[endofunctor]]. These objects are used in [[functional programming]] as ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|unfolds]]''. The [[categorical dual]] of the anamorphism is the [[catamorphism]].

== Anamorphisms in functional programming ==

In [[functional programming]], an '''anamorphism''' is a generalization of the concept of ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|unfolds]]'' on coinductive [[List (computing)|lists]]. Formally, anamorphisms are [[generic function]]s that can [[Corecursion|corecursively]] construct a result of a certain [[Algebraic data type|type]] and which is parameterized by functions that determine the next single step of the construction.

The data type in question is defined as the greatest fixed point ''ν X . F X'' of a functor ''F''. By the universal property of final coalgebras, there is a unique coalgebra morphism ''A → ν X . F X'' for any other ''F''-coalgebra ''a : A → F A''. Thus, one can define functions from a type ''A'' _into_ a coinductive datatype by specifying a coalgebra structure ''a'' on ''A''.

=== Example: Potentially infinite lists ===

As an example, the type of potentially infinite [[List (computing)|lists]] (with elements of a fixed type ''value'') is given as the fixpoint ''[value] = ν X . value × X + 1'', i.e. a list consists either of a ''value'' and a further list, or it is empty. A (pseudo-)[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]-Definition might look like this:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data [value] = (value:[value]) | []
&lt;/source&gt;

It is the fixed point of the functor &lt;code&gt;F value&lt;/code&gt;, where:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
data F value x = Maybe (value, x)
&lt;/source&gt;

One can easily check that indeed the type &lt;code&gt;[value]&lt;/code&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;code&gt; F value [value]&lt;/code&gt;, and thus &lt;code&gt;[value]&lt;/code&gt; is the fixed point.
(Also note that in Haskell, least and greatest fixpoints of functors coincide, therefore inductive lists are the same as coinductive, potentially infinite lists.)

The ''anamorphism'' for lists (then usually known as ''unfold'') would build a (potentially infinite) list from a state value. Typically, the unfold takes a state value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and a function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; that yields either a pair of a value and a new state, or a singleton to mark the end of the list. The anamorphism would then begin with a first seed, compute whether the list continues or ends, and in case of a nonempty list, prepend the computed value to the recursive call to the anamorphism.

A Haskell definition of an unfold, or anamorphism for lists, called &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt;, is as follows:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
ana :: (state -&gt; Maybe (value, state)) -&gt; state -&gt; [value]
ana f stateOld = case f stateOld of
            Nothing                -&gt; []
            Just (value, stateNew) -&gt; value : ana f stateNew
&lt;/source&gt;

We can now implement quite general functions using ''ana'', for example a countdown:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
f :: Int -&gt; Maybe (Int, Int)
f current = let oneSmaller = current - 1
            in   if oneSmaller &lt; 0
                   then Nothing
                   else Just (oneSmaller, oneSmaller)
&lt;/source&gt;
This function will decrement an integer and output it at the same time, until it is negative, at which point it will mark the end of the list. Correspondingly, &lt;code&gt;ana f 3&lt;/code&gt; will compute the list &lt;code&gt;[2,1,0]&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Anamorphisms on other data structures ===

An anamorphism can be defined for any recursive type, according to a generic pattern, generalizing the second version of ''ana'' for lists.

For example, the unfold for the tree data structure

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) a (Tree a)
&lt;/source&gt;

is as follows
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 ana :: (b -&gt; Either a (b, a, b)) -&gt; b -&gt; Tree a
 ana unspool x = case unspool x of
                   Left a          -&gt; Leaf a
                   Right (l, x, r) -&gt; Branch (ana unspool l) x (ana unspool r)
&lt;/source&gt;

To better see the relationship between the recursive type and its anamorphism, note that &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; can be defined thus:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 newtype List a = List {unCons :: Maybe (a, List a)}

 newtype Tree a = Tree {unNode :: Either a (Tree a, a, Tree a))}
&lt;/source&gt;

The analogy with &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt; appears by renaming &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; in its type:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 newtype List a = List {unCons :: Maybe (a, List a)}
 anaList ::       (list_a       -&gt; Maybe (a, list_a)) -&gt; (list_a -&gt; List a)

 newtype Tree a = Tree {unNode :: Either a (Tree a, a, Tree a))}
 anaTree ::       (tree_a       -&gt; Either a (tree_a, a, tree_a)) -&gt; (tree_a -&gt; Tree a)
&lt;/source&gt;

With these definitions, the argument to the constructor of the type has the same type as the return type of the first argument of &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt;, with the recursive mentions of the type replaced with &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.

== History ==

One of the first publications to introduce the notion of an anamorphism in the context of programming was the paper ''Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|citeseerx = 10.1.1.41.125
|title=Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire
|first=Erik
|last=Meijer
|authorlink=Erik Meijer (computer scientist)
|author2=Fokkinga, Maarten|author3=Paterson, Ross
|year=1991
}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Erik Meijer (computer scientist)|Erik Meijer]] ''et al.'', which was in the context of the [[Squiggol]] programming language.

==Applications==
Functions like [[Zip (higher-order function)|&lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt;]] and &lt;code&gt;iterate&lt;/code&gt; are examples of anamorphisms.  &lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt; takes a pair of lists, say ['a','b','c'] and [1,2,3] and returns a list of pairs [('a',1),('b',2),('c',3)]. &lt;code&gt;Iterate&lt;/code&gt; takes a thing, x, and a function, f, from such things to such things, and returns the infinite list that comes from repeated application of f, i.e. the list [x, (f x), (f (f x)), (f (f (f x))), ...].

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 zip (a:as) (b:bs) = if (as==[]) || (bs ==[])   -- || means 'or'
                      then [(a,b)]
                      else (a,b):(zip as bs) 
 
 iterate f x = x:(iterate f (f x))&lt;/source&gt;

To prove this, we can implement both using our generic unfold, &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt;, using a simple recursive routine:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 zip2 = ana unsp fin
    where
    fin (as,bs) = (as==[]) || (bs ==[]) 
    unsp ((a:as), (b:bs)) = ((a,b),(as,bs))

 iterate2 f = ana (\a-&gt;(a,f a)) (\x-&gt;False) &lt;/source&gt;
In a language like Haskell, even the abstract functions &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unfold&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ana&lt;/code&gt; are merely defined terms, as we have seen from the definitions given above.

== Anamorphisms in category theory ==

In [[category theory]], anamorphisms are the [[categorical dual]] of [[catamorphism]]s (and catamorphisms are the categorical dual of anamorphisms).

That means the following. 
Suppose (''A'', ''fin'') is a [[Initial algebra|final]] [[F-coalgebra|''F''-coalgebra]] for some [[endofunctor]] ''F'' of some [[category (mathematics)|category]] into itself.
Thus, ''fin'' is a [[morphism]] from ''A'' to ''FA'', and since it is assumed to be final we know that whenever (''X'', ''f'') is another ''F''-coalgebra (a morphism ''f'' from ''X'' to ''FX''), there will be a unique [[homomorphism]] ''h'' from (''X'', ''f'') to (''A'', ''fin''), that is a morphism ''h'' from ''X'' to ''A'' such that ''fin '''.''' h = Fh '''.''' f''.
Then for each such ''f'' we denote by '''ana''' '''''f''''' that uniquely specified morphism ''h''.

In other words, we have the following defining relationship, given some fixed ''F'', ''A'', and ''fin'' as above:

*&lt;math&gt;h = \mathrm{ana}\ f&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{fin}\circ h = Fh \circ f&lt;/math&gt;

=== Notation ===

A notation for ana ''f'' found in the literature is &lt;math&gt;[\!(f)\!]&lt;/math&gt;. The brackets used are known as '''lens brackets''', after which anamorphisms are sometimes referred to as ''lenses''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31922">{{The Works of Aristotle}}[[Aristotle]] first used the term [[ethics]] to name a field of study developed by his predecessors [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]. Philosophical ethics is the attempt to offer a rational response to the question of how humans should best live. Aristotle regarded ethics and [[politics]] as two related but separate fields of study, since ethics examines the good of the individual, while politics examines the good of the city-state.

Aristotle's writings have been read more or less continuously since ancient times,&lt;ref&gt;"Roman Aristotle," in ''Philosophia Togata II: Plato and Aristotle at Rome'', Oxford University Press (Oxford: 1997), pp. 1–69.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his ethical treatises in particular continue to influence philosophers working today. Aristotle emphasized the importance of developing excellence ([[virtue]]) of character (Greek ''ēthikē [[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]''), as the way to achieve what is finally more important, excellent conduct (Greek ''[[energeia]]''). As Aristotle argues in Book II of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', the man who possesses character excellence does the right thing, at the right time, and in the right way. Bravery, and the correct regulation of one's bodily appetites, are examples of character excellence or virtue. So acting bravely and acting temperately are examples of excellent activities. The highest aims are living well and ''[[eudaimonia]]'' a Greek word often translated as well-being, [[happiness]] or "human flourishing".&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', trans. T.H. Irwin, Introduction. Hackett Publishing Company (Indianapolis: 1999) ''xv''.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many ethicists, Aristotle regards excellent activity as pleasurable for the man of virtue. For example, Aristotle thinks that the man whose appetites are in the correct order actually takes pleasure in acting moderately.

Aristotle emphasized that virtue is practical, and that the purpose of ethics is to become good, not merely to know. Aristotle also claims that the right course of action depends upon the details of a particular situation, rather than being generated merely by applying a law. The type of wisdom which is required for this is called "prudence" or "practical wisdom" (Greek ''[[phronesis]]''), as opposed to the wisdom of a theoretical philosopher (Greek ''[[wikt:σοφία#Ancient Greek|sophia]]''). But despite the importance of practical decision making, in the final analysis the original Aristotelian and Socratic answer to the question of how best to live, at least for the best types of human, was to live the life of [[philosophy]].'

== Three ethical treatises ==

Three Aristotelian ethical works survive today which are considered to be either by Aristotle, or from relatively soon after:
* ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', abbreviated as the ''NE'' or sometimes (from the Latin version of the name) as the ''EN''. The ''NE'' is in 10 books, and is the most widely read of Aristotle's ethical treatises.
* ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', often abbreviated as the ''EE''.
* ''[[Magna Moralia]]'', often abbreviated as the ''MM''.

The exact origins of these texts is unclear, although they were already considered the works of Aristotle in ancient times. Textual oddities suggest that they may not have been put in their current form by Aristotle himself. For example, Books IV–VI of ''Eudemian Ethics'' also appear as Books V–VII of ''Nicomachean Ethics''. The authenticity of the ''Magna Moralia'' has been doubted,&lt;ref&gt;But for an argument that the Magna Moralia's philosophical content (if not the language) is authentically Aristotle's, see: John M. Cooper, "The Magna Moralia and Aristotle's Moral Philosophy," in ''The American Journal of Philology'' 94.4 (Winter, 1973): pp. 327–49.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas almost no modern scholar doubts that Aristotle wrote the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and the ''Eudemian Ethics'' himself, even if an editor also played some part in giving us those texts in their current forms.

The ''Nicomachean Ethics'' has received the most scholarly attention, and is the most easily available to modern readers in many different translations and editions. Some critics consider the ''Eudemian Ethics'' to be "less mature," while others, such as Kenny (1978),&lt;ref&gt;''The Aristotelian Ethics: A Study of the Relationship between the Eudemian and Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle,'' (Oxford 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; contend that the ''Eudemian Ethics'' is the more mature, and therefore later, work.

Traditionally it was believed that the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and the ''Eudemian Ethics'' were either edited by or dedicated to Aristotle's son and pupil [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] and his disciple Eudemus, respectively, although the works themselves do not explain the source of their names.  Although Aristotle's father was also called Nicomachus, Aristotle's son was the next leader of Aristotle's school, the [[Lyceum]], and in ancient times he was already associated with this work.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero mentioned him in ''De Finibus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth treatise, Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], is often regarded as the sequel to the Ethics, in part because Aristotle closes the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' by saying that his ethical inquiry has laid the groundwork for an inquiry into political questions (''NE'' X.1181b6-23). Aristotle's Ethics also states that the good of the individual is subordinate to the good of the city-state, or ''polis''.

Fragments also survive from Aristotle's [[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|''Protrepticus'']], another work which dealt with ethics.

== Aristotle as a Socratic ==

Some scholars regarded Aristotle as a Socratic thinker.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Aristotle's ethics builds upon earlier Greek thought, particularly that of his teacher [[Plato]] and Plato's teacher, [[Socrates]]. While Socrates left no written works, and Plato wrote dialogues and a few letters, Aristotle wrote treatises in which he sets forth philosophical doctrines directly. To be more precise, Aristotle did write dialogues, but they unfortunately survive only in fragments.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

According to Aristotle in his ''Metaphysics'', Socrates was the first Greek philosopher to concentrate on ethics, although he apparently did not give it this name, as a philosophical inquiry concerning how people should best live. Aristotle dealt with this same question but giving it two names, "the political" (or Politics) and "the ethical" (Ethics), both with Politics being the name for the two together as the more important part. The original Socratic questioning on ethics started at least partly as a response to [[sophism]], which was a popular style of education and speech at the time. Sophism emphasized [[rhetoric]], and argument, and therefore often involved criticism of [[ancient Greek religion|traditional Greek religion]] and flirtation with [[moral relativism]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Aristotle's ethics, or study of character, is built around the premise that people should achieve an excellent character (a virtuous character, "''ethikē aretē''" in Greek) as a pre-condition for attaining happiness or well-being (''eudaimonia''). It is sometimes referred to in comparison to later ethical theories as a "character based ethics". Like Plato and Socrates he emphasized the importance of [[reason]] for human happiness, and that there were logical and natural reasons for humans to behave virtuously, and try to become virtuous.

Aristotle's treatment of the subject is distinct in several ways from that found in Plato's Socratic dialogues.

*Aristotle's presentation is obviously different from Plato's because he does not write in [[dialogue]]s, but in [[treatise]]s. Apart from this difference, Aristotle explicitly stated that his presentation was different from Plato's because he started from whatever could be agreed upon by well brought-up gentlemen, and not from any attempt to develop a general theory of what makes anything good. He explained that it was necessary not to aim at too much accuracy at the starting point of any discussion to do with controversial matters such as those concerning what is just or what is beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;NE Book I, EE Book I&lt;/ref&gt; (From this starting point however, he built up to similar theoretical conclusions concerning the importance of intellectual virtue and a contemplative life.)&lt;ref&gt;NE end of Book VI and end of Book X. Also see Burger (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rather than discussing only four "[[cardinal virtues]]" of Plato ([[courage]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[justice]], and [[prudence]]), all three of the ethical works start with courage and temperance as the two typical moral virtues which can be described as a mean, go on to discuss a whole range of minor virtues and vices which can be described as a mean, and only after that touch upon justice and the intellectual virtues. Aristotle places prudence (''phronēsis'', often translated as practical wisdom) amongst these intellectual virtues. (Nevertheless, like Plato he eventually says that all the highest forms of the moral virtues require each other, and all require intellectual virtue, and in effect that the happiest and most virtuous life is that of a philosopher.)&lt;ref&gt;Burger (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aristotle emphasizes throughout all his analyses of virtues that they aim at what is beautiful (''kalos''), effectively equating [[The Good|the good]], at least for humans, with the beautiful (''to kalon'').&lt;ref&gt;Burger (2008); Sachs (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aristotle's analysis of ethics makes use of his metaphysical theory of [[potentiality and actuality]]. He defines happiness in terms of this theory as an actuality (''energeia''); the virtues which allow happiness (and enjoyment of the best and most constant pleasures) are dynamic-but-stable dispositions (''hexeis'') which are developed through habituation; and this pleasure in turn is another actuality that compliments the actuality of happy living.&lt;ref&gt;NE Book X&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical ethics ==

[[Aristotle]] believed that ethical knowledge is not only a [[theory|theoretical]] knowledge, but rather that a person must have "experience of the actions in life" and have been "brought up in fine habits" to become good ([[Nicomachean Ethics|NE]] 1095a3 and b5). For a person to become virtuous, he can't simply study what virtue ''is'', but must actually do virtuous things.

{{cquote|We are not studying in order to know what virtue is, but to become good, for otherwise there would be no profit in it. ''(NE'' II.2)}}

== Aristotle's starting point ==

The Aristotelian Ethics all aim to begin with approximate but uncontroversial starting points. In the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' Aristotle says explicitly that one must begin with what is familiar to us, and "the that" or "the fact that" (''NE'' I.1095b2-13). Ancient commentators agree that what Aristotle means here is that his treatise must rely upon practical, everyday knowledge of virtuous actions as the starting points of his inquiry, and that he is supposing that his readers have some kind of experience-based understanding of such actions, and that they value noble and just actions to at least some degree.&lt;ref&gt;See M.F. Burnyeat, "Aristotle on Learning to be Good," in ''Essays on Aristotle's Ethics'', ed. Rorty (1980) pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, Aristotle also seems to rely upon common conceptions of how the world works. In fact, some regard his ethical inquiries as using a method that relies upon popular opinion (his so-called "endoxic method" from the Grk. ''endoxa''). There is some dispute, however, about exactly how such common conceptions fit into Aristotle's method in his ethical treatises,&lt;ref&gt;Martha Nussbaum, for example, has argued that Aristotle's so-called endoxic method, described at ''NE'' VII.1145b1 ff. is in fact Aristotle's general philosophical method. See Nussbaum, ''Fragility of Goodness'' (Cambridge: 1986/2001) pp. 240 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly since he also makes use of more formal arguments, especially the so-called "function argument," which is described below.

Aristotle describes popular accounts about what kind of life would be a happy one by classifying them into three most common types: a life dedicated to vulgar pleasure; a life dedicated to fame and honor; and a life dedicated to contemplation (''NE'' I.1095b17-19). To reach his own conclusion about the best life, however, Aristotle tries to isolate the function of humans. The argument he develops here is accordingly widely known as "the function argument," and is among the most-discussed arguments made by any ancient philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Rachel Barney, "Aristotle's Argument for a Human Function," in ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' 34 (Summer 2008) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that while humans undergo nutrition and growth, so do other living things, and while humans are capable of perception, this is shared with animals (''NE'' I.1098b22-1098a15). Thus neither of these characteristics is particular to humans. According to Aristotle, what remains and what is distinctively human is reason. Thus he concludes that the human function is some kind of excellent exercise of the intellect. And, since Aristotle thinks that practical wisdom rules over the character excellences, exercising such excellences is one way to exercise reason and thus fulfill the human function.

One common objection to Aristotle's function argument is that it uses descriptive or factual premises to derive conclusions about what is good.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Jennifer Whiting in an article that defends the argument. See Whiting, "Aristotle's Function Argument: A Defense" ''Ancient Philosophy'' 8, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments are often thought to run afoul of the [[is-ought problem|is-ought gap]].

== Moral virtue ==

Moral virtue, or excellence of character, is the disposition (Grk ''hexis'') to act excellently, which a person develops partly as a result of his upbringing, and partly as a result of his habit of action. Aristotle develops his analysis of character in Book II of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', where he makes this argument that character arises from habit—likening ethical character to a skill that is acquired through practice, such as learning a musical instrument. In Book III of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle argues that a person's character is voluntary, since it results from many individual actions which are under his voluntary control.

Aristotle distinguishes the disposition to feel emotions of a certain kind from virtue and vice. But such emotional dispositions may also lie at a mean between two extremes, and these are also to some extent a result of up-bringing and habituation. Two examples of such dispositions would be modesty, or a tendency to feel shame, which Aristotle discusses in NE IV.9; and righteous indignation (''nemesis''), which is a balanced feeling of sympathetic pain concerning the undeserved pleasures and pains of others.&lt;ref&gt;EE III.vii. Also see MM.&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly which habitual dispositions are virtues or vices and which only concern emotions, differs between the different works which have survived, but the basic examples are consistent, as is the basis for distinguishing them in principle.

Some people, despite intending to do the right thing, cannot act according to their own choice. For example, someone may choose to refrain from eating chocolate cake, but finds himself eating the cake contrary to his own choice. Such a failure to act in a way that is consistent with one's own decision is called "''akrasia''", and may be translated as weakness of will, incontinence, or lack of self-mastery.

== Four Cardinal Virtues ==
# '''Prudence''', also known as practical wisdom, is the most important virtue for Aristotle. In war, soldiers must fight with prudence by making judgments through practical wisdom. This virtue is a must to obtain because courage requires judgments to be made.
# '''Temperance''', or self-control, simply means moderation. Soldiers must display moderation with their enjoyment while at war in the midst of violent activities. Temperance concerning courage gives one moderation in private which leads to moderation in public.
# '''Courage''' is “moderation or observance of the mean with respect to feelings of fear and confidence.”  Courage is “observance of the mean with regard to things that excite confidence or fear, under the circumstances which we have specified, and chooses its course and sticks to its post because it is noble to do so, or because it is disgraceful not to do so.”   Concerning warfare, Aristotle believes soldiers are morally significant and are military and political heroes. War is simply a stage for soldiers to display courage, and is the only way courage can be exemplified. Any other action by a human is simply the copying a soldier's ways; they are not actually courageous.
# '''Justice''' means giving the enemy what is due to them in the proper ways; being just toward them. In other words, one must recognize what is good for the community and one must undertake a good course of action.
Vices of courage must also be identified which are cowardice and recklessness. Soldiers who are not prudent act with cowardice, and soldiers who do not have temperance act with recklessness. One should not be unjust toward their enemy no matter the circumstance. On another note, one becomes virtuous by first imitating another who exemplifies such virtuous characteristics, practicing such ways in their daily lives, turning those ways into customs and habits by performing them each and every day, and finally, connecting or uniting the four of them together.

Only soldiers can exemplify such virtues because war demands soldiers to exercise disciplined and firm virtues, but war does everything in its power to shatter the virtues it demands. Since virtues are very fragile, they must be practiced always, for if they are not practiced they will weaken and eventually disappear. One who is virtuous has to avoid the enemies of virtue which are indifference or persuasion that something should not be done, self-indulgence or persuasion that something can wait and does not need to be done at that moment, and despair or persuasion that something simply cannot be accomplished anyway. In order for one to be virtuous they must display prudence, temperance, courage, and justice; moreover, they have to display all four of them and not just one or two to be virtuous.

== Justice ==

Aristotle devotes Book V of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' to justice (this is also Book IV of the ''Eudemian Ethics''). In this discussion, Aristotle defines justice as having two different but related senses—general justice and particular justice. General justice is virtue expressed in relation to other people. Thus the just man in this sense deals properly and fairly with others, and expresses his virtue in his dealings with them—not lying or cheating or taking from others what is owed to them.
 
Particular justice is the correct distribution of [[just deserts]] to others. For Aristotle, such justice is proportional—it has to do with people receiving what is proportional to their merit or their worth. In his discussion of particular justice, Aristotle says an educated judge is needed to apply just decisions regarding any particular case. This is where we get the image of the scales of justice, the blindfolded judge symbolizing blind justice, balancing the scales, weighing all the evidence and deliberating each particular case individually.

== The highest good ==

In his ethical works, Aristotle describes ''eudaimonia'' as the highest human good. In Book I of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' he goes on to identify ''eudaimonia'' as the excellent exercise of the intellect, leaving it open{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} whether he means practical activity or intellectual activity.
With respect to practical activity, in order to exercise any one of the practical excellences in the highest way, a person must possess all the others. Aristotle therefore describes several apparently different kinds of virtuous person as necessarily having all the moral virtues, excellences of character.
*Being of "great soul" ([[magnanimity]]), the virtue where someone would be truly deserving of the highest praise and have a correct attitude towards the honor this may involve. This is the first such case mentioned in the ''Nicomachean Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;It is mentioned within the initial discussion of practical examples of virtues and vices at [[Nicomachean Ethics#Magnanimity or "greatness of soul"|Book IV]].[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1123b 1123b].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Being just in the true sense. This is the type of justice or fairness of a good ruler in a good community.&lt;ref&gt;This description occurs for example during the special discussion of the virtue (or virtues) of [[justice]] at [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1129b 1129b] in [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book V: Justice and Fairness: a moral virtue needing special discussion|Book V]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Phronesis]]'' or practical wisdom, as shown by good leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in this way at 1144b in [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|Book VI]].[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1144b 1144b].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The virtue of being a truly good friend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics#Books VIII and IX: Friendship and partnership|Book VIII]].[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1157b 1157a]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Having the nobility ''[[kalokagathia]]'' of a gentleman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eudemian Ethics]] Book VIII, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle also says, for example in NE Book VI, that such a complete virtue requires intellectual virtue, not only practical virtue, but also theoretical wisdom. Such a virtuous person, if they can come into being, will choose the most pleasant and happy life of all, which is the philosophical life of contemplation and speculation.

Aristotle claims that a human's highest functioning must include reasoning, being good at what sets humans apart from everything else. Or, as Aristotle explains it, "The function of man is activity of soul in accordance with reason, or at least not without reason."  He identifies two different ways in which the soul can engage: ''reasoning'' (both practical and theoretical) and ''following reasoning''. A person that does this is the happiest because they are fulfilling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul.

:(The wise person will) be more than human.  A man will not live like that by virtue of his humanness, but by virtue of some divine thing within him.  His activity is as superior to the activity of the other virtues as this divine thing is to his composite character.  Now if mind is divine in comparison with man, the life of the mind is divine in comparison with mere human life.  We should not follow popular advice and, being human, have only mortal thoughts, but should become immortal and do everything toward living the best in us. ''(NE 10.7)''

In other words, the thinker is not only the 'best' person, but is also most like God.

== Influence on later thinkers ==
{{see also|University of Magnaura}}

Aristotle's writings were taught in the Academy in Athens until 529 CE when the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] closed down non-Christian schools of philosophy.

Aristotle's work however continued to be taught as a part of secular education. Aristotle's teachings spread through the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where some early Islamic regimes allowed rational philosophical descriptions of the natural world. [[Alfarabi]] was a major influence in all medieval philosophy and wrote many works which included attempts to reconcile the ethical and political writings of Plato and Aristotle. Later [[Avicenna]], and later still [[Averroes]], were [[Arabic Philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] who commented on Aristotle as well as writing their own philosophy in Arabic. Averroes, a European Muslim, was particularly influential in turn upon European Christian philosophers, theologians and political thinkers.

In the twelfth century, Latin translations of Aristotle's works were made, enabling the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]] and his pupil [[Thomas Aquinas]] to synthesize Aristotle's philosophy with Christian theology.  Later the medieval church [[scholasticism]] in Western Europe insisted on Thomist views and suppressed non-Aristotelian metaphysics. Aquinas' writings are full of references to Aristotle, and he wrote a commentary on Aristotle's ''Nicomachean Ethics''. Aquinas also departed from Aristotle in certain respects. In particular, his ''Summa Theologica'' argued that ''Eudaimonia'' or human flourishing was held to be a temporary goal for this life, but perfect happiness as the ultimate goal could only be attained in the next life by the virtuous. Aquinas also added new theological virtues to Aristotle's system: faith, hope and charity. And supernatural assistance could help people to achieve virtue. Nevertheless, much of Aristotle's ethical thought remained intact in Aquinas.

In modern times, Aristotle's writings on ethics remain among the most influential in his broad corpus, along with The Rhetoric, and The Poetics, while his scientific writings tend to be viewed as of more strictly historical interest. Modern science develops theories about the physical world based on experiments and careful observation—in particular, on the basis of exact measurements of time and distance. Aristotle, on the other hand, bases his science largely on qualitative and non-experimental observation. Accordingly, he made some inaccurate claims which have been overturned—such as the claim that objects of different mass accelerate at different rates due to gravity.

On the other hand, The ''Nicomachean Ethics'' continues to be relevant to philosophers today. In fact, [[virtue ethics]] takes its inspiration from Aristotle's approach to ethics—in particular, sharing his emphasis on character excellence, and ethical psychology. Some philosophers, in particular Bernard Williams, regard Aristotle's ethics as superior to the Utilitarian and Kantian traditions, which have come to be the dominant approaches to philosophical ethics. Aristotle's well-known function argument is less commonly accepted today, since he seems to use it in order to develop a claim about human perfection from an observation from what is distinctive about man. But the exact role of the function argument in Aristotle's ethical theory is itself a matter of dispute.

The '''Chandy-Misra-Haas algorithm resource model''' checks for [[deadlock]] in a [[distributed system]]. It was developed by K. Mani Chandy, Jayadev Misra and Laura M Haas.

== Locally dependent ==
Consider the n processes ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''5,''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; which are performed in a single system(controller). ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, if ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; depends on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3,''&lt;/sub&gt; so on and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n-1''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. That is, if &lt;math&gt;P_1 \rightarrow P_2 \rightarrow P_3 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow P_n &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is locally dependent on &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt;. If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be locally dependent to itself if it is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; depends on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;: i.e. if &lt;math&gt;P_1 \rightarrow P_2 \rightarrow P_3 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow P_n \rightarrow P_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is locally dependent on itself.

== Description ==

The [[algorithm]] uses a message called probe(i,j,k) to transfer a message from controller of process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; to controller of process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. It specifies a message started by process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to find whether a deadlock has occurred or not.  Every process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; maintains a boolean array ''dependent'' which contains the information about the processes that depend on it. Initially the values of each array are all "false".

=== Controller sending a probe ===

Before sending, the probe checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally dependent on itself.  If so, a deadlock occurs. Otherwise it checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are in different controllers, are locally dependent and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for the resource that is locked by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Once all the conditions are satisfied it sends the probe.

=== Controller receiving a probe ===

On the receiving side, the controller checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is performing a task. If so, it neglects the probe. Otherwise, it checks the responses given ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(i) is false. Once it is verified, it assigns true to ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(i). Then it checks whether k is equal to i. If both are equal, a deadlock occurs, otherwise it sends the probe to next dependent process.

== Algorithm ==
In [[pseudocode]], the algorithm works as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Misra|first2=J.|last3=Haas|first3=L.

      (ii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for '''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and
      (iii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are on different controllers.
 '''send probe(i, j, k).''' to home site of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;

      (iii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; has not replied to all requests of to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;
 '''then begin'''
      "dependents"&lt;sub&gt;"k"&lt;/sub&gt;(i) = true;
      '''if''' k == i
      '''then''' declare that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  is deadlocked
      '''else''' for all ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;  such that
             (i) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;,
             (ii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for '''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; and
             (iii) ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; are on different controllers.
      '''send probe(i, a, b).''' to home site of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; 
 '''end'''

== Example ==

[[File:Distributed Deadlock.jpg|thumb|occurrence of deadlock in distributed system]]

''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; initiates deadlock detection. ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; sends the probe saying ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; depends on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;. Once the message is received by ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, it checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle. ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle because it is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt; and updates ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;(2) to True.

As above, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;  sends probe to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; sends probe to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;. At ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle so it update ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) to True. Therefore, deadlock can be declared.

== Complexity ==

Consider that there are "m" controllers and "p" process to perform, to declare whether a deadlock has occurred or not, the worst case for controllers and processes must be visited. Therefore, the solution is O(m+p). The time [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is [[Linear time|O(n)]].

[[File:BahnhofsuhrZuerich RZ.jpg|thumb|The [[Swiss railway clock]].]]
[[File:Greenwich clock.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Shepherd Gate Clock]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]].]]
A '''clock''' is an instrument used to measure, keep,&lt;!-- Per [[WP:RETAIN]] and [[MOS:OXFORD]], please do not remove comma without consensus on the talk page --&gt; and indicate [[time]]. The clock is one of the oldest human [[invention]]s, meeting the need to measure intervals of time shorter than the natural units: the [[day]], the [[lunar month]],&lt;!-- Per WP:RETAIN and MOS:OXFORD, please do not remove comma without consensus on the talk page --&gt; and the [[year]]. Devices operating on several physical processes have been used over the millennia.

Some predecessors to the modern clock may be considered as "clocks" that are based on movement in nature: A [[sundial]] shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a flat surface. There is a range of duration timers, a well-known example being the [[hourglass]]. [[Water clock]]s, along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments.  A major advance occurred with the invention of the [[verge escapement]], which made possible the first mechanical clocks around 1300 in [[Europe]], which kept time with oscillating timekeepers like [[balance wheel]]s.&lt;ref name="Dohrn"&gt;{{cite book

Traditionally in [[horology]], the term ''clock'' was used for a [[striking clock]], while a clock that did not strike the hours audibly was called a '''timepiece'''.&lt;ref&gt;see Baillie et al., p. 307; Palmer, p. 19; Zea &amp; Cheney, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage today, a "clock" refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time. [[Watch]]es and other timepieces that can be carried on one's person are often distinguished from clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/clock |accessdate=2018-01-29 |quote=a device for measuring and showing time, which is usually found in or on a building and is not worn by a person}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spring-driven clocks appeared during the 15th century. During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]]. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The [[electric clock]] was patented in 1840. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.

The timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s at a particular [[frequency]].&lt;ref name="Marrison" /&gt;
This object can be a [[pendulum]], a [[tuning fork]], a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.

Clocks have different ways of displaying the time. Analog clocks indicate time with a traditional [[clock face]], with moving hands. Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numbering systems are in use; [[24-hour time]] notation and 12-hour notation. Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays. For the blind and use over telephones, [[speaking clock]]s state the time audibly in words.  There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by touch. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].

==History==
{{main article|History of timekeeping devices}}

===Etymology===
The word ''clock'' is derived (via Dutch, Northern French, and [[Medieval Latin]]) from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] words ''clagan'' and ''clocca'' meaning "[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]".

The apparent position of the [[Sun]] in the sky moves over the course of each day, reflecting the rotation of the [[Earth]]. Shadows cast by stationary objects move correspondingly, so their positions can be used to indicate the time of day. A [[sundial]] shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a (usually) flat surface, which has markings that correspond to the hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Sundials Work|url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/discussions/how-do-sundials-work/|publisher=The British Sundial Society|access-date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sundials can be horizontal, vertical, or in other orientations. Sundials were widely used in [[Ancient history|ancient times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Sundials|url=http://sundials.org/index.php/all-things-sundial/ancient-sundials|publisher=North American Sundial Society|access-date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the knowledge of latitude, a well-constructed sundial can measure local [[solar time]] with reasonable accuracy, within a minute or two. Sundials continued to be used to monitor the performance of clocks until the [[modern era]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Devices that measure duration, elapsed time and intervals===
[[File:Wooden hourglass 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The flow of [[sand]] in an [[hourglass]] can be used to keep track of elapsed time.]]
Many devices can be used to mark passage of time without respect to reference time (time of day, minutes, etc.) and can be useful for measuring duration or intervals. Examples of such duration timers are [[candle clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s and the [[hourglass]]. Both the candle clock and the incense clock work on the same principle wherein the consumption of resources is more or less constant allowing reasonably precise and repeatable estimates of time passages. In the hourglass, fine [[sand]] pouring through a tiny hole at a constant rate indicates an arbitrary, predetermined, passage of time. The resource is not consumed but re-used.

====Water====
{{main article|Water clock}}
[[File:SuSongClock1.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[scale model]] of [[Su Song]]'s [[Astronomical]] Clock Tower, built in 11th-century [[Kaifeng]], [[China]]. It was driven by a large [[waterwheel]], [[chain drive]], and [[escapement]] mechanism.]]
Water clocks, also known as clepsydrae (sg: ''clepsydra''), along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical [[gnomon]] and the day counting [[tally stick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given their great antiquity, where and when they first existed is not known and perhaps unknowable. The bowl-shaped outflow is the simplest form of a water clock and is known to have existed in [[Babylon]] and in [[Egypt]] around the 16th century BC. Other regions of the world, including [[India]] and [[China]], also have early evidence of water clocks, but the earliest dates are less certain. Some authors, however, write about water clocks appearing as early as 4000 BC in these regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cowan|1958|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]] supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sailingissues.com/yachting-guide/tower-of-winds-1.html Tower of the Winds – Athens]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations are credited for initially advancing water clock design to include complex [[gear]]ing, which was connected to fanciful [[automaton|automata]] and also resulted in improved accuracy. These advances were passed on through [[Byzantium]] and [[Islamic]] times, eventually making their way back to [[Europe]]. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks（水鐘）in 725 AD, passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].

Some water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions. Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th-century Europe.

Islamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering. In 797 (or possibly 801), the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] of [[Baghdad]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented [[Charlemagne]] with an [[Asian Elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] together with a "particularly elaborate example" of a water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = James | first = Peter | title = Ancient Inventions | year = 1995 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-345-40102-1 | page = 126 | publisher = Ballantine Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; clock.
[[Pope Sylvester II]] introduced clocks to northern and western Europe around 1000AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=232|publisher=London, F.J. Mason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al-jazari elephant clock.png|thumb|upright|An [[elephant clock]] in a manuscript by [[Al-Jazari]] (1206 AD) from ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn al-Razzaz Al-Jazari]] (ed. 1974), ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''. Translated and annotated by [[Donald Routledge Hill]], Dordrecht/[[D. Reidel]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]In the 13th century, [[Al-Jazari]], an engineer from Mesopotamia (lived 1136–1206) who worked for [[Artuqid]] king of Diyar-Bakr, [[Nasrudin|Nasir al-Din]], made numerous clocks of all shapes and sizes. A book on his work described 50 mechanical devices in 6 categories, including water clocks. The most reputed clocks included [[Elephant clock|the Elephant]], Scribe and [[Castle clock]]s, all of which have been successfully reconstructed. As well as telling the time, these grand clocks were symbols of status, grandeur and wealth of the Urtuq State.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

====Early mechanical====
{{Expert needed|Time|section|talk=Early mechanical clocks – flag|date=August 2016}}
The word ''horologia'' (from the Greek ὥρα, hour, and λέγειν, to tell) was used to describe early mechanical clocks,&lt;ref name=wmsmith1875&gt;{{cite book |last2=Smith |first2=William |title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |year=1875 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |pages=615‑617 |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Horologium.html |author1=Leonhard Schmitz }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the use of this word (still used in several [[Romance languages]]) &lt;ref&gt;Modern French "horloge" is very close; Spanish "reloj" and Portuguese "relógio" drop the first part of the word.&lt;/ref&gt; for all timekeepers conceals the true nature of the mechanisms. For example, there is a record that in 1176 [[Cathédrale Saint-Étienne de Sens|Sens Cathedral]] installed a ‘[[horologe]]’&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin de la société archéologique de Sens'', year 1867, vol. IX, p. 390, available at www.archive.org. See also [[:fr:Discussion:Horloge]]&lt;/ref&gt; but the mechanism used is unknown. According to [[Jocelin of Brakelond]], in 1198 during a fire at the abbey of St Edmundsbury (now [[Bury St Edmunds]]), the monks 'ran to the clock' to fetch water, indicating that their water clock had a reservoir large enough to help extinguish the occasional fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Chronicle of Jocelin of Brakelond, Monk of St. Edmundsbury: A Picture of Monastic and Social Life on the XIIth Century |year=1910 |location=London |publisher=Chatto and Windus. Translated and edited by L.C. Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''clock'' (from the Celtic words ''clocca'' and ''clogan'', both meaning "bell"), which gradually supersedes "horologe", suggests that it was the sound of bells which also characterized the prototype mechanical clocks that appeared during the 13th century in [[Europe]].

A water-powered cogwheel clock was created in [[History of Science and Technology in China|China]] in AD 725 by [[Yi Xing]] and [[Liang Lingzan]].  This is not considered an [[escapement]] mechanism clock as it was unidirectional, the [[Song dynasty]] [[polymath]] and [[genius]] [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) incorporated it into his monumental innovation of the astronomical clock-tower of [[Kaifeng]] in 1088.&lt;ref&gt;History of Song 宋史, Vol. 340&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2011}} His astronomical clock and rotating [[armillary sphere]] still relied on the use of either flowing water during the spring, summer, autumn seasons and [[mercury (element)|liquid mercury]] during the freezing temperature of winter (i.e. [[hydraulics]]). A mercury clock, described in the ''Libros del saber'', a Spanish work from 1277 consisting of translations and paraphrases of Arabic works, is sometimes quoted as evidence for Muslim knowledge of a mechanical clock. A mercury-powered cogwheel clock was created by [[al-Muradi|Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi]]&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Book of Secrets is coming to the world after a thousand years: Automata existed already in the eleventh century!|author=[[Mario Taddei]]|publisher=Leonardo3|url=http://www.leonardo3.net/leonardo/qma/img/Press_release_Secrets_UK.pdf|accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Arabic Mechanical Engineering: Survey of the Historical sources|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|journal=[[Arabic Sciences and Philosophy]]|year=1991|volume=1|pages=167–186 [173]|doi=10.1017/S0957423900001478|ref=harv{{inconsistent citations}}|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, between 1280 and 1320, there is an increase in the number of references to clocks and horologes in church records, and this probably indicates that a new type of clock mechanism had been devised. Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power—the [[escapement]]—marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock, which differed from the previously mentioned cogwheel clocks. [[Verge escapement]] mechanism derived in the surge of true mechanical clocks, which didn't need any kind of fluid power, like water or mercury, to work.

These mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interests in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.

Simple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].

In 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'. Over the next 30 years there are mentions of clocks at a number of ecclesiastical institutions in England, Italy, and France. In 1322, a [[Norwich cathedral astronomical clock|new clock was installed in Norwich]], an expensive replacement for an earlier clock installed in 1273. This had a large (2 metre) astronomical dial with automata and bells. The costs of the installation included the full-time employment of two [[clockkeeper]]s for two years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Astronomical===

Besides the Chinese astronomical clock of Su Song in 1088 mentioned above, in Europe there were the clocks constructed by [[Richard of Wallingford]] in [[St Albans]] by 1336, and by Giovanni [[Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio|de Dondi]] in [[Padua, Italy|Padua]] from 1348 to 1364. They no longer exist, but detailed descriptions of their design and construction survive,&lt;ref name="north"&gt;North, John. God's Clockmaker: Richard of Wallingford and the Invention of Time. London: Hambledon and London (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, Henry "Geared to the Stars: the evolution of planetariums, orreries, and astronomical clocks", University of Toronto Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and modern reproductions have been made.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt; They illustrate how quickly the theory of the mechanical clock had been translated into practical constructions, and also that one of the many impulses to their development had been the desire of astronomers to investigate celestial phenomena.

Wallingford's clock had a large astrolabe-type dial, showing the sun, the moon's age, phase, and node, a star map, and possibly the planets. In addition, it had a [[Rota Fortunae|wheel of fortune]] and an indicator of the state of the tide at [[London Bridge]]. Bells rang every hour, the number of strokes indicating the time.&lt;ref name="north"/&gt; Dondi's clock was a seven-sided construction, 1 metre high, with dials showing the time of day, including minutes, the motions of all the known planets, an automatic calendar of fixed and [[Moveable feast|movable feasts]], and an eclipse prediction hand rotating once every 18 years.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt; It is not known how accurate or reliable these clocks would have been. They were probably adjusted manually every day to compensate for errors caused by wear and imprecise manufacture. Water clocks are sometimes still used today, and can be examined in places such as ancient castles and museums. The [[Salisbury cathedral clock|Salisbury Cathedral clock]], built in 1386, is considered to be the world's oldest surviving mechanical clock that strikes the hours.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles, et al.

Clockmakers developed their art in various ways. Building smaller clocks was a technical challenge, as was improving accuracy and reliability. Clocks could be impressive showpieces to demonstrate skilled craftsmanship, or less expensive, mass-produced items for domestic use. The escapement in particular was an important factor affecting the clock's accuracy, so many different mechanisms were tried.

Spring-driven clocks appeared during the 15th century,&lt;ref name="White2"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lynn Jr.|title=Medieval Technology and Social Change|publisher=Oxford Univ.

This resulted in the invention of the ''[[stackfreed]]'' and the [[fusee (horology)|fusee]] in the 15th century, and many other innovations, down to the invention of the modern ''going [[barrel (horology)|barrel]]'' in 1760.

Early clock dials did not indicate minutes and seconds. A clock with a dial indicating minutes was illustrated in a 1475 manuscript by Paulus Almanus,&lt;ref name=haencyc&gt;p. 529, "Time and timekeeping instruments", ''History of astronomy: an encyclopedia'', John Lankford, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997, {{ISBN|081530322X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some 15th-century clocks in [[Germany]] indicated minutes and seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xuDDqqa8FlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+mechanical+inventions,+Abbott+Payson+Usher#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=209|title=A history of mechanical inventions |first=Abbott Payson|last=Usher|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1988|isbn=978-0486255934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished, particularly in the metalworking towns of [[Nuremberg]] and [[Augsburg]], and in [[Blois]], France. Some of the more basic table clocks have only one time-keeping hand, with the dial between the hour markers being divided into four equal parts making the clocks readable to the nearest 15 minutes. Other clocks were exhibitions of craftsmanship and skill, incorporating astronomical indicators and musical movements. The [[escapement#Cross-beat escapement|cross-beat escapement]] was invented in 1584 by [[Jost Bürgi]], who also developed the [[remontoire]]. Bürgi's clocks were a great improvement in accuracy as they were correct to within a minute a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Lance Day |editor2=Ian McNeil |title=Biographical dictionary of the history of technology |publisher=[[Routledge]] (Routledge Reference) |year=1996 |page=116 |isbn=978-0415060424 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nqAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Table clock c. 1650 attributed to Hans Buschmann that uses technical inventions by Jost Bürgi |publisher=[[The British Museum]] |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/table_clock_attributed_to_hans.aspx |accessdate=2010-04-11 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clocks helped the 16th-century astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] to observe astronomical events with much greater precision than before.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}{{how|date=November 2014}}

The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had the idea to use a swinging bob to regulate the motion of a time-telling device earlier in the 17th century. [[Christiaan Huygens]], however, is usually credited as the inventor. He determined the mathematical formula that related pendulum length to time (about 99.4&amp;nbsp;cm or 39.1&amp;nbsp;inches for the one second movement) and had the first pendulum-driven clock made. The first model clock was built in 1657 in [[the Hague]], but it was in [[England]] that the idea was taken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc|title=History of Clocks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the ''grandfather clock'') was created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671. It was also at this time that clock cases began to be made of wood and [[clock face]]s to utilize [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] as well as hand-painted ceramics.

In 1670, William Clement created the [[anchor escapement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa072801a.htm |title=The History of Mechanical Pendulum Clocks and Quartz Clocks |work=about.com |year=2012 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an improvement over Huygens' crown escapement. Clement also introduced the pendulum suspension spring in 1671. The concentric minute hand was added to the clock by [[Daniel Quare]], a London clockmaker and others, and the second hand was first introduced.

====Hairspring====
In 1675, Huygens and [[Robert Hooke]] invented the [[spiral balance|spiral balance spring]], or the hairspring, designed to control the oscillating speed of the [[balance wheel]]. This crucial advance finally made accurate pocket watches possible. The great English clockmaker, [[Thomas Tompion]], was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his [[pocket watch]]es, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History Of Clocks|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rack and snail striking mechanism for [[striking clock]]s, was introduced during the 17th century and had distinct advantages over the 'countwheel' (or 'locking plate') mechanism. During the 20th century there was a common misconception that [[Edward Barlow (priest)|Edward Barlow]] invented ''[[rack and snail]]'' striking.  In fact, his invention was connected with a repeating mechanism employing the rack and snail.&lt;ref&gt;Horological Journal, September 2011, pp. 408–412.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[repeater (horology)|repeating clock]], that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] invented the [[Escapement#Deadbeat escapement|deadbeat escapement]] for clocks in 1720.

====Marine chronometer====
A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship. In 1714, the British government offered large [[longitude prize|financial rewards]] to the value of 20,000 pounds,&lt;ref name="Rigden2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=John S. Rigden|title=Hydrogen: The Essential Element|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhFxn_lUvz0C|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674012523|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. [[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks, later received considerable sums under the Longitude Act.

In 1735, Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat. The chronometer was tested in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer.

====Mass production====
The British had predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high quality products for the elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cVUSauNST8EC&amp;dq=British+Watch+Company+mass+production|title=Manufacturing Time: Global Competition in the Watch Industry, 1795–2000|author=Glasmeier, Amy|year=2000|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=2013-02-07|isbn=978-1572305892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was an attempt to modernise clock manufacture with [[mass production]] techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery by the British Watch Company in 1843, it was in the [[United States]] that this system took off.

===Early electric===
{{main article|Electric clock}}
In 1815, [[Francis Ronalds]] published the [[Electric clock#History|first electric clock]] powered by [[Voltaic pile#Dry pile|dry pile]] batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1783269174|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], Scottish clockmaker, patented the [[electric clock]] in 1840. The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electromagnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum. By the end of the nineteenth century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in clocks. Spring or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an [[electromechanical clock]]. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a [[master clock]] and [[slave clocks]].

Electric clocks that are powered from the [[Alternating current|AC]] supply often use [[synchronous motor]]s. The supply current alternates with a frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;[[hertz]] in many countries, and 60&amp;nbsp;hertz in others. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the motor rotates at a speed that is related to the alternation frequency. Appropriate gearing converts this rotation speed to the correct ones for the hands of the analog clock. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the alternation of the AC supply, vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms. Electronic circuits divide these high-frequency oscillations to slower ones that drive the time display.  Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.

====Quartz====
The [[piezoelectric]] properties of crystalline [[quartz]] were discovered by [[Jacques Curie|Jacques]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in 1880.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution&gt;{{cite web|url= http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/revol.html |title= A Revolution in Timekeeping |accessdate= 30 April 2008 |publisher= NIST| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409174853/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/revol.html | archivedate = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/curie/pierre.htm |title=Pierre Curie |accessdate=8 April 2008|publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first crystal oscillator was invented in 1917 by [[Alexander M.

====Atomic====
As of the 2010s, [[atomic clock]]s are the most accurate clocks in existence. They are considerably more accurate than [[quartz clock]]s as they can be accurate to within a few seconds over thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DNwfG5hQ7-YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PA484,M1|title=Sky and Ocean Joined: The U.S. Naval Observatory, 1830–2000|last=Dick|first=Stephen|page=484|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521815994|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic clocks were first theorized by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and Peter Guthrie Tait, ''Treatise on Natural Philosophy'', 2nd ed.

==Operation==
[[File:A chiming clock's mechanism.jpg|thumb|A chiming clock's mechanism.]]
The invention of the mechanical clock in the 13th century initiated a change in timekeeping methods from [[Continuous function|continuous]] processes, such as the motion of the [[gnomon]]'s shadow on a [[sundial]] or the flow of liquid in a [[water clock]], to periodic [[oscillatory]] processes, such as the swing of a [[pendulum]] or the vibration of a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]],&lt;ref name="Cipolla" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marrison1"&gt;{{cite journal

Although the mechanisms they use vary, all oscillating clocks, mechanical, digital and atomic, work similarly and can be divided into analogous parts.&lt;ref name="Jespersen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jespersen|first=James|author2=Fitz-Randolph, Jane |author3=Robb, John |title=From Sundials to Atomic Clocks: Understanding Time and Frequency|publisher=Courier Dover|year=1999|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=clock+resonance+pendulum|isbn=978-0486409139|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How clocks work|work=InDepthInfo|publisher=W.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of ''counter'', and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in human readable form.

===Power source===

[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|left|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]
* In mechanical clocks, the power source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or chain wrapped around a [[pulley]], [[sprocket]] or drum; or a spiral [[Spring (device)|spring]] called a [[mainspring]].  Mechanical clocks must be ''wound'' periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by pulling on the free end of the chain, to store [[energy]] in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.
* In [[electric clock]]s, the power source is either a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or the [[Mains power|AC power line]]. In clocks that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall or during a power outage.  Battery powered analog wall clocks are available that operate over 15 years between battery changes.
{{breakafterimages}}

===Oscillator===
The timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].&lt;ref name="Marrison" /&gt;
* In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].
* In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].
* In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]].
* In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.
* In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[Verge escapement|foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]]. As a result, they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.&lt;ref&gt;Milham, 1945, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
The advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or 'beat' dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates. The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, pp. 47–50]&lt;/ref&gt; or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|journal=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag &amp; Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=978-3527402304|bibcode=2004fsba.book.....R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks. Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece. Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose. Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.

====Synchronized or slave clocks====
Some clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:
* [[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.&lt;ref&gt;Milham, 1945, pp. 325–328&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.
* [[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] do not have an internal oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a [[synchronous motor]] which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.  Although changes in the [[Electric grid|grid]] line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds during the course of a day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.
* Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but can be periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the [[Internet]] to atomic clocks ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), using the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). Sometimes computers on a [[local area network]] (LAN) get their time from a single local server which is maintained accurately.
* [[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically synchronized to [[radio time signal|time signals]] transmitted from dedicated [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|standard time radio stations]] or [[satellite navigation]] signals, which are set by [[atomic clock]]s.

===Controller===
This has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.
* In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.
* In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].
* In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]]. A thin gas of [[caesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]]. A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase-locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves. Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, pp. 52–62]&lt;/ref&gt;
In mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried. The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.&lt;ref name="Marrison" /&gt;

===Counter chain===
This counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc. It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.
* In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.&lt;ref&gt;Milham, 1945, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;
* In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter (digital)|counters]] or dividers add the pulses up [[Digital data|digitally]], using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic. Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.

===Indicator===
[[File:Cuckoo strikes the 8th hour.ogv|thumb|right|A [[Cuckoo clock]] with mechanical [[automaton]] and sound producer striking on the 8th hour on the analog dial.]]
This displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.
* The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.
* Analog clocks display time with an analog [[clock face]], which consists of a round dial with the numbers 1 through 12, the hours in the day, around the outside.   The hours are indicated with an [[hour hand]], which makes two revolutions in a day, while the minutes are indicated by a [[Clock face|minute hand]], which makes one revolution per hour.  In mechanical clocks a gear train drives the hands; in electronic clocks the circuit produces pulses every second which drive a [[stepper motor]] and gear train, which move the hands.
* [[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digits]] on a digital [[display device|display]].  A common misconception is that a digital clock is more accurate than an analog wall clock, but the indicator type is separate and apart from the accuracy of the timing source.
* [[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].

==Types==
Clocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.

===Time display methods===

====Analog====
{{See also|Clock face}}
[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]]. The 24 hour band moves across the static map, keeping pace with the apparent movement of the sun above ground, and a pointer fixed on London points to the current time.]]
[[File:Rew17h09 1977.jpg|thumb|A modern quartz clock with a 24-hour face]]

Analog clocks usually use a [[clock face]] which indicates time using rotating pointers called "hands" on a fixed numbered dial or dials.  The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world,  has a short "hour hand" which indicates the [[hour]] on a circular dial of 12 [[hour]]s, making two revolutions per day, and a longer "minute hand" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a "second hand" which indicates the [[second]]s in the current minute. The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]],  because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  Before the modern clock face was standardized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  During the [[French Revolution]] the French government tried to introduce a [[10-hour clock]], as part of their decimal-based [[metric system]] of measurement, but it didn't catch on.  An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).
[[File:Rew17h09 1978.jpg|thumb|left|A simple 24 hour clock showing the approximate position of the sun.]]

Another type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Because the sun does not adjust to daylight saving time, users must add an hour during that time. Corrections must also be made for the [[equation of time]], and for the difference between the longitudes of the sundial and of the central meridian of the [[time zone]] that is being used (i.e. 15 degrees east of the [[prime meridian]] for each hour that the time zone is ahead of [[GMT]]). Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial. There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism—these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s. Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, the "Twelv" clock &lt;!-- not a typo, see http://www.gizmag.com/go/6312/ --&gt;indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].&lt;ref&gt;•{{US Patent|7079452}}&lt;br /&gt;•{{US Patent|7221624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks:
* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00–23;
* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM–11AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM–11PM (a notation mostly used in domestic environments).

Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.

Some clocks, called '[[flip clock]]s', have digital displays that work mechanically. The digits are painted on sheets of material which are mounted like the pages of a book. Once a minute, a page is turned over to reveal the next digit. These displays are usually easier to read in brightly lit conditions than LCDs or LEDs. Also, they do not go back to 12:00 after a power interruption. Flip clocks generally do not have electronic mechanisms. Usually, they are driven by [[Alternating current|AC]]-[[synchronous motor]]s.

====Hybrid (analog-digital)====
[[File:Orologio animato in tempo reale con secondi OF.gif|thumb|Hybrid real-time animated clock with seconds (12 hours)]]
Clocks with analog quadrants, with a digital component, usually minutes and hours displayed analogously and seconds displayed in digital mode.

====Auditory====
{{Main article|Talking clock}}
For convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. "The time is twelve thirty-five"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell, [[Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[speaking clock]] service as well.

Word clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: "It’s about three o’clock." These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software.

====Projection====
{{Main article|Projection clock}}
Some clocks, usually digital ones, include an optical [[Image projector|projector]] that shines a magnified image of the time display onto a screen or onto a surface such as an indoor ceiling or wall. The digits are large enough to be easily read, without using glasses, by persons with moderately imperfect vision, so the clocks are convenient for use in their bedrooms. Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.C. supply. Completely battery-powered portable versions resembling [[flashlight]]s are also available.

====Tactile====
Auditory and projection clocks can be used by people who are blind or have limited vision. There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. Another type is essentially digital, and uses devices that use a code such as [[Braille]] to show the digits so that they can be felt with the fingertips.

====Multi-display====
Some clocks have several displays driven by a single mechanism, and some others have several completely separate mechanisms in a single case. Clocks in public places often have several faces visible from different directions, so that the clock can be read from anywhere in the vicinity; all the faces show the same time. Other clocks show the current time in several time-zones. Watches that are intended to be carried by travellers often have two displays, one for the local time and the other for the time at home, which is useful for making pre-arranged phone calls. Some [[equation clock]]s have two displays, one showing [[Local mean time|mean time]] and the other [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|solar time]], as would be shown by a sundial. Some clocks have both analog and digital displays. Clocks with Braille displays usually also have conventional digits so they can be read by sighted people.

==Purposes==
[[File:Robbins NC Clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Many cities and towns traditionally have public clocks in a prominent location, such as a [[town square]] or [[city center]].  This one is on display at the center of the town of [[Robbins, North Carolina]].]]
[[File:Restoran Pozoj, Čakovec - stara ura.jpg|thumb|upright|An old clock in a restaurant in [[Croatia]]]]
Clocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist or in a pocket; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[railway station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.

The primary purpose of a clock is to ''display'' the time. Clocks may also have the facility to make a loud alert signal at a specified time, typically to waken a sleeper at a preset time; they are referred to as ''alarm clocks''. The alarm may start at a low volume and become louder, or have the facility to be switched off for a few minutes then resume. Alarm clocks with visible indicators are sometimes used to indicate to children too young to read the time that the time for sleep has finished; they are sometimes called ''training clocks''.

A clock mechanism may be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. a [[central heating]] system, a [[VCR]], or a [[time bomb]] (see: [[digital counter]]). Such mechanisms are usually called [[timer]]s. Clock mechanisms are also used to drive devices such as [[Solar tracker#Chronological tracker|solar trackers]] and [[Telescope mount#Equatorial mounts|astronomical telescopes]], which have to turn at accurately controlled speeds to counteract the rotation of the Earth.

Most [[digital computer]]s depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a [[clock signal]]. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.

In Chinese culture, [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese#Gifts|giving a clock]] (送鍾/送钟, sòng zhōng) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act [[Faux pas derived from Chinese pronunciation#Clock|is a homophone]] with the term for the act of attending another's funeral (送終/送终, sòngzhōng).&lt;ref name="Brown(2006)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 别人过节喜庆的时候，不送钟表。送终和送钟谐音。&lt;/ref&gt; A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is undesirable to give someone a clock or (depending on the region) other timepiece as a gift. Traditional superstitions regard this as counting the seconds to the recipient's death. Another common interpretation of this is that the phrase "to give a clock" ({{zh|t=送鐘|s=送钟}}) in Chinese is pronounced "sòng zhōng" in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], which is a [[homophone]] of a phrase for "terminating" or "attending a funeral" (both can be written as {{lang|zh|送終}} (traditional) or {{lang|zh|送终}} (simplified)). [[Cantonese people]] consider such a gift as a curse.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Kurth Clot deBroissia [http://www.netique.com/giftsearch/international.html#anchor317728 ''International Gift Giving Protocol'']&lt;/ref&gt;

This homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called "''zhong''", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.

However, should such a gift be given, the "unluckiness" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'送'}} ("give") expression of the phrase.

===Time standards===
{{Main article|Time standard|Atomic clock}}
For some scientific work timing of the utmost accuracy is essential. It is also necessary to have a standard of the maximum accuracy against which working clocks can be calibrated. An ideal clock would give the time to unlimited accuracy, but this is not realisable. Many physical processes, in particular including some [[Electronic transition|transitions]] between atomic [[energy level]]s, occur at exceedingly stable frequency; counting cycles of such a process can give a very accurate and consistent time—clocks which work this way are usually called [[atomic clock]]s. Such clocks are typically large, very expensive, require a controlled environment, and are far more accurate than required for most purposes; they are typically used in a [[Metrology#Laboratories|standards laboratory]].

===Navigation===
Until advances in the late twentieth century, [[navigation]] depended on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude can be determined through [[celestial navigation]]; the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]]. Many buildings near major ports used to have (some still do) a large [[Time ball|ball]] mounted on a tower or mast arranged to drop at a pre-determined time, for the same purpose. While [[satellite navigation]] systems such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) require unprecedentedly accurate knowledge of time, this is supplied by equipment on the satellites; vehicles no longer need timekeeping equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6824">During the [[Edo period]], [[Japan]] used various punishments against criminals. These can be categorized as follows:

* [[Capital punishment|Death penalty]]
* [[Prison|Incarceration]] and [[Exile]]
* [[Penal labor]]
* [[Confiscation]] of [[property]]
* [[Corporal punishment]]

== Death penalty  ==

Serious crimes such as [[murder]] and [[arson]] were punished by death. The [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] maintained execution grounds for Edo at [[Kozukappara execution grounds|Kozukappara]], [[Suzugamori execution grounds|Suzugamori]], and [[Itabashi execution grounds|Itabashi]]. Kozukappara, also known as Kotsukappara or Kozukahara, is currently located near the southwest exit of Tokyo's [[Minami-Senju Station]]. It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 people were executed here. Only part of the site remains, located next to Emmeiji temple, partly buried under the rail tracks and under a more-recent burial ground. Archaeological and morphological research was done by [[Tokyo University]] on the skulls found buried here which confirmed the execution methods. Another notable one was located at Suzugamori in Shinagawa. Both sites are still sparsely commemorated ''in situ'' with memorial plaques and tombstones.

The shogunate executed criminals in various ways:

* [[Boiling to death|Boiling]]
* [[Execution by burning|Burning]]
* [[Crucifixion]] for killing a parent, husband etc.
* [[Decapitation]] by [[Katana|sword]]
* [[Sawing (torture)|Sawing]]
* Waist-cutting (cutting the person in half). The Kanazawa [[Han (Japan)|han]] coupled this with decapitation.

The death penalty often carried collateral punishments. One was parading the criminal around town prior to execution. A similar one was public display of the criminal prior to execution. A third was public display of the severed head.

[[Samurai]] were often sentenced to commit [[seppuku]] in lieu of these forms of punishment. Seppuku is a term of suicide for the samurai.

== Incarceration and exile ==
Depending on the severity of the crime, magistrates could sentence convicts to incarceration in various forms:
* Exile to an [[island]]. Criminals in [[Edo]] were often confined on [[Hachijōjima]] or [[Miyakejima]]. Criminals so punished received [[tattoo]]s.
* [[Imprisonment]]. The government of Edo maintained a jail at Kodenma-chō.

Exclusion from the location of the crime was a penalty for both commoners and samurai.
* Tokoro-barai, banishment to a certain distance, was common for non-samurai.
* Kōfu kinban, assignment to the post of [[Kofu, Yamanashi|K&amp;#333;fu]] in the mountains west of Edo, is an example of rustication of samurai.

== Penal labor ==
For crimes requiring moderate punishment, convicts could be sent to work at labor camps such as the one on Ishikawa-jima in [[Tokyo Bay|Edo Bay]]. More serious acts could result in being sent to work in the [[gold]] [[Mining|mine]] on the island of [[Sado Island|Sado]]. In 1590, Hideyoshi had banned "unfree labor" or [[slavery]]; but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labor.  For example, the Edo period penal laws prescribed "non-free labor" for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the ''Gotōke reijō'' (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common.  The 1711 ''Gotōke reijō'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James Bryant. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YIbNlliRswC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=hideyoshi+slavery&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9P9o262Fpo&amp;sig=TKN79q0hnoLMEP8UbZk2fdmq00I&amp;hl=en#PPA31,M1  ''Frontier Contact Between Choson Korea and Tokugawa Japan,'' p. 31]–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also common for female convicts to be sentenced to serve terms working as slaves and prostitutes in walled [[Red Light District]]s, most notably [[Yoshiwara]].

== Confiscation ==
A penalty that targeted [[merchant]]s especially was kesshō, the confiscation of a business.

== Corporal punishment ==
[[Handcuffs|Handcuffing]] allowed the government to punish a criminal while he was under [[house arrest]]. Depending on the severity of the crime, the sentence might last 30, 50, or 100 days.

[[Flagellation]] was a common penalty for crimes such as [[theft]] and [[fight]]ing. [[Amputation]] of the nose or ears replaced flogging as penalty early in the Edo period. The 8th Shōgun of Edo, [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] introduced judicial Flogging Penalty, or ''tataki'', in 1720.  A convicted criminal could be sentenced to a maximum of 100 lashes.  ''[[Samurai]]'' and priests were exempt from flogging, and the penalty was applied only to commoners. The convict was stripped of all outer clothing and struck about the buttocks and back. The flogging penalty was used until 1867, though it fell out of favor from 1747 to 1795 intermittently.  Both men and women could be sentenced to a flogging, though during one segment of the mid-Edo period, women were imprisoned rather than flogged.&lt;ref&gt;Nawa Yumio "Torture and Penalty in Japan"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of flogging penalty===
In 757 A.D., the Chinese-influenced Yoro Ritsuryo (養老律令) legal system was enacted and introduced Five Judicial Penalties (五刑).  Two of the Five Judicial Penalties involved Flogging.  Light Flogging provided for 10 to 50 lashes, while Heavy 
Flogging stipulated 60 to 100 strokes.  However, a slave could be sentenced to up a maximum of 200 lashes.  These flogging penalties only applied to male commoners.  Convicts of the nobility, along with female commoners, might be sentenced to the imposition of handcuffs or a fine.  When a convicted criminal was flogged, half the number of lashes were typically applied to the back, half to the buttocks. At times, if the convict's request to change the lash target was sanctioned then the lashes would be applied only to the back or to the buttocks.  By the [[Sengoku period|Age of Warring States]], flogging had been largely replaced by [[decapitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Im Myung-Su "Torture and Punishment in Edo period"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}
'''Disability studies''' is an academic discipline that examines the meaning, nature, and consequences of [[disability]]. Initially the field focused on the division between "impairment" and "disability", where impairment was an impairment of an individual's mind or body, while disability was considered a [[social constructionism|social construct]].&lt;ref name=MLA&gt;{{cite web|title=Session Details: Avenues of Access: The State of Disability Studies|url=http://www.mla.org/conv_listings_detail?prog_id=570&amp;year=2013|website=Modern Language Association|publisher=Modern Language Association|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This premise gave rise to two distinct models of disability: the [[Social model of disability|social]] and [[medical model of disability|medical]] models of disability. In 1999 the social model was universally accepted as the model preferred by the field.&lt;ref name=Models1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bickenbacha|first1=Jerome E|last2=Chatterji|first2=Somnath|last3=Badley|first3=E.M.|last4=Üstün|first4=T.B.|title=Models of disablement, universalism and the international classification of impairments, disabilities and handicaps|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1999|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1173–1187|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953698004419%20/%20bbib10|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(98)00441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, the division between the social and medical models has been challenged.&lt;ref name=MLA/&gt;&lt;ref name="anti-social"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=Guy|last2=Karen|first2=Clarke|last3=Randallb|first3=Dave|last4=Rouncefield|first4=Mark|last5=Sommerville|first5=Ian|title=The anti‐social model of disability|journal=Disability &amp; Society|date=Oct 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–158|doi=10.1080/0968759042000181776|citeseerx=10.1.1.140.9006}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally there has been an increased focus on interdisciplinary research.&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs&gt;{{cite web|title=what is disability studies?|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/what_is_ds|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, recent investigations suggest using "cross-sectional markers of stratification"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siordia | first1 = C | year = 2014 | title = Disability Prevalence According to a Class, Race, and Sex (CRS) Hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Racial &amp; Ethnic Health Disparities | volume =  2| issue = 3| pages =  303–310| doi = 10.1007/s40615-014-0073-8 | pmid = 26539340 | pmc = 4628829}}&lt;/ref&gt; may help provide new insights on the non-random distribution of risk factors capable of acerbating disablement processes.

Disability studies courses include work in disability history, theory, legislation, policy, ethics, and the arts. However, students are taught to focus on the lived experiences of individuals with disabilities in practical terms. The field is focused on increasing individuals with disabilities access to [[civil rights]] and improving their [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=CAPUZZI SIMON|first1=CECILIA|title=Disability Studies: A New Normal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/disability-studies-a-new-normal.html?_r=0|accessdate=26 March 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability studies emerged in the 1980s primarily in the US, the UK, and Canada. In 1986, the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of the Social Science Association (United States) was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]].&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and History|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The first edition of the Disabilities Studies Reader (one of the first collections of academic papers related to disability studies) was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415914703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field grew rapidly over the next ten years. In 2005, the [[Modern Language Association]] established disability studies as a “division of study.” &lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==History==
Universities have long studied disabilities from a clinical perspective.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 1986 the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of Social Science Association was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]]&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory/&gt; and its journal "[[Disability Studies Quarterly]]" was the first journal in disability studies. The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; However, courses and programs were very few. In the 1997 first edition of the "Disability Studies Reader" Lennard J. Davis wrote that "it had been virtually impossible to have someone teaching about disability within the humanities".&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; In the second edition, written ten years later, he writes that "all that has changed", but "just because disability studies is on the map, does not mean that is easy to find".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Davis|editor1-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415953337|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still the field continued to grow throughout the 2000s. In 2009 Disability Studies Quarterly published a A Multinational Review of English-language Disability Studies Degrees and Courses. They found that from 2003 to 2008 the number of disability studies stand alone studies courses in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada grew from 56 to 108 and the number of degree granting courses grew from 212 to 420. A total of 17 degrees in disability studies were offered, with 11 programs in the US, 2 in the UK, 3 in Canada, and one in Australia.&lt;ref name=DSQ:ProgramReview&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Multinational Review Of English-Language Disability Studies Degrees And Courses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2009|volume=29|issue=3|url=http://dsq-sds.org/issue/view/41|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v29i3.940 | last1 = Cushing | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Smith | first2 = Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[New York Times]] article "Disability Studies: A New Normal" suggests that the expansion in disability studies programs is related to the 1990 passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA). Those raised after the passage of the ADA have entered colleges and the workforce, as Disability Studies has grown. In a 2014 article, Disability Studies Quarterly published an analysis on the relationships between student run groups and disability studies, from 2008 to 2012. Their article analyzes groups at four different universities and describes how professors have incorporated student activism into their curriculum and research.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stout|first1=Allegra|last2=Schwartz|first2=Ariel|title="It'll Grow Organically and Naturally": The Reciprocal Relationship between Student Groups and Disability Studies on College Campuses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2014|volume=34|issue=2|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4253/3593|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v34i2.4253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
According to the transnational&lt;ref name=SDSAbout&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://disstudies.org/about|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Society for Disability Studies]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Using an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary approach.  Disability sits at the intersection of many overlapping disciplines in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences.  Programs in Disability Studies should encourage a curriculum that allows students, activists, teachers, artists, practitioners, and researchers to engage the subject matter from various disciplinary perspectives.

*Challenging the view of disability as an individual deficit or defect that can be remedied solely through medical intervention or rehabilitation by "experts" and other service providers.  Rather, a program in Disability Studies should explore models and theories that examine social, political, cultural, and economic factors that define disability and help determine personal and collective responses to difference. At the same time, Disability Studies should work to de-stigmatize disease, illness, and impairment, including those that cannot be measured or explained by biological science.  Finally, while acknowledging that medical research and intervention can be useful, Disability Studies should interrogate the connections between medical practice and stigmatizing disability.
*Studying national and international perspectives, policies, literature, culture, and history with an aim of placing current ideas of disability within their broadest possible context.  Since attitudes toward disability have not been the same across times and places, much can be gained by learning from these other experiences.
*Encouraging participation by disabled students and faculty, and ensuring physical and intellectual access. Prioritizing leadership positions held by disabled people; at the same time, it is important to create an environment where contributions from anyone who shares the above goals are welcome."&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disability studies and medical humanities==
The [[social model of disability]] is expanded to chronic illness and to the broader work of the [[medical humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garden|first=R|title=Disability and narrative: new directions for medicine and the medical humanities|journal=Medical Humanities|date=December 2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=70–4|pmid=21393285|doi=10.1136/jmh.2010.004143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners are working towards improving the healthcare for disabled people through disability studies. This multi-disciplinary field of inquiry draws on the experiences and perspectives of people with disabilities to address discrimination. [[Infinite Ability]] has done some preliminary work in [[India]] to introduce disability studies to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|author2=Khosla, J |author3=Sridhar, S |title=Exploring medical humanities through theatre of the oppressed|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|date=July 2012|volume=54|issue=3|pages=296–7|pmid=23226869|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.102461|pmc=3512382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khetarpal|first=A|author2=Singh, S|title=Infertility: Why can't we classify this inability as disability?|journal=The Australasian Medical Journal|year=2012|volume=5|issue=6|pages=334–9|pmid=22848333|doi=10.4066/AMJ.2012.1290|pmc=3395292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|title=Broadening horizons: looking beyond disability|journal=Medical Education|date=May 2012|volume=46|issue=5|page=522|pmid=22515781|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intersectionality==
[[Feminism]] introduces the inclusion of [[intersectionality]] in disability studies. It focuses on [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Class (social)|class]] and other related systems of [[oppression]] that can also intersect with having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillborn|first=David|date=2015|title=Intersectionality, Critical Race Theory, and the Primacy of Racism: Race, Class, Gender, and Disability in Education.|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=277–287|doi=10.1177/1077800414557827}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminism standpoint, there is a large concern for grasping multiple positions and differences among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tina Goethals|first=|last2=Elisabeth De Schauwer|last3=Geert Van Hove|date=|year=2015|title=Weaving Intersectionality into Disability Studies Research: Inclusion, Reflexivity and Anti-Essentialism|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.11116/jdivegendstud.2.1-2.0075.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:000f48af9d031f8db8036895074aa270|journal=Digest.

===Race===
Recent scholarship has included studies that explore the intersection between disability and race. Ellen Samuels explores [[Gender studies|gender]], queer sexualities, and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenstudies.wisc.edu/professional-pages/samuels.htm|title=Department of Gender and Women's Studies|date=2013-02-27|publisher=Womenstudies.wisc.edu|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disabilitystudies.syr.edu/resources/feministdisabilitystudies.aspx|title=Women and Disability: Feminist Disability Studies [Disability Studies&amp;#93;|publisher=Disabilitystudies.syr.edu|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Bell (scholar)|Christopher Bell]]’s posthumous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.ca/2009/12/obituary-chris-bell-disability-studies.html|title=Media dis&amp;dat: Obituary: Chris Bell, disability studies scholar on race, HIV/AIDS, dies|author=BA Haller|date=2009-12-26|publisher=Media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.ca|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; volume on ''Blackness and Disability'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2N8uMz6g02gC|title=Blackness and Disability: Critical Examinations and Cultural Interventions - Google Boeken|year=2011|isbn=9783643101266|accessdate=2013-05-07|last1=Bell|first1=Christopher M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Robert McRuer]] both explore [[Queer theory|queerness]] and disability. These works engage with issues of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic oppression. Scholars of Feminist Disability Studies include [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] and Alison Kafer. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The 2009 publication of Fiona Kumari Campbell’s "Contours of Ableism: The Production of Disability and Abledness" signalled a new direction of research — studies in ableism, moving beyond preoccupations with disability to explore the maintenance of abledness in sexed, raced and modified bodies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Similarly, recent work has focused on the intersections of race and ethnicity with disability in the field of education studies and attempted to bridge Critical Race Studies with Dis/ability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamma|first=Subini Ancy|date=18 November 2015|title=Dis/ability critical race studies (DisCrit): theorizing at theintersections of race and dis/ability|url=https://www.academia.edu/2258717|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work reflects an effort to deal with complex histories of marking racially "othered" bodies as physically, psychologically, or morally deficient, and traces this history of scientific racism to contemporary dynamics. Empirical studies show that minority students are disproportionately more likely to be removed from class or school for "behavioral" or academic reasons, and far more likely to be labeled with intellectual or learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamma|first=Subini Ancy|date=18 November 2015|title=Dis/ability critical race studies(DisCrit): theorizing at theintersections of race and dis/ability|url=https://www.academia.edu/2258717|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–31|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors propose a union of critical race and disability studies, DisCrit, as an intersectional approach designed to analyzing the interaction between ableism, sexism, and racism.

In addition to work by individual scholars, disability studies organizations have also begun to focus on disability and race and gender. The Society for Disability Studies created the Chris Bell Memorial Scholarship to honor Bell's commitment to diversity in disability studies.&lt;ref name="SDSBell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|title=chris bell memorial scholarship|website=Society for Disability Studies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160435/https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|archivedate=2 April 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=26 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postsecondary disability studies programs increasingly engage with the [[intersectionality]] of oppression.

===Feminism===
Feminism integrates the social and political aspects that makes a body oppressed while allowing empowerment to be present in acknowledging its culture. [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] explains that these related systems of oppression pervades all aspects of culture by "its structuring institutions, social identities, cultural practices, political positions, historical communities, and the shared human experience of embodiment". Garland-Thomson further describes that "identity based critical enterprises have enriched and complicated our understandings of social justice, subject formation, subjugated knowledges and collective action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie. "Integrating disability, transforming feminist theory." NWSA journal 14.3 (2002): 1-32|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism works towards [[accessibility]] for everyone regardless of which societal oppressive behavior makes them a [[minority group|minority]]. Although physical adjustments are most commonly fought for in disability awareness, psychological exclusion also plays a major role oppressing people with disabilities. [[Sara Ahmed]] elaborates the mental exclusiveness of privilege in "Atmospheric Walls", that there is an atmosphere that surrounds minority bodies which explains why an intersectionally privileged person could be made uncomfortable simply by being in the same room as a person of color, or in this case someone with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ahmed, Sara N. "Atmospheric Walls." Feministkilljoys. N.p., 2014. Web. 10 Oct. 2016|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists and scholars also developed theories that put attention on the connection of gender and disability. Scholars like Thomas J. Gerschick argued that disability plays a big role on processing and experiencing gender, and people with disabilities often suffer stigmatization towards their gender, since their disabilities may make their body representation excluded by normative binary gender representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerschick|first=Thomas J.|date=2000-07-01|title=Toward a Theory of Disability and Gender|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=25|issue=4|pages=1263–1268|doi=10.1086/495558|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerschick also argues that this stigmatization can affect the gendering process and self-representation of people with disabilities. Feminists also look into how people with disabilities are politically oppressed and powerless. Abby L. Wilkerson argues that people with disabilities are politically powerless because they are often desexualized, and the lack of sexual agency leads to the lack of political agency. Wilkerson also indicates that the erotophobia towards minority groups like people with disabilities further oppresses them, since it prevents these groups from gaining political power through sexual agency and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkerson|first=Abby|date=2002|title=Disability, Sex Radicalism, and Political Agency|jstor=4316923|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=33–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and sexuality===
The intersectionality of disability and LGBTQ communities is a more modern subject of study in which the relevance, historically, came about mostly in the 1960s and the 1970s with the surge of advocates in the midst of the vocal liberation and civil rights movements.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} These communities on their own are topics of numerous deliberations, however they also often link in significance in many ways. The significance of the movements however, began to build momentum and most legal recognition in the 1980s. It was from this age of advocacy that the intersectionality of these two minority groups came into a more clear focus, though it is one continuously growing subject of discussion.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} It was only in 1973 that the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from their list of mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drescher|first=Jack|date=2015|title=Out of DSM: Depathologizing Homosexuality|journal=Behavioral Sciences|volume=5|issue=4|pages=565–575|pmc=4695779|pmid=26690228|doi=10.3390/bs5040565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, it was about forty years later in 2013 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ([[DSM-5]]) changed the listing of transgender to “gender dysphoria”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=American Psychiatric Association|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0890425558|language=en|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable circumstances where the case of these two minority rights come together was the court case ''[[In re Guardianship of Kowalski]]'', in which an accident that occurred in 1983 left a thirty-six year old Sharon Kowalski physically disabled with severe brain injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/07/us/gay-groups-are-rallied-to-aid-2-women-s-fight.html|title=Gay Groups Are Rallied To Aid 2 Women's Fight|last=Brozan|first=Nadine|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court granted guardianship of her to her homophobic parents who refused visitation rights to her long time partner, Karen Thompson. The court case lasted nearly ten years and was resolved by granting Thompson custody in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/18/us/disabled-woman-s-care-given-to-lesbian-partner.html|title=Disabled Woman's Care Given to Lesbian Partner|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major victory in the realm of gay rights but also called to attention the validity of rights for those who identified under the queer and disabled spectrum. Numerous support groups emerged from necessity to create safe spaces for those identifying in these specific minority groups such as the founding of the Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf in 1977,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the Lesbian Disabled Veterans of America group in 1996{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} which then became the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Disabled Veterans of America, and the San Francisco Gay Amputees group in 2006.

A 2012 study showed that disability was more common in gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals when compared to heterosexual peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fredriksen-Goldsen|first=Karen I.|last2=Kim|first2=Hyun-Jun|last3=Barkan|first3=Susan E.|date=2012|title=Disability Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults: Disparities in Prevalence and Risk|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490559/|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=1|pages=e16–e21|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300379|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3490559|pmid=22095356|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown that the gay, lesbian, and bisexual group with disabilities were noticeably younger in age than the heterosexual group. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of mental and physical health between the study groups, a higher statistic of those with queer identities having issues health wise than those straight identifying, reportedly due to the weight of social pressure and discrimination of minority sexual identities.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Though these minority groups do not always intersect, the way they handle their own discrimination, can be compared in similar ways.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Being that both the LGBTQ rights movement and the disability rights movements have been defined as minority discrimination movements, it has been said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} that they are a direct contrast to society normalizing the dominance of heterosexuality and able-bodiedness in its majority population. It is also a large topic of discussion to say that both groups have to undergo the same kind of "coming out" process in terms of their sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity because of the lasting social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2015|title=Addressing Disability Stigma within the Lesbian Community|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43888838/Lesbian___Disability.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1539886805&amp;Signature=JzL0VYPNkGAJAKigLgay9NP0i%2F0%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAddressing_Disability_Stigma_within_the.pdf|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation|volume=81|pages=49–56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Coming out" through sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity is one example of "Double Jeopardy", as they are part of more than one stigmatized group.

[[Queer studies]] which emerged from [[women's studies]], brings light towards the different kind of oppression [[queer]] and [[transgender]] people with disabilities have. For example, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] dismisses [[gender disphoria]] because of its moral case against transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry |first=Kevin M. |title=Disabilityqueer: Federal Disability Rights Protection for Transgender People |date=February 18, 2014 |journal=Yale Human Rights and Development Law Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |page=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yhrdlj/vol16/iss1/1/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer studies are commonly associated with people with disabilities who identify as “Crip” and is commonly believed that queer politics must incorporate crip politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McRuer |first=Robert |title=Cripping Queer Politics, or the Dangers of Neoliberalism |website=S&amp;F Online |url=http://sfonline.barnard.edu/a-new-queer-agenda/cripping-queer-politics-or-the-dangers-of-neoliberalism/ |issue=10.1–10.2 |date=Fall 2011 – Spring 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alison Kafer describes a first person experience of identifying queer and crip both bold reappropriated terms in Kafer's novel, "Feminist Queer Crip". Kafer describes the politics of the crip future and "an insistence on thinking these imagined futures - and hence, these lived presents - differently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, queer, crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=9780253009227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many activists with disabilities find empowerment in appropriating the term crip, not all people with disabilities feel comfortable using that identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3GPb2obU0gC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Crip+Theory:+Cultural+Signs+of+Queerness+and+Disability#v=onepage&amp;q=Crip%20Theory:%20Cultural%20Signs%20of%20Queerness%20and%20Disability&amp;f=false|title=Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last=McRuer|first=Robert|date=2006-06-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814761090|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different terms used as an alternative to disability, for example Melwood, a nonprofit who uses the term "differing abilities", describes the label disability as  "a limitation in the ability to pursue an occupation because of a physical or mental impairment; a disqualification, restriction or disadvantage and a lack of legal qualification to do something, was an inadequate or limiting 'label' for a cross section of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Disabilities" vs. "Differing Abilities" |url=https://www.melwood.org/disabilities-vs-differing-abilities|website=Melwood|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term disability has a history of inferiority, it is believed by many that substituting the term will help eliminate the [[ableism]] that is embedded within it. Susan Wendell describes ableism in society "as a structure for people who have no weakness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wendell |first=Susan |title=Toward a Feminist Theory of Disability |journal=Hypatia |volume=4 |number=2 |year=1989 |pages=104–124 |jstor=3809809 |doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1989.tb00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; this also applies to anyone who has any intersectional disadvantages. Feminism identifies these disadvantages and strategizes how to deconstruct the system that supports marginalizing specific groups of people.

=== Social class ===
Within class comes multiple avenues for intersectionality through disability.

==Criticism==

===Questioning the social model===
The International Association of Accessibility Professionals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies|url=http://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certificationprofoutline|website=International Association of Accessibility Professionals|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes six different models for conceptualizing disability: social, medical, cultural affiliation, economic, charity, and functional solutions. Once universally accepted in the field, the '''social''' model of disability &lt;ref name=Models1999 /&gt; has recently{{When|date=January 2018}} been challenged.&lt;ref name="anti-social" /&gt; In a 2014 ''Disability Studies Quarterly'' article, students involved in campus disability groups note that they actively seek cures for their chronic illnesses and "question the rejection of the '''medical''' model" of disability.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups/&gt; The '''cultural affiliation''' model accepts the person's disability completely and uses it a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro|first1=J|title=No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement|date=1994|publisher=Broadway Books.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''economic''' model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person's ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support or accommodations for the person's disability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strnadová|first1=I|last2=Cumming,|first2=Therese|title=Lifespan transitions and disability : A holistic perspective|date=2015|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the '''charity''' model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population.  The '''functional solutions''' model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or "functional impairments") due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deemphasizes the sociopolitical aspects of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship. This is the prevailing opinion behind compliance literature that promotes self-efficacy and self-advocacy skills for people with disabilities preparing for transition to independent living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/transitionguide.html |title=Transition of Students With Disabilities To Postsecondary Education: A Guide for High School Educators |publisher=.ed.gov |date= 2018-09-25|accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of cognitive and mental disabilities===
There is discourse within disability studies to analyze the construction of ''mental illness.'' However, few post-structuralist disability scholars have focused their attention to impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Carol|title=Sociologies of disability and illness : contested ideas in disability studies and medical sociology|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1403936363|page=131|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carol Thomas, the Reader in Sociology at the Institute for Health Research, [[Lancaster University]], this may be because disability scholars have in the past considered only the barriers confronted by people with physical disabilities.  The experience of impairment, cognitive disability, and mental illness had been absent from the discussion.

It is unclear exactly which perspective of disability scholarship “psychological impairment” can fall under, and this has led to a hesitation on the part of scholars.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;  Scholars such as [[Peter Beresford]] (2002) suggest "the development of a 'social model of madness and distress'" which would consider impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; Yet others may recommend the "embodied approach," to the study of mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

{{English grammar}}
A '''double negative''' is a grammatical construction occurring when two forms of [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] are used in the same sentence. '''Multiple negation''' is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a [[clause]]. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have '''negative concord''' or '''emphatic negation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wouden|first1=Ton van der|title=Negative Contexts: Collocation, Polarity and Multiple Negation|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134773336|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d72GAgAAQBAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and some  dialects of [[English language|English]], such as [[African-American Vernacular English]], are examples of negative-concord languages,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} while [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] do not have negative concord. It is cross-linguistically observed that negative-concord languages are more common than those without.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Languages without negative concord typically have [[negative polarity]] items that are used in place of additional negatives when another negating word already occurs.  Examples are "ever", "anything" and "anyone" in the sentence "I haven't ever owed anything to anyone" (cf. "I have&lt;u&gt;''n't''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;''never''&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;''nothing''&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;''no one''&lt;/u&gt;" in negative-concord dialects of English, and "&lt;u&gt;''Nunca''&lt;/u&gt; devi &lt;u&gt;''nada''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''ninguém''&lt;/u&gt;" in Portuguese, lit. "Never have I owed nothing to no one", or "&lt;u&gt;''Non''&lt;/u&gt; ho &lt;u&gt;''mai''&lt;/u&gt; dovuto &lt;u&gt;''nulla''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''nessuno''&lt;/u&gt;" in Italian).  Note that negative polarity can be triggered not only by direct negatives such as "not" or "never", but also by words such as "doubt" or "hardly" ("I doubt he has ever owed anything to anyone" or "He has hardly ever owed anything to anyone").

Stylistically, in English, double negatives can sometimes be used for affirmation (e.g. "I'm not feeling not good"), an  [[understatement]] of the positive ("I'm feeling good").  The rhetorical term for this is [[litotes]].

==English==
===Two negatives resolving to a positive===
When two negatives are used in one independent clause, in standard English the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative:{{rp|see the Robert Lowth citation below}} this is known as [[litotes]]. However, depending on how such a sentence is constructed, in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence. For this reason, it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one's speech is lost. A double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps, and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker.
* ''There isn't no other way.''

vs.
* ''There isn't no other way!''

These two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech. Any assumption would be correct, and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out; thereby rendering the sentence's meaning ambiguous. Since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative, the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence. In light of punctuation, the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment.
&lt;!-- The following is a clever anecdote but not directly relevant --&gt;
&lt;!-- The context-dependent nature of this rhetorical device in English is illustrated in a well-known linguistic anecdote. Oxford philosopher of language [[J. L. Austin]] gave a lecture in which he noted that there are many languages wherein a double negative makes a positive, but none in which a double positive makes a negative.  From the audience, Columbia philosopher [[Sidney Morgenbesser]] replied, "Yeah, yeah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001314.html|title=IF P, SO WHY NOT Q?|work=Language Log|author=[[Mark Liberman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

In [[standard written English|Standard English]], two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive. This rule was observed as early as 1762, when Bishop [[Robert Lowth]] wrote ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last = Fromkin|first = Victoria |author2=Rodman, Robert |author3=Hyams, Nina|title = An Introduction to Language, Seventh Edition|publisher = Heinle|year = 2002|page = 15|isbn = 0-15-508481-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "I do not disagree" could mean "I certainly agree",  "I agree", "I sort of agree", "I don't understand your point of view", "I have no opinion", and so on; it is a form of "[[weasel word]]s". Further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended.

This is opposed to the single negative "I do not agree", which typically means "I disagree". However,  the statement "I do not completely disagree" is a similar double negative to "I do not disagree" but needs little or no clarification.

With the meaning "I completely agree", Lowth would have been referring to [[litotes]] wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out. However, the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work, which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished. Because of this ambiguity, double negatives are frequently employed when making [[back-handed compliments]]. The phrase "Mr. Jones was not incompetent." will seldom mean "Mr. Jones was very competent" since the speaker would have found a more flattering way to say so. Instead, some kind of problem is implied, though Mr. Jones possesses basic competence at his tasks.

===Two or more negatives resolving to a negative===
[[File:friar-canterbury-tales.jpg|thumb|right|The Friar from the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]] of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]’s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'']]
Discussing English grammar, the term "double negative" is often&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition. Op. cit. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/double+negative Merriam-Webster Online]. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; though not universally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/double+negative The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], 4th ed. Houghton Mifflin Co, 2009. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/double-negative |title=double negative |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied to the [[Standard English|non-standard]] use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation.

Double negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as [[Southern American English]], [[African American Vernacular English]], and various British regional dialects. Indeed, they were used in [[Middle English]]. Historically, [[Chaucer]] made extensive use of double, triple, and even quadruple negatives in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. About the Friar, he writes "Ther nas no man no wher so vertuous" ("There never was no man nowhere so virtuous"). About the Knight, "He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / In all his lyf unto no maner wight" ("He never yet no vileness didn't say / In all his life to no manner of man").

Following the [[battle of Marston Moor]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] quoted his nephew's dying words in a letter to the boy's father [[Valentine Walton]]: "A little after, he said one thing lay upon his spirit. I asked him what it was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of His enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Cromwell Lord Protector'', at 129, Primus, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-917657-90-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=088_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=God+had+not+suffered+him&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IL07T6XbOqG90AG75pmqCw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=God%20had%20not%20suffered%20him&amp;f=false John Forster], ''Statesmen of the Commonwealth of England with a Treatise on the Popular Progress in English History'', pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this particular letter has often been reprinted, it is frequently changed to read "not ... to be any more" instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Whereas some double negatives may resolve to a positive, in some dialects others resolve to intensify the negative clause within a sentence. For example:
* ''I didn't go nowhere today.
* ''I'm not hungry no more.
* ''You don't know nothing.
* ''There was never no more laziness at work than before.

In contrast, some double negatives become positives:
* ''I didn't '''not''' go to the park today.
* ''We can't '''not''' go to sleep!

The key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives. If a verb is present between the two, the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former.  In the first example, the verb ''to go'' separates the two negatives; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb.  Indeed, the word 'nowhere' is thus being used as an [[adverb]] and does not negate the argument of the sentence. One interesting thing to note is that double negatives such as ''I don't want to know no more'' contrasts with Romance languages such as French in ''Je ne veux pas savoir.'' &lt;ref&gt;See the article regarding Romance languages explaining this form of double negation.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception is when the second negative is stressed, as in ''I'm not doing {{em|nothing}}; I'm thinking.''  A sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives, such as those prescribed in the later examples, where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it.  Two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer. The last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive. This is because the verb 'to doubt' has no intensifier which effectively resolves a sentence to a positive. Had we added an adverb thus:
* ''I have no doubt never this sentence is false.''

Then what happens is that the verb ''to doubt'' becomes intensified, which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive. The same applies to the third example, where the adverb 'more' merges with the prefix ''no-'' to become a negative word, which when combined with the sentence's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb ''hungry''. Where people think that the sentence ''I'm not hungry no more'' resolves to a positive is where the latter negative ''no'' becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart ''more'' which effectively becomes a noun, instead of an adverb. This is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase ''no more'' is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier. Another argument used to support the position double negatives aren't acceptable is a mathematical analogy: negating a negative number results in a positive one; e.g., {{nowrap|1=− −2 = +2}}; therefore, it is argued, ''I did not go nowhere'' resolves to ''I went somewhere''.

Other forms of double negatives, which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it, are described thus:

:''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] nor [[Existentialism]].''

Philosophies aside, this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what isn't to be. Opponents of double negatives would have preferred ''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] or [[Existentialism]]''; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence. This form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative. The use of 'nor' to emphasise the negative clause is still popular today, and has been popular in the past through works of Shakespeare and Milton:

:''Nor did they not perceive the evil plight''
:''In which they were'' ~ [[John Milton]] - [[Paradise Lost]]

:''I never was, nor never will be'' ~ [[William Shakespeare]] - [[Richard III]]

To the common reader the negatives herein do not cancel each other out but simply emphasizes the negative clause.

Up to the 18th century, double negatives were used to emphasize negation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.american.edu/cas/tesol/resources/upload/Kirby_Philippa.pdf Philippa Kirby], ''Double and Multiple Negatives, p. 2''&lt;/ref&gt; "Prescriptive grammarians" recorded and codified a shift away from the double negative in the 1700s. Double negatives continue to be spoken by those of Vernacular English, such as those of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; To such speakers, they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives. Researchers have studied African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and trace its origins back to colonial English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 5''&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that double negatives were present in colonial English, and thus presumably English as a whole, and were acceptable at that time. English after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics. The use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/02/grammar-myths-3/], ''Oxford Dictionaries Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Essay towards a practical English Grammar'' of 1711, [[James Greenwood (grammarian)|James Greenwood]] first recorded the rule: "Two Negatives, or two Adverbs of Denying do in English affirm".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  [[Robert Lowth]] stated in his grammar textbook ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar'' (1762) that "two negatives in English destroy one another, or are equivalent to an affirmative".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  Grammarians have assumed that Latin was the model for Lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord, as Latin does not feature it.  Data indicates, however, that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in Standard English by the time of Lowth's grammar, and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism, which was well established by the time it appeared.{{sfn|Kallel|2011|pp=130–131}}

===In film and television===
[[file:I wont not use no double negatives.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bart Simpson]] attempting his exercise of double negatives in the [[Simpsons]] episode [[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]]]
Double negatives have been employed in various films and television shows. In the film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the [[chimney sweep]] Bert employs a double negative when he says, "If you don't want to go nowhere..." Another is used by the bandits in the "[[stinking badges|Stinking Badges]]" scene of [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'': "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges!".

More recently, the British television show ''[[EastEnders]]'' has received some publicity over the [[Estuary English|Estuary]] accent of character [[Dot Branning]], who speaks with double and triple negatives ("I ain't never heard of no licence.").{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. In the [[Harry Enfield]] sketch "Mr Cholmondley-Warner's Guide to the Working-Class", a stereotypical Cockney employs a septuple-negative: "Inside toilet? I ain't never not heard of one of them nor I ain't nor nothing."

In music, double negatives can be employed to similar effect (as in [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Another Brick in the Wall]]", in which schoolchildren chant "We don't need no education / We don't need no thought control") or used to establish a frank and informal tone (as in [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]").

==Germanic languages==
Double negation is uncommon in other [[West Germanic languages]]. A notable exception is [[Afrikaans]], where it is mandatory (for example, "He cannot speak Afrikaans" becomes ''Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie'', "He cannot Afrikaans speak not"). Dialectal Dutch, French and [[Khoisan languages|San]] have been suggested as possible origins for this trait. Its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by Bruce Donaldson:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&amp;q=double+negative#v=onepage&amp;q=Ek%20het%20nie%20geweet%20dat%20hy%20sou%20kom%20nie&amp;f=false |title=''A Grammar of Afrikaans'', Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, p. 404 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ek het '''nie''' geweet dat hy sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I did not know that he would be coming.")
* ''Ek het geweet dat hy '''nie''' sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I knew that he would not be coming.")
* ''Hy sal '''nie''' kom '''nie''', want hy is siek''. ("He will not be coming because he is sick.")
* ''Dit is '''nie''' so moeilik om Afrikaans te leer '''nie'''''. ("It is not so difficult to learn Afrikaans.")

Another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a "double negative" but simply a grammatical template for negation.  The second ''nie'' cannot be understood as a noun or adverb (as can, e.g., ''pas'' in French), and cannot be substituted by any part of speech other than itself with the sentence remaining grammatical.  It is a grammatical particle with no independent meaning that happens to be spelled and pronounced the same as the embedded ''nie'', meaning "not", through historical accident.

The second ''nie'' is used if and only if the sentence or phrase doesn't already end with ''nie'' or another negating adverb.
* ''Ek sien jou '''nie'''''. ("I don't see you")
* ''Ek sien jou '''nooit'''''. ("I never see you")

Afrikaans shares with English the property that two negatives make a positive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For example,
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't agree with you." )
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' '''nié''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't ''not'' agree with you," i.e., I agree with you.)

While double negation is still found in the [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]] of west [[Flanders]] (e.g., ''Ik ne willen da nie doen'', "I do not want to do that") and in some villages in the central Netherlands such as [[Garderen]], it takes a different form than that found in Afrikaans. In [[Belgian Dutch]] dialects, however, there are still some widely used expressions like ''nooit niet'' ("never not") for "never".

Similar to some dialectal English, [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian]] employs both single and double negation, with the latter denoting special emphasis. For example, compare the Bavarian ''Des hob i no nia ned g'hört'' ("This have I yet never not heard") with the standard German "Das habe ich noch nie gehört". The German emphatic "niemals!" (roughly "never ever") corresponds to Bavarian "(går) nia ned" or even "nie nicht" in Standard German pronunciation.

Another exception is [[Yiddish]]. Due to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] influence, the double (and sometimes even triple) negative is quite common.

A few examples would be:
* איך האב '''קיינמאל''' '''נישט''' געזאגט ("I '''never''' '''didn't''' say")
* איך האב נישט '''קיין''' מורא פאר '''קיינעם''' '''ניט''' "I have '''no''' fear of '''no one not'''")
* It is common to add נישט ("not") after the Yiddish word גארנישט ("nothing"), i.e. איך האב גארנישט נישט געזאגט ("I have said nothing")

==Latin and Romance languages==
While in Latin a second negative word appearing along with ''non'' turns the meaning into a positive one: ''ullus'' means "any", ''nullus'' means "no", ''non...nullus'' (''nonnullus'') means "some". In the same way, ''umquam'' means "ever", ''numquam'' means "never", ''non...numquam'' (''nonnumquam'') means "sometimes", in many Romance languages a second term indicated a negative is required.

[[French grammar#Negation|In French]], the usual way to express negation is to employ two negatives, e.g. ''ne [verb] pas'', ''ne [verb] plus'', or ''ne [verb] jamais'', as in the sentences "Je ne sais pas" ("I do not know"), "Il n'y a plus de baguettes" ("There aren't any more baguettes"), and "On ne sait jamais" ("one never knows"). The second term was originally an emphatic; ''pas'', for example, derives from the Latin ''passus'', meaning "step", so that French ''Je ne marche pas'' and Catalan ''No camino pas'' originally meant "I will not walk a single step." This initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern French language&lt;ref&gt;There are literary cases in which "ne" can be used without "pas"; many of these are traditional phrases stemming from a time before the emphatic became an essential part of negation.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, in fact, in contemporary French, the original actual negative ''ne'' is mostly left away in favour of ''pas'', as in ''Je sais pas'' "I don't know". In [[Northern Catalan]], ''no'' may be omitted in colloquial language, and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], which uses ''non'' only as a short answer to questions. In [[Venetian language|Venetian]], the double negation ''no ... mìa'' can likewise lose the first particle and rely only on the second: ''magno mìa'' ("I eat not") and ''vegno mìa'' ("I come not"). These exemplify [[Jespersen's cycle]].

[[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] languages usually employ doubled negative [[correlative]]s. Portuguese ''Não vejo nada'', Romanian ''Nu văd nimic'' and Italian ''Non vedo niente''&lt;ref&gt;In Italian a simple–negative phrase, ''Non vedo alcunché'' ("I don't see anything"), is also possible.&lt;/ref&gt; ("I do not see nothing") are used to express "No, I do not see anything". In Italian, a second following negative particle ''non'' turns the phrase into a positive one, but with a slightly different meaning. For instance, while both ''Voglio mangiare'' ("I want to eat") and ''Non voglio non mangiare'' ("I don't want not to eat") mean "I want to eat", the latter phrase more precisely means "I'd prefer to eat".

Other Romance languages employ double negatives less regularly. In [[Asturian language|Asturian]], an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs: ''Yo nunca nun lu viera'' ("I had not never seen him") means "I have never seen him" and ''A mi tampoco nun me presta'' ("I neither do not like it") means "I do not like it either". Standard Catalan and Galician also used to possess a tendency to double ''no'' with other negatives, so ''Jo tampoc no l'he vista'' or ''Eu tampouco non a vira'', respectively ("I neither have not seen her") meant "I have not seen her either". That practice is dying out.

In 1974, Italy held [[Italian_divorce_referendum,_1974#Confusion_about_voting_methods|a referendum]] on whether to repeal a recent law that allowed divorce.  Voters were said to have been confused in that in order to support divorce, they needed to vote 'no' on the referendum which was worded so that 'yes' would support repeal.  And to reframe the fundamental underlying issue as being support/non-support of the continuation of marriage, then the vote was structured as a triple negative (with divorce as the negation of the continuation of marriage being the first negative).  This referendum was defeated, and without this confusion, it was said that it would have been defeated more decisively.

==Welsh==
In spoken [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the word '''ddim''' (not) often occurs with a prefixed or [[Consonant mutation|mutated]] verb form that is negative in meaning: ''Dydy hi ddim yma'' (word-for-word, "Not-is she not here") expresses "She is not here" and ''Chaiff Aled ddim mynd'' (word-for-word, "Not-will-get Aled not go") expresses "Aled is not allowed to go".

Negative correlatives can also occur with already negative verb forms. In literary Welsh, the mutated verb form is caused by an initial negative particle, '''ni''' or '''nid'''.  The particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains: ''[Ni] wyddai neb'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-knew nobody") means "Nobody knew" and ''[Ni] chaiff Aled fawr o bres'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-will-get Aled lots of money") means "Aled will not get much money". This is not usually regarded as three negative markers, however, because the negative mutation is really just an effect of the initial particle on the following word.&lt;ref&gt;

==Greek==
===Ancient Greek===
Doubled negatives are perfectly correct in [[Ancient Greek]].  With few exceptions, a simple negative (οὐ or μή) following another negative (for example, οὐδείς, ''no one'') results in an affirmation: οὐδείς οὐκ ἔπασχε τι ("No one was not suffering") means more simply "Everyone was suffering". Meanwhile, a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation: μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ("Do not permit no one to raise an uproar") means "Let not a single one among them raise an uproar".

Those constructions apply only when the negatives all refer to the same word or expression. Otherwise, the negatives simply work independently of one another: οὐ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀκοντίζειν οὐκ ἔβαλον αὐτόν means "It was not on account of their not throwing that they did not hit him", and one should not blame them for not trying.

===Modern Greek===
In [[Modern Greek]], negative concord is standard and more commonly used. For example, the sentence 'You (pl.) will not find anything' can be said in two ways: 'Δε θα βρείτε τίποτα' ('Not will find nothing') is more common than 'Δε θα βρείτε κάτι' ('Not will find something'). It depends simply on the mood of the speaker, and the latter being is considered slightly more polite. An exception to that rule is the (archaic) pronoun ουδείς, also meaning "no one", which does not allow negation of the verb that it governs.

==Slavic languages==
In [[Slavic languages]] other than [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]], multiple negatives are grammatically correct ways to express negation, and a single negative is often incorrect. In complex sentences, every part that could be grammatically negated should be negative. For example, in the [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], ''Ni(t)ko nikad(a) nigd(j)e ništa nije uradio'' ("Nobody never did not do nothing nowhere") means "Nobody has ever done anything, anywhere", and ''Nikad nisam tamo išao/išla'' ("Never I did not go there") means "I have never been there". In Czech it is also common to use  three or more negations. For example, ''Nikdy jsem nikde nikoho neviděl'' ("I have not never seen no one nowhere"). In Russian, "I know nothing" is я ничего не знаю (''ya nichevo nye znayu''), lit. "I nothing don't know."

A single negation, while syntactically correct, may result in a very unusual meaning or make no sense at all. Saying "I saw nobody" in [[Polish language|Polish]] (''Widziałem nikogo'') instead of the more usual "I did not see nobody" (''Nikogo nie widziałem'') might mean "I saw an instance of nobody" or "I saw Mr. Nobody" but it would not have its plain English meaning. Likewise, in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], saying "I do not know anyone" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam kogarkoli}}'') in place of "I do not know no one" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam nikogar}}'') has the connotation "I do not know just ''anyone''": I know someone important or special.

==Baltic languages==
As with most [[synthetic language|synthetic]] ''[[centum-satem isogloss|satem]]'' languages double negative is mandatory{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Furthermore, all verbs and [[indefinite pronoun]]s in a given statement must be negated, so it could be said that multiple negative is mandatory in Latvian.

For instance, a statement "I have '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" would be rendered as ''es '''ne'''kad '''ne'''vienam '''ne'''ko '''ne'''esmu bijis parādā''. The only alternative would be using a negating [[subordinate clause]] and [[subjunctive]] in the [[main clause]], which could be approximated in English as "there has '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; been an instance that I would have owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" ('''''nav''' bijis tā, ka es &lt;u&gt;kādreiz&lt;/u&gt; būtu &lt;u&gt;kādam&lt;/u&gt; bijis &lt;u&gt;kaut ko&lt;/u&gt; parādā''), where negative pronouns (''nekad, neviens, nekas'') are replaced by [[indefinite pronoun]]s (''kādreiz, kāds, kaut kas'') more in line with the English "ever, any" indefinite pronoun structures.

==Uralic languages==
Double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] with negative pronouns: ''Nincs semmim'' (word for word: "[doesn't-exists] [nothing-of-mine]", and translates literally as "I do not have nothing") means "I do not have anything". Negative pronouns are constructed by means of adding the prefixes ''se-,'' ''sem-,'' and ''sen-'' to interrogative pronouns.

Something superficially resembling double negation is required also in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which uses the [[auxiliary verb]] ''ei'' to express negation. Negative pronouns are constructed by adding one of the suffixes ''-an,'' ''-än,'' ''-kaan,'' or ''-kään'' to interrogative pronouns: ''Kukaan ei soittanut minulle'' means "No one called me". These suffices are, however, never used alone, but always in connection with ''ei''. This phenomenon is commonplace in Finnish, where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions, for example ''edes'' for ''jopa'' ("even"), as in ''jopa niin paljon'' meaning "even so much", and ''ei edes niin paljoa'' meaning "not even so much".

==Turkish==

Negative verb forms are grammatically required in [[Turkish grammar|Turkish]] phrases with negative pronouns or adverbs that impart a negative meaning on the whole phrase. For example, ''Hiçbir şeyim yok'' (literally, word for word, "Not-one thing-of-mine exists-not") means "I don't have anything". Likewise, ''Asla memnun değilim'' (literally, "Never satisfied not-I-am") means "I'm never satisfied".

==Japanese==
Japanese employs [[litotes]] to phrase ideas in a more indirect and polite manner. Thus, one can indicate necessity by emphasizing that not doing something would not be proper. For instance, しなければならない (''shinakereba naranai'', "must") literally means "not doing [it] would not be proper". しなければいけません (''shinakereba ikemasen'', also "must") similarly means "not doing [it] cannot go forward".

Of course, indirectness can also be employed to put an edge on one's rudeness as well. "He has studied Japanese, so he should be able to write kanji" can be phrased 彼は日本語を勉強したから漢字で書けないわけがありません (''kare wa nihongo o benkyō shita kara kanji de kakenai wake ga arimasen''), there is a rather harsher idea: "As he has studied Japanese, the reasoning that he cannot write Kanji does not exist".

==Chinese==
[[Mandarin Chinese]] also employs [[litotes]] in a like manner. One common construction is '''不'''得'''不''' ([[Hanyu Pinyin|Pinyin]]: ''[[wikt:bùdébù|bùdébù]]'', "cannot not"), which is used to express (or feign) a necessity more regretful and polite than that expressed by 必须 (''[[wikt:bìxū|bìxū]]'', "must"). Compared with "我必须走" (''Wǒ bìxū zǒu'', "I must go"), "我'''不'''得'''不'''走" (''Wǒ bùdébù zǒu'', "I cannot not go") tries to emphasize that the situation is out of the speaker's hands and that the speaker has no choice in the matter: "Unfortunately, I have got to go". Similarly, "'''没有'''人'''不'''知道" (''Méiyǒu rén bù zhīdào'', "There is '''not''' a person who does '''not''' know") is a more emphatic way to express "Everyone knows".

Double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech, while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning. For example, "我'''不'''相信'''没'''人'''不'''来" (''Wǒ bù xiāngxìn méi rén bù lái'', "I do '''not''' believe '''no''' one will '''not''' come") means "I do not think everyone will come". However, triple or multiple negatives are considered obscure and are typically avoided.

==History of languages==
[[File:Jespersen's cycle.svg|thumb|250px|An illustration of Jespersen's cycle in French]]
{{main|Jespersen's Cycle}}
Many languages, including all living Germanic languages, French, Welsh and some Berber and Arabic dialects, have gone through a process known as [[Jespersen's cycle]], where an original negative particle is replaced by another, passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles (e.g. [[Old French]] ''jeo ne dis'' → Modern Standard French ''je ne dis pas'' → Modern Colloquial French ''je dis pas'' "I don't say").

In many cases, the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative ''per se'' (thus in French ''pas'' "step", originally "not a step" = "not a bit"), but in Germanic languages, such as English and German the intermediate stage was a case of double negation, as the current negatives ''not'' and ''nicht'' in these languages originally meant "nothing": e.g. [[Old English]] ''ic ne seah'' "I didn't see" &gt;&gt; [[Middle English]] ''I ne saugh nawiht'', lit. "I didn't see nothing" &gt;&gt; [[Early Modern English]] ''I saw not''.&lt;ref&gt;Kastovsky, Dieter. 1991. Historical English syntax. p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelderen, Elly. 2006. ''A history of the English language''. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar development to a [[circumfix]] from double negation can be seen in non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages, too: for example, in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], ''kiel'' "he ate" is negated as ''ma kielx'' "he did not eat", where the verb is preceded by a negative particle ''ma''- "not" and followed by the particle -''x'', which was originally a shortened form of ''xejn'' "nothing" - thus, "he didn't eat nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/language/maltesegrammar.htm#ver |title=Grazio Falzon. Basic Maltese Grammar |publisher=Aboutmalta.com |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Euler_diagram_of_solar_system_bodies.svg|thumb|right|300px|An Euler diagram showing the relationships between different [[Solar System]] objects]]
{{Not a typo|An}} '''Euler diagram''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔɪ|l|ər}}, {{respell|OY|lər}}) is a [[diagram]]matic means of representing [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and their relationships. Typically they involve overlapping shapes, and may be scaled, such that the area of the shape is proportional to the number of elements it contains. They are particularly useful for explaining complex hierarchies and overlapping definitions. They are often confused with [[Venn diagram]]s. Unlike Venn diagrams, which show all possible relations between different sets, the Euler diagram shows only relevant relationships.

The first use of "Eulerian circles" is commonly attributed to Swiss mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707–1783). In the United States, both Venn and Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in [[set theory]] as part of the [[new math]] movement of the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readingquest.org/strat/venn.html Strategies for Reading Comprehension Venn Diagrams]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as organizations and businesses.

Euler diagrams consist of simple closed shapes in a two dimensional plane that each depict a set or category. How or if these shapes overlap demonstrates the relationships between the sets. There are only 3 possible relationships between any 2 sets; completely inclusive, partially inclusive, and exclusive. This is also referred to as containment, overlap or neither or, especially in mathematics, it may be referred to as [[subset]], [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]].

Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or "zones": the interior, which symbolically represents the [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set.  Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent [[disjoint sets]].  Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the sets).  A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a [[subset]] of it.

[[File:Syllogism-Set-Diagrams.svg|thumb|300px|right|Examples of small [[Venn diagram]]s ''(on left)'' with shaded regions representing [[empty set]]s, showing how they can be easily transformed into equivalent Euler diagrams ''(right)'']]
[[Venn diagram]]s are a more restrictive form of Euler diagrams.  A Venn diagram must contain all 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; logically possible zones of overlap between its ''n'' curves, representing all combinations of inclusion/exclusion of its constituent sets.  Regions not part of the set are indicated by coloring them black, in contrast to Euler diagrams, where membership in the set is indicated by overlap as well as color.  When the number of sets grows beyond 3 a Venn diagram becomes visually complex, especially compared to the corresponding Euler diagram. The difference between Euler and Venn diagrams can be seen in the following example. Take the three sets:

* &lt;math&gt;A = \{1,\, 2,\, 5\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;B = \{1,\, 6\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C = \{4,\, 7\}&lt;/math&gt;

The Euler and the Venn diagrams of those sets are:

&lt;gallery widths="300"&gt;
File:3-set Euler diagram.svg|Euler diagram
File:3-set Venn diagram.svg|Venn diagram
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In a logical setting, one can use model theoretic semantics to interpret Euler diagrams, within a [[universe of discourse]]. In the examples below, the Euler diagram depicts that the sets ''Animal'' and ''Mineral'' are disjoint since the corresponding curves are disjoint, and also that the set ''Four Legs'' is a subset of the set of ''Animal''s. The Venn diagram, which uses the same categories of ''Animal'', ''Mineral'', and ''Four Legs'', does not encapsulate these relationships. Traditionally the ''emptiness'' of a set in Venn diagrams is depicted by shading in the region. Euler diagrams represent ''emptiness'' either by shading or by the absence of a region.

Often a set of well-formedness conditions are imposed; these are topological or geometric constraints imposed on the structure of the diagram.  For example, connectedness of zones might be enforced, or concurrency of curves or multiple points might be banned, as might tangential intersection of curves. In the adjacent diagram, examples of small Venn diagrams are transformed into Euler diagrams by sequences of transformations; some of the intermediate diagrams have concurrency of curves. However, this sort of transformation of a Venn diagram with shading into an Euler diagram without shading is not always possible. There are examples of Euler diagrams with 9 sets that are not drawable using simple closed curves without the creation of unwanted zones since they would have to have non-planar dual graphs.

[[File:Hamilton Lectures on Logic 1874 Euler Diagrams.png|thumb|344x344px|Photo of page from Hamilton's ''Lectures on Logic''. The symbolism A, E, I, and O refer to the categorical statements that can occur in a [[syllogism]]. The small text to the left erroneously states: "The first employment of circular diagrams in logic improperly ascribed to Euler. To be found in Christian Weise", a book actually written by Johann Christian Lange.&lt;ref name="Venn_1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gailand_1967"/&gt;]]
[[File:Couturat 1914 and Venn assignments1.jpg|thumb|500px|right|On the right is a photo of page 74 from Couturat 1914 wherein he labels the 8 regions of the Venn diagram. The modern name for these "regions" is [[minterm]]s. These are shown on the left with the variables x, y and z per Venn's drawing. The symbolism is as follows: logical AND ( &amp; ) is represented by arithmetic multiplication, and the logical NOT ( ~ )is represented by " ' " after the variable, e.g. the region x'y'z is read as "NOT x AND NOT y AND z" i.e. ~x &amp; ~y &amp; z.]]

[[File:Veitch and Karnaugh 3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Both the Veitch and Karnaugh diagrams show all the [[minterms]], but the Veitch is not particularly useful for reduction of formulas. Observe the strong resemblance between the Venn and Karnaugh diagrams; the colors and the variables x, y, and z are per Venn's example.]]

As shown in the illustration to the right, [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] in his posthumously published ''Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic'' (1858–60) erroneously asserts that the original use of circles to "sensualize ... the abstractions of Logic" (p.&amp;nbsp;180) was not [[Leonhard Paul Euler]] (1707–1783) but rather [[Christian Weise]] (1642–1708) in his ''Nucleus Logicae Weisianae'' that appeared in 1712 posthumously, however, the latter book was actually written by Johann Christian Lange rather than Weise.&lt;ref name="Venn_1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gailand_1967"/&gt; He references Euler's ''[[Letters to a German Princess]]'' [Partie ii., Lettre XXXV., ed. Cournot.  – ED.]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;By the time these lectures of Hamilton were published, Hamilton too had died. His editors (symbolized by ED.), responsible for most of the footnoting, were the logicians [[Henry Longueville Mansel]] and [[John Veitch (poet)|John Veitch]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hamilton's illustration the four [[categorical proposition]]s that can occur in a [[syllogism]] as symbolized by the drawings A, E, I and O are:&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton 1860:179. The examples are from Jevons 1881:71ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A: The ''Universal Affirmative'', Example: "All metals are elements".
* E: The ''Universal Negative'', Example: "No metals are compound substances".
* I: The ''Particular Affirmative'', Example: "Some metals are brittle".
* O: The ''Particular Negative'', Example: "Some metals are not brittle".

In his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'' Chapter V "Diagrammatic Representation", [[John Venn]] (1834–1923) comments on the remarkable prevalence of the Euler diagram:
: "...of the first sixty logical treatises, published during the last century or so, which were consulted for this purpose:-somewhat at random, as they happened to be most accessible :-it appeared that thirty four appealed to the aid of diagrams, nearly all of these making use of the Eulerian Scheme." (Footnote 1 page 100)

[[File:Venn 1881 p 115-116 pasteup.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Composite of two pages 115–116 from Venn 1881 showing his example of how to convert a syllogism of three parts into his type of diagram. Venn calls the circles "Eulerian circles" (cf Sandifer 2003, Venn 1881:114 etc) in the "Eulerian scheme" (Venn 1881:100) of "old-fashioned Eulerian diagrams" (Venn 1881:113).]]

But nevertheless, he contended, "the inapplicability of this scheme for the purposes of a really general Logic" (page 100) and on page 101 observed that, "It fits in but badly even with the four propositions of the common Logic to which it is normally applied." Venn ends his chapter with the observation illustrated in the examples below—that their use is based on practice and intuition, not on a strict [[algorithm]]ic practice:
:“In fact ... those diagrams not only do not fit in with the ordinary scheme of propositions which they are employed to illustrate, but do not seem to have any recognized scheme of propositions to which they could be consistently affiliated.” (pp. 124–125)

Finally, in his Chapter XX HISTORIC NOTES Venn gets to a crucial criticism (italicized in the quote below); observe in Hamilton's illustration that the O (''Particular Negative'') and I (''Particular Affirmative'') are simply rotated:

:"We now come to Euler's well-known circles which were first described in his ''Lettres a une Princesse d'Allemagne'' (Letters 102–105). The weak point about these consists in the fact that they only illustrate in strictness the actual relations of classes to one another, rather than the imperfect knowledge of these relations which we may possess, or wish to convey, by means of the proposition. Accordingly they will not fit in with the propositions of common logic, but demand the constitution of a new group of appropriate elementary propositions.... This defect must have been noticed from the first ''in the case of the particular affirmative and negative, for the same diagram is commonly employed to stand for them both, which it does indifferently well''". (italics added: page 424)

(Sandifer 2003 reports that Euler makes such observations too; Euler reports that his figure 45 (a simple intersection of two circles) has 4 different interpretations). Whatever the case, armed with these observations and criticisms, Venn then demonstrates (pp.&amp;nbsp;100–125) how he derived what has become known as his [[Venn diagrams]] from the "...old-fashioned Euler diagrams." In particular he gives an example, shown on the left.

By 1914, [[Louis Couturat]] (1868–1914) had labeled the terms as shown on the drawing on the right. Moreover, he had labeled the ''exterior region'' (shown as a'b'c') as well. He succinctly explains how to use the diagram – one must ''strike out'' the regions that are to vanish:
:"VENN'S method is translated in geometrical diagrams which represent all the constituents, so that, in order to obtain the result, we need only ''strike out (by shading)'' those which are made to vanish by the data of the problem." (italics added p. 73)

Given the Venn's assignments, then, the unshaded areas ''inside'' the circles can be summed to yield the following equation for Venn's example:
: "No Y is Z and ALL X is Y: therefore No X is Z" has the equation x'yz' + xyz' + x'y'z for the unshaded area ''inside'' the circles (but note that this is not entirely correct; see the next paragraph).

In Venn the 0th term, x'y'z', i.e. the background surrounding the circles, does not appear.  Nowhere is it discussed or labeled, but Couturat corrects this in his drawing. The correct equation must include this unshaded area shown in boldface:
: "No Y is Z and ALL X is Y: therefore No X is Z" has the equation x'yz' + xyz' + x'y'z + ''' x'y'z' '''.

In modern usage the Venn diagram includes a "box" that surrounds all the circles; this is called the universe of discourse or the [[domain of discourse]].

Couturat now observes that, in a direct [[algorithm]]ic (formal, systematic) manner, one cannot derive reduced Boolean equations, nor does it show how to arrive at the conclusion "No X is Z". Couturat concluded that the process "has ... serious inconveniences as a method for solving logical problems": 
:"It does not show how the data are exhibited by canceling certain constituents, nor does it show how to combine the remaining constituents so as to obtain the consequences sought. In short, it serves only to exhibit one single step in the argument, namely the equation of the problem; it dispenses neither with the previous steps, i. e., "throwing of the problem into an equation" and the transformation of the premises, nor with the subsequent steps, i. e., the combinations that lead to the various consequences. Hence it is of very little use, inasmuch as the constituents can be represented by algebraic symbols quite as well as by plane regions, and are much easier to deal with in this form."(p. 75)

Thus the matter would rest until 1952 when [[Maurice Karnaugh]] (1924–&amp;nbsp;) would adapt and expand a method proposed by [[Edward W. Veitch]]; this work would rely on the [[truth table]] method precisely defined in [[Emil Post]]'s 1921 PhD thesis "Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions" and the application of propositional logic to [[switching logic]] by (among others) [[Claude Shannon]], [[George Stibitz]], and [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See footnote at [[George Stibitz]].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in chapter "Boolean Algebra" Hill and Peterson (1968, 1964) present sections 4.5ff "Set Theory as an Example of Boolean Algebra" and in it they present the Venn diagram with shading and all. They give examples of Venn diagrams to solve example switching-circuit problems, but end up with this statement:
::"For more than three variables, the basic illustrative form of the Venn diagram is inadequate. Extensions are possible, however, the most convenient of which is the Karnaugh map, to be discussed in Chapter 6." (p. 64)
In Chapter 6, section 6.4 "Karnaugh Map Representation of Boolean Functions" they begin with:
::"The Karnaugh map&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; [&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Karnaugh 1953] is one of the most powerful tools in the repertory of the logic designer. ... A Karnaugh map may be regarded either as a pictorial form of a truth table or as an extension of the Venn diagram." (pp. 103–104)

The history of Karnaugh's development of his "chart" or "map" method is obscure. Karnaugh in his 1953 referenced Veitch 1951, Veitch referenced [[Claude E. Shannon]] 1938 (essentially Shannon's Master's thesis at [[M.I.T.]]), and Shannon in turn referenced, among other authors of logic texts, Couturat 1914. In Veitch's method the variables are arranged in a rectangle or square; as described in [[Karnaugh map]], Karnaugh in his method changed the order of the variables to correspond to what has become known as (the vertices of) a [[hypercube]].

=== Example: Euler- to Venn-diagram and Karnaugh map ===
This example shows the Euler and Venn diagrams and Karnaugh map deriving and verifying the deduction "No ''X''s are ''Z''s".
In the illustration and table the following logical symbols are used:
* 1 can be read as "true", 0 as "false"
* ~ for NOT and abbreviated to ' when illustrating the minterms e.g. x' =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; NOT x,
* + for Boolean OR (from [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]: 0+0=0, 0+1 = 1+0 = 1, 1+1=1)
* &amp; (logical AND) between propositions; in the mintems AND is omitted in a manner similar to arithmetic multiplication: e.g. x'y'z =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; ~x &amp; ~y &amp; z (From Boolean algebra: 0*0=0, 0*1 = 1*0=0, 1*1 = 1, where * is shown for clarity)
* → (logical IMPLICATION): read as IF ... THEN ..., or " IMPLIES ", ''P'' → ''Q'' =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; NOT ''P'' OR ''Q''

[[File:Veitch and Karnaugh truth table 4.jpg|thumb|921px|center|Before it can be presented in a Venn diagram or Karnaugh Map, the Euler diagram's syllogism "No ''Y'' is ''Z'', All ''X'' is ''Y''" must first be reworded into the more formal language of the [[propositional calculus]]: " 'It is not the case that: {{var|Y}} AND {{var|Z'}} AND 'If an {{var|X}} then a {{var|Y'}} ". Once the propositions are reduced to symbols and a propositional formula ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ), one can construct the formula's [[truth table]]; from this table the Venn and/or the Karnaugh map are readily produced. By use of the adjacency of "1"s in the Karnaugh map (indicated by the grey ovals around terms 0 and 1 and around terms 2 and 6) one can "reduce" the example's [[Boolean equation]] i.e. (x'y'z' + x'y'z) + (x'yz' + xyz') to just two terms: x'y' + yz'. But the means for deducing the notion that "No X is Z", and just how the reduction relates to this deduction, is not forthcoming from this example.]]

Given a proposed conclusion such as "No ''X'' is a ''Z''", one can test whether or not it is a correct [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] by use of a [[truth table]]. The easiest method is put the starting formula on the left (abbreviate it as ''P'') and put the (possible) deduction on the right (abbreviate it as ''Q'') and connect the two with [[logical implication]] i.e. ''P'' → ''Q'', read as IF ''P'' THEN ''Q''. If the evaluation of the truth table produces all 1s under the implication-sign (→, the so-called ''major connective'') then ''P'' → ''Q'' is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]. Given this fact, one can "detach" the formula on the right (abbreviated as ''Q'') in the manner described below the truth table.

Given the example above, the formula for the Euler and Venn diagrams is:
: "No ''Y''s are ''Z''s" and "All ''X''s are ''Y''s": ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; ''P''
And the proposed deduction is:
: "No ''X''s are ''Z''s": ( ~ (x &amp; z) ) =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; ''Q''

So now the formula to be evaluated can be abbreviated to:
: ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) → ( ~ (x &amp; z) ): ''P'' → ''Q''
: IF ( "No ''Y''s are ''Z''s" and "All ''X''s are ''Y''s" ) THEN ( "No ''X''s are ''Z''s" )

{| style="width:auto; border:1px solid darkgray; border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align:center"

At this point the above implication ''P'' → ''Q'' (i.e. ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) →  ~(x &amp; z) ) is still a formula, and the deduction – the "detachment" of ''Q'' out of ''P'' → ''Q'' – has not occurred. But given the demonstration that ''P'' → ''Q'' is tautology, the stage is now set for the use of the procedure of [[modus ponens]] to "detach" Q: "No ''X''s are ''Z''s" and dispense with the terms on the left.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This is a sophisticated concept. Russell and Whitehead (2nd edition 1927) in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' describe it this way: "The trust in inference is the belief that if the two former assertions [the premises P, P→Q ] are not in error, the final assertion is not in error . . . An inference is the dropping of a true premiss [sic]; it is the dissolution of an implication" (p. 9). Further discussion of this appears in "Primitive Ideas and Propositions" as the first of their "primitive propositions" (axioms): *1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true" (p. 94). In a footnote the authors refer the reader back to Russell's 1903 ''Principles of Mathematics'' §38.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
''Modus ponens'' (or "the fundamental rule of inference"&lt;ref&gt;cf Reichenbach 1947:64&lt;/ref&gt;) is often written as follows: The two terms on the left, ''P'' → ''Q'' and ''P'', are called ''premises'' (by convention linked by a comma), the symbol ⊢ means "yields" (in the sense of logical deduction), and the term on the right is called the ''conclusion'': 
: ''P'' → ''Q'', ''P'' ⊢ ''Q''

For the modus ponens to succeed, both premises P → Q and P must be ''true''. Because, as demonstrated above the premise ''P'' → ''Q'' is a tautology, "truth" is always the case no matter how x, y and z are valued, but "truth" will only be the case for ''P'' in those circumstances when ''P'' evaluates as "true" (e.g. rows {{EquationNote|0}} OR {{EquationNote|1}} OR {{EquationNote|2}} OR {{EquationNote|6}}: x'y'z' + x'y'z + x'yz' + xyz' = x'y' + yz').&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Reichenbach discusses the fact that the implication ''P'' → ''Q'' need not be a tautology (a so-called "tautological implication"). Even "simple" implication (connective or adjunctive) will work, but only for those rows of the truth table that evaluate as true, cf Reichenbach 1947:64–66.&lt;/ref&gt; 
: ''P'' → ''Q'' , ''P'' ⊢ ''Q''
:* i.e.: ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) → ( ~ (x &amp; z) ) , ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) ⊢ ( ~ (x &amp; z) )
:* i.e.: IF "No ''Y''s are ''Z''s" and "All ''X''s are ''Y''s" ''THEN'' "No ''X''s are ''Z''s", "No ''Y''s are ''Z''s" and "All ''X''s are ''Y''s" ⊢ "No ''X''s are ''Z''s"

One is now free to "detach" the conclusion "No ''X''s are ''Z''s", perhaps to use it in a subsequent deduction (or as a topic of conversation).

The use of tautological implication means that other possible deductions exist besides "No ''X''s are ''Z''s"; the criterion for a successful deduction is that the 1s under the sub-major connective on the right ''include'' all the 1s under the sub-major connective on the left (the ''major'' connective being the implication that results in the tautology). For example, in the truth table, on the right side of the implication (→, the major connective symbol) the bold-face column under the sub-major connective symbol " '''~''' " has the all the same 1s that appear in the bold-faced column under the left-side sub-major connective '''&amp;''' (rows {{EquationNote|0}}, {{EquationNote|1}}, {{EquationNote|2}} and {{EquationNote|6}}), plus two more (rows {{EquationNote|3}} and {{EquationNote|4}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15155">'''Evolution of cognition''' is the idea that life on earth has gone from organisms with little to no [[cognitive function]] to a greatly varying display of cognitive function that we see in organisms today.  [[Animal cognition]] is largely studied by observing [[behavior]], which makes studying extinct species difficult. The definition of cognition varies by discipline; psychologists tend define cognition by [[human behaviors]], while ethologists have widely varying definitions. Ethological definitions of cognition range from only considering cognition in animals to be behaviors exhibited in humans, while others consider anything action involving a nervous system to be cognitive.

== Methods of studying cognitive evolution ==

Studying the evolution of cognition is accomplished through a comparative cognitive approach&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukas|first=Reuven|date=2004|title=Evolutionary Biology of Animal Cognition|jstor=30034120|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=35|pages=347–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsuzawa|first=Tetsuro|date=2009-10-01|title=The chimpanzee mind: in search of the evolutionary roots of the human mind|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-009-0277-1|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/s10071-009-0277-1|issn=1435-9448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.144/abstract|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a cognitive ability and comparing it between closely related species and distantly related species. For example, a researcher may want to analyze the connection between spatial memory and food caching behavior. By examining two closely related animals (chickadees and jays) and/or two distantly related animals (jays and chipmunks), hypotheses could be generated about when and how this cognitive ability evolved.

== Animals with high levels of cognition ==

Higher cognitive processes have evolved in many closely and distantly related animals. Some of these examples are considered convergent evolution, while others most likely shared a common ancestor that possessed higher cognitive function. For example, apes humans, and cetaceans most likely had a common ancestor with high levels of cognition, and as these species diverged they all possessed this trait. Corvids (the crow family) and apes show similar cognitive abilities in some areas such as tool use. This ability is most likely an example of convergent evolution, due to their distant relatedness.

== Selection favoring cognition ==
=== Social living ===
Social living is thought to have co-evolved with higher cognitive processes. It is hypothesized that higher cognitive function evolved to mitigate the negative effects of living in social groups. For example, the ability to recognize individual groups members could solve the problem of cheating behavior. If individuals within the group can keep track of the cheaters, then they can punish or exclude them from the group. There is also a positive correlation between relative brain size and aspects of sociality in some species&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R. I. M.|last2=Shultz|first2=Susanne|date=2007-09-07|title=Evolution in the Social Brain|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/317/5843/1344|journal=Science|language=en|volume=317|issue=5843|pages=1344–1347|doi=10.1126/science.1145463|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17823343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emery|first=Nathan J.|last2=Seed|first2=Amanda M.|last3=Bayern|first3=Auguste M.

=== Sex, mating, and relationships ===

Many animals have complex mating rituals require higher levels of cognition to evaluate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Birds are well known for their intense mating displays including swan dances that can last hours or even days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/662213/birds-incredible-mating-ritual-five-days-video|title=These birds have the most INCREDIBLE mating ritual that lasts FIVE days|last=Meades|first=Sian|date=2016-04-18|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher levels of cognition may have evolved to facilitate the formation of longer lasting relationships. Animals that form pair bonds and share parental responsibilities produce offspring that are more likely to survive and reproduce, which increases the fitness of these individuals. The cognitive requirements for this type of mating include the ability the differentiate individuals from their group and resolve social conflicts.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Finding, extracting, and protecting food ===
Another hypothesis for the evolution of cognition is that cognition allowed individuals access to food and resources that were previously unavailable. For example, the genetic mutation for color vision allowed for a greatly increased efficiency in finding and foraging fruit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Food caching behavior displayed in some birds and mammals is an example of a behavior that may have co-evolved with higher cognitive processes. This ability to store food for later consumption allows these animals to take advantage of temporary surpluses in food availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Male|first=Lucinda H.|last2=Smulders|first2=Tom V.|date=2007-03-01|title=Memory for food caches: not just for retrieval|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/18/2/456/204179|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=456–459|doi=10.1093/beheco/arl107|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corvids have displayed incredible abilities to create and remember the locations of up to hundreds of caches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherry|first=David|title=Food storage by black-capped chickadees: Memory for the location and contents of caches|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000334728480281X|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=32|issue=2|pages=451–464|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(84)80281-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is evidence that this is not just an instinctual behavior, but an example of future planning. Jays have been found to diversify the types of food they cache, possible indicating they understand the need to eat a variety of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Kort|first=Selvino R.|last2=Dickinson|first2=Anthony|last3=Clayton|first3=Nicola S.|title=Retrospective cognition by food-caching western scrub-jays|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002396900500024X|journal=Learning and Motivation|volume=36|issue=2|pages=159–176|doi=10.1016/j.lmot.2005.02.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of this hypothesis suggest that higher cognitive processes require a large brain to body ratio. This higher brain to body size ratio in turn requires a large metabolic input to function. The idea is that the two processes (greater access to food and the brain's growing need for energy) may have snowballed the evolution of these two features.

=== Technology, tools, innovation, and culture ===
The cognitive ability to use tools and pass information from one generation to the next is thought to have been a driving force of the evolution of cognition. Many animals use tools including: primates, elephants, cetaceans, birds, fish, and some invertebrates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tool use varies widely depending on the species. For example, sea otters have been observed using a rock to break open snail shells, while primates and New Caledonian crows have demonstrated an ability to fashion a new tool for a specific use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bird|first=Christopher D.|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2009-06-23|title=Insightful problem solving and creative tool modification by captive nontool-using rooks|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0901008106|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=25|pages=10370–10375|doi=10.1073/pnas.0901008106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to use tools seems to provide animals with a fitness advantage, usually in the form of access to food previously unavailable, which allows a competitive advantage for these individuals.

Some animals have demonstrated the ability to pass information from one generation to the next (culture) including: primates, cetaceans, and birds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Primates and birds can pass information of specific tool use strategies on to their offspring who can, in turn, pass it on to their offspring. In this way, the information can remain in a group on individuals even after the original users are gone. One famous example of this is in a group of macaque monkeys in Japan.  Researchers studying this species observed these monkeys feeding behavior in a population in Japan. The researchers witnessed one female, named Imo, realize that by washing potatoes in the nearby river you could remove much more sand and dirt then by simply wiping it off. Over the next few generations the researcher saw this behavior begin to appear in other individuals throughout the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alfre.dk/monkeys-washing-potatoes/|title=Monkeys Washing Potatoes {{!}} Alfred K|last=K|first=Alfred|website=alfre.dk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29373">[[Fair division]] has mostly been researched theoretically. But in addition to theory, various experiments have been made for checking various fair division procedures.

== Case studies ==

=== Allocating indivisible heirlooms ===
1. Flood&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flood|first=Merrill M.|date=1958-10-01|title=Some Experimental Games|url=https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.5.1.5|journal=Management Science|volume=5|issue=1|pages=5–26|doi=10.1287/mnsc.5.1.5|issn=0025-1909|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|case 4}} describes a division of a gift containing 5 parcels: whiskey, prunes, eggs, suitcase, etc. The division was done using the Steinhaus-Banach-Knaster procedure. The resulting division was fair, but in retrospect it was found that coalitions could gain from manipulation.

2. When Mary Anna Lee Paine Winsor died at the age of 93, her estate included two trunks of silver, that had to be divided among her 8 grandchildren. It was divided using a decentralized, fair and efficient allocation procedure, which combined [[market equilibrium]] and a [[Vickrey auction]]. Although most participants did not fully understand the algorithm or the preference information desired, it handled the major considerations well and was regarded as equitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pratt|first=John Winsor|last2=Zeckhauser|first2=Richard Jay|date=1990|title=The Fair and Efficient Division of the Winsor Family Silver|url=https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.36.11.1293|journal=Management Science|language=en|volume=36|issue=11|pages=1293–1301|doi=10.1287/mnsc.36.11.1293|issn=0025-1909|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allocating unused classrooms ===
In California, the law says that public school classrooms should be shared fairly among all public school pupils, including those in charter schools. Schools have [[dichotomous preferences]]: each school demands a certain number of classes, it is happy if it got all of them and unhappy otherwise. A new algorithm, devloped by &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurokawa|first=David|last2=Procaccia|first2=Ariel D.|last3=Shah|first3=Nisarg|date=2015-06-15|title=Leximin Allocations in the Real World|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2764468.2764490|publisher=ACM|pages=345–362|doi=10.1145/2764468.2764490|isbn=9781450334105}}&lt;/ref&gt;, allocates classrooms to schools using a non-trivial implementation of the ''randomized leximin mechanism.''  Unfortunately it was not deployed in practice, but it was tested using computer simulations based on real school data. While the problem is computationally-hard, simulations show that the implementation scales gracefully in terms of running time: even when there are 300 charter schools, it terminates in a few minutes on average. Moreover, while theoretically the algorithm guarantees only 1/4 of the maximum number of allocated classrooms, in the simulations it satisfies on average at least 98% of the maximum number of charter schools that can possibly be satisfied, and allocates on average at least 98% of the maximum number of classrooms that can possibly be allocated. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The partial collaboration with the school district lead to several practical desiderata in deploying fair division solutions in practice. First, the simplicity of the mechanism, and the intuitiveness of the properties of proportionality, envy-freeness, Pareto optimality, and strategyproofness, have made the approach more likely to be adopted. On the other hand, the use of randomization, though absolutely necessary in order to guarantee fairness in allocating indivisible goods such as classrooms, has been a somewhat harder sell: the term "lottery" raised negative connotations and legal objections.

=== Resolving international conflicts ===
The [[adjusted winner procedure]] is a protocol for simultaneously resolving several issues under conflict, such that the agreement is envy-free, equitable, and Pareto efficient. It has been commercialized through the [http://www.fairoutcomes.com FairOutcomes] website. While there are no account of it actually being used to resolve disputes, there are several counterfactual studies checking what would have been the results of using this procedure to solve international disputes: 

* For the [[Camp David Accords]], the authors construct approximate numeric valuation functions for Israel and Egypt, based on the relative importance of each issue for each country. They then run the AW protocol. The theoretical results are very similar to the actual agreement, which leads the authors to conclude that the agreement is as fair as it could be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brams|first=Steven J.|last2=Togman|first2=Jeffrey M.|date=1996|title=Camp David: Was The Agreement Fair?|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/073889429601500105|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=99–112|doi=10.1177/073889429601500105|issn=0738-8942|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* For the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], the author constructs the valuation functions based on a survey of expert opinions, and describes the agreement that would result from running the AW protocol with these valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massoud|first=Tansa George|date=2000-06-01|title=Fair Division, Adjusted Winner Procedure (AW), and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002700044003003|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=333–358|doi=10.1177/0022002700044003003|issn=0022-0027|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*For the [[Spratly Islands dispute]], the authors construct a two-phase procedure for settling the dispute, and present its (hypothetic) outcome. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denoon|first=D. B.

=== Allocating rooms and rent ===
[[Rental harmony]] is the problem of simultaneously allocating rooms in an apartment and the rent of the apartment among the housemates. It has several solutions. Some of these solutions were implemented in the [http://spliddit.org Spliddit.org] website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Jonathan|last2=Procaccia|first2=Ariel D.|date=2015-01-28|title=Spliddit: unleashing fair division algorithms|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2728732.2728738|journal=ACM SIGecom Exchanges|volume=13|issue=2|pages=41–46|doi=10.1145/2728732.2728738}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tested on real users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gal|first=Ya'akov (Kobi)|last2=Mash|first2=Moshe|last3=Procaccia|first3=Ariel D.|last4=Zick|first4=Yair|date=2016-07-21|title=Which Is the Fairest (Rent Division) of Them All?|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2940716.2940724|publisher=ACM|pages=67–84|doi=10.1145/2940716.2940724|isbn=9781450339360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sharing cooperation surplus ===
When different agents cooperate, there is an economic surplus in welfare. [[Cooperative game theory]] studies the question of how this surplus should be allocated, taking into account the various coalitional options of the players. Several cases of such cooperation has been studied, in light of concepts such as the [[Shapley value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tijs|first=Stef H.|last2=Branzei|first2=Rodica|date=2004|title=Cases in Cooperation and Cutting the Cake|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=627424|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.627424|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair Bargaining ===
Flood&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; analyzed several cases of bargaining between a buyer and a seller on the price of purchasing a good (e.g. a car). He found that the "split-the-difference" principle was acceptable by both participants. The same cooperative principle was found in more abstract non-cooperative games. However, in some cases, bidders in an auction did not find a cooperative sollution.

He tested them using a computerized simulation: valuation functions for each agent were generated by dividing the cake into random segments, and assigning a random value to each segment, normalizing the total value of the cake. The [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian welfare]] and the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian welfare]] of various algorithms were compared.

=== Welfare redistribution mechanism ===

He tested his mechanism using simulations. He generated piecewise-constant valuation functions, whose constants were selected at random from the uniform distribution. He also tried Gaussian distributions and got similar results.

=== [[Fair item assignment]] ===
It is known that, when items are indivisible, fair allocations might not exist. However, this is a worst-case scenario; in realistic settings, fair allocations often do exist. Computerized simulations show that, when the number of goods is larger than the number of agents by a logarithmic factor, fair allocations often exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickerson|first=John P.|last2=Goldman|first2=Jonathan|last3=Karp|first3=Jeremy|last4=Procaccia|first4=Ariel D.|last5=Sandholm|first5=Tuomas|date=2014-07-27|title=The computational rise and fall of fairness|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2893873.2894091|journal=Proceedings of AAAI 2014|publisher=AAAI Press|volume=|pages=1405–1411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, computerized simulations show that, in many cases, there exist allocations that are  ''necessarily fair'' based on a certain convexity assumption on the agents' preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segal-Halevi|first=Erel|last2=Aziz|first2=Haris|last3=Hassidim|first3=Avinatan|date=2017-08-19|title=Fair allocation based on diminishing differences|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3171642.3171820|journal=Proceedings of IJCAI 2017|publisher=AAAI Press|volume=|pages=1254–1261|isbn=9780999241103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laboratory experiments ==
Several experiments were conducted with people, in order to find out what is the relative importance of several desiderata in choosing an allocation.

=== Fairness vs. efficiency - what outcome is better? ===
Sometimes, there are only two possible allocations: one is fair (e.g. [[envy-free division]]) but inefficient, while the other is efficient (e.g. [[Pareto-optimal]]) but unfair. Which division do people prefer? This was tested in several lab experiments. 

1. Subjects were given several possible allocations of money, and were asked which allocation they prefer. One experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engelmann|first=Dirk|last2=Strobel|first2=Martin|date=2004-08-01|title=Inequality Aversion, Efficiency, and Maximin Preferences in Simple Distribution Experiments|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002741|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=94|issue=4|pages=857–869|doi=10.1257/0002828042002741|issn=0002-8282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the most important factors were Pareto-efficiency and Rawlsian motive for helping the poor (maximin principle). However, a later experiment found that these conclusions only hold for students of economics and business, who train to acknowledge the importance of efficiency. In the general population, the most important factors are selfishness and [[inequality aversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fehr|first=Ernst|last2=Naef|first2=Michael|last3=Schmidt|first3=Klaus M|date=2006-11-01|title=Inequality Aversion, Efficiency, and Maximin Preferences in Simple Distribution Experiments: Comment|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.96.5.1912|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=96|issue=5|pages=1912–1917|doi=10.1257/aer.96.5.1912|issn=0002-8282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

2. Subjects were asked to answer questionnaires regarding the division of indivisible items between two people. The subjects were shown the subjective value that each (virtual) person attaches to each item. The predominant aspect considered was equity - satisfying each individual's preferences. The efficiency aspect was secondary. This effect was slightly more pronounced in economics students, and less pronounced in law students (who chose a Pareto-efficient allocation more frequently).&lt;ref name="hp1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Herreiner, Dorothea|author2=Puppe, Clemens|title=Distributing Indivisible Goods Fairly: Evidence from a Questionnaire Study|url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/econ_fac/3/|journal=Loyola Marimount University - Economics Faculty Works}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

3. Subjects were divided into pairs and asked to negotiate and decide how to divide a set of 4 items between them. Each combination of items had a pre-specified monetary value, which was ''different'' between the two subjects. Each subject knew both his own values and the partner's values. After the division, each subject could redeem the items for their monetary value.     The items could be divided in several ways: some divisions were [[Equitable division|equitable]] (e.g., giving each partner a value of 45), while other divisions were Pareto efficient (e.g., giving one partner 46 and another partner 75). The interesting question was whether people prefer the equitable or the efficient division. The results showed that people preferred the more efficient division only if it was not "too unfair". A difference of 2-3 value units was considered sufficiently small for most subjects, so they preferred the efficient allocation. But a difference of 20-30 units (such as in the 45:45 vs. 46:75 example) was perceived as too large: 51% preferred the 45:45 division.    The effect were less pronounced when the subjects were only shown the ''rank'' of the item combinations for each of them, rather than the full monetary value.    This experiment also revealed a recurring process which was used during the negotiation: subjects first find the most equitable division of the goods. They take it as a reference point and try to find Pareto improvements. An improvement is implemented only if the inequality it causes is not too large. This process is called CPIES: Conditioned Pareto Improvement from Equal Split.&lt;ref name="hp10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herreiner|first1=Dorothea K.|last2=Puppe|first2=Clemens|date=November 2010|title=Inequality aversion and efficiency with ordinal and cardinal social preferences—An experimental study|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=76|issue=2|pages=238–253|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2010.06.002|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intra-personal vs. inter-personal fairness - which is more important? ===
What is the importance of ''intra-personal'' fairness criteria (such as [[envy-freeness]], where each person compares bundles based only on his own utility-function), vs. ''inter-personal'' fairness criteria (such as [[Equitable division|equitability]], where each person views the utilities of all other agents)? Using a free-form bargaining experiment, it was found that inter-personal fairness (e.g. equitability) is more important. Intra-personal fairness (such as envy-freeness) are relevant only as a secondary criterion.&lt;ref name="hp09"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herreiner|first1=Dorothea K.|last2=Puppe|first2=Clemens D.|year=2007|title=Envy Freeness in Experimental Fair Division Problems|journal=Theory and Decision|volume=67|pages=65|doi=10.1007/s11238-007-9069-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fairness vs. simplicity - what procedure is more satisfactory? ===
[[Divide and choose]] (DC) is a fair and very simple procedure. There are more sophisticated procedures that have better fairness guarantees. The question of which were more satisfactory was tested in several lab experiments.

1. '''Divide-and-choose vs Knaster-Brams-Taylor.''' Several pairs of players had to divide among them 3 indivisible goods (a ballpoint pen, a lighter and a mug) and some money. Three procedures were used: the simple DC, and the more complicated ''Adjusted Knaster'' (an improvement of [[adjusted winner]]) and ''Proportional Knaster''.  The authors asked the subjects to select their favorite procedure. Then, they let them play the procedure in two modes: binding (strict adherence to the protocol rules) and non-binding (possible renegotiation afterwards). They compared the procedures performance in terms of efficiency, envy-freeness, equitability and truthfulness. Their conclusions are: (a) The sophisticated mechanisms are advantageous only in the binding case; when renegotiation is possible, their performance drops to the baseline level of DC. (b) The preference for a procedure depends not only on the expected utility calculations of the negotiators, but also on their psychological profile: the more "antisocial" a person is, the more likely he is to opt for a procedure with a compensatory mechanism. The more risk-averse a person is, the more likely he is to opt for a straightforward procedure like DC. (c) The final payoff of a participant in a procedure depends a lot on the implementation. If participants cannot divide the goods under a procedure of their own choice, they are more eager to maximize their payoff. A shortened time horizon is equally detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Gerald|last2=Krämer|first2=Ulrike Sabrina|date=2004|title=The Limitations of Fair Division: An Experimental Evaluation of Three Procedures|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4149806|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=48|issue=4|pages=506–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. '''Structured procedures vs. Genetic algorithms'''. Two pairs of players had to divide between them 10 indivisible goods. A [[genetic algorithm]] was used to search for the best division candidates: out of the 1024 possible divisions, a subset of 20 divisions was shown to the players, and they were asked to grade their satisfaction about the candidate division on a scale ranging from 0 (not satisfied at all) to 1 (fully satisfied). Then, for each subject, a new population of 20 divisions was created using a genetic algorithm. This procedure continued for 15 iterations until a best surviving allocation was found.    The results were compared to five provably-fair division algorithms: Sealed Bid Knaster, Adjusted Winner, Adjusted Knaster, Division by Lottery and  Descending Demand. Often, the best divisions found by the genetic algorithm were rated as more mutually satisfactory than the ones derived from the algorithms. Two possible reasons for that were: (a) ''Temporal fluctuation of preferences'' - the valuations of humans change from the point they report their valuations to the point they see the final allocation. Most fair division procedures ignore this issue, but the genetic algorithm captures it naturally. (b) ''Non-additivity of preferences''. Most division procedures assume that valuations are additive, but in reality they are not; the genetic algorithm works just as well with non-additive valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dupuis-Roy|first=Nicolas|last2=Gosselin|first2=Frédéric|date=2009|title=An Empirical Evaluation of Fair-Division Algorithms|url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt0v65q415/qt0v65q415.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society|volume=|pages=2681-2686|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. '''Simple procedures vs. Strongly-fair procedures'''. 39 player-pairs were given 6 indivisible gift-certificates of the same value ($10) but from different vendors (e.g. Esso, Starbucks, etc.). Before the procedure, each participant was shown all the 64 possible allocations, and was asked to grade the ''satisfaction'' and ''fairness'' of each of them between 0 (bad) and 100 (good). Then, they were taught seven different procedures, with different levels of fairness guarantees: Strict Alternation and Balanced Alternation (no guarantees), Divide and Choose (only envy-freeness), Compensation Procedure and Price Procedure (envy-freeness and Pareto-efficiency), Adjusted Knaster and Adjusted Winner (envy-freeness, Pareto-efficiency and equitability). They practiced each of these against a computer. Then, they did an actual division against another human subject. After the procedure, they were asked again to grade the satisfaction and fairness of the outcome; the goal was to distinguish procedural fairness from distributional fairness. The results showed that: (a) procedural fairness had no significant impact; satisfaction was mainly determined by distributional fairness. (b) the results of simpler procedures (strict alternation, balanced alternation and DC) were considered fairer and more satisfactory. They explain this couter-intuitive result by showing that humans care about ''object equality'' - giving each agent the same number of objects (though this does not entail any mathematical fairness criterion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dupuis-Roy, Nicolas; Gosselin, Frédéric|first=|date=2011|title=The Simpler, the Better: A New Challenge for Fair-Division Theory|url=http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/Proceedings/2011/papers/0742/paper0742.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci 2011)|volume=|pages=3229–3234|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficiency vs. strategy - what procedure is more efficient? ===
Consider two agents that have to bargain on a deal, such as how to divide goods among them. Often, if they sincerely reveal their preferences, they can attain a win-win deal. However, if they strategically misrepresent their preferences in an attempt to gain, they might actually lose the deal. What negotiation procedure is most efficient in terms of attaining good deals? Several bargaining procedures were studied in the lab.

1. '''[[Sealed bid auction]]''': a simple one-shot negotiation procedure. In the lab, information-advantaged players aggressively exploited asymmetric information, and drastically misrepresented their true valuation through strategic bidding. This often resulted in a reduced bargaining zone, forgone deals and low economic efficiency. In one experiment, deals were made on only 52% of all trials, while 77% of all trials had a positive bargaining zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=T. E. Daniel, A. Seale, A. Rapoport|first=|date=1998|title=Strategic Play and Adaptive Learning in the Sealed Bid Bargaining Mechanism|url=http://www.academia.edu/download/39731579/Strategic_Play_and_Adaptive_Learning_in_20151105-8328-1ffut5t.pdf|journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=42|pages=133–166|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

2. '''Bonus procedure''': a procedure that gives a bonus was given to participants making a deal. This bonus is calculated such that it is optimal for players to reveval their true preferences. Lab experiments show that this does not help: subjects still strategize, although it is bad for them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parco|first=James E.|last2=Rapoport|first2=Amnon|date=2004-11-01|title=Enhancing Honesty in Bargaining Under Incomplete Information: An Experimental Study of the Bonus Procedure|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10726-005-3824-4|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=539–562|doi=10.1007/s10726-005-3824-4|issn=0926-2644|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. [[Adjusted Winner|'''Adjusted Winner''']] (AW): a procedure that allocates divisible objects in order to maximize the total utility. In the lab, subjects bargained in pairs over two divisible objects. Each of the two objects was assigned a random value drawn from a commonly known prior distribution. Each player had complete information about their own values, but incomplete information about their co-bargainer’s values. There were three information conditions: (1)  Competing Preferences: Players know that the preferences of their co-bargainer are similar to their own; (2)  Complementary Preferences: Players know that the preferences of their co-bargainer are diametrically opposed to their own;  (3)  Unknown (Random) Preferences: Players do not know what their co-bargainer values most relative to their own preferences.  In condition (1), the bilateral decisions converge toward efficient outcomes, yet only one-third are "envy-free". In condition (2), while players dramatically misrepresent their true valuation for objects, both efficiency and envy-freeness approach maximum levels. In condition (3), pronounced strategic bidding emerges, yet the result is twice as many envy-free outcomes, with increased levels of efficiency (relative to condition 1). In all cases, the structured AW procedure was quite successful in attaining a win-win solution - about 3/2 times more than unstructured negotiation. The key to its success is that it forces players out of the ‘fixed pie myth’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniel|first=Terry E.|last2=Parco|first2=James E.|date=2005-05-01|title=Fair, Efficient and Envy-Free Bargaining: An Experimental Test of the Brams-Taylor Adjusted Winner Mechanism|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10726-005-1245-z|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=241–264|doi=10.1007/s10726-005-1245-z|issn=0926-2644|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. '''Conflict-resolution algorithm''': Hortala-Vallve and lorente-Saguer describe a simple mechanism for solving several issues simultaneously (analogous to Adjusted Winner). They observe that equilibrium play increases over time, and truthful play decreases over time - agents manipulate more often when they learn their partners' preferences. Fortunately, the deviations from equilibrium do not cause much damage to the social welfare - the final welfare is close to the theoretic optimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-11-01|title=A simple mechanism for resolving conflict|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825610000333|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=375–391|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2010.02.005|issn=0899-8256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How does sharing behavior develop in children? ===
In the lab, children were paired to "rich" and "poor" and were asked to share objects. There were differences in the perception of "initial belongings" vs. "things that have to be shared": young children (up to 7) did not distinguish them while older children (above 11) did. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moessinger|first=Pierre|date=1975|title=Developmental study of fair division and property|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2420050310|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=385–394|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420050310|issn=0046-2772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Felicity''' is an English feminine given name meaning "happiness". It is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''felicitas'' meaning "luck, good fortune".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfnames.com/fnames/f/origin-and-meaning-of-felicity.htm MFnames.com - Origin and Meaning of Felicity]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a form of the Latin name '''Felicitas''', taken from the name of the [[Ancient Roman]] goddess [[Fortuna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthename.com/name/felicity Behind the Name - Origin and History of the Name Felicity]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the name of [[Felicitas of Rome|Saint Felicity of Rome]], a 2nd-century saint venerated by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. ''[[Felicia]]'', a related name, is a feminine form of the name ''[[Felix (name)|Felix]]'', which is derived from an [[Ancient Roman]] cognomen meaning "lucky," or "successful."

Felicity was the 236th most popular name for girls born in [[England and Wales]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babyplanners.co.uk/namebraindata.php?s=f&amp;y=2007 Babyplanners]&lt;/ref&gt; The name was the 706th most popular name for girls born in the [[United States]] in 2007, down from 619th place in 2006. The name was most popular in the United States in 1999, the year after the television show ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' debuted. It was the 390th most popular name for girls in 1999, rising from 818th place in 1998, the year it debuted on the list of 1,000 most popular names for girls in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthename.com/top/search.php?terms=felicity Popularity for Felicity]&lt;/ref&gt; Felicity Merriman is a red-headed Colonial doll produced by the [[American Girl (company)|American Girl company]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24338">'''Fibred categories''' (or '''fibered categories''') are abstract entities in [[mathematics]] used to provide a general framework for [[descent theory]]. They formalise the various situations in [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] in which ''inverse images'' (or ''pull-backs'') of objects such as [[vector bundle]]s can be defined. As an example, for each topological space there is the category of vector bundles on the space, and for every [[continuous map]] from a topological space ''X'' to another topological space ''Y'' is associated the [[pullback bundle|pullback]] [[functor]] taking bundles on ''Y'' to bundles on ''X''. Fibred categories formalise the system consisting of these categories and inverse image functors. Similar setups appear in various guises in mathematics, in particular in [[algebraic geometry]], which is the context in which fibred categories originally appeared. Fibered categories are used to define [[stack (mathematics)|stack]]s, which are fibered categories (over a site) with "descent". Fibrations also play an important role in categorical semantics of [[type theory]], and in particular that of [[dependent type]] theories.

Fibred categories were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Alexander Grothendieck|first=Alexander|last= Grothendieck|year=1959|year2=1971}}, and developed in more detail by {{harvs|txt|authorlink= Jean Giraud (mathematician)|first=Jean |last=Giraud |year1=1964|year2=1971}}.

==Background and motivations==
There are many examples in [[topology]] and [[geometry]] where some types of objects are considered to exist ''on'' or ''above'' or ''over'' some underlying ''base space''. The classical examples include vector bundles, [[principal bundle]]s and [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] over topological spaces. Another example is given by "families" of [[algebraic varieties]] parametrised by another variety. Typical to these situations is that to a suitable type of a [[map (mathematics)|map]] ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' between base spaces, there is a corresponding ''inverse image'' (also called ''pull-back'') operation ''f&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' taking the considered objects defined on ''Y'' to the same type of objects on ''X''. This is indeed the case in the examples above: for example, the inverse image of a vector bundle ''E'' on ''Y'' is a vector bundle ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') on ''X''.

Moreover, it is often the case that the considered "objects on a base space" form a category, or in other words have maps ([[morphisms]]) between them. In such cases the inverse image operation is often compatible with composition of these maps between objects, or in more technical terms is a [[functor]]. Again, this is the case in examples listed above.

However, it is often the case that if ''g'': ''Y'' → ''Z'' is another map, the inverse image functors are not ''strictly'' compatible with composed maps: if ''z'' is an object ''over'' ''Z'' (a vector bundle, say), it may well be that

: &lt;math&gt; f^*(g^*(z))\neq (g\circ f)^*(z).&lt;/math&gt;

Instead, these inverse images are only [[natural transformation|naturally]] [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. This introduction of some "slack" in the system of inverse images causes some delicate issues to appear, and it is this set-up that fibred categories formalise.

The main application of fibred categories is in [[descent theory]], concerned with a vast generalisation of "glueing" techniques used in topology. In order to support descent theory of sufficient generality to be applied in non-trivial situations in algebraic geometry the definition of fibred categories is quite general and abstract. However, the underlying intuition is quite straightforward when keeping in mind the basic examples discussed above.

==Formal definitions==
There are two essentially equivalent technical definitions of fibred categories, both of which will be described below. All discussion in this section ignores the [[set theory|set-theoretical]] issues related to "large" categories. The discussion can be made completely rigorous by, for example, restricting attention to small categories or by using [[Grothendieck universe|universe]]s.

===Cartesian morphisms and functors===
If φ: ''F'' → ''E'' is a [[functor]] between two [[category (mathematics)|categories]] and ''S'' is an object of ''E'', then the [[subcategory]] of ''F'' consisting of those objects ''x'' for which φ(''x'')=''S'' and those morphisms ''m'' satisfying φ(''m'')=id&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, is called the ''fibre category'' (or ''fibre'') ''over S'', and is denoted ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''. The morphisms of ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' are called ''S-morphisms'', and for ''x'',''y'' objects of ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'', the set of ''S''-morphisms is denoted by Hom&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y''). The image by φ of an object or a morphism in ''F'' is called its ''projection'' (by φ). If f is a morphism of ''E'', then those morphisms of ''F'' that project to ''f'' are called ''f-morphisms'', and the set of ''f''-morphisms between objects ''x'' and ''y'' in ''F'' is denoted by Hom&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y''). A functor φ: ''F'' → ''E'' is also called an ''E-category'', or said to make ''F'' into an ''E''-category or a category ''over'' ''E''. An ''E''-functor from an ''E''-category φ: ''F'' → ''E'' to an ''E''-category ψ: ''G'' → ''E'' is a functor α: ''F'' → ''G'' such that ψ ∘ α = φ. ''E''-categories form in a natural manner a [[2-category]], with 1-morphisms being ''E''-functors, and 2-morphisms being natural transformations between ''E''-functors whose components lie in some fibre.

A morphism ''m'': ''x'' → ''y'' in ''F'' is called ''φ-cartesian'' (or simply ''cartesian'') if it satisfies the following condition:
: if ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' is the projection of ''m'', and if n: ''z'' → ''y'' is an ''f''-morphism, then there is ''precisely one'' ''T''-morphism ''a'': ''z'' → ''x'' such that ''n'' = ''m ∘ a''.
A cartesian morphism ''m'': ''x'' → ''y'' is called an ''inverse image'' of its projection ''f'' = φ(''m''); the object ''x'' is called an ''inverse image'' of ''y'' ''by f''.

The cartesian morphisms of a fibre category ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' are precisely the isomorphisms of ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''. There can in general be more than one cartesian morphism projecting to a given morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'', possibly having different sources; thus there can be more than one inverse image of a given object ''y'' in ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' by ''f''.  However, it is a direct consequence of the definition that two such inverse images are isomorphic in ''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''.

An ''E''-functor between two ''E''-categories is called a ''cartesian functor'' if it takes cartesian morphisms to cartesian morphisms. Cartesian functors between two ''E''-categories ''F'',''G'' form a category Cart&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G''), with [[natural transformations]] as morphisms. A special case is provided by considering ''E'' as an ''E''-category via the identity functor: then a cartesian functor from ''E'' to an ''E''-category ''F'' is called a ''cartesian section''. Thus a cartesian section consists of a choice of one object ''x&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each object ''S'' in ''E'', and for each morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' a choice of an inverse image ''m&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'': ''x&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''x&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''. A cartesian section is thus a (strictly) compatible system of inverse images over objects of ''E''. The category of cartesian sections of ''F'' is denoted by

: &lt;math&gt;\underset{\longleftarrow}{\mathrm{Lim}} (F/E) = \mathrm{Cart}_E(E,F).&lt;/math&gt;

In the important case where ''E'' has a [[Initial object|terminal object]] ''e'' (thus in particular when ''E'' is a [[topos]] or the category ''E&lt;sub&gt;/S&lt;/sub&gt;'' of [[slice category|arrows]] with target ''S'' in ''E'') the functor

: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\colon\underset{\longleftarrow}{\mathrm{Lim}} (F/E) \to F_e,\qquad s\mapsto s(e)&lt;/math&gt;

is [[full and faithful functors|fully faithful]] (Lemma 5.7 of Giraud (1964)).

===Fibred categories and cleaved categories===
The technically most flexible and economical definition of fibred categories is based on the concept of cartesian morphisms. It is equivalent to a definition in terms of ''[[cleavage (mathematics)|cleavages]]'', the latter definition being actually the original one presented in Grothendieck (1959); the definition in terms of cartesian morphisms was introduced in Grothendieck (1971) in 1960–1961.

An ''E'' category φ: ''F'' → ''E'' is a ''fibred category'' (or a ''fibred E-category'', or a ''category fibred over E'') if each morphism ''f'' of ''E'' whose codomain is in the range of projection has at least one inverse image, and moreover the composition ''m ∘ n'' of any two cartesian morphisms ''m'',''n'' in ''F'' is always cartesian. In other words, an ''E''-category is a fibred category if inverse images always exist (for morphisms whose codomains are in the range of projection) and are ''transitive''.

If ''E'' has a terminal object ''e'' and if ''F'' is fibred over ''E'', then the functor ε from cartesian sections to ''F&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' defined at the end of the previous section is an [[equivalence of categories]] and moreover [[surjection|surjective]] on objects.

If ''F'' is a fibred ''E''-category, it is always possible, for each morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' in ''E'' and each object ''y'' in ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'', to choose (by using the [[axiom of choice]]) precisely one inverse image ''m'': ''x'' → ''y''. The class of morphisms thus selected is called a ''cleavage'' and the selected morphisms are called the ''transport morphisms'' (of the cleavage). A fibred category together with a cleavage is called a ''cleaved category''. A cleavage is called ''normalised'' if the transport morphisms include all identities in ''F''; this means that the inverse images of identity morphisms are chosen to be identity morphisms. Evidently if a cleavage exists, it can be chosen to be normalised; we shall consider only normalised cleavages below.

The choice of a (normalised) cleavage for a fibred ''E''-category ''F'' specifies, for each morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' in ''E'', a ''functor'' ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'': on objects ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is simply the inverse image by the corresponding transport morphism, and on morphisms it is defined in a natural manner by the defining universal property of cartesian morphisms. The operation which associates to an object ''S'' of ''E'' the fibre category ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' and to a morphism ''f'' the ''inverse image functor'' ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is ''almost'' a contravariant functor from ''E'' to the category of categories. However, in general it fails to commute strictly with composition of morphisms. Instead, if ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' and ''g'': ''U'' → ''T'' are morphisms in ''E'', then there is an isomorphism of functors
:&lt;math&gt; c_{f,g}\colon  \quad g^*f^* \to (f \circ g)^*.&lt;/math&gt;
These isomorphisms satisfy the following two compatibilities:
# &lt;math&gt;c_{f,\mathrm{id}_T} = c_{\mathrm{id}_S,f} = \mathrm{id}_{f^*}&lt;/math&gt;
# for three consecutive morphisms &lt;math&gt;h,g,f\colon\quad V \to U \to T \to S&lt;/math&gt; and object &lt;math&gt;x\in F_S&lt;/math&gt; the following holds: &lt;math&gt;c_{f,g\circ h} \cdot c_{g,h}(f^*(x)) = c_{f\circ g, h}(x)\cdot h^*(c_{f,g}(x)).&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown (see Grothendieck (1971) section 8) that, inversely, any collection of functors ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; → ''F''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; together with isomorphisms ''c''&lt;sub&gt;f,g&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying the compatibilities above, defines a cleaved category. These collections of inverse image functors provide a more intuitive view on fibred categories; and indeed, it was in terms of such compatible inverse image functors that fibred categories were introduced in Grothendieck (1959).

The paper by Gray referred to below makes analogies between these ideas and the notion of  [[fibration]] of spaces.

These ideas simplify in the case of [[groupoids]], as shown in the paper of Brown referred to below, which obtains a useful family of exact sequences from a fibration of groupoids.

===Splittings and split fibred categories===
A (normalised) cleavage such that the composition of two transport morphisms is always a transport morphism is called a ''splitting'', and a fibred category with a splitting is called a ''split'' (fibred) ''category''. In terms of inverse image functors the condition of being a splitting means that the composition of inverse image functors corresponding to composable morphisms ''f,g'' in ''E'' ''equals'' the inverse image functor corresponding to ''f ∘ g''. In other words, the compatibility isomorphisms ''c&lt;sub&gt;f,g&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the previous section are all identities for a split category. Thus split ''E''-categories correspond exactly to true functors from ''E'' to the category of categories.

Unlike cleavages, not all fibred categories admit splittings. For an example, see [[#Examples|below]].

===Co-cartesian morphisms and co-fibred categories===
One can invert the direction of arrows in the definitions above to arrive at corresponding concepts of co-cartesian morphisms, co-fibred categories and split co-fibred categories (or co-split categories). More precisely, if φ: ''F'' →''E'' is a functor, then a morphism ''m'': ''x'' → ''y'' in ''F'' is called ''co-cartesian'' if it is cartesian for the [[opposite functor]] φ&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;: ''F''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; → ''E''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''m'' is also called a ''direct image'' and ''y'' a direct image of ''x'' for ''f'' = φ(''m''). A ''co-fibred'' ''E''-category is an''E''-category such that direct image exists for each morphism in ''E'' and that the composition of direct images is a direct image. A ''co-cleavage'' and a ''co-splitting'' are defined similarly, corresponding to ''direct image functors'' instead of inverse image functors.

==Properties==

===The 2-categories of fibred categories and split categories===
The categories fibred over a fixed category ''E'' form a 2-category '''Fib'''(''E''), where the ''category'' of morphisms between two fibred categories ''F'' and ''G'' is defined to be the category Cart&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G'') of cartesian functors from ''F'' to ''G''.

Similarly the split categories over ''E'' form a 2-category '''Scin'''(''E'') (from French ''catégorie scindée''), where the category of morphisms between two split categories ''F'' and ''G'' is the full sub-category Scin&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G'') of ''E''-functors from ''F'' to ''G'' consisting of those functors that transform each transport morphism of ''F'' into a transport morphism of ''G''. Each such ''morphism of split E-categories'' is also a morphism of ''E''-fibred categories, i.e., Scin&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G'') ⊂ Cart&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G'').

There is a natural forgetful 2-functor ''i'': '''Scin'''(''E'') → '''Fib'''(''E'') that simply forgets the splitting.

===Existence of equivalent split categories===
While not all fibred categories admit a splitting, each fibred category is in fact ''equivalent'' to a split category. Indeed, there are two canonical ways to construct an equivalent split category for a given fibred category ''F'' over ''E''. More precisely, the forgetful 2-functor ''i'': '''Scin'''(''E'') → '''Fib'''(''E'') admits a right 2-adjoint ''S'' and a left 2-adjoint ''L'' (Theorems 2.4.2 and 2.4.4 of Giraud 1971), and ''S''(''F'') and ''L''(''F'') are the two associated split categories. The adjunction functors ''S''(''F'') →  ''F'' and  ''F'' → ''L''(''F'') are both cartesian and equivalences (''ibid''.). However, while their composition ''S''(''F'') → ''L''(''F'') is an equivalence (of categories, and indeed of fibred categories), it is ''not'' in general a morphism of split categories. Thus the two constructions differ in general. The two preceding constructions of split categories are used in a critical way in the construction of the [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] associated to a fibred category (and in particular stack associated to a [[pre-stack]]).

==Examples==
# The functor ''Ob '': '''Cat'''→'''Set''', sending a category to its set of objects, is a fibration. For a set ''S'', the fiber consists of categories ''C'' with ''Ob(C)=S''. The cartesian arrows are the fully faithful functors.
# '''Categories of arrows''': For any category ''E'' the ''category of arrows'' A(''E'') in ''E'' has as objects the morphisms in ''E'', and as morphisms the commutative squares in ''E'' (more precisely, a morphism from (''f'': ''X'' → ''T'') to (''g'': ''Y'' → ''S'') consists of morphisms (''a'': ''X'' → ''Y'') and (''b'': ''T'' → ''S'') such that ''bf = ga''). The functor which takes an arrow to its target makes A(''E'') into an ''E''-category; for an object ''S'' of ''E'' the fibre ''E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the category ''E&lt;sub&gt;/S&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''S''-objects in ''E'', i.e., arrows in ''E'' with target ''S''. Cartesian morphisms in A(''E'') are precisely the [[Cartesian square (category theory)|cartesian square]]s in ''E'', and thus A(''E'') is fibred over ''E'' precisely when  [[fibre product]]s exist in ''E''.
# '''Fibre bundles''': Fibre products exist in the category ''Top'' of [[topological space]]s and thus by the previous example A(''Top'') is fibred over ''Top''. If ''Fib'' is the full subcategory of A(''Top'') consisting of arrows that are projection maps of [[fibre bundle]]s, then ''Fib&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the category of fibre bundles on ''S'' and ''Fib'' is fibred over ''Top''. A choice of a cleavage amounts to a choice of ordinary inverse image (or ''pull-back'') functors for fibre bundles.
# '''Vector bundles''': In a manner similar to the previous examples the projections (''p'': ''V'' → ''S'') of real (complex)  [[vector bundles]] to their base spaces form a category ''Vect''&lt;sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sub&gt; (''Vect''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;) over ''Top'' (morphisms of vector bundles respecting the [[vector space]] structure of the fibres). This ''Top''-category is also fibred, and the inverse image functors are the ordinary ''pull-back'' functors for vector bundles. These fibred categories are (non-full) subcategories of ''Fib''.
# '''Sheaves on topological spaces''': The inverse image functors of [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] make the categories Sh(''S'') of sheaves on topological spaces ''S'' into a (cleaved) fibred category ''Sh'' over ''Top''. This fibred category can be described as the full sub-category of A(''Top'') consisting of [[etale space]]s of sheaves. As with vector bundles, the sheaves of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] also form fibred categories of ''Top''.
# '''Sheaves on topoi''': If ''E'' is a [[topos]] and ''S'' is an object in ''E'', the category ''E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''S''-objects is also a topos, interpreted as the category of sheaves on ''S''. If ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' is a morphism in ''E'', the inverse image functor ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; can be described as follows: for a sheaf ''F'' on ''E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' and an object ''p'': ''U'' → ''T''  in ''E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' one has ''f&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;F''(''U'') = Hom&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U'', ''f&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;F'') equals Hom&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f ∘ p'', ''F'') = ''F''(''U''). These inverse image make the categories ''E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' into a ''split'' fibred category on ''E''. This can be applied in particular to the "large" topos ''TOP'' of topological spaces.
# '''Quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes''': [[Quasi-coherent sheaf|Quasi-coherent sheaves]] form a fibred category over the category of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. This is one of the motivating examples for the definition of fibred categories.
# '''Fibred category admitting no splitting''': A group ''G'' can be considered as a category with one object and the elements of ''G'' as the morphisms, composition of morphisms being given by the group law. A group [[homomorphism]] ''f'': ''G'' → ''H'' can then be considered as a functor, which makes ''G'' into a ''H''-category. It can be checked that in this set-up all morphisms in ''G'' are cartesian; hence ''G'' is fibred over ''H'' precisely when ''f'' is surjective. A splitting in this setup is a (set-theoretic) [[section (category theory)|section]] of ''f'' which commutes strictly with composition, or in other words a section of ''f'' which is also a homomorphism. But as is well known in [[group theory]], this is not always possible (one can take the projection in a non-split [[group extension]]).
# '''Co-fibred category of sheaves''': The [[direct image]] functor of sheaves makes the categories of sheaves on topological spaces into a co-fibred category. The transitivity of the direct image shows that this is even naturally co-split.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8018">'''Finitism''' is a [[philosophy of mathematics]] that accepts the existence only of [[finite set|finite]] [[mathematical object]]s. It is best understood in comparison to the mainstream philosophy of mathematics where infinite mathematical objects (e.g., [[infinite set]]s) are accepted as legitimate.

== Main idea ==
The main idea of finitistic mathematics is not accepting the existence of infinite objects such as infinite sets. While all natural numbers are accepted as existing, the set of all natural numbers is not considered to exist as a mathematical object. Therefore [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]] over infinite domains is not considered meaningful. The mathematical theory often associated with finitism is [[Thoralf Skolem]]'s [[primitive recursive arithmetic]].

== History ==
The introduction of infinite mathematical objects occurred a few centuries ago when the use of infinite objects was already a controversial topic among mathematicians. The issue entered a new phase when [[Georg Cantor]] in 1874 introduced what is now called [[naive set theory]] and used it as a base for his work on [[transfinite numbers]]. When paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]], [[Berry's paradox]] and the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] were discovered in Cantor's naive set theory, the issue became a heated topic among mathematicians.

There were various positions taken by mathematicians. All agreed about finite mathematical objects such as natural numbers. However there were disagreements regarding infinite mathematical objects. 
One position was the [[intuitionistic mathematics]] that was advocated by [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], which rejected the existence of infinite objects until they are constructed.

Another position was endorsed by [[David Hilbert]]: finite mathematical objects are concrete objects, infinite mathematical objects are ideal objects, and accepting ideal mathematical objects does not cause a problem regarding finite mathematical objects. More formally, Hilbert believed that it is possible to show that any theorem about finite mathematical objects that can be obtained using ideal infinite objects can be also obtained without them. Therefore allowing infinite mathematical objects would not cause a problem regarding finite objects. This led to [[Hilbert's program]] of proving consistency of set theory using finitistic means as this would imply that adding ideal mathematical objects is conservative over the finitistic part. Hilbert's views are also associated with [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist philosophy of mathematics]]. Hilbert's goal of proving the consistency of set theory or even arithmetic through finitistic means turned out to be an impossible task due to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorems]]. However, by [[Harvey Friedman]]'s [[Elementary function arithmetic#Friedman.27s grand conjecture|grand conjecture]] most mathematical results should be provable using finitistic means.

Hilbert did not give a rigorous explanation of what he considered finitistic and refer to as elementary. However, based on his work with [[Paul Bernays]] some experts such as [[William W. Tait|William Tait]] have argued that the [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] can be considered an upper bound on what Hilbert considered finitistic mathematics.

In the years following Gödel's theorems, as it became clear that there is no hope of proving consistency of mathematics, and with development of [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]] such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and the lack of any evidence against its consistency, most mathematicians lost interest in the topic. Today most classical mathematicians are considered [[Platonist]] and readily use infinite mathematical objects and a set-theoretical universe.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

== Classical finitism vs. strict finitism ==
In her book ''Philosophy of Set Theory'', [[Mary Tiles]] characterized those who allow ''potentially infinite'' objects as '''classical finitists''', and those who do not allow potentially infinite objects as '''strict finitists''': for example, a classical finitist would allow statements such as "every natural number has a [[successor function|successor]]" and would accept the meaningfulness of infinite [[series (mathematics)|series]] in the sense of limits of finite partial sums, while a strict finitist would not. Historically, the [[recorded history|written history]] of mathematics was thus classically finitist until Cantor discovered the hierarchy of [[transfinite number|transfinite]] [[cardinal number|cardinals]] at the end of the 19th century.

== Views regarding infinite mathematical objects ==
[[Leopold Kronecker]] remained a strident opponent to Cantor's set theory:&lt;ref&gt;Eriksson, K., Estep D., and Johnson C. ''Applied Mathematics: Body and Soul''. Volume 1. Springer, 2004, p. 230-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

|God created the natural numbers; all else is the work of man.&lt;ref&gt;
From an 1886 lecture at the  'Berliner Naturforscher-Versammlung', according to [[H. M. Weber]]'s memorial article, [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN37721857X_0002&amp;DMDID=dmdlog6 ''Leopold Kronecker'', in Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung, Vol. 2 1891-92]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Reuben Goodstein]] is another proponent of finitism.  Some of his work involved building up to [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] from finitist foundations.

Although he denied it, much of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writing on mathematics has a strong affinity with finitism.

If finitists are contrasted with [[Transfinite number|transfinitists]] (proponents of e.g. [[Georg Cantor]]'s hierarchy of infinities), then also [[Aristotle]] may be characterized as a strict finitist. Aristotle especially promoted the [[potential infinity]] as a middle option between strict finitism and [[actual infinity]] (the latter being an actualization of something never-ending in nature, in contrast with the Cantorist actual infinity consisting of the transfinite [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[ordinal number|ordinal]] numbers, which have nothing to do with the things in nature):

{{quote
|But on the other hand to suppose that the infinite does not exist in any way leads obviously to many impossible consequences: there will be a beginning and end of time, a magnitude will not be divisible into magnitudes, number will not be infinite. If, then, in view of the above considerations, neither alternative seems possible, an arbiter must be called in.
|Aristotle, Physics, Book 3, Chapter 6}}

== Other related philosophies of mathematics ==
'''[[Ultrafinitism]]''' (also known as '''ultraintuitionism''') has an even more conservative attitude towards mathematical objects than finitism, and has objections to the existence of finite mathematical objects when they are too large.

Towards the end of the 20th century [[John Penn Mayberry]] developed a system of finitary mathematics which he called "Euclidean Arithmetic". The most striking tenet of his system is a complete and rigorous rejection of the special foundational status normally accorded to iterative processes, including in particular the construction of the natural numbers by the iteration "+1". Consequently Mayberry is in sharp dissent from those who would seek to equate finitary mathematics with Peano Arithmetic or any of its fragments such as [[primitive recursive arithmetic]].

== Freud ==
In ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' (1905), Freud distinguished the fixations of the libido on an incestuous object from a fixation upon a specific, partial ''aim'', such as [[voyeurism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (Penguin Freud Library 7) pp.&amp;nbsp;68–70 and p.&amp;nbsp;151&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud theorized that some humans may develop psychological fixation due to one or more of the following:
#A lack of proper gratification during one of the [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual stages of development]].
#Receiving a strong impression from one of these stages, in which case the person's personality would reflect that stage throughout adult life.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Sexuality'' p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;
#"An excessively strong manifestation of these instincts at a very early age [which] leads to a kind of partial ''fixation'', which then constitutes a weak point in the structure of the sexual function".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1995) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

As Freud's thought developed, so did the range of possible 'fixation points' he saw as significant in producing particular neuroses.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Note", Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Penguin Freud Library 10) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continued to view fixation as "the manifestation of very early linkages – linkages which it is hard to resolve – between instincts and impressions and the objects involved in those impressions".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Psychopathology'' pp. 137–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalytic [[therapy]] involved producing a new [[transference]] fixation in place of the old one.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fink, ''A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (Harvard 1999) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The new fixation – for example a father-transference onto the analyst – may be very different from the old, but will absorb its energies and enable them eventually to be released for non-fixated purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin Freud Library 1) p. 509&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objections===
*Whether a particularly obsessive attachment is a fixation or a defensible expression of [[love]] is at times debatable. Fixation to intangibles (i.e., ideas, ideologies, etc.) can also occur. The obsessive factor of fixation is also found in symptoms pertaining to [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], which psychoanalysts linked to a mix of early (pregenital) frustrations and gratifications.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fixation has been compared to [[Imprinting (psychology)|psychological imprinting]]&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; at an early and sensitive period of development.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Gregory ed, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; others object that Freud was attempting to stress the looseness of the ties between libido and object, and the need to find a specific cause any given (perverse or neurotic) fixation.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Mitchell, ''Relational Concepts in Psychoanalysis'' (1988) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Freudians ==
[[Melanie Klein]] saw fixation as inherently pathological&lt;ref&gt;C. Geissmann-Chambon/P. Geissmann, ''A History of Child Psychoanalysis'' (Routledge 1998) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; – a blocking of potential [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] by way of [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyndsey Stonebridge/John Phillips, ''Reading Melanie Klein'' (1998) p. 243n&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik H. Erikson]] distinguished fixation to zone – oral or anal, for example – from fixation to mode, such as taking in, as with his instance of the man who "may eagerly absorb the 'milk of wisdom' where he once desired more tangible fluids from more sensuous containers".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Penguin 1973) p. 72 and p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eric Berne]], developed his insight further as part of [[transactional analysis]], suggesting that "particular games and scripts, and their accompanying physical symptoms, are based in appropriate zones and modes".&lt;ref&gt;Erik Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (Corgi 1975) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Kohut]] saw the [[Grandiosity|grandiose self]] as a fixation upon a normal childhood stage;&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; while other [[post-Freudian]]s explored the role of fixation in aggression and criminality.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Brunas-Wagstaff, ''Personality: A Cognitive Approach'' (1998) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Coleridge's ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]'' has been seen as using witchcraft as a vehicle to explore psychological fixation.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Samuel Taylor Coleridge'' (2010) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tennyson]] has been considered to show a [[Romanticism|romantic]] fixation on days of old.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Ledbetter, ''Tennyson and Victorian Periodicals'' (2007) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

"'''For Want of a Nail'''" is a [[proverb]], having numerous variations over several centuries, reminding that seemingly unimportant acts or omissions can have grave and unforeseen consequences.

== Analysis ==
{{quote box|border=1px|align=right|title=''"Knight" Variation''|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
For want of a nail the shoe was lost,
for want of a shoe the horse was lost,
for want of a horse the knight was lost,
for want of a knight the battle was lost,
for want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
So a kingdom was lost&amp;mdash;all for want of a nail.&lt;/poem&gt;|source=
''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' ''DC Comics, 1998''}}

The proverb has come down in many variations over the centuries. It describes a situation in which a failure to anticipate or correct some initially small dysfunction leads by successively more critical stages to an egregious outcome. The rhyme's implied small difference in initial conditions is the lack of a spare [[horseshoe]] [[Nail (fastener)|nail]], relative to a condition of its availability.&lt;ref name=everything.com/&gt; At a more literal level, it expresses the importance of [[military logistics]] in warfare.

Such chains of [[causality]] are perceived only in [[hindsight]]. No one ever lamented, upon seeing his unshod horse, that the kingdom would eventually fall because of it.&lt;ref name=everything.com&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1097943 For want of a nail @ Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Related sayings are is "A stitch, in time, saves nine" and "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure". A somewhat similar idea is referred to in the [[metaphor]] known as [[camel's nose|the camel's nose]].

**"Cases of this kind have always been found to be very difficult to deal with, beginning with a case said to have been decided about two centuries and a half ago, where a man going to be married to an heiress, his horse having cast a shoe on the journey, employed a blacksmith to replace it, who did the work so unskilfully that the horse was lamed, and, the rider not arriving in time, the lady married another; and the blacksmith was held liable for the loss of the marriage. The question is a very serious one; and we should inevitably fall into a similar absurdity unless we applied the rules of common sense to restrict the extent of liability for the breach of contract of this sort."
*‘Don't care’ was the man who was to blame for the well-known catastrophe: ‘For want of a nail the shoe was lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost, and for want of a horse the man was lost.’ (1880 [[Samuel Smiles]], Duty)&lt;ref name=answers.com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Smiles |first1=Samuel|authorlink1=Samuel Smiles |title=Duty : with illustrations of courage, patience, &amp; endurance |url=https://books.google.com/books?q=samuel+smiles+duty&amp;oq=samuel+smiles+du |accessdate=2 April 2010 | year=1880 |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Benjamin Franklin]] included a version of the rhyme in his ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]''.

A Horse! My Kingdom for a Horse!", as depicted in Act V, Scene 4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r3.org/bookcase/shaksper/act5.html#scene4 Richard III, Act V, Scene 4, from the Richard III society] (Retrieved 20100319)&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Shakespeare]] play [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]].

== Modern references ==
{{in popular culture|date=January 2017}}

Along with  the long history of the proverb listed above, it has continued to be referenced since the mid 20th century in modern culture.  Examples include:

=== Legal ===

*In his dissent in ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]'' (549 US 497, 2007), Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] cites "all for the want of a horseshoe nail" as an example of a ''possible'' chain of causation.  He claimed that, by contrast, the threshold jurisdictional issue of standing requires a ''likely'' chain of causation, which was not satisfied by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s regulation of new automobile emissions to prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;''Massachusetts v. E.P.A.'', 549 U.S. 497, 546 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his dissent in ''[[CSX Transportation, Inc. v. McBride]]'', Roberts again invokes the proverb, explaining that, in [[tort|tort law]], the doctrine of [[proximate cause]] is meant to "limit[] liability at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of the kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-235.pdf ''CSX Transportation, Inc. v. McBride''], No. 10-235 (U.S. 17 June 2011) (slip op., at 3) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

For want of a shoe the horse was lost, and all that." Stephen King's 1987 novel, ''The Tommyknockers'' also references the proverb in its first line: "For want of a nail the kingdom was lost&amp;nbsp;– that's how the catechism goes when you boil it down."
*''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' is a three-issue comic book limited series published by [[DC Comics]] in 1998 about a world where the baby Kal-El was never found by [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Ma and Pa Kent]] because a nail punctured their truck tire on the day when they would have found his ship; thus the child does not grow up to become [[Superman]].  This story uses the English ("[[Knight]]") variation of the rhyme as a theme.
*''[[A Wind in the Door]]'' is a fantasy/science fiction novel by [[Madeleine L'Engle]] which was a sequel to ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]''.

'The Want of a Nail"&lt;/poem&gt;|source= – T. Rundgren&lt;br&gt;''Warner Chappell N.A., Ltd., 1989''}}
* [[Todd Rundgren]]'s song [["The Want of a Nail"]] from his album ''[[Nearly Human]]'' uses the rhyme as a metaphor for a man who has lived his entire life without love, and how, if you "multiply it a billion times" and "spread it all over the world," things fall apart. A cover of Rundgren's version is also used in the 2003 film ''[[Camp (2003 film)|Camp]]'' as the cast is introduced at the end of the film.
* [[Aesop Rock]]'s song "No City" from his album ''[[None Shall Pass]]'' samples a voice reading the proverb, setting the tone for the idiosyncratic rap.

The episode's concept itself is also based on the proverb, with the character of [[Hawkeye Pierce|Hawkeye]] going through a convoluted process involving several camp personnel, in order to get a new boot.
* In the movie ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'', the proverb was used by Kamata (Sonny Chiba) to explain to his nephew the result of a small detail being overlooked.
* In the movie ''[[Father Goose (film)|Father Goose]]'', Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard) in his first scene of the movie, while talking to an Admiral on the telephone, uses part of the proverb by saying "For want of a nail, the war was..." in reference to finding an additional coastal plane spotter.
* In the episode of USA's ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', "[[List of Monk episodes#Season 5: 2006–2007|Mr. Monk at Your Service]]",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0946426/ Mr. Monk at Your Service] (Retrieved 20090401)&lt;/ref&gt; Monk quotes the proverb after being challenged by an employee that suggest a fork being a centimeter off center wasn't a problem. Monk: "For the want of a nail, the kingdom was lost."
* In the 1982 movie ''[[The Verdict]]'', Ed Concannon (James Mason) uses the proverb, "for want of a shoe the horse was lost" to his disciples to describe what the case has become after Frank Galvin turned down the settlement.
* The entire proverbial rhyme is recited by the character Abraham Farlan in the 1946 motion picture ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]''. Here it was used to describe the chain of circumstances which formed the life of the main character, Peter Carter.
* In season two, episode three of the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', while trying to repair the timer device in a world crippled by 'anti-technology' Professor Arturo exclaims, "For want of a shoe the war was lost."
* In the 50th episode of ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Dead or Alive]]'', Man On Horseback, Josh Randall, [[Steve McQueen]]'s character, uses the proverb "''For the want of a nail, they lost the shoe. For the want of a shoe, they lost the horse. For the want of a horse, they lost the rider''" to justify the reason why he is taking with him four extra horseshoes.
* In the 1967 [[Mannix]] episode 'Turn Every Stone,' Joe Mannix alludes to the saying at  the end when he says, "It's the old horseshoe-nail bit again. For want of $10,000, a million was lost."
* In the 1954 movie ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'', Captain Queeg ([[Bogart]]) refers to the proverb during the following conversation with Ensign Keith after he reprimanded him for failing to enforce the untucked shirt-tails rule. "I know a man's shirt's a petty detail, but big things are made up of details. Don't forget, 'For want of a nail, a horseshoe was lost and then the whole battle.' A captain's job is a lonely one. He's easily misunderstood. Forget that I bawled you out."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1294">In [[moral philosophy|moral]] and [[legal philosophy]], there exists a distinction between the concepts of [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and [[licence]]. The former deals with the rights of the individual; the latter covers the expressed permission (or lack thereof) for more than one individual to engage in an activity.&lt;!--*"I define license as interfering with another's freedom." ---AS Neill.--&gt;

As a result, freedoms usually include rights which are usually recognized (often, not always, in an unconditional manner) by the government (and access to which is theoretically enforced against any and all interferences). Licenses, on the other hand, are distributed to individuals who make use of a specific item, expressing the permission to use the item or service under specified, conditional terms and boundaries of usage.

'''Fruit of the poisonous tree''' is a legal metaphor in the United States used to describe [[evidence]] that is obtained illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Criminal Procedure|last=Dressler|first=Joshua|authorlink=|year=2002|edition=3rd|publisher=LexisNexis|location=Newark, NJ|isbn=0-8205-5405-7|pages=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of the terminology is that if the source (the "tree") of the evidence or evidence itself is tainted, then anything gained (the "fruit") from it is tainted as well.

==History==
The doctrine underlying the name was first described in ''[[Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States]]'', 251 U.S. 385 (1920).&lt;ref&gt;''Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States'', 251 U.S. 385 (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fruit+of+a+poisonous+tree |title=Fruit of a poisonous tree legal definition of Fruit of a poisonous tree.

United States]]'' (1939).

Such evidence is not generally admissible in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaines|first=Larry|authorlink=|author2=Miller, LeRoy|title=Criminal Justice In Action: The Core |year=2006|publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]]|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0-495-00305-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a police officer conducted an unconstitutional ([[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]) search of a home and obtained a key to a train station locker, and evidence of a crime came from the locker, that evidence would most likely be excluded under the fruit of the poisonous tree [[legal doctrine]].  The testimony of a witness who is discovered through illegal means would not necessarily be excluded, however, {{citation needed span|text=due to the "attenuation doctrine"|date=March 2018}}, which allows certain evidence or testimony to be admitted in court if the link between the illegal police conduct and the resulting evidence or testimony is sufficiently attenuated.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  It is believed{{by whom|date=March 2018}} that a witness who freely and voluntarily testifies is enough of an independent intervening factor to sufficiently "attenuate" the connection between the government's illegal discovery of the witness and the witness's voluntary testimony itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  (''United States v. Ceccolini'', 435 U.S. 268 (1978))

The "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine is an extension of the [[exclusionary rule]], which, subject to some exceptions, prevents evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment from being admitted in a criminal trial.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Like the exclusionary rule, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is intended to deter police from using illegal means to obtain evidence.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The doctrine is subject to four main exceptions.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The tainted evidence is admissible if:
# it was discovered in part as a result of an independent, untainted source; or
# [[Inevitable discovery|it would inevitably have been discovered despite the tainted source]]; or
# the chain of causation between the illegal action and the tainted evidence is too attenuated; or
# the search warrant was not found to be valid based on [[probable cause]], but was executed by government agents in good faith (called the [[good-faith exception]]).

This doctrine was also used by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in ''[[Gäfgen v. Germany]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In certain cases continental European countries have similar laws (e.g. in cases of torture), while the doctrine itself is generally not known.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Illegally obtained evidence is used by the courts to ensure that the judgment is factually correct, however the person obtaining the illegal evidence typically faces independent consequences.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

The protests were inspired by '''Vida Movahed''' ({{lang-fa|ویدا موحد}}), an Iranian woman known as the '''Girl of Enghelab Street''' ({{lang-fa|دختر خیابان انقلاب}}), who stood in the crowd on a utility box in the [[Enqelab Street|Enghelab Street]] (Revolution Street) of [[Tehran]] on 28 December 2017, tied her hijab, a white headscarf, to a stick, and waved it to the crowd as a flag.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="albawaba.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com_1"/&gt; She was arrested on that day&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com_1"/&gt; and was released temporary on bail&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com_1"/&gt; a month later, on 28 January 2018.&lt;ref name="NasrinSotoudeh_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk_1"/&gt; Some people believe that Movahed's action was based on [[Masih Alinejad]]'s call for [[White Wednesdays]], a protest movement that the presenter at [[VOA-PNN|VOA Persian Television]] started in early 2017.&lt;ref name="globalvoices.org_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl.org_2"/&gt; Other women later re-enacted her protest and posted photos of their actions on social media.

== Islamic Republic's Penal Code ==
{{see|Theocracy#Iran}}
In the Islamic law of Iran imposed shortly after the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic revolution]], article 638 of 5th book of Islamic Penal Code (called Sanctions and deterrent penalties) women who do not wear a hijab may be imprisoned from ten days to two months, and/or required to pay fines from 50,000 up to 500,000 [[Iranian rial|rials]].&lt;ref name="thesun.co.uk_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="article_638_iran_law"/&gt; Fines are recalculated in the courts as the value of Iranian rials drops every year since 1979.

Article 639 of the same book says, two type of people shall be sentenced to one year to 10 years imprisonment, first a person who establishes or directs a place of immorality or prostitution, second a person who facilitates or encourages people to commit immorality or prostitution.&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="article_639_iran_law"/&gt;

These are some of the laws under which some protesters were charged.&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rudaw.net_1"/&gt;

== Background ==
Before the [[Iranian Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 (during the reign of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of Iran) the hijab was not compulsory,&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; though some Iranian women during this period wore headscarfs or [[chador]].&lt;ref name="Abrahamian"/&gt;

After the 1979 Islamic revolution, the hijab gradually became compulsory.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt; In 1979, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] announced that women should observe Islamic dress code;&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Algar84/&gt; His statement sparked demonstrations, which were met by government assurances that the statement was only a recommendation.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Algar84/&gt; Hijab was subsequently made mandatory in government and public offices in 1980, and in 1983 it became mandatory for all women.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;

In 2018, a government run survey dating back to 2014, was released by President [[Hassan Rouhani]], showing that 49.8% of Iranians were against compulsory or mandatory hijab.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com_1"/&gt; The report was released by the [[Center for Strategic Studies]], the research arm of the Iranian President's office, and was titled "Report of the first hijab special meeting" on July 2014 in a PDF format.&lt;ref name="css.ir_1"/&gt;

On 2 February 2018 a poll conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) showed that a few Iranians agreed with "changing Iran's political system or relaxing strict Islamic law".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Adam|title=Most Iranians feel Trump’s comments in support of protesters didn’t help, poll finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/02/most-iranians-feel-trumps-comments-in-support-of-protesters-didnt-help-poll-finds/|website=washingtonpost|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran is the only country in the world that requires non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf.&lt;ref name="firstpost.com_1"/&gt; For example, in January 2018, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] female musician was forcibly veiled in the middle of her concert performance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.albawaba.com/loop/chinese-musician-humiliated-iran-hijab-imposed-mid-performance-1074470&lt;/ref&gt;

 | footer = The gender of God in Hinduism is sometimes visualized as a male god such as [[Krishna]] (left), or female goddess such as [[Lakshmi]] (middle), androgynous such as [[Ardhanarishvara]] (a composite of [[Shiva|Siva or Shiva]] - male - and [[Parvati]] - female) (right), or as formless and genderless [[Brahman]] (Universal Absolute, Supreme Self as Oneness in everyone).

 }}
In [[Hinduism]], there are diverse approaches to conceptualizing [[Gender of God|God and gender]]. Many Hindus focus upon impersonal [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] ([[Brahman]]) which is genderless. Other Hindu traditions conceive God as androgynous (both female and male), alternatively as either male or female, while cherishing gender [[henotheism]], that is without denying the existence of other Gods in either gender.&lt;ref&gt;John Renard (1999), Responses to 101 Questions on Hinduism, Paulist, {{ISBN|978-0809138456}}, pages 74-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|9XC9bwMMPcwC|What is Hinduism?|page=PR17}}, Hinduism Today, Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shakti]] tradition conceives of God as a female. Other [[Bhakti]] traditions of Hinduism have both male and female gods. In ancient and medieval Indian mythology, each masculine [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] of the Hindu pantheon is partnered with a feminine who is often a [[devi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adishakti.org/forum/concept_of_shakti_hinduism_as_a_liberating_force_for_women_1-18-2005.htm The Concept of Shakti: Hinduism as a Liberating Force for Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Hinduism}}
Male and female deities are extensively mentioned in the Vedas. The earliest ''mandalas'' ("Books"; the authorship of each ''mandala'' is traditionally ascribed to a particular ''[[rishi]]'' or that ''rishi'''s family) of the [[Rigveda]], estimated to have been composed sometime in the 2nd millennium BCE, invoke and praise both gods and goddesses. ''[[Ushas]]'' ("Goddess of Dawns") is praised in twenty Hymns of Chapters VI.64, VI.65, VII.78 and X.172, with Hymn VI.64.5 declaring goddess Ushas as the one who must be worshipped first.&lt;ref name=davidk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rigvedasanhitac00websgoog#page/n19/mode/2up Rigveda] Hymn VI.64.5, HH Wilson (Translator), Trubner &amp; Co London, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
'''Hymn to Ushas''' (Abridged):&lt;br&gt;
The shining tints of the Dawn have spread like the waves of the waters,&lt;br&gt;
Beautifying the world, she renders all good roads easy to traverse,&lt;br&gt;
She who is replete with delight, excellence and health,&lt;br&gt;
Divine Ushas, though art seen auspicious, thou shinest afar,&lt;br&gt;
thy bright rays spread over the sky, lovely and radiant with great splendour;&lt;br&gt;
Do thou Ushas bring me opulence, daughter of heaven;&lt;br&gt;
thou who art divine, who art lovely, who art to be worshipped at the first daily rite;&lt;br&gt;
At thy dawning, divine Ushas, birds fly from their resting places, men arise to work;&lt;br&gt;
Thou, divine Ushas, bring ample wealth to the mortal, the offerer of these prayers.

*English Translation: [https://archive.org/stream/rigvedasanhitac00websgoog#page/n19/mode/2up Rigveda] Hymn VI.64.5, HH Wilson (Translator), Trubner &amp; Co London, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Goddesses, other than Ushas, mentioned in early Vedic literature include ''Prthivi'' (earth), ''Aditi'' (mother of gods, abundance), ''Sarasvati'' (river, nourishment), ''Vac'' (sound and speech), and ''Nirrti'' (death, destruction).&lt;ref name=davidk/&gt; Similarly male gods feature prominently in the Vedas, with ''Indra'' (rain, lightning), ''Agni'' (fire), ''Varuna'' (rta, law), ''Dyaus'' (sky, virility), ''Savitr'' (''Surya'', sun), and ''Soma'' (drink) some of the most mentioned. The two deities most mentioned in Rigveda are [[Indra]] and [[Agni]], both male.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Kinsley (1986), Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520053939}}, pages 6-8&lt;/ref&gt; Surya is the third most revered god, again a male.&lt;ref name=wjw&gt;William Joseph Wilkins, {{Google books|ZBUHAAAAQAAJ|Hindu Mythology: Vedic and Purānic|page=8}}, London Missionary Society, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt; Each is mentioned, anywhere rain and fire is evoked. They are profusely praised, with ceremonies and prayers to all gods and goddesses symbolically organized around fire (Agni [[yajna]]). The hymns seek strengthening of fire, and it is god Indra who increases the energy of the fire, while god Surya increases his brightness.  [[Max Muller]] states that, while there are difference in frequency of mentions, gods and goddesses in Rig veda are "neither superior nor inferior; almost every one is represented as supreme and absolute".&lt;ref name=wjw/&gt;

Gross states that ancient and medieval Hindu literature is richly endowed with gods, goddesses and androgynous representations of God.&lt;ref name=rmg&gt;RM Gross (1978), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1463798 Hindu Female Deities as a Resource for the Contemporary Rediscovery of the Goddess], Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Sep., 1978), pages 269-291&lt;/ref&gt; This, states Gross, is in contrast with several monotheistic religions, where God is often synonymous with "He" and theism is replete with male anthropomorphisms.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt; In Hinduism, goddess-imagery does not mean loss of male-god, rather the ancient literature presents the two genders as balancing each other and complementary. The Goddesses in Hinduism, states Gross,&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt; are strong, beautiful and confident, symbolizing their vitality in cycle of life. While masculine Gods are symbolically represented as those who act, the feminine Goddesses are symbolically portrayed as those who inspire action.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt; Goddesses in Hinduism are envisioned as the patrons of arts, culture, nurture, learning, arts, joys, spirituality and liberation.&lt;ref name=davidk&gt;David R. Kinsley (1986), Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520053939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;

God is not either male or female concept in ancient Indian literature. Androgynous concepts of god are common place as well.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;

===Brahman===
Most major schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] focus their philosophical discourse on the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Universal Absolute]], called [[Brahman]], which is a grammatically genderless noun.&lt;ref name=hrz&gt;Heinrich Robert Zimmer (1972), Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691017785}}, pages 123-128&lt;/ref&gt; This Universal Absolute, states Zimmer, is "beyond the differentiating qualifications of sex, beyond any and all limitations, individualizing characteristics whatsoever". The ''Brahman'' is the Great Cosmic Spirit, the Ultimate True Reality, the Supreme Self. It is a transcendental concept that includes all virtues, forms, genders, characteristics, capacities, knowledge and being-ness.&lt;ref name=hrz/&gt; The history of the genderless concept of Brahman, as the omnipresent Absolute Spirit and Supreme Self, can be traced back to Vedas, and extensively in the earliest Upanishads, such as hymns 1.4.10 and 4.4.5 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad,&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद् बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद्] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English Translation Hymn 1.4.10: [https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n171/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - 1.4.10] pages 145-146;&lt;br&gt;English Translation Hymn 4.4.5: [https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n739/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - 4.4.5] pages 712-713;&lt;/ref&gt; and hymn 6.2.1 of Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1.&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानिति शान्त उपासीत । अथ खलु क्रतुमयः पुरुषो यथाक्रतुरस्मिँल्लोके पुरुषो भवति तथेतः प्रेत्य भवति स क्रतुं कुर्वीत ॥ १ ॥ ([http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/छान्दोग्योपनिषद्_२ छान्दोग्योपनिषद्] Wikisource);&lt;br&gt;English Translation 1: All this indeed is '''Brahman'''. From It the universe comes forth, in It the universe merges, and in It the universe breathes. Therefore a man should meditate on Brahman with a calm mind. Now, a man consists of free will. As he wills in this world, so does he become. Let him, with this knowledge in mind, form his free will. ([http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/upanishads/chandogya_upanishad.php Chandogya Upanishad The Sandilya Doctrine - 3.14.1]);&lt;br&gt;English Translation 2: [https://archive.org/stream/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English#page/n165/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad III.xiv.1] GN Jha (Translator), page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmer clarifies the notion of gender in Sanskrit language and its relation to the concepts of Brahman and God in Hinduism, as follows:

{{Quote|
It must be understood that in Sanskrit, grammatical gender is not always a sign of physical sex. Gender infers function, sex infers form; so that an individual&lt;ref&gt;man or woman&lt;/ref&gt; may be masculine from one point of view and feminine from another. (...) Brahman can be regarded as the "womb" of life, and as in Christianity "this man" and "this woman" are equally "feminine to God" [in Hinduism]. Absolutely, Brahman, although grammatically neuter, is the principle of all such differentiation. Essence and nature are respectively masculine and feminine, logically distinct, but "one in God," who is neither this nor that [in Hinduism], and therefore "It" rather than "He" or "She" specifically.
|[[Heinrich Zimmer]]|Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization&lt;ref name=hrz/&gt;}}

==Mythology==
Hindu mythology incorporates numerous devas (gods) and devis (goddesses). These are symbolic stories that synthesize God and gender, with ideas and values. The [[Vishnu Purana]], for example, recites one such myth describes male gods and female goddesses with names that is loaded with symbolism. An excerpt of the story is as follows,&lt;ref name=vp/&gt;

{{Quote|
The progeny of [[Dharma]] by the daughters of Daksha were as follows: by Sraddhá (devotion) he had [[Kama]] (desire); by Lakshmí (wealth, prosperity), was born Darpa (pride); by Dhriti (courage), the progeny was [[Niyama]] (precept); by Tusht́i (inner comfort), Santosha (contentment); by Pusht́i (opulence), the progeny was Lobha (cupidity, greed); by Medhá (wisdom, experience), Sruta (sacred tradition); by Kriyá (hard work, labour), the progeny were Dańd́a, Naya, and Vinaya (justice, politics, and education); by Buddhi (intellect), Bodha (understanding); by Lajjá (shame, humility), Vinaya (good behaviour); by Vapu (body, strength), Vyavasaya (perseverance). Shanti (peace) gave birth to Kshama (forgiveness); Siddhi (excellence) to Sukha (enjoyment); and Kírtti (glorious speech) gave birth to Yasha (reputation). These were the sons of Dharma; one of whom, Kama (love, emotional fulfillment) had baby Hersha (joy) by his wife Nandi (delight).

The wife of Adharma (vice, wrong, evil) was Hinsá (violence), on whom he begot a son Anrita (falsehood), and a daughter Nikriti (immorality): they intermarried, and had two sons, Bhaya (fear) and Naraka (hell); and twins to them, two daughters, Máyá (deceit) and Vedaná (torture), who became their wives. The son of Bhaya (fear) and Máyá (deceit) was the destroyer of living creatures, or Mrityu (death); and Dukha (pain) was the offspring of Naraka (hell) and Vedaná (torture). The children of Mrityu were Vyádhi (disease), Jará (decay), Soka (sorrow), Trishńa (greediness), and Krodha (wrath). These are all called the inflictors of misery, and are characterised as the progeny of Vice (Adharma). They are all without wives, without posterity, without the faculty to procreate; they perpetually operate as causes of the destruction of this world. On the contrary, Daksha and the other Rishis, the elders of mankind, tend perpetually to influence its renovation: whilst the Manus and their sons, the heroes endowed with mighty power, and treading in the path of truth, as constantly contribute to its preservation.|Vishnu Purana|Chapter 7, Translated by [[Horace Hayman Wilson]]&lt;ref name=vp&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp041.htm Vishnu Purana] Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Examples==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}

=== Smarta and Advaita ===
The [[Smarta]] tradition, which by and large, follows [[Advaita]] philosophy believes all forms, male and female, to be different forms of the impersonal Absolute, [[Brahman]] which is of neuter gender and can never be defined.
Brahman is viewed as without personal attributes ([[Nirguna Brahman]]) or with attributes ([[Saguna Brahman]], equated with [[Ishvara]]) as [[God]]. In [[Advaita Vedanta]], Ishvara is Brahman. Thus according to [[Smarta]] views, the divine can be with attributes, [[Saguna Brahman]], and also be viewed with whatever attributes, (e.g., a goddess) a devotee conceives.

===Siva and Vishnu===
In [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvaita.org/docs/srv_faq.html#who= Dvaita Documentation: Vaishnava FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaivam.org/shpintro.htm Shaivam - An Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; God, [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] respectively, is personified as male. God, however, transcends gender in these sub-schools, and the male form is used as an icon to help focus the [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (worship). The use of icons is not restricted to male forms. It takes various forms and shapes. The Shaivites and Vaishnavites worship God in non-anthropomorphic, symbolic male-female images as well, such as the [[linga]]-[[yoni]] and [[Sila (murti)|Saligram]] respectively. In their literature, the principle of God's true nature as sexless is emphasized as in the [[Vishnu sahasranama]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Thus, the first few names,{{which|date=February 2015}} of Vishnu sahasranama, in particular, do not describe features of Vishnu in detail and hence are not [[anthropomorphic]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Shakti ===
[[Shaktism]], on the other hand, is a denomination of Hinduism that worships [[Shakti]], or [[Devi]] [[Mother goddess|Mata]]—the Hindu name for the [[Mother goddess|Great Divine Mother]]—in all of her forms whilst not rejecting the importance of masculine and neuter divinity (which are however deemed to be inactive in the absence of the Shakti). In pure Shaktism, the Great Goddess, or [[Mahadevi|Devi]], is worshiped. N. N. Bhattacharyya{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} explained that "[those] who worship the Supreme Deity exclusively as a Female Principle are called [[Shakta]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Alternative interpretations of Shaktism, however—primarily those of [[Shaivite]] scholars, such as [[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]]—argue that the feminine manifest is ultimately only the vehicle through which the masculine Un-manifest [[Parasiva]] is ultimately reached.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Radha Krishna ===
{{main|Radha Krishna}}
The common separation of Sakti and Saktiman, i.e. Female and Male principle in god arrives at the conclusion Sakti and Saktiman are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta,A History of Indian Philosophy (1991) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every god has its partner, 'better-half' or Sakti and without this Sakti he is sometimes viewed being without essential power.&lt;ref&gt;Santilata Dei, Del Santilata, Vaisnavism in Orissa (1988) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In some Bhakti schools, devotees of Hinduism worship both genders as a God-pair, rather than a specific gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beck, Guy L. |title=Alternative Krishnas: regional and vernacular variations on a Hindu deity |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=2005 |isbn=0-7914-6415-6 |oclc= |doi= |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SJ73GHSCF8C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Radha+is+supreme&amp;ei=PTeWSLa_BouCjwGTyY2sDQ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0UsEEDGzKto2Ryf-_UW0R2kzuyRw p. 68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kakoli Basak, (1991) Rabindranath Tagore, a Humanist - p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Vaishnava point of view the divine feminine energy (''Shakti'') implies a divine source of energy, i.e. God as ''shaktiman''. "Sita relates to [[Rama]]; [[Lakshmi]] belongs to [[Narayana]]; [[Radha]] has Her [[Krishna]]." The female, in these pairs, is viewed as the source of energy and essence of the male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2002|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Symmons (1998), This is Hinduism, Nelson Thornes, {{ISBN|978-0748730933}}, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1975), The Indian Great Goddess, History of Religions, Vol. 14, No. 4, pages 260-263&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the prominent features of Vaishnavism in Manipur, for example, is the worship of the two genders together. Devotees do not worship Krishna alone, or Radha alone, but Radha-Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g-wbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Manipur+Radha&amp;dq=Manipur+Radha&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature - p. 4290], Amaresh Datta, Mohan Lal,1994&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rasa (theology)|Rasa]]'' and other dances are a feature of the regional [[Folk religion|folk]] and religious tradition and often, for example, a female dancer will portray both 'male' Krishna and his consort, Radha, in the same piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwartz|2004|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People must have good moral character determined as a fact of law in predominately two contexts - (1) state-issued [[licensure]] that allows one to work and practice a regulated profession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Craddock |first1=Larry |title="Good Moral Character" As A Licensing Standard |website=www.texasbarcle.com |url=http://www.texasbarcle.com/Materials/Events/6394/25228.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2)  federal government-issued [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizenship]] certificates whereby an immigrant undergoes [[naturalization]] to become a citizen. Many laws create a paradox by placing the burden of proof of good moral character on the applicant while such a proof, but not the law, necessitates that the evaluators assess the beliefs and values of the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Taya R. |last2=Morse |first2=Lily |title=Moral character: What it is and what it does |journal=Research in Organizational Behavior |date=2014 |volume=34 |pages=43–61 |doi=10.1016/j.riob.2014.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good moral character is the opposite of [[moral turpitude]], another legal concept in the United States used in similar instances.

==Assessments of good moral character==
Good moral character can be proven through the presence of several positive moral findings, having no-to-minimal negative moral findings, and by the absence of legal violations. Positive evidence of good moral character can include letters of reccomendation, pursuing education, working seven days a week, owning one’s home, attending church every Sunday, marrying one’s high-school sweetheart, having strong ties to one’s nuclear family, coaching little league teams, teaching English above all other languages in one’s home, paying taxes, paying bills on time, and volunteering in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MENDELSON |first1=MARGOT K. |title=Constructing America: Mythmaking in U.S. Immigration Courts |journal=The Yale Law Journal |date=2010 |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=1012–1058 |jstor=20698316}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one volunteers to help others, they may be considered a better person if something bad, uncontrollable, and unexpected happens to them while they are working. For example, a man who was stung by a bee while mowing the lawn for an elderly neighbor would often be rated as having a better moral character than a similar man who was not stung by a bee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=From incidental harms to moral elevation: The positive effect of experiencing unintentional, uncontrollable, and unavoidable harms on perceived moral character |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=1 November 2017 |volume=73 |pages=86–96 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2017.06.016 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116306977 |language=en |issn=0022-1031|last1=Schaumberg |first1=Rebecca L. |last2=Mullen |first2=Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative findings of moral character can include having children without being married, not paying taxes, receiving government support, and advocating for racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Billy |first1=Jason |title=Confronting Racists at the Bar: Matthew Hale, Moral Character, and Regulating the Marketplace of Ideas |journal=Harvard Blackletter Law Journal |date=2006 |volume=22 |url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hblj22&amp;div=5&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of any negative finding can outweigh several positive findings.

==In immigration law==
Even minor violations of the law can be the sole reason for denying citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/local/172675_suit10.html One mistake robs man of citizenship&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] describes "good moral character" as an absence of involvement in the following activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://careers.findlaw.com/firmsite/attachments/LE6_c_checklist_WhatIsGoodMoralCharacter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127043144/http://careers.findlaw.com/firmsite/attachments/LE6_c_checklist_WhatIsGoodMoralCharacter.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-27 |df= }} What is good moral character?&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the practice of medicine==
A 1975 survey by Camenisch included responses from 19 state medical board presidents (respondents) wherein they placed eight characteristics of good moral character in order of importance from most-to-least.

Camenisch writes, “The grouping of the eight elements in the order of importance makes it clear that ‘good moral character’ in the minds of the respondents emphatically has more to do with the professional's obligations to a limited number of specific individuals, to his patients, than to the society at large, to the entire population of those needing health care... this second area ... includes such matters as the distribution of health care and the mode and ease of patient access to it. ... this low ranking of societal issues and responsibilities is of special interest in light of the fact that these same respondents, when asked to indicate the major differences between professional and other occupational licensing, gave highest place to ‘the degree of dedication to the public well-being expected of the licensee.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Camenisch |first1=PF |title=On the matter of good moral character. |journal=The Linacre Quarterly |date=August 1978 |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=273–83 |pmid=11661606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''half-truth''' is a [[deception|deceptive statement]] that includes some element of [[truth]]. The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth, or it may use some deceptive element, such as improper [[punctuation]], or [[double meaning]], especially if the intent is to deceive, [[Evasion (ethics)|evade]], [[blame]] or misrepresent the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Half-truth |title=Merriam Webster Definition of Half-truth, August 1, 2007 |publisher=M-w.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose and or consequence of a half-truth is to make something that is really only a [[belief]] appear to be [[knowledge]], or a truthful statement to represent the whole truth, or possibly lead to a false conclusion. According to the [[Justified true belief#Justified true belief|justified true belief]] theory of knowledge, in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe in the relevant true proposition, but one must also have a good reason for doing so. A half-truth deceives the recipient by presenting something believable and using those aspects of the statement that can be shown to be true as good reason to believe the statement is true in its entirety, or that the statement represents the whole truth. A person deceived by a half-truth considers the proposition to be knowledge and acts accordingly.

==Examples==
* In January 2018, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] claimed on Twitter that "because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!" Although the unemployment rate for black Americans was indeed at a record low, the rate had been consistently decreasing since 2010, six years before Trump took office.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-partly-correct-rejoinder-jay-z/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using a [[technicality]]: Former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] famously engaged in a half-truth when he gave the testimony of "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky." Here he engaged in an [[equivocation]] fallacy to deliberately indicate one particular meaning of the phrase "sexual relations", while intending another meaning, in order to deliberately mislead the court while still being able to later claim that "my statements were technically correct."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
*"You should not trust Peter with your children. I once saw him smack a child with his open hand." ''In this example the statement could be true, but Peter may have slapped the child on the back because he was choking.''
*"I'm a really good driver. In the past thirty years, I have gotten only four speeding tickets"* ''This statement is true, but irrelevant if the speaker started driving a week ago.''
*After being stopped for [[drunk driving]], the inebriated driver proclaims "I only had a couple of [[beer]]s" in slurred speech. ''The driver may have also consumed alcoholic drinks other than beer, and the "beers" may have been large bottles as opposed to the usual contents of a normal-sized can, bottle, or glass''
*The classic story about [[blind men and an elephant]]. Each blind man touches a different part of the elephant and reaches a different conclusion about the nature of the elephant; while each man's experience of the elephant is accurate, none of them have a full understanding of the nature of the beast. One may be touching the tail and believe that the elephant is long and thin, another may be touching the belly and say that it is round and big.
*"False dichotomy": the formal fallacy of false dilemma, also known as [[False dilemma|false choice, falsified dilemma]], fallacy of the excluded middle, [[black and white thinking]], false correlative, either/or fallacy, and bifurcation—involves a situation in which two alternative statements are held to be the only possible options, when in reality there exist one or more other options which have not been considered or presented to the listeners.

==Politics==
Some forms of half-truths are an inescapable part of politics in [[representative democracy|representative democracies]]. The reputation of a political candidate can be irreparably damaged if they are exposed in a lie, so a complex style of language has evolved to minimise the chance of this happening. If someone has not said something, they cannot be accused of lying. As a consequence, politics has become a world where half-truths are expected, and political statements are rarely accepted at face value.&lt;ref name="htpolitics"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|author=Crystal, David|authorlink=David Crystal|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Safire]] defines a half-truth, for political purposes, as "a statement accurate enough to require an explanation; and the longer the explanation, the more likely a public reaction of half-belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Language of Politics: An Anecdotal Dictionary of Catchwords, Slogans, and Political Usage|author=[[William Safire]]|year=1968|publisher=[[Random House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 work ''The Magic Lantern: The Revolution of 1989 Witnessed in Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, and Prague'', [[Timothy Garton Ash]] responded to [[Václav Havel]]'s call for "living in truth":
{{cquote|Now we expect many things of politicians in a well-functioning parliamentary democracy. But "living in truth" is not one of them. In fact the essence of democratic politics might rather be described as "working in half-truth". Parliamentary democracy is, at its heart, a system of limited adversarial mendacity, in which each party attempts to present part of the truth as if it were the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] was quoted as saying: "There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Dialogues'', 1954: Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is true, statements, or truths, which according to Whitehead are all half-truths, are susceptible to creating deceptive and false conclusions.

==Meme theory==

[[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]] links half-truths to [[meme]]s "the truth of any proposition depends on the assumptions you make in considering it—the distinct memes you use in thinking about it".&lt;ref name="brodie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme|author=Brodie, Richard|year=1996|publisher=Integral Press, Seattle|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie considers half-truths a necessary part of human interaction because they allow practical application of ideas when it is impractical to convey all the information needed to make a fully informed decision, although some half-truths can lead to a false conclusions or [[inferences]] in the world of [[logic]].

==Quotations==
The notion of half-truths has existed in various cultures, giving rise to several [[epigram]]matic sayings.

*[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], an Austrian journalist, critic, playwright, and poet noted, "An [[aphorism]] can never be the whole truth; it is either a half-truth or a truth-and-a-half."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in [[Thomas Szasz]], ''Anti-Freud: Karl Kraus's Criticism of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry'', 1990, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Arthur Koestler]] "Two half-truths do not make a truth, and two half-cultures do not make a culture."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in [[Jonathon Green]], ''Says who?: a guide to the quotations of the century'', 1988, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sunrise - A Song of Two Humans (DVD menu).jpg|thumb|A [[DVD-Video]] typically includes an interactive menu allowing the user to change settings or play additional content.]]
'''Interactive media''' normally refers to products and services on digital computer-based systems which respond to the user's actions by presenting content such as [[text (literary theory) | text]], [[moving image]], [[animation]], [[video]], [[Digital audio | audio]], and [[video games]].

==Definition==
[[Interactivity|Interactive]] media is a method of communication in which the output from the media comes from the input of the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive media|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Smart Devices Interact With Pervasive Screens: A Survey", 
P.C. Ng, K.E. Eun, J. She, M. Baldauf, ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) 
Volume 13, Issue 4, August 2017.
[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3115933]&lt;/ref&gt;
Interactive media works with the user's participation. The media still has the same purpose but the user's input adds interaction and brings interesting features to the system for better enjoyment.

==Development==
The analogue videodisc developed by NV [[Philips]] was the pioneering technology for interactive media. Additionally, there are several elements that encouraged the development of interactive media including the following: 
* The laser disc technology was first invented in 1958. It enabled the user to access high-quality analogue images on the computer screen. This increased the ability of interactive video systems. 
* The concept of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which was developed in the 1970s, popularized by [[Apple Computer, Inc.]] was essentially about visual metaphors, intuitive feel and sharing information on the virtual desktop. Additional power was the only thing needed to move into multimedia.
* The sharp fall in hardware costs and the unprecedented rise in the computer speed and memory transformed the personal computer into an affordable machine capable of combining audio and color video in advanced ways. 
* Another element is the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990 by [[Microsoft]] into the mainstream IBM clone world. It accelerated the acceptance of GUI as the standard mechanism for communicating with small computer systems. 
* The development by NV [[Philips]] of optical digital technologies built around the compact disk (CD) in 1979 is also another leading element in the interactive media development as it raised the issue of developing interactive media.&lt;ref&gt;Lat chem, C., Williamson, J., &amp; Henderson-Lancet, L. (1993). Interactive multimedia practice and promise. London; Philadelphia: Koran page.&lt;/ref&gt; 
All of the prior elements contributed in the development of the main hardware and software systems used in interactive media.

==Terminology==
Though the word ''media'' is plural, the term  is often used as a singular noun.

Interactive media is related to the concepts [[interaction design]], [[new media]], [[interactivity]], [[human computer interaction]], [[cyberculture]], [[digital culture]], [[interactive design]], and includes [[augmented reality]].

An essential feature of interactivity is that it is mutual: user and machine each take an active role (see [[interaction]]). Most [[interactive computing]] systems are for some human purpose and interact with humans in human contexts.&lt;ref name="Dix"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dix  | first1 = Alan  | last2 = Finlay  | first2 = Janet  | last3 = Abowd  | first3 = Gregory D.  | last4 = Beale  | first4 = Russell  | authorlink = Alan Dix  | title = Human-computer interaction. 3rd edn.  | publisher = Pearson Education  | year = 2004  | page = xvi  | isbn = 9780130461094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manovich complains that 'In relation to computer-based media, the concept of interactivity is a tautology.  .... Therefore, to call computer media “interactive” is meaningless – it  simply means stating the most basic fact about computers.'.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Manovich  | first = Lev  | authorlink = Lev Manovich  | title = The Language of New Media  | publisher = MIT Press  | location = Cambridge  | year = 2001  | page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term is useful to denote an identifiable body of practices and technologies.

Interactive media are an instance of a computational method influenced by the sciences of cybernetics, [[autopoiesis]] and system theories, and challenging notions of reason and cognition, perception and memory, emotions and affection.

Any form of interface between the [[end user]]/[[audience]] and the medium may be considered interactive. Interactive media is not limited to [[electronic media]] or digital media. [[Board game]]s, [[pop-up book]]s, [[gamebook]]s, [[flip book]]s and [[constellation wheel]]s are all examples of printer interactive media. Books with a simple [[table of contents]] or [[Index (publishing)|index]] may be considered interactive due to the [[non-linear]] control mechanism in the medium, but are usually considered non-interactive since the majority of the [[user experience]] is non-interactive reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media psychology]] is the newest emerging dimension of media theory applied to interactive media. {{cite web |url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011010440/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===Effects on learning===
Interactive media is helpful in the four development dimensions in which young children learn: social and emotional, language development, cognitive and general knowledge, and approaches toward learning. Using computers and educational computer software in a learning environment helps children increase communication skills and their attitudes about learning. Children who use educational computer software are often found using more complex speech patterns and higher levels of verbal communication. A study found that basic interactive books that simply read a story aloud and highlighted words and phrases as they were spoken were beneficial for children with lower reading abilities. Children have different styles of learning, and interactive media helps children with visual, verbal, auditory, and tactile learning styles.&lt;ref&gt;Glaucoma, Christina R., M.A. The Effects of Interactive Media on Preschoolers' Learning: A Review of the Research and Recommendations for the Future. P. 13-17. Ed. Eileen Espresso, Patti Miller, and Christine Cordoba.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intuitive understanding===
Interactive media makes technology more intuitive to use. Interactive products such as smartphones, iPad's/iPod's, interactive whiteboards and websites are all easy to use. The easy usage of these products encourages consumers to experiment with their products rather than reading instruction manuals.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Stuart. "The Disadvantages and Advantages of Interactive Media." EHow. Demand Media, 10 May 2011. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Interactive media promotes dialogic communication. This form of communication allows senders and receivers to build long term trust and cooperation. This plays a critical role in building relationships. Organizations also use interactive media to go further than basic marketing and develop more positive behavioral relationships.&lt;ref&gt;DeYeso, Jennifer. "The Effect of Interactive and Traditional Media on Relationship Building." Slideshare. LinkedIn Corporation, 25 Apr. 2012. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on families==
The introduction of interactive media has greatly affected the lives and inner workings of families, with many family activities having integrated with technology quite seamlessly, allowing both children and parents to adapt to it as they see fit. However, parents have also become increasingly worried about the impact that it will have on their family lives. This is not necessarily because they are opposed to technology, but because they fear that it will lessen the time that they get to spend with their children. Studies have shown that although interactive media is able to connect families together when they are unable to physically, the dependence on this media also continues to persist even when there are opportunities for family time, which often leads the adults to believe that it distracts children more than it benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Katie Headrick; Takeuchi, Lori; Stevens, Reed. "Mapping the daily media round: novel methods for understanding families' mobile technology use." Learning, Media, and Technology. 21 Oct. 2017. Accessed 4 Feb. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Distributed interactive media===
The media which allows several geographically remote users to interact synchronously with the media application/system is known as Distributed Interactive Media. Some common examples of this type of Media include Online Gaming, Distributed Virtual Environment, Whiteboards which are used for interactive conferences and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Mauve, Martin; Vogel, Jiirgen (2001) "Consistency Control for Distributed Interactive Media" Sept. 30-Oct. 5, 2001, Ottawa, Canada 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A couple of basic examples of [https://www.interactivemedia.az/en/ interactive media] (also known as a company in Azerbaijan) are video games and websites. Websites, especially social networking websites provide the interactive use of text and graphics to its users, who interact with each other in various ways such as chatting, playing online games, sharing posts that may include their thoughts and/or pictures and so forth. Video games are also one of the common examples of Interactive Media as the players make use of the joystick/controller to interactively respond to the actions and changes taking place on the game screen generated by the game application, which in turn reacts to the response of the players through the joystick/controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|title=Interactive Media|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=28 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies and implementation==
Interactive media can be implemented using a variety of platforms and applications that use technology. Some examples include mobile platforms such as touch screen smartphones and tablets, as well as other interactive mediums that are created exclusively to solve a unique problem or set of problems. Interactive media is not limited to a professional environment, it can be used for any technology that responds to user actions. This can include the use of [[JavaScript]] and [[AJAX]] in web pages, but can also be used in programming languages or technology that has similar functionality.

One of the most recent innovations to use interactivity that solves a problem that individuals have on a daily basis is [[Delta Airlines]]'s "Photon Shower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/delta-teases-us-shower-beats-jet-lag-473471/|title=Delta teases us with 'shower' that beats jet lag - CNN Travel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device was developed as a collaboration between Delta Airlines and Professor [[Russell Foster]] of [[Cambridge University]]. The device is designed to reduce the effect of [[Jet lag|jet lag]] on customers that often take long flights across time zones. The interactivity is evident because of how it solves this problem. By observing what time zones a person has crossed and matching those to the basic known sleep cycles of the individual, the machine is able to predict when a person's body is expecting light, and when it is expecting darkness. It then stimulates the individual with the appropriate light source variations for the time, as well as an instructional card to inform them of what times their body expects light and what times it expects darkness. Growth of interactive media continues to advance today, with the advent of more and more powerful machines the limit to what can be input and manipulated on a display in real time is become virtually non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf | title=Technology and Interactive Media as Tools in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children from Birth through Age 8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324042025/http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf|archivedate=24 March 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031121333/https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|url=https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|title=Selected Examples of Effective Classroom Practice Involving Technology Tools and Interactive Media|archivedate=31 October 2012|publisher=|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exacttarget.com/blog/5-interactive-media-examples-of-the-new-mad-men/|title=Marketing|website=Salesforce.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kshetrajna'''  ([[Sanskrit|Devnagari]]: क्षेत्रज्ञ) means the One who knows of the body, soul, spirituality, conscious principle in the corporeal frame. In the thirteenth chapter of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Krishna]] explains the distinction between the Kshetra (known) and the Kshetrajna (knower).

==Overview==

The Kshetra or the field refers to the body which is material, mutable, transitory and perishable, the Kshetrajna refers to the conscious knower of the body who is of the same essence as Knowledge, immutable, eternal and imperishable, the knower of the body is the soul residing in the body. Kshetra is [[Prakrti]] or matter which is insentient, and the knower of the Kshetra is the [[Purusha]] who is sentient. True knowledge is knowing and understanding both these two factors, the insentient and sentient. The knowledge of Prakrti only, is called the Apara Vidya or Lower knowledge, and that pertaining to the Purusha is called the [[Para Vidya]] or Higher knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Encyclopaedia Vol.1|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTdnvQBPWIUC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=kshetrajna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ROwGU7KPDsuihgfr_YDgCA&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kshetrajna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Arjuna is told that the distinctive nature of God is eight-fold constituted by the five primordial elements, mind, intellect and the ego-sense, but that is the lower nature which is inferior, impure, troublesome, whose essence is bondage; the higher nature, which is the pure essential nature of God, is the higher living being, the Kshetrajna, the field-knower, the cause leading to the assumption of vital force by which the world is penetrated and upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=254–255|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/bhagavad-gita-bhashya-sankara/|quote=Bhagavad Gita Slokas VII.4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kshetra (the Field)==

In the opening Sloka of Chapter XIII of the Bhagavad Gita, [[Krishna]] defines Kshetra and establishes the identity of the individual soul, the conscious knower of the Kshetra, with the Universal Soul.

:इदं शरीरं कौन्तेय क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते |
:एतद्यो वेत्ति तं प्राहुः क्षेत्रज्ञ इति तद्विदः || (XIII.1)

:"This body, Arjuna, is termed as the Field (Kshetra); and him who knows it, the sages discerning the truth about both refer to as the knower of the Field (Kshetrajna"

Thereafter, He explains that - the five elements, the ego, the intellect, the Unmanifest (Primordial Matter), the ten organs (of perception and action), the mind, and the five objects of sense (sound, touch, colour, taste and smell); also desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, the physical body, consciousness, firmness, this is the Kshetra with its evolutes (XIII.5-6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|pages=547–551|url=  http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/srimad-bhagavad-gita-tattvavivecani-english-commentary-IDE961/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jnana (Knowledge)==

Arjuna is told that – absence of pride, freedom from hypocrisy, non-violence, forbearance, straightness of the body, speech and mind, devout service of the preceptor, internal and external purity, steadfastness of mind and control of body, mind and the senses, dispassion towards the objects of enjoyment of this world and the next, and also absence of egotism, pondering again and again on the pain and evils inherent in birth, death, old age and disease; absence of attachment and the feeling of mineness in respect of son, wife, home etc., and constant equipoise of mind both in favourable and unfavourable circumstances; unflinching devotion to God through exclusive attachment, living in secluded and holy places, and finding no enjoyment in the company of men; fixity in self-knowledge and seeing God as the object of true knowledge – all this is declared as knowledge; and what is other than this is called ignorance (XIII 7-11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|pages=552–556|url=  http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/srimad-bhagavad-gita-tattvavivecani-english-commentary-IDE961/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his Bhasya explains that devotion inspired by conviction that wavers not, is unwavering devotion, which devotion is knowledge. Spiritual knowledge is that of the Self, meditation on it is the perception of the content of philosophical knowledge. Knowledge is what ought to be known and the knowable is that by which one attains immortality.429-430&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=429–430|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/bhagavad-gita-bhashya-sankara/|quote=Bhagavad Gita Slokas XIII.11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knower of Kshetras==

Krishna tells Arjuna that:-
 
:क्षेत्रज्ञ चापि मां विद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रेषु भारत |
:क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोर्ज्ञानं यत्तज्ज्ञानं मतं मम || (XIII.2)

:"Know Myself to be the Kshetrajna (individual soul) also in all the Kshetras, Arjuna. And it is the knowledge of Kshetra and Kshetrajna (i.e., of Matter with its evolutes and the Spirit) which I consider as Wisdom."

Having identified Himself as the Kshetrajna, Krishna proceeds to describe in detail Him who is sat (being) and asat (non-being) both, the Sole Witness who is eternal and present everywhere and in all things, and failing to reach Whom, speech together with the mind returneth ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]] II.9) – this indescribable entity is [[Brahman]], ज्ञेयम् - the object worth knowing, विज्ञाय मद्भावाय उपपद्यते – in whose being the devout knowing which reality enter (merge) (VIII.18). Krishna directs that one should know Prakrti and Purusha to be beginningless – that the former is responsible for bringing forth the evolutes and the instruments, and the latter, who is the individual soul seated in Prakrti, is declared to be the cause of experience of joys and sorrows, and attachment to [[Gunas]] is the cause of birth in sat-asat-yoni. And that - देहेऽस्मिन् पुरुषः परः – Purusha, the individual soul dwelling in the body, is the same as the Supreme Soul Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|pages=552, 566|url=  http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/srimad-bhagavad-gita-tattvavivecani-english-commentary-IDE961/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Kshetrajna is the pure conscious spirit that is purusha and atman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bhagavad Gita: A Text and Commentary for Students|author=Jeanne D.Fowler|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|page=216|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zU4E5ZidVr0C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=kshetrajna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ROwGU7KPDsuihgfr_YDgCA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kshetrajna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna does not describe Kshetrajna, He describes that which is required to be known. When ज्ञेयम् - Jneya is realized, there disappears all duality and separateness in the form of knower, knowledge and what is to be known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita: An Exposition|author=Chhaganlal G.Kaji |publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=415–416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwUiusoi0qQC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;dq=kshetrajna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ROwGU7KPDsuihgfr_YDgCA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kshetrajna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Kshetra does not have a separate Kshetrajna, the Lord is the supreme Kshetrajna in all the Kshetras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Long Walk to Enlightenment|author=Thillyavel Naidoo|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXUf_PCLPK0C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=kshetrajna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ROwGU7KPDsuihgfr_YDgCA&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kshetrajna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic concept==

The concept of “Sameness” or “Oneness” of the individual soul and the Universal Soul emphasized by the [[Upanishads]], the [[Brahma Sutras]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and other allied texts is but an echo of what was long ago revealed to the [[Vedic]] [[Rishi]]s and has lingered on. Ātman (Hinduism) [[Dirghatamas]] one of the Angirasa Rishis of the [[Rig Veda]] in Mantra 4 of Sukta I.163 addressed to [[Agni]] states:-

:त्रीणि त आहुर्दिवि बन्धनानि त्रीण्यप्सु त्रीण्यन्तः समुद्रे |
:उतेव मे वरुणश्छन्त्स्यर्वन्यत्रा त आहुः परमं जनित्रम् ||

:"O enlightened One ! The place of your origin or birth is the same as that of mine; O the finest One ! if you are endowed with strength I too possess the same kind of strength (of the same magnitude); O the bright One (Agni) ! if you so happen to exist in three states or forms so does water (the finest divine aspects) and the earth (the gross supporting aspect) and all objects (the entire transformation of the First Cause) dispersed in space (existing outside and within all) have three forms, O learned One ! if your birth and knowledge is divine so is mine."

This unique awareness of Sameness which is actually the awareness of Oneness is the knowledge of Reality, the true knowledge of existence, gaining which knowledge the true seeker of knowledge ceases to see difference in this wide world which difference is seen only as so many names echoing and re-echoing persistently in one’s mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=201|url=  http://www.worldcat.org/title/illumination-of-knowledge-a-brief-reflection-on-the-role-of-agni-the-vedic-god-of-fire/oclc/470877223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sankara’s opinion==

[[Adi Sankara|Sankara]], in his commentary on Chapter XIII of the Bhagavad Gita with regard to the distinction between [[Ishvara]] and [[Jiva]] since the identification of the prajna (the self in deep sleep-state) with Ishvara is problematic, states:-
“Now as to the objections that Ishvara would be a samsarin if He be one with Kshetrajna, and that if Kshetrajnas be one with Ishvara there can be no samsara because there is no samsarin: these objections have been met by saying that knowledge and ignorance are distinct in kind and effects, - that all that is knowable is the Kshetra, and Kshetrajna is the knower and none else.” 
And, therefore, avarna dosha (obscuration of intellect) which is the basic feature of deep sleep affects only individual beings and not God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta |author=Arvind Sharma|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=31–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLbHcAf8NdMC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=kshetrajna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ROwGU7KPDsuihgfr_YDgCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=kshetrajna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">'''Legal consciousness''' is a ''collection'' of understood and/or imagined to have understood, [[legal awareness]] of ideas, views, feelings and traditions imbibed through [[legal socialization]]; which reflects as [[legal culture]] among given individual, or a group, or a given society at large. The legal consciousness evaluates the existing [[law]] and also bears in mind an image of the desired or ideal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juridicainternational.eu/?id=12433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legal Consciousness Among Youth at the Red Hook Community Justice Center By Aviad Lael Brisman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consciousness]] is not an individual trait nor solely ideational; legal consciousness is a type of [[Social Practice|social practice]] reflecting and forming [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref name="Silbey Susan 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan|title=legal consciousness|journal=New Oxford Companion to Law|date=2008|pages=2|url=http://web.mit.edu/~ssilbey/www/pdf/Legal_consciousness.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2015|ref=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of legal Consciousness documents the forms of participation and interpretation through which act or sustain, reproduce, or amend the circulating contested or hegemonic structures of meanings concerning [[law]]. Legal consciousness is the way in which [[law]] is experienced and interpreted by specific individuals as they engage, avoid, resist or just assume the [[law]] and legal meanings.

Legal consciousness is a state of being, [[legal socialisation]] is the process to Legal consciousness; where as [[legal awareness]] &amp; [[legal mobilisation]] are means to achieve  the same.

==Definition==
The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia (1979) defined legal consciousness as " ''the sum of views and ideas expressing the attitude of people toward law, legality, and justice and their concept of what is lawful and unlawful. Legal consciousness is a form of social consciousness. Legal ideology, the system of legal views based on certain social and scientific viewpoints, is a concentrated expression of legal consciousness. The customs and feelings of people in relation to legal phenomena constitute the psychological aspect of legal consciousness; among these are a sense of justice and a loathing of crimes and illegal actions'' "

Legal consciousness is defined by Ewick and Silbey as the process by which people make sense of their experiences by relying on legal categories and concepts. People do this even when they are not familiar with the details and minutia of law or the legal system. They explain that there are cultural schemas provided by law that people use to make sense of their experiences. They refer to this as legality. The concept of legality includes "the meanings, sources, authority and cultural practices that are commonly recognized as legal, regardless of who employs them or for what ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewick; Silbey|first1=Patricia; Susan|title=The Common Place of Law: Stories from Everyday Life|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These meanings and sources and different ways of knowing and understanding enable people to make sense of what happens to them and what that might mean in terms of their rights and options. This process of understanding legal experiences occurs within a larger ecosystem in which there are disputes over meaning and values. Seron and Munger explain that ""in addition, class may affect legal consciousness: Law may mean different things depending on an individual's location in the various hierarchies of status, prestige, and knowledge associated with membership in a social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seron; Munger|first1=Carroll; Frank|last2=Munger|first2=Frank|title=Law and Inequality: Race, Gender... and of Course, Class|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=1996|volume=22|pages=187–212|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Military expression''' is an area of [[military law]] pertaining to the [[United States military]] that relates to the [[free speech]] rights of its service members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vagts|first=Detlev F.|title=Free Speech in the Armed Forces|journal=[[Columbia Law Review]]|date=February 1957|volume=57|issue=12|pages=187–218|issn=0010-1958|oclc=4895173605}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "military free speech" was the term used during the [[Vietnam War]] era, "military expression" has become a niche area of [[military law]] since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.yaleconservativeparty.com/stm Yale Conservative Party] lecture for 2009 titled "Military Expression in the Modern Armed Forces"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}} Besides media references relating to specific cases, the term was used at military [[whistleblower]] committee hearings with members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and Senate on May 14, 2008. Transcripts of the hearings show that attorney [[Mike Lebowitz]] was identified as testifying as a legal expert in "military expression".&lt;ref&gt;transcripts for May 14, 2008, see also [[C-SPAN]] coverage of hearings&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=November 2012}} That hearing also included references by U.S. Representative [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-TX) who also referred to the area of law as "military expression".{{Elucidate|date=February 2011}}

== Limitations on military expression ==

While the civilian population of the United States is afforded the right to free expression under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has affirmed the notion that service members have a reduced level of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/135/550 ''United States v. Voorhees''] 135 U.S. 550 (10 S.Ct. 841, 34 L.Ed. 258)&lt;/ref&gt; While the Court acknowledged that service members do have First Amendment rights, these rights are limited:

{{quote|They do, in fact, have the same first amendment rights as their civilian brothers. They are, however, not absolute...The difference is that the military has peculiar needs and interests apart from those of the civilian community it serves, and they preclude the exercise of the right of free speech on as broad a basis as is the practice in the civilian community. No [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] or man in the armed forces has a right, be it constitutional, statutory or otherwise, to publish any information (or make any statement) which will imperil his unit or its cause.&lt;ref name="airpower.maxwell.af.mil"&gt;http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1980/may-jun/moran.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123235218/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1980/may-jun/moran.html |date=November 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}}}

== After September 11, 2001 ==

With the advent of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003, the issue of military expression was again in the public eye as a relatively small amount of service members and veterans began demonstrating. One case revolved around a former Marine (still under contract with the [[Individual Ready Reserve|IRR]]) who was photographed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wearing a partial uniform during an anti-war demonstration in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=David|title=Antiwar to the Corps: Marine Reservist-Protesters Face Discipline|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/30/AR2007053002627_pf.html|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual faced disciplinary action for his participation in this demonstration, as well as for a politically charged email he sent to a Marine officer.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Koff, "Corps accused of 'muzzle' tactics", ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=November 2012}} However, in this case, the service member avoided the other than honorable discharge being sought by the military due to the First Amendment arguments posed on his behalf.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; That case, which was argued by attorney [[Mike Lebowitz]] in representation of anti-war and political activist [[Adam Kokesh]], is regarded as the first military expression case of its kind to result generally favorably for the service member.&lt;ref name=justine&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharrock|first=Justine|title=Zip It, Soldier!: What happens to Iraq veterans who speak out against the war?|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/09/iraq-veterans-speak-out-against-war|newspaper=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of technology ==

Political speech, to include being active in a political party, also has become an issue as the Internet and email permits easier participation despite rules against such activity.&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Whig Party has Appeal to Some Troops," by William H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20275">The '''multislice''' algorithm is a method for the simulation of the interaction of an [[electron beam]] with matter,  including all multiple elastic scattering effects. The method is reviewed in the book by Cowley.&lt;ref name ="CowleyDP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diffraction Physics, 3rd Ed|author = John M. Cowley|year=1995|publisher=North Holland Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm is used in the simulation of high resolution [[Transmission electron microscopy]] micrographs, and serves as a useful tool for analyzing experimental images.&lt;ref name ="Kirkland"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Computing in Electron Microscopy|author = Dr. Earl J. Kirkland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we describe relevant background information, the theoretical basis of the technique, approximations used, and several software packages that implement this technique. Moreover, we delineate some of the advantages and limitations of the technique and important considerations that need to be taken into account for real-world use.

== Background ==

The multislice method has found wide application in electron crystallography. The mapping from a crystal structure to its image or diffraction pattern has been relatively well understood and documented. However, the reverse mapping from electron micrograph images to the crystal structure is generally more complicated. The fact that the images are two-dimensional projections of three-dimensional crystal structure makes it tedious to compare these projections to all plausible crystal structures. Hence, the use of numerical techniques in simulating results for different crystal structure is integral to the field of electron microscopy and crystallography. Several software packages exist to simulate electron micrographs.

There are two widely used simulation techniques that exist in literature: the Bloch wave method, derived  from Hans Bethe's original theoretical treatment of the Davisson-Germer experiment,  and the multislice method. In this paper, we will primarily focus on the multislice method for simulation of diffraction patterns, including multiple elastic scattering effects. Most of the packages that exist implement the multislice algorithm along with Fourier analysis to incorporate electron lens aberration effects to determine electron microscope image and address aspects such as phase contrast and diffraction contrast. For electron microscope samples in the form of a thin crystalline slab in the transmission geometry, the aim of these software packages is to provide a map of  the crystal potential, however this inversion process is greatly complicated by the presence of multiple elastic scattering.

The first description of what is now known as the multislice theory was given in the classic paper by Cowley and Moodie .&lt;ref name="Cowley"&gt;{{cite news|journal=Acta Crystallographica|author=J. M. Cowley and A. F. Moodie|year=1957|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, the authors describe scattering of electrons using a physical optics approach without invoking quantum mechanical arguments. Many other derivations of these iterative equations have since  been given using alternative methods, such as Greens functions, differential equations, scattering matrices or path integral methods.

A summary of the development of a computer algorithm from the multislice theory of Cowley and Moodie for numerical computation was reported by Goodman and Moodie.&lt;ref&gt;P. Goodman and A. F. Moodie, Acta Crystallogr. 1974, A30, 280&lt;/ref&gt; They also discussed in detail the relationship of the multislice to the other formulations. Specifically, using Zassenhaus's theorem, this paper gives the mathematical path from multislice to 1. Schroedingers equation (derived from the multislice),  2. Darwin's differential equations, widely used for diffraction contrast TEM image simulations - the Howie-Whelan equations derived from the multislice. 3. Sturkey's scattering matrix method. 4.  the free-space propagation case, 5. The phase grating approximation, 6. A new "thick-phase grating" approximation, which has never been used, 7. Moodie's polynomial expression for multiple scattering, 8. The Feynman path-integral formulation, and 9. relationship of multislice to the Born series. The relationship between algorithms is summarized in Section 5.11 of Spence (2013),&lt;ref name ="SpenceHREM"&gt;{{cite book|title=High-Resolution Electron Microscopy, 4th Ed.|author = [[John C. H. Spence]]|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see Figure 5.9).

== Theory ==

The form of multislice algorithm presented here has been adapted from Peng, Dudarev and Whelan 2003.&lt;ref name ="Peng"&gt;{{cite book|title=High-Energy Electron Diffraction and Microscopy|author = L. M. Peng, S. L. Dudarev and M. J. Whelan|year=2003|publisher=Oxford Science Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multislice algorithm is an approach to solving the Schrödinger wave equation:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2\Psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\Psi(x,t)
 &amp;=E\Psi(x,t)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In 1957, Cowley and Moodie &lt;ref name="Cowley"/&gt; showed that the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically to evaluate the amplitudes of diffracted beam. Subsequently, the effects of dynamical diffraction can be calculated and the resulting simulated image will exhibit good similarities with the actual image taken from a microscope under dynamical conditions. Furthermore, the multislice algorithm does not make any assumption about the periodicity of the structure, as a result this method can be used to simulate HREM images of aperiodic systems as well.

The following section will include a mathematical formulation of the Multislice algorithm. The Schrödinger equation can also be represented in the form of incident and scattered wave as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Psi({\mathbf{r}}) &amp;= \Psi_{0}({\mathbf{r}}) + \int{G({\mathbf{r,r'}})V({\mathbf{r'}})\Psi({\mathbf{r'}})d{\mathbf{r'}}}
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{r,r'})&lt;/math&gt; is the Green’s function that represents the amplitude of the electron wave function at a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; due to a source at point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r'}&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence for an incident plane wave of the form &lt;math&gt;\Psi(r)=\exp(i\mathbf{k\cdot r})&lt;/math&gt; the Schrödinger equation can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Psi({\mathbf{r}}) = \exp(i{\mathbf{k\cdot r}}) - \frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int\frac{\exp(ik\cdot {\mathbf{|r-r'|}})}{{\mathbf{|r-r'|}}}
  V({\mathbf{r'}})\Psi({\mathbf{r'}})dr'
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We then choose the coordinate axis in such a way that the incident beam hits the sample at (0,0,0) in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;-direction. Now we consider wave-function with a modulation function &lt;math&gt;\phi({\mathbf{r}})&lt;/math&gt; for the amplitude of the wave-function. Hence, the modulation function can be represented as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \phi({\mathbf{r}}) &amp;= 1 - \frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int{\frac{\exp[ik|{\mathbf{r-r'}}|-i{\mathbf{k}}\cdot({\mathbf{r-r'}})]}{|{\mathbf{r-r'}}|}V({\mathbf{r'})\phi({\mathbf{r'}})}dr'}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we make substitutions with regards to the coordinate system we have adhered.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      {\mathbf{k}} \cdot ({\mathbf{r-r'}}) &amp;= k(z-z') \quad  \&amp; \quad |{\mathbf{r-r'}}| 
      \approx (z-z') +  ({\mathbf{X-X'}})^2/{2(z-z')}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      \phi({\mathbf{r}})   =  1 -i\frac{\pi}{E\lambda}   \int \int \limits_{z'=-\infty}^{z'=z}
      V({\mathbf{X'}},z')     \phi({\mathbf{X'}},z')   \frac{1} {i\lambda (z-z')} \exp\left(ik\frac{|{\mathbf{X-X'}}|^2}{2(z-z')}\right)d{\mathbf{X'}}dz'
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 2\pi /k&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of the electrons with energy &lt;math&gt;(E) = \hbar^2k^2/{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

So far we have set up the mathematical formulation of wave mechanics without addressing the scattering in the material. The interaction constant is defined as

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      \sigma = \pi/E\lambda
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Further we also need to address the transverse spread which is done in terms of Fresnel propagation function

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      p({\mathbf{X}},z) = \frac{1}{iz\lambda} \exp\left(ik\frac{{\mathbf{X}}^2}{2z}\right)
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In multislice simulation the thickness of each slice over which the iteration is performed is usually small and as a result within a slice the potential field can be approximated to be constant &lt;math&gt;V({\mathbf{X'}},z)&lt;/math&gt;. Subsequently, the modulation function can be represented as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      \phi({\mathbf{X}},z_{n+1}) = \int p({\mathbf{X}}-{\mathbf{X'}}, z_{n+1}-z_{n}) \phi({\mathbf{X}},z_{n})\exp\left(-i\sigma\int\limits_{z_{n}}^{z_{n+1}}V({\mathbf{X'}},z')dz'\right)dX'
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can therefore represent the modulation function in the next slice

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \phi_{n+1} = \phi({\mathbf{X}},z_{n+1}) = [q_{n}\phi_{n}]*p_{n} 
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where, * represents convolution, &lt;math&gt;p_{n}=p({\mathbf{X}},z_{n+1}-z_{n})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_{n}({\mathbf{X}})&lt;/math&gt; defines the transmission function of the slice.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      q_{n}({\mathbf{X}})   =  \exp \{-i\sigma \int \limits_{z_{n}}^{z_{n+1}}   V({\mathbf{X}},z')dz'\}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the iterative application of the aforementioned procedure will provide a full interpretation of the sample in context. Further, it should be reiterated that no assumptions have been made on the periodicity of the sample apart from assuming that the potential &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{X},z)&lt;/math&gt; is uniform within the slice. As a result, it is evident that this method in principle will work for any system. However, for aperiodic systems in which the potential will vary rapidly along the beam direction, the slice thickness has to be significantly small and hence will result in higher computational expense.

== Practical Considerations ==

The basic premise is to calculate diffraction from each layer of atoms using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and multiplying each by a phase grating term. The wave is then multiplied by a propagator, inverse Fourier Transformed, multiplied by a phase grating term yet again, and the process is repeated. The use of FFTs allows a significant computational advantage over the Bloch Wave method in particular, since the FFT algorithm involves &lt;math&gt; N \log N&lt;/math&gt; steps compared to the diagonalization problem of the Bloch wave solution which scales as &lt;math&gt;N^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of atoms in the system.  (See Table 1 for comparison of computational time).

The most important step in performing a multislice calculation is setting up the unit cell and determining an appropriate slice thickness. In general, the unit cell used for simulating images will be different from the unit cell that defines the crystal structure of a particular material. The primary reason for this due to aliasing effects which occur due wraparound errors in FFT calculations. The requirement to add additional “padding” to the unit cell has earned the nomenclature “super cell” and the requirement to add these additional pixels to the basic unit cell comes at a computational price.

To illustrate the effect of choosing a slice thickness that is too thin, let us consider a simple example. The Fresnel propagator describes the propagation of electron waves in the z direction (the direction of the incident beam) in a solid:

&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}(\mathbf{u},z) = \tilde{\phi}(\mathbf{u},z=0)\exp(\pi i \lambda \mathbf{u}^2 z)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the reciprocal lattice coordinate, z is the depth in the sample, and lambda is the wavelength of the electron wave (related to the wave vector by the relation &lt;math&gt;k = 2\pi / \lambda&lt;/math&gt;). Figure [fig:SliceThickness] shows vector diagram of the wave-fronts being diffracted by the atomic planes in the sample. In the case of the small-angle approximation (&lt;math&gt;\theta \sim&lt;/math&gt; 100 mRad) we can approximate the phase shift as &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;. For 100 mRad the error &lt;math&gt;d - S &lt;/math&gt; is on the order of 0.5% since &lt;math&gt;\cos(0.1) = 0.995&lt;/math&gt;. For small angles this approximation holds regardless of how many slices there are, although choosing a &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; greater than the lattice parameter (or half the lattice parameter in the case of perovskites) for a multislice simulation would result in missing atoms that should be in the crystal potential.

[[File:MultisliceThickness.png|thumb|MultisliceThickness]]

Additional practical concerns are how to effectively include effects such as inelastic and diffuse scattering, quantized excitations (e.g. plasmons, phonons, excitons), etc. There was one code that took these things into consideration through a coherence function approach &lt;ref name ="Physik"&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D.|title=A Coherence Function Approach to Image Simulation|publisher=Vom Fachbereich Physik Technischen Universitat Darmstadt|author=Heiko Muller|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; called Yet Another Multislice (YAMS), but the code is no longer available either for download or purchase.

==Available Software ==

There are several software packages available to perform multislice simulations of images. Among these is NCEMSS, NUMIS, MacTempas, and Kirkland . Other programs exist but unfortunately many have not been maintained (e.g. SHRLI81 by Mike O’Keefe of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and Cerius2 of Accerlys). A brief chronology of multislice codes is given in Table 2, although this is by no means exhaustive.

== ACEM/JCSTEM ==

This software is developed by Professor Earl Kirkland of Cornell University. This code is freely available as an interactive Java applet and as standalone code written in C/C++. The Java applet is ideal for a quick introduction and simulations under a basic incoherent linear imaging approximation. The ACEM code accompanies an excellent text of the same name by Kirkland  which describes the background theory and computational techniques for simulating electron micrographs (including multislice) in detail. The main C/C++ routines use a command line interface (CLI) for automated batching of many simulation. The ACEM package also includes a graphical user interface that is more appropriate for beginners. The atomic scattering factors in ACEM are accurately characterized by a 12-parameter fit of Gaussians and Lorentzians to relativistic Hartree–Fock calculations. http://people.ccmr.cornell.edu/~kirkland/

== NCEMSS ==

This package was released from the National Center for High Resolution Electron Microscopy. This program uses a mouse-drive graphical user interface and is written by Dr. Roar Kilaas and Dr. Mike O’Keefe of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. While the code is no longer developed, the program is available through the Electron Direct Methods (EDM) package written by Professor Laurence Marks of Northwestern University. Debye-Waller factors can be included in as a parameter to account for diffuse scattering, although the accuracy is unclear (i.e. a good guess of the Debye-Waller factor is needed).

http://www.numis.northwestern.edu/edm/

== NUMIS ==

The Northwestern University Multislice and Imaging System (NUMIS) is a package is written by Professor Laurence Marks of Northwestern University. It uses a command line interface (CLI) and is based in UNIX. A structure file must be provided as input in order to run use this code, which makes it ideal for advanced users. The NUMIS multislice programs use the conventional multislice algorithm by calculating the wavefunction of electrons at the bottom of a crystal and simulating the image taking into account various instrument-specific parameters including &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; and convergence. This program is good to use if one already has structure files for a material that have been used in other calculations (for example, Density Functional Theory). These structure files can be used to general X-Ray structure factors which are then used as input for the PTBV routine in NUMIS. Microscope parameters can be changed through the MICROVB routine.

== MacTempas ==

This software is specifically developed to run in Mac OS X by Dr. Roar Kilaas of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is designed to have a user-friendly user interface and has been well-maintained relative to many other codes (last update May 2013). It is available (for a fee) from http://www.totalresolution.com.

This is a software for multislice simulation was written in FORTRAN 77 by Dr. J. M. Zuo, while he was a postdoc research fellow at Arizona State University under the guidance of Prof. [[John C. H. Spence]]. The source code was published in the book of Electron Microdiffraction.&lt;ref&gt;Electron Microdiffraction, [[John C. H. Spence|J.C. H. Spence]] and J. M. Zuo, Plenum, New York, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison between multislice and Bloch wave simulations for ZnTe was also published in the book. A separate comparison between several multislice algorithms at the year of 2000 was reported in &lt;ref&gt;Koch, C. and J.M. Zuo, “Comparison of multislicecomputer programs for electron scattering simulations and the Bloch wavemethod”, Microscopy and Microanalysis,Vol. 6 Suppl. 2, 126-127, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

== QSTEM: Quantitative TEM/STEM Simulations ==

The executable and source code is available as a free download at the Koch group website: https://archive.is/20130620044224/http://elim.physik.uni-ulm.de/?page_id=834

== STEM-CELL ==

This is a code written by Dr Vincenzo Grillo of the Institute for Nanoscience (CNR)  in Italy. This code is essentially a graphical frontend to the multislice code written by Kirkland, with more additional features. These include tools to generate complex crystalline structures, simulate HAADF images and model the STEM probe, as well as modeling of strain in materials. Tools for image analysis (e.g. GPA) and filtering are also available.

'''Mīmāṃsā''' is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "reflection" or "critical investigation" and thus refers to a tradition of brahminical thought which reflected on the meanings of certain [[Vedic]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mimamsa Mimamsa] Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britenc&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/383181/Mimamsa Mimamsa] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is also known as '''Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā''' because of its focus on the earlier (''pūrva'') Vedic texts dealing with ritual actions, and similarly as '''Karma-Mīmāṃsā''' due to its focus on ritual action (''karma'')&lt;ref name=olil2&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'' (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445&lt;/ref&gt;. It is one of six Vedic "affirming" ([[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]]) schools of [[Hinduism]]. This particular school is known for its philosophical theories on the nature of [[dharma]], based on [[hermeneutics]] of the [[Vedas]], especially the [[Brahmana|Brāḥmanas]] and [[Saṃhita|Saṃhitas]].&lt;ref name=olil&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503&lt;/ref&gt; The Mīmāṃsā school was foundational and influential for the [[Vedanta|vedāntic]] schools, which were also known as '''Uttara-Mīmāṃsā''' for their focus on the "later" (''uttara'') portions of the Vedas, the [[Upaniṣads]]. While both "earlier" and "later" Mīmāṃsā investigate the aim of human action, they do so with different attitudes towards the necessity of ritual praxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ram-Prasad |first1=Chakravarti |title=Knowledge and Action 1: Means to the Human End in Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā and Advaita Vedānta |journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy |date=2000 |volume=1 |issue=28 |pages=1-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mīmāṃsā has several sub-schools, each defined by its [[epistemology]]. The Prābhākara sub-school, which takes its name from the seventh-century philosopher [[Prabhākara]], described the five epistemically reliable means to gaining knowledge: ''[[pratyaksha|pratyakṣa]]'' or perception; ''anumāna'' or inference; ''[[upamāṇa]]'', by comparison and analogy; ''arthāpatti'', the use of postulation and derivation from circumstances; and ''[[śabda]]'', the word or testimony of past or present reliable experts.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; The Bhāṭṭa sub-school, from philosopher [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]], added a sixth means to its canon; ''[[anupalabdhi]]'' meant non-perception, or proof by the absence of cognition (e.g., the ''lack'' of gunpowder on a suspect's hand)&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=jag&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The school of Mīmāṃsā consists of both [[atheism|atheistic]] and [[theism|theistic]] doctrines, but the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of Gods. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, and focused on the epistemology and metaphysics of ''dharma''.&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neville|first=Robert|title=Religious truth|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worthington|first=Vivian|title=A history of yoga|year=1982|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aI9AAAAIAAJ|page=66|isbn=9780710092588}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mīmāṃsā school,  ''[[dharma]]'' meant rituals and social duties, not ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]'', or gods, because gods existed only in name.&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt; The Mīmāṃsakas also held that Vedas are "eternal, author-less, [and] infallible", that Vedic ''vidhi'', or injunctions and [[mantra]]s in rituals are prescriptive ''kārya'' or actions, and the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the Upaniṣads and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality as subsidiary, a philosophical view that Vedānta disagreed with.&lt;ref name=olil/&gt;&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt;

Mīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of [[philology]] and the [[philosophy of language]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter M.

==Darśana (philosophy) – central concerns==
{{See|Hindu philosophy}}

Mīmānsā is one of the six classical Hindu ''darśanas''. It is among the earliest schools of Hindu philosophies.&lt;ref name=britenc/&gt; It has attracted relatively less scholarly study, although its theories and particularly its questions on exegesis and theology have been highly influential on all classical Indian philosophies.{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|pp=337-340}}{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=26-31}}{{sfn|Dan Arnold|2008|pp=57-61, 89-98}} Its analysis of language has been of central importance to the legal literature of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice Winternitz|authorlink=Moriz Winternitz|title=History of Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ql0BmInD1c4C |year=1963|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0056-4|pages=511–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Mīmānsā's central concern was [[epistemology]] (''[[pramana]]''), that is what are the reliable means to knowledge. It debated not only "how does man ever learn or know, whatever he knows", but also whether the nature of all knowledge is inherently circular, whether those such as [[Foundationalism|foundationalists]] who critique the validity of any "justified beliefs" and knowledge system make flawed presumptions of the very premises they critique, and how to correctly interpret and avoid incorrectly interpreting [[dharma]] texts such as the [[Vedas]].{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=28-32}} It asked questions such as "what is ''devata'' (god)?", "are rituals dedicated to ''devatas'' efficacious?", "what makes anything efficacious?", and "can it be proved that the Vedas, or any canonical text in any system of thought, fallible or infallible (''svatah pramanya'', intrinsically valid)?, if so, how?" and others.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=26-33}}{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|pp=337-342}} To Mīmānsā scholars, the nature of non-empirical knowledge and human means to it are such that one can never demonstrate certainty, one can only falsify knowledge claims, in some cases.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=27, 29-30}} According to [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]], a professor at Harvard Divinity School specializing on Hinduism, the Mīmānsā school is "one of the most distinctively Hindu forms of thinking; it is without real parallel elsewhere in the world".{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|p=337}}

The central text of the Mīmānsā school is Jamini's ''Mīmānsā Sutras'', along with the historically influential commentaries on this [[sutra]] by Sabara and by Kumarila Bhatta.{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|p=337}}{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=27-29}} Together, these texts develop and apply the rules of language analysis (such as the rules of contradiction), asserting that one must not only examine injunctive propositions in any scripture, but also examine the alternate related or reverse propositions for better understanding. They suggested that to reach correct and valid knowledge it is not only sufficient to demand proof of a proposition, it is important to give proof of a proposition's negative as well as declare and prove one's own preferred propositions. Further, they asserted that whenever perception is not the means of direct proof and knowledge, one cannot prove such non-empirical propositions to be "true or not true", rather one can only prove a non-empirical proposition is "false, not false, or uncertain".{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=28-35}}

For example, Mīmānsākas welcome not only the demand for proof of an injunctive proposition such as "[[agnihotra]] ritual leads one to heaven", but suggest that one must examine and prove alternate propositions such as "ritual does not lead one to heaven",  "something else leads one to heaven", "there is heaven", "there is no heaven" and so on. Mīmānsā literature states that if satisfactory, verifiable proof for all of such propositions cannot be found by its proponents and its opponents, then the proposition needs to be accepted as a part of a "belief system".{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=27-29}}{{sfn|Dan Arnold|2008|pp=57-79}} Beliefs, such as those in the scriptures (Vedas), must be accepted to be true unless its opponents can demonstrate the proof of validity of their own texts or teacher(s) these opponents presume to be ''prima facie justified'', and until these opponents can demonstrate that the scriptures they challenge are false. If they do not try to do so, it is hypocrisy; if they try to do so, it can only lead to infinite regress, according to Mīmānsākas.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=28-32}}{{sfn|Dan Arnold|2008|pp=89-114}} Any historic scripture with widespread social acceptance, according to Mīmānsāka, is an activity of communication (''vyavaharapravrtti'') and is accepted as authoritative because it is socially validated practice, unless perceptually verifiable evidence emerges that proves parts or all of it as false or harmful.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=31-33, 36-38}}

Mīmānsākas were predominantly concerned with the central motivation of human beings, the [[summum bonum|highest good]], and actions that make this possible.{{sfn|Prasad|1994|pp=317-318}} They stated that human beings seek ''niratisaya priti'' (unending ecstatic pleasure, joy, happiness) in this life and the next. They argued that this highest good is the result of one's own ethical actions (''[[dharma]]''), that such actions are what the Vedic sentences contain and communicate, and therefore it important to properly interpret and understand Vedic sentences, words and meaning.{{sfn|Prasad|1994|pp=317-318}}{{sfn|P. T. Raju|1985|pp=17, 41-47, 61-63, Quote (p. 62): "The ideal life, according to the Mimamsa, is thus a life of continuous ethical activity and enjoyment of its fruits."}} Mīmānsā scholarship was centrally concerned with the philosophy of language, how human beings learn and communicate with each other and across generations with language in order to act in a manner that enables them to achieve that which motivates them.{{sfn|Prasad|1994|pp=317-319}}{{sfn|J.F. Staal|1976|pp=112-117}} The Mīmānsā school focussed on ''dharma'', deriving ethics and activity from the ''karma-kanda'' (rituals) part of the Vedas, with the argument that ethics for this life and efficacious action for ''svarga'' (heaven) cannot be derived from sense-perception, and can only be derived from experience, reflection and understanding of past teachings.{{sfn|Shyam Ranganathan|2007|pp=298-302, 348-349}}

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 6px #FFE0BB;padding:1.0em"&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
In every human activity, the motivating force to perform an action is his innate longing for ''priti'' (pleasure, happiness&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda, Johannes Bronkhorst and Elisa Freschi translate "priti" as happiness; e.g. see, {{cite book|author=Elisa Freschi|title=Duty, Language and Exegesis in Prabhakara Mimamsa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhX3I99EbQ0C&amp;pg=PA380|year=2012|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-22260-1|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;),
whether at the lowest level or the highest level.
At the highest level, it is nothing but an unsurpassed state of ''priti'',
which is ensured only by performing ethical actions.
&lt;/poem&gt;
– Sabara, 2nd century Mīmānsā scholar{{sfn|Prasad|1994|p=339 note 5, Mimamsasutrabhasya 4.3.15}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Daniel Arnold, Mīmānsā scholarship has "striking affinities" with that of [[William Alston]], the 20th century Western philosopher, along with some notable differences.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=41-43}} The Mīmānsākas subjected to a radical critique, more than two thousand years ago, states Francis Clooney, the notions such as "God," the "sacred text," the "author" and the "anthropocentric ordering of reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Why the Veda Has No Author: Language as Ritual in Early Mīmāṃsā and Post-Modern Theology |author= Francis X.

==Epistemology==
In the field of [[epistemology]], later Mīmāṃsākas made some notable contributions. Unlike the [[Nyaya]] or the [[Vaisheshika]] systems, the {{IAST|Prābhākara}} sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes five means of valid knowledge (Skt. ''[[pramāṇa]]''). The {{IAST|Bhāṭṭa}} sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes one additional sixth, namely ''anuapalabdhi'', just like [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism. These six epistemically reliable means of gaining knowledge are:

===Pratyaksa===
Main article : [[Pratyaksha]]

''[[Pratyaksha|Pratyakṣa]]'' (प्रत्यक्ष्य) means perception. It is of two types in Mīmānsā and other schools of Hinduism: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref name=kamal&gt;MM Kamal (1998), The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 46(2): 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198239765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception:&lt;ref name=kpmat/&gt; ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient scholars proposed "unusual perception" as ''pramana'' and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some schools of Hinduism considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from ''Pratyakṣa-pramana'', so as to contrast ''nirnaya'' (definite judgment, conclusion) from ''anadhyavasaya'' (indefinite judgment).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anumana===
Main article : [[Anumana]]

''[[Anumāṇa]]'' (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''.&lt;ref name=kamal/&gt; In all except one Hindu philosophies,&lt;ref&gt;Carvaka school is the exception&lt;/ref&gt; this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: ''pratijna'' (hypothesis), ''hetu'' (a reason), and ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: ''sadhya'' (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and ''paksha'' (the object on which the ''sadhya'' is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if ''sapaksha'' (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if ''vipaksha'' (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand ''Vyapti'' - the requirement that the ''hetu'' (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both ''sapaksha'' and ''vipaksha''.&lt;ref name=jl4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a ''nigamana'' (conclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upamana===
Main article : [[Upamāṇa]]

''[[Upamāṇa]]'' means comparison and analogy.&lt;ref name=dpsb&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood&gt;[[Gavin Flood]], An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;VN Jha (1986), "The upamana-pramana in Purvamimamsa", SILLE, pages 77-91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Upamana'', states Lochtefeld,&lt;ref name=jl721/&gt; may be explained with the example of a traveller who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later.&lt;ref name=jl721&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Upamana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 721&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of comparison is formally called ''upameyam'', the object of comparison is called ''upamanam'', while the attribute(s) are identified as ''samanya''.&lt;ref name=mw457&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, pages 457-458&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, explains [[Monier Monier-Williams]], if a boy says "her face is like the moon in charmingness", "her face" is ''upameyam'', the moon is ''upamanam'', and charmingness is ''samanya''. The  7th century text [[Bhaṭṭikāvya]] in verses 10.28 through 10.63 discusses many types of comparisons and analogies, identifying when this epistemic method is more useful and reliable, and when it is not.&lt;ref name=mw457/&gt; In various ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, 32 types of ''Upanama'' and their value in epistemology are debated.

===Arthāpatti===
{{Main|Arthāpatti}}

''[[Arthāpatti]]'' (अर्थापत्ति) means postulation, derivation from circumstances.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; In contemporary logic, this ''pramāṇa'' is similar to circumstantial [[Modus ponens|implication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36920/arthapatti Arthapatti] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this ''pramāṇa'' as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Arthapatti" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable. Another common example for ''arthāpatti'' found in the texts of Mīmāṃsā  and other schools of Hinduism is, that if "Devadatta is fat" and "Devadatta does not eat in day", then the following must be true: "Devadatta eats in the night". This form of postulation and deriving from circumstances is, claim the Indian scholars, a means to discovery, proper insight and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (1996), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, pages 41-63&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu schools that accept this means of knowledge state that this method is a valid means to conditional knowledge and truths about a subject and object in original premises or different premises. The schools that do not accept this method, state that postulation, extrapolation and circumstantial implication is either derivable from other ''pramāṇas'' or flawed means to correct knowledge, instead one must rely on direct perception or proper inference.&lt;ref&gt;DM Datta (1932), The Six Ways of Knowing: A Critical study of the Advaita theory of knowledge, University of Calcutta, Reprinted in 1992 as {{ISBN|978-8120835269}}, pages 221-253&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anupalabdhi===
Main article : [[Anupalabdhi]], See also: [[Abhava]]

''[[Anupalabdhi|Anupalabdi]]'' (अनुपलब्धि), accepted only by Kumarila Bhatta sub-school of Mīmāṃsā, means non-perception, negative/cognitive proof.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; ''Anupalabdhi pramana'' suggests that knowing a negative, such as "there is no jug in this room" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Abhava" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the two schools of Hinduism that consider ''Anupalabdhi'' as epistemically valuable, a valid conclusion is either ''sadrupa'' (positive) or ''asadrupa'' (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other ''pramana'', Indian scholars refined ''Anupalabdi'' to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept "non-perception" as a ''pramana''. The schools that endorsed ''Anupalabdi'' affirmed that it as valid and useful when the other five ''pramanas'' fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;

''[[Abhava]]'' (अभाव) means non-existence. Some scholars consider ''Anupalabdi'' to be same as ''Abhava'',&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt; while others consider ''Anupalabdi'' and ''Abhava'' as different.&lt;ref name=ds&gt;D Sharma (1966), Epistemological negative dialectics of Indian logic — Abhāva versus Anupalabdhi, Indo-Iranian Journal, 9(4): 291-300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 155-174, 227-255&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhava-pramana'' has been discussed in ancient Hindu texts in the context of ''[[Padārtha]]'' (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A ''Padartha'' is defined as that which is simultaneously ''Astitva'' (existent), ''Jneyatva'' (knowable) and ''Abhidheyatva'' (nameable).&lt;ref name=chba/&gt; Specific examples of ''padartha'', states Bartley, include ''dravya'' (substance), ''[[guna]]'' (quality), ''karma'' (activity/motion), ''samanya/jati'' (universal/class property), ''samavaya'' (inherence) and ''vishesha'' (individuality). ''Abhava'' is then explained as "referents of negative expression" in contrast to "[[Sense and reference|referents]] of positive expression" in ''Padartha''.&lt;ref name=chba/&gt; An absence, state the ancient scholars, is also "existent, knowable and nameable", giving the example of negative numbers, silence as a form of testimony, ''asatkaryavada'' theory of causation, and analysis of deficit as real and valuable. ''Abhava'' was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: ''dhvamsa'' (termination of what existed), ''atyanta-abhava'' (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), ''anyonya-abhava'' (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and ''pragavasa'' (prior, antecedent non-existence).&lt;ref name=chba&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), ''Padartha'', in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, pages 415-416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohan Lal (Editor), The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, Vol. 5, Sahitya Akademy, {{ISBN|81-260-1221-8}}, page 3958&lt;/ref&gt;

This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through ''Sabda'' (words).&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the ''Sabda'' of reliable sources.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as [[Carvaka]], state that this is never possible, and therefore ''Sabda'' is not a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to Vedanta school===
An interesting feature of the Mīmāṃsā school of philosophy is its unique epistemological theory of the intrinsic validity of all cognition as such. It is held that all knowledge is ''ipso facto'' true (Skt. ''svataḥ prāmāṇyavāda''). Thus, what is to be proven is not the truth of a cognition, but its falsity. The Mīmāṃsākas advocate the self-validity of knowledge both in respect of its origin (''utpatti'') and ascertainment (''jñapti''). Not only did the Mīmāṃsākas make the very great use of this theory to establish the unchallengeable validity of the [[Veda]]s, but later Vedantists also drew freely upon this particular Mīmāṃsā contribution.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Metaphysics and beliefs==
The core tenets of {{IAST|''Pūrva Mīmāṃsā''}} are [[ritual]]ism ([[orthopraxy]]), anti-asceticism and anti-mysticism. The central aim of the school is elucidation of the nature of ''[[dharma]]'', understood as a set ritual obligations and prerogatives to be performed properly.

===Atheism===
Mīmāṃsā theorists decided that the evidence allegedly proving the [[existence of God]] was insufficient. They argue that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious truth|first=Robert|last=Neville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThLR13JpCWsC|page=51|isbn=9780791447789|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mīmāṃsā argues that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the ''[[mantra]]s'' that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought |first=Harold |last=Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C|page=114|isbn=9780791473368 |date=2008-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dharma''===
[[Dharma]] as understood by Pūrva Mīmāṃsā can be loosely translated into English as "virtue", "morality" or "duty". The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school traces the source of the knowledge of dharma neither to sense-experience nor inference, but to verbal [[cognition]] (i.e. knowledge of words and meanings) according to Vedas. In this respect it is related to the [[Nyāya]] school, the latter, however, accepts only four sources of knowledge (''pramāṇa'') as valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=Subodh|title=The Philosophy Of Vaisnavism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lariw7EILCAC&amp;pg=PA60|year=2004|publisher=Cosmo Publications|isbn=978-81-7755-886-9|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school held [[dharma]] to be equivalent to following the prescriptions of the [[Samhita|Saṃhitās]] and their [[Brāhmaṇa]] commentaries relating the correct performance of [[yajña|Vedic ritual]]s. Seen in this light, Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is essentially ritualist ([[orthopraxy]]), placing great weight on the performance of [[karma]] or action as enjoined by the Vedas.

===Relation to Vedānta===
Emphasis of Yajnic Karmakāṇḍas in Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is erroneously interpreted by some to be an opposition to Jñānakāṇḍa of Vedānta and Upaniṣads. Pūrva Mīmāṃsā does not discuss topics related to Jñānakāṇḍa, such as salvation (''mokṣa''), but it never speaks against [[mokṣa]]. Vedānta quotes Jaimini's belief in Brahman as well as in mokṣa:

In Uttara-Mīmāṃsā or Vedānta (4.4.5-7), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying (ब्राह्मेण जैमिनिरूपन्यासादिभ्यः) "''(The mukta Puruṣa is united with the Brahman) as if it were like the Brahman, because descriptions (in Śruti etc) prove so''".

In Vedānta (1.2.28), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying that "There is no contradiction in taking Vaishvānara as the supreme Brahman".

In 1.2.31, Jaimini is again quoted by Bāḍarāyana as saying that the nirguna (attribute-less) Brahman can manifest itself as having a form.

In 4.3.12, Bādarāyana again cites Jaimini as saying that the mukta Purusha attains Brahman.

In Pūrva Mīmāṃsā too, Jaimini emphasises the importance of faith in and attachment to the Omnipotent Supreme Being Whom Jaimini calls "The Omnipotent Pradhaana" (The Main):

Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1: "sarvaśaktau pravṛttiḥ syāt tathābhūtopadeśāt" (सर्वशक्तौ प्रवृत्तिः स्यात् तथाभूतोपदेशात्). The term ''upadeśa'' here means instructions of the śāstras as taught. We should tend towards the omnipotent supreme being. In the context of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1 shown above, next two sutras becomes significant, in which this Omnipotent Being is termed as "[[Pradhana|pradhāna]]", and keeping away from Him is said to be a "doṣa", hence all beings are asked to get related ("abhisambandhāt" in  tadakarmaṇi ca doṣas tasmāt tato viśeṣaḥ syāt pradhānenābhisambandhāt; Jaimini 6, 3.3) to the "Omnipotent Main Being" (api vāpy ekadeśe syāt pradhāne hy arthanirvṛttir guṇamātram itarat tadarthatvāt; Jaimini 6, 3.2). Karma-Mīmāṃsā supports the Vedas, and Rgveda says that one Truth is variously named by the sages. It is irrelevant whether we call Him as Pradhāna or Brahman or Vaishvānara or Shiva or God.

==History==
The school's origins lie in the scholarly traditions of the final centuries BCE, when the priestly ritualism of Vedic sacrifice was being marginalized by [[Buddhism]] and [[Vedanta]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} To counteract this challenge, several groups emerged dedicated to demonstrating the validity of the Vedic texts by rigid formulation of rules for their interpretation. The school gathers momentum in the [[Gupta period]] with [[Śābara]], and reaches its apex in the 7th to 8th centuries with {{IAST|[[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]]}} and [[Prabhākara]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The school for some time in the Early Middle Ages exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought, and is credited as a major force contributing to the [[decline of Buddhism in India]], but it has fallen into decline in the High Middle Ages and  today is all but eclipsed by Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;Göhler (1995), p. 5f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mīmānsā texts==
The foundational text for the Mīmāṃsā school is the [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras|Purva Mīmāṃsā Sutras]] of [[Jaimini]] (ca. 5th to 4th century BCE). A major commentary was composed by [[Śābara]] in ca. the 1th century BC. The school reaches its height with [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|{{IAST|Kumārila Bhaṭṭa}}]] and {{IAST|[[Prabhākara]]}} (fl. ca. 700 CE). Both Kumarila Bhatta and Prabhākara (along with {{IAST|Murāri}}, whose work is no more extant) have written extensive commentaries on [[Śābara]]'s Mīmāṃsāsūtrabhāṣyam.
Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, Mandana Miśra, Pārthasārathi Miśra, Sucarita Miśra, Ramakrishna Bhatta, Madhava Subhodini, Sankara Bhatta, Krsnayajvan, Anantadeva, Gaga Bhatta, Ragavendra Tirtha, VijayIndhra Tirtha, Appayya Dikshitar, Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri, Mahomahapadyaya Sri Ramsubba Sastri, Sri Venkatsubba Sastri, Sri A. Chinnaswami Sastri, Sengalipuram Vaidhyanatha Dikshitar were some of Mīmānsā scholars.

The ''{{IAST |Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}'' of Jaimini (c. 3rd century BCE) has summed up the general rules of ''{{IAST |nyāya}}'' for Vedic interpretation. The text has 12 chapters, of which the first chapter is of philosophical value. The commentaries on the ''{{IAST |Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}'' by {{IAST |Bhartṛmitra}}, {{IAST |Bhavadāsa}}, Hari and {{IAST|Upavarṣa}} are no more extant. {{IAST |Śabara}} (c. 1st century BCE) is the first commentator of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}'', whose work is available to us. His ''{{IAST |bhāṣya}}'' is the basis of all later works of ''{{IAST |Mīmāṁsā }}''. {{IAST |Kumārila Bhaṭṭa}} (7th century CE), the founder of the first school of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' commented on both the ''{{IAST|Sūtra}}'' and its ''{{IAST |Śabara Bhāṣya}}''. His treatise consists of 3 parts, the ''{{IAST|Ślokavārttika}}'', the ''{{IAST |Tantravārttika}}'' and the ''{{IAST |Ṭupṭīkā}}''. {{IAST|Manḍana Miśra}} (8th century CE) was a follower of {{IAST |Kumārila}}, who wrote ''Vidhiviveka'' and  ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsānukramaṇī}}''. There are several commentaries on the works of {{IAST|Kumārila}}. {{IAST|Sucarita Miśra}} wrote a ''{{IAST|Kāśikā}}'' (commentary) on the ''{{IAST|Ślokavārttika}}''. {{IAST|Someśvara Bhatta}} wrote ''{{IAST|Nyāyasudhā}}'', also known as ''{{IAST|Rāṇaka}}'', a commentary on the ''{{IAST |Tantravārttika}}''. {{IAST|Pārthasarathi Miśra}} wrote ''{{IAST|Nyāyaratnākara}}'' (1300 CE), another commentary on the ''{{IAST|Ślokavārttika}}''. He also wrote ''{{IAST |Śāstradīpikā}}'', an independent work on the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' and ''Tantraratna''. {{IAST|Venkaṭa Dīkṣita}}’s   ''{{IAST|Vārttikabharaṇya}}'' is a commentary on the ''{{IAST |Ṭupṭīkā}}''. {{IAST |Prabhākara}} (8th century CE), the originator of the second school of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' wrote his commentary ''{{IAST|Bṛhatī}}'' on the ''{{IAST |Śabara Bhāṣya}}''. {{IAST |Śālikanātha}}’s ''{{IAST |Ṛjuvimalā}}'' (ninth century CE) is a commentary on the ''{{IAST|Bṛhatī}}''. His ''{{IAST |Prakaraṇapañcikā}}'' is an independent work of this school and the ''{{IAST|Pariśiṣṭa}}'' is a brief explanation of the ''{{IAST |Śabara Bhāṣya}}''. {{IAST |Bhavanātha}}’s ''{{IAST|Nyāyaviveka}}'' deals with the views of this school in details. The founder of the third school of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' was {{IAST|Murāri}}, whose works have not reached us.

{{IAST|Āpadeva}} (17th century) wrote an elementary work on the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'', known as ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsānyāyaprakaśa}}'' or ''{{IAST|Āpadevī}}''.  ''{{IAST |Arthasaṁgraha}}'' of  {{IAST |Laugākṣi Bhāskara}} is based on the ''{{IAST|Āpadevī}}''. {{IAST|Vedānta Deśika}}’s ''{{IAST |Śeśvara Mīmāṁsā}}'' was an attempt to combine the views of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' and the ''{{IAST|Vedānta}}'' schools.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. ''Indian Philosophy'', Vol. II, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-563820-4}}, pp.376-78&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Bradd Shore]], the '''''neuromantic'''''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Shore|first=Bradd|title=Culture in Mind: Cognition, Culture, and the Problem of Meaning|url=|volume=|pages=141, 143–4|year=1996|location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=|isbn=|id=|authorlink=Bradd Shore|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the cybernetic frame of mind among excited computer enthusiasts as they experience what Michael Heim called "the all-at-once simultaneity of totalizing presentness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Shore explains that "the sense of mastery over language resources that word processing bestows on the experienced user is intimately related to [[Martin Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell|enframing ''(Bestellen'')]], a subjection of the world to human will that Heidegger saw as a characteristic of all modern technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There are sources that claim the concept of neuromantic is not only confined to computer enthusiasts. For instance, there is the so-called neuromantic imagination that inspire architects. Here, the cybernetic frame of mind is fired by the concept of the "third nature," which is occupied by those who inhabit not the actual terrain in which we live, work, and play but the virtual space of media flows that enter the "unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teletechnologies, Place, and Community|last=Wilken|first=Rowan|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415875950|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Flow (psychology)|Flowstates]].

==Academic preparation==
Torres's academic background includes studies in [[Cultural Anthropology]], Puerto Rican studies, [[Art]] and [[Latin American studies]]. Torres graduated from [[Rutgers University]], the State University of New Jersey at Livingston College in June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taino-tribe.org/diplo.htm ''A Taino Indian Graduates From Rutgers University, The Newark Star Ledger Newspaper: "A Cap Of A Different Color" ''] Retrieved 31 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural activism==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s Torres did research aimed at documenting [[Taino]] artifacts and history through the [[Institute of Puerto Rican Culture|CPI]] Comite Pro Indigenismo. In the mid 1970s Torres had translated the very first theater script from the Spanish language to the Taino language as a former Actor and member of El Grupo Guazabara (The Guazabara Theater Group). In 1993 he founded the Taino Inter-Tribal Council (TITC, Inc.), a not-for-profit Taino cultural-educational organization. He worked at various archaeological sites, including Puerto De Tierra in the 1970s. For over five (5) decades and many years, Torres has advocated the reclaiming and repatriation of artifacts pertaining to the past Pre-Columbian historical territory of the principal regional Chief [[Orocobix]] of the Jatibonicu Taino tribe, a tribe located in the central mountain region of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taino-tribe.org/t-exhibit.htm ''1973 Pre-Columbian Taino Art Exhibit "Our Profound Taino Roots." '' Retrieved 31 March 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; It should be mentioned that Torres is credited and recognized as being a Taino Native Civil Rights activist and one of the original founding Fathers of the 1968 Taino Indian Movement of Puerto Rico.

He is an activist for the official government recognition of the Taino American Indian people and his Jatibonicu Taino tribal community of Puerto Rico and in New Jersey. As tribal leader, Torres is politically active in Taino tribal council government, national and international political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taino-tribe.org ''Tribal Government of the Jatibonicu Taino People of Puerto Rico.''] Retrieved 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often known as Don Pedro or [[Tribal chief|Chief]] Guanikeyu, in 1996 Torres called for the "Taino national unity of all the Taino Indian people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/Taino/docs/call.html ''A call for Taino national unity: from the great grandson of Chief Orocobix, and tribal Elder of the District of Jatibonicu.''] Retrieved 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Torres represented the Jatibonicu Taino Tribal Nation before the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taino-tribe.org/us-census.html ''A Taino Tribal Leader Meets With Heads of US Census.''] Retrieved 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his Taino tribal activism he has written various papers and articles on the relevancy of Taino culture and the history of Tainos in Puerto Rico, Florida and adjacent areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyunque.com/Taino.htm ''PUERTO RICO HISTORY THE TAINO PEOPLE.''] Retrieved 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Torres also performed as a Taino language teacher and researcher. As a tribal leader, he conducted the traditional Taino Guatiao (naming ceremony) and has bestowed the Taino name on many modern Taino people today. He also promoted the Taino language when he was chosen to name a crater on planet Venus that he named Nanichi "My Love or My Heart" in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/4140?__fsk=-1932054963 ''The Naming of Crater "Nanichi" that was approved and adopted by the International body of the IAU in 2000.''] Retrieved 23 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resignation and subsequent return==
Due to failing health, in 2001, Guanikeyu Torres withdrew from the leading role of his Taino tribal community and assumed the post of tribal elder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/41/274.html ''My Fairwell Letter To The Taino People in the Year 2001.''] World History archives: The contemporary political history of the Taino in general. 1 January 2001.

{{Nihongo|'''Poka-yoke'''|ポカヨケ||{{IPA-ja|poka joke|}}}} is a Japanese term that means "mistake-proofing" or "inadvertent error [[:wikt:prevention|prevention]]". The key word in the second translation, often omitted, is "inadvertent". There is no poka-yoke solution that protects against an operator's sabotage, but sabotage is a rare behavior among people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BcH1CwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Standardized Work with TWI: Eliminating Human Errors in Production and Service Processes|last=Misiurek|first=Bartosz|publisher=Productivity Press|year=2016|isbn=9781498737548|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poka-yoke is any mechanism in any process that helps an equipment operator avoid (''yokeru'') mistakes (''poka''). Its purpose is to eliminate product defects by preventing, correcting, or drawing attention to [[human error]]s as they occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Using Poka-Yoke Techniques for Early Defect Detection | url=http://facultyweb.berry.edu/jgrout/pokasoft.html | last= Robinson | first=Harry | year=1997 | accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was formalised, and the term adopted, by [[Shigeo Shingo]] as part of the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref name=Shigeo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Brief Tutorial on Mistake-proofing, Poka-Yoke, and ZQC | url=http://www.mistakeproofing.com/tutorial.html | author=John R. Grout, Brian T. Downs | accessdate=May 4, 2009 | publisher=MistakeProofing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally described as ''[[Baka (fool)|baka]]-yoke'', but as this means "fool-proofing" (or "[[Idiot proof|idiot-proofing]]") the name was changed to the milder ''poka-yoke''.

==Usage==
More broadly, the term can refer to any [[behavior-shaping constraint]] designed into a process to prevent incorrect operation by the user. 

A simple poka-yoke example is demonstrated when a driver of the car equipped with a manual gearbox must press on the clutch pedal (a process step, therefore a poka-yoke) prior to starting an automobile. The interlock serves to prevent unintended movement of the car. Another example of poka-yoke would be the car equipped with an automatic transmission, which has a switch that requires the car to be in "Park" or "Neutral" before the car can be started (some automatic transmissions require the brake pedal to be depressed as well). These serve as behavior-shaping constraints as the action of "car in Park (or Neutral)" or "foot depressing the clutch/brake pedal" must be performed before the car is allowed to start. The requirement of a depressed brake pedal to shift  most of the cars with an automatic transmission from "Park" to any other gear is yet another example of a poka-yoke application. Over time, the driver's behavior is conformed with the requirements by repetition and habit.

==History==
The term poka-yoke was applied by [[Shigeo Shingo]] in the 1960s to industrial processes designed to prevent human errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Using Poka-Yoke techniques for early defect detection | url=http://facultyweb.berry.edu/jgrout/pokasoft.html | author=H Robinson | accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shingo redesigned a process in which factory workers, while assembling a small switch, would often forget to insert the required spring under one of the switch buttons. In the redesigned process, the worker would perform the task in two steps, first preparing the two required springs and placing them in a placeholder, then inserting the springs from the placeholder into the switch. When a spring remained in the placeholder, the workers knew that they had forgotten to insert it and could correct the mistake effortlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Sayings of Shigeo Shingo: Key Strategies for Plant Improvement | url=http://www.qualitycoach.net/products/the-sayings-of-shigeo-shingo-key-strategies-f.asp | accessdate=August 20, 2012 | publisher=QualityCoach.Net }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shingo distinguished between the concepts of inevitable human [[Error|mistake]]s and [[Product defect|defect]]s in the production. Defects occur when the mistakes are allowed to reach the customer. The aim of poka-yoke is to design the process so that mistakes can be detected and corrected immediately, eliminating defects at the source.

== Implementation in manufacturing ==
Poka-yoke can be implemented at any step of a manufacturing process where something can go wrong or an error can be made.&lt;ref name=qualityportal&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thequalityportal.com/pokayoke.htm | title=Poka Yoke or Mistake Proofing :: Overview | publisher=The Quality Portal | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a [[fixture (tool)|fixture]] that holds pieces for processing might be modified to only allow pieces to be held in the correct orientation,&lt;ref name="NKS"&gt;{{cite book |author = Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun |authorlink=Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun |title=Poka-yoke: improving product quality by preventing defects |publisher=Productivity Press |year=1988 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hR_8Ulz6d_oC&amp;pg=PA111 111] |isbn=978-0-915299-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a digital counter might track the number of spot welds on each piece to ensure that the worker executes the correct number of welds.&lt;ref name="NKS" /&gt;

Shigeo Shingo recognized three types of poka-yoke for detecting and preventing errors in a [[mass production]] system:&lt;ref name=Shigeo&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Shigeo | last1 = Shingo |authorlink=Shigeo Shingo  | first2 = Andrew  | last2 = Dillon |title=A study of the Toyota production system from an industrial engineering viewpoint |publisher = Productivity Press | location = Portland, OR |year=1989 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=RKWU7WElJ7oC&amp;pg=PA22 | isbn = 0-915299-17-8 |oclc=19740349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qualityportal /&gt;

# The ''contact'' method identifies product defects by testing the product's shape, size, color, or other physical attributes.
# The ''fixed-value'' (or ''constant number'') method alerts the operator if a certain number of movements are not made.
# The ''motion-step'' (or ''sequence'') method determines whether the prescribed steps of the process have been followed.

Either the operator is alerted when a mistake is about to be made, or the poka-yoke device actually prevents the mistake from being made. In Shingo's lexicon, the former implementation would be called a ''warning'' poka-yoke, while the latter would be referred to as a ''control'' poka-yoke.&lt;ref name="Shigeo" /&gt;

Shingo argued that errors are inevitable in any [[manufacturing]] process, but that if appropriate poka-yokes are implemented, then mistakes can be caught quickly and prevented from resulting in defects. By eliminating defects at the source, the cost of mistakes within a company is reduced.{{citation needed|date = June 2013}}

A methodic approach to build up poka-yoke countermeasures has been proposed by the Applied Problem Solving (APS) methodology,&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Fantin (2014). Applied Problem Solving. Method, Applications, Root Causes, Countermeasures, Poka-Yoke and A3. How to make things happen to solve problems. Milan, Italy: Createspace, an Amazon company. {{ISBN|978-1499122282}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of a three-step analysis of the risks to be managed:
# Identification of the need
# Identification of possible mistakes
# Management of mistakes before satisfying the need
This approach can be used to [[Murphy's law|emphasize]] the technical aspect of finding effective solutions during brainstorming sessions.

== Benefits of poka-yoke implementation ==
A typical feature of poka-yoke solutions is that they don't let an error in a process happen. But that is just one of their advantages. Others include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Less time spent on training workers;
* Elimination of many operations related to [[quality control]];
* Unburdening of operators from repetitive operations;
* Promotion of the work improvement-oriented approach and actions;
* A reduced number of rejects;
* Immediate action when a problem occurs;
* 100% built-in [[quality control]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18157">According to the [[United States Office of Government Ethics]], a '''political appointee''' is "any employee who is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], or agency head".  As of 2016, there are around 4,000 political appointment positions which an incoming administration needs to review, and fill or confirm, of which about 1,200 require Senate confirmation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These positions are published in the ''[[United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions]]'' (Plum Book), a new edition of which is released after each [[United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plum Book: About|url=https://m.gpo.gov/plumbook/|publisher=Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types ==
There are four basic categories of political appointments:

* '''Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation (PAS)''': These positions require a [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearing]] and a confirmation vote of the full Senate under the [[Appointments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1251_ed9g.pdf NLRB v. SW General, Inc.]'', no. 15-1251 (March 21, 2017) (U.S. Supreme Court)&lt;/ref&gt; As at 2016, PAS positions included [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|1,212 senior positions]], including the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] secretaries and their subordinates at the Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, and Assistant Secretary levels; the heads of most [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agencies]]; and [[Ambassadors of the United States|ambassadors]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://presidentialtransition.org/blog/posts/160316_help-wanted-4000-appointees.php|title=Help Wanted: 4,000 Presidential Appointees|last=Piaker|first=Zach|date=2016-03-16|work=|newspaper=[[Partnership for Public Service]] Center for Presidential Transition|access-date=2016-11-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes [[United States Attorney|United States Attorneys]] and [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshals]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/14/opinion/donald-trump-is-now-hiring.html|title=Donald Trump Is Now Hiring|last=The Editorial Board|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011]] reclassified about 170 PAS positions to PA, to no longer needing Senate confirmation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fcw.com/articles/2012/11/09/hire-presidential-appointees.aspx|title=How to become a presidential appointee|last=Tuutti|first=Camille|date=2012-11-09|website=FCW|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[ttps://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/08/obama-signs-bill-giving-him-more-power-over-appointments-132463 Obama signs bill giving him more power over appointments]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Presidential appointments without Senate confirmation (PA)''': These appointments do not require a Senate hearing or vote.  As at 2016, there were 353 PA positions, most of which were in the [[Executive Office of the President]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Non-career Senior Executive Service (NA)''': The [[Senior Executive Service (United States)|Senior Executive Service]] (SES) forms the level just below the presidential appointees.  While the SES largely consists of career officials, up to 10%, or (as of 2016) 680 positions, can be political appointees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Schedule C appointments (SC)''': [[Schedule C appointment|Schedule C appointees]] serve in confidential or policy roles immediately subordinate to other appointees.  As of 2016, there are 1,403 Schedule C appointees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Unlike the presidential appointments, the non-career SES and Schedule C appointments tend to be made within each agency and then approved by the [[Office of Presidential Personnel]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ethics restrictions ==
Political appointees, referring broadly to anyone appointed by the President, the Vice President, or agency head, are subject to more ethics restrictions than regular executive-branch employees. There are two categories of appointees, and each category is subject to additional and slightly different ethics restrictions.&lt;ref name="oge" /&gt;
* The [[spoils system]]/patronage system is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party as opposed to a merit system, where offices are awarded on the basis of some measure of merit independent of political activity.
* The [[merit system]] is the process of promoting and hiring government employees based on their ability to perform a job, rather than on their political connections. It is the opposite of the spoils system. A common conception of the federal government's merit system principles is that they are designed to ensure fair and open recruitment and competition and employment practices free of political influence or other non-merit factors. Although that is certainly true, a closer reading of those principles suggests a much broader policy objective that relates directly to managing the ongoing performance of the federal workforce.
Political appointees are required to take an ethics pledge not to accept gifts from [[lobbyists]]. This is because of [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13490 Under [[s:Executive_Order_12674#Sec._102._Limitations_on_Outside_Earned_Income|Section 102]] of Executive Order 12674, political appointees who are appointed by the president are not allowed to receive any income from outside employment or activities.&lt;ref name="oge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Appointees|url=http://www.oge.gov/Topics/Selected-Employee-Categories/Political-Appointees/|publisher=U.S. Office of Government Ethics|accessdate=2013-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217212029/http://oge.gov/Topics/Selected-Employee-Categories/Political-Appointees/|archivedate=2013-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions to the gift rule include:

* 	Positions within a [[White House]] operating unit that is designated as not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition
* 	Positions within the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]]
* 	[[U.S. Foreign Service]] positions that do not require Senate confirmation
Political appointees sometimes attempt to transfer to a career position in the [[competitive service]], [[excepted service]], or [[Senior Executive Service (United States)|Senior Executive Service]].  This practice, known as "burrowing in", is desired by employees due to increased pay and job security, as career positions do not end when a presidential administration changes.  As these appointed positions are selected noncompetitively, while career employees are supposed to be selected on the basis of [[Meritocracy|merit]] and without political influence, these conversions are subject to extra scrutiny.  Since 2010, such conversions require advance approval from OPM, and the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) periodically audits the conversions.  In 2008, members of Congress criticized the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] for improperly allowing political employees to convert to career positions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehousetransitionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Appointment-to-Career-Conversions_110212-1.pdf|title=Conversion of Employees from Appointed (Noncareer) Positions to Career Positions in the Executive Branch|last=Schwemle|first=Barbara L.|date=2012-11-02|website=|publisher=Congressional Research Service|pages=1, 5, 8|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the politics of the United States, the system of political appointments comes from a history of the [[spoils system]] (also known as a [[patronage system]]) which is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory. The term was derived from the phrase "to the victor belong the spoils" by New York Senator [[William L. Marcy]], referring to the victory of the [[Jackson Democrats]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1828|election of 1828]], with the term "spoils" meaning goods or benefits taken from the loser in a competition, election or military victory. Though it is commonly assumed that the patronage system in the United States first came into general use during [[Andrew Jackson]]'s presidency, it actually has an older history. President [[Thomas Jefferson]], a [[Democratic-Republican]], favored a policy of keeping rival [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] out of government.

The patronage system thrived in the U.S. federal government until 1883. In 1820 [[United States Congress|Congress]] limited federal administrators to four-year terms, which led to constant turnover; by the 1860s and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], patronage had led to widespread inefficiency and political corruption. Although it used to be confined to cabinet positions, department heads, and foreign ambassadorships, by the 1860s patronage had spread to low-level government positions. This meant that when the incumbent political party lost a presidential election, the federal government underwent wholesale turnover.

On July 2, 1881, [[Charles J. Guiteau]], a disaffected and mentally unstable political office seeker, [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|assassinated]] President [[James Garfield]]. This highlighted how much the patronage problem had gotten out of control, and shifted public opinion, convincing the United States that the President of the United States had more important things to do than to engage in patronage. Congress was eventually spurred to pass the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] of 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patronage|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/lib/student_work/florence96/jessdave/patronage.html|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which created a [[Civil Service Commission]] and advocated a [[merit system]] for selecting government employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Garfield: A Biography|last = Peskin|first = Allan|publisher = Kent State University Press|year = 1976|isbn = 978-0873382106|location = Kent, OH|pages = 591|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SRmY164czTQC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, passage of the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]] of 1939 forbade the intimidation or bribery of voters and restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. It prohibited using any public funds designated for relief or public works for electoral purposes. It forbade officials paid with federal funds from using promises of jobs, promotion, financial assistance, contracts, or any other benefit to coerce campaign contributions or political support, which restricted most partisan political activities of federal employees. By 1980, 90% of federal positions had become part of the civil service system, which lead to state and local governments to employed large patronage systems. Big-city political machines in places such as [[New York City]], [[Boston]], and [[Chicago]] thrived in the late nineteenth century. Being as a patronage system not only rewarded political supporters for past support, it also encouraged future support, because persons who have a patronage job would try to retain it by campaigning for the party at the next election. Large-scale patronage systems declined steadily during the twentieth century. During the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920), "good government" reformers overthrew political machines and installed civil service systems. Chicago, under Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], remained the last bastion of patronage, existing in its purest form until the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti- Corruption Report|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/pols/ChicagoPolitics/AntiCorruptionReport_4.pdf|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In today’s more observant standards, politicians wanted to pull away from the negative intonation of the name casting of Patronage, and Spoil system which led them to rename the process “Political Appointments”.

==Issues==
The United States has more political appointees in government than any other industrialized democracy in the world. Even though the United States has one of the largest populations of political appointees in the system, the efficiency of political appointees is constantly shifting. Political appointees are engraved in everyday decisions even making the final call on major events. As of 2013, the [[The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] was lacking a Senate-confirmed adminitrator since 2006 when [[Marilyn Tavenner]] was acting administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Theodoric|title=Under Obama, More Appointments Go Unfilled|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/under-obama-more-appointments-go-unfilled#filibuster-correx|publisher=ProPublica|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 60 positions for appointment remain vacant and 45 positions have remained vacant for more than a year.

Judicial vacancies have also become a problem as well with numerous open seats for circuit and district judges left to be filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bendery|first=Jennifer|title=Judicial Vacancies Skyrocket During President Obama's First Term|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/02/judicial-vacancies-obama_n_2228978.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=15 November 2013|date=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of President Obama's first term, thirteen percent of presidential-appointee positions had not been filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|title=Plum Book|year=2012|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political appointees also come under heat for their own actions including [[Ben Bernanke]]'s involvement with private banks and also [[Michael D.

Gallo and Lewis stated that they thought careerist and appointees should work in a balanced atmosphere to be more productive and share skills. Professional rapport between careerists and appointees is considered in a study of presidential environmental appointees by Matthew Auer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auer|first=Matthew|journal=Public Administration Review|date=7 January 2008|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00838.x/full|accessdate=2013-11-21|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00838.x|title=Presidential Environmental Appointees in Comparative Perspective|volume=68|issue=1|pages=68–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auer found that oft-mentioned problems in the appointment system, such as short time-in-office and lack of government experience were less pronounced among top federal environmental appointees, across both Republican and Democratic administrations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1452">Referent power is gained by a leader who has strong interpersonal relationship skills.

Referent power, as an aspect of personal power,  becomes particularly important as organizational leadership is increasingly about collaboration and influence rather than command and control.

In an organizational setting, referent power is most easily seen in the charismatic leader who excels in making others feel comfortable in his or her presence. Staff typically express their excitement about work in terms of their attraction to their leader's personal characteristics and charisma. The reason they commit to their work is because of the leader's likability and they base their self-esteem and sense of accomplishment on their leader's approval.

The '''right to sexuality''' incorporates the right to express one's sexuality and to be free from discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]]. In specific, it relates to the [[human rights]] of people of diverse sexual orientation, including [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people, and the protection of those rights, although it is equally applicable to [[heterosexuality]]. The right to sexuality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is based on the universality of human rights and the inalienable nature of rights belonging to every person by virtue of being human.

No right to sexuality exists explicitly in [[international human rights law]]; rather, it is found in a number of [[international human rights instruments]] including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].

==Definition==
The concept of the right to sexuality is difficult to define, as it comprises various rights from within the framework of international human rights law.

Sexual orientation is defined in the Preamble to the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] as "each person’s capacity for profound emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm The Yogyakarta Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135718/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}, Preamble.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is found in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).

The UDHR provides for non-discrimination in Article 2, which states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights], Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sexual orientation can be read into Article 2 as "other status" or alternatively as falling under "sex".

In the ICCPR, Article 2 sets out a similar provision for non-discrimination:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Toonen v Australia]] the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] (UNHRC) found that the reference to "sex" in Article 2 of the ICCPR included sexual orientation, thereby making sexual orientation prohibited grounds of distinction in respect of the enjoyment of rights under the ICCPR.&lt;ref&gt;(488/1992), CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992 (1994); 1-3 IHRR 97 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to be free from discrimination is the basis of the right to sexuality, but it is closely related to the exercise and protection of other fundamental human rights.

==Background==
Individuals of diverse sexual orientation have been discriminated against historically and continue to be a "vulnerable" group in society today. Forms of discrimination experienced by people of diverse sexual orientation include the denial of the [[right to life]], the [[right to work]] and the [[right to privacy]], non-recognition of personal and family relationships, interference with human [[dignity]], interference with [[security of the person]], violations of the right to be free from [[torture]], discrimination in access to economic, social and cultural rights, including housing, health and education, and pressure to remain silent and invisible.&lt;ref&gt;M O'Flaherty and J Fisher ''Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and International Human Rights Law: Contextualising the Yogyakarta Principles'' (2008) 8 HRLR 207 at 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy-eight countries maintain laws that make same-sex consensual sex between adults a criminal offence, and seven countries (or parts thereof) impose the death penalty for same-sex consensual sex. They are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Mauritania, Sudan, the twelve northern states of Nigeria, and the southern parts of Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf ''State Sponsored Homophobia: A world survey of laws criminalising same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults'', The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, edited by Lucas Paoli Itaborahy, May 2012, pages 4 and 13] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611181908/http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf |date=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to sexuality has only relatively recently become the subject of international concern, with the regulation of sexuality traditionally falling within the jurisdiction of the [[nation state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ichrp.org/files/reports/47/137_web.pdf International Council on Human Rights] ''Sexuality and Human Rights'' (2009) at 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Today numerous international [[non-governmental organisations]] and [[intergovernmental organisations]] are engaged in the protection of the rights of people of diverse sexual orientation as it is increasingly recognised that discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is widespread and an unacceptable violation of human rights.

==Acts of Violence==
Acts of violence against LGBT people are often especially vicious compared to other [[hate crime|bias-motivated crime]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011, at [22].&lt;/ref&gt; and include killings, kidnappings, beatings, rape, and psychological violence, including threats, coercion and arbitrary depravations of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011, at [20].&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of violent acts against people of diverse sexual orientation are too numerous to account here, and they occur in all parts of the world. A particularly distressing example is the sexual assault and murder of fifteen lesbians in [[Thailand]] in March 2012. In that example, two lesbian couples were killed by men who objected to their relationship and who were embarrassed when they were unable to convince the women into heterosexual relationships with themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/pressroom/pressrelease/1506.html Thai police ignore fifteen killings of lesbians and toms] (27 March 2012) International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often acts of violence against people of diverse sexual orientation are perpetrated by the victim's own family. In a case in [[Zimbabwe]], the multiple rape of a lesbian was organised by her own family in an attempt to "cure" her of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G02/104/28/PDF/G0210428.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences] Commission on Human Rights, 31 January 2002, E/CN.4/2002/83 at [102].&lt;/ref&gt;

In those cases, as in many other cases of violence against people of diverse sexual orientation, State law enforcement authorities are complicit in human rights abuses for failing to persecute violators of rights.

==Breach of the Right to Privacy==
{{Main| Right to Privacy}}
The [[right to privacy]] is a protected freedom under the UDHR,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights], Article 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ICCPR&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}, Article 17.&lt;/ref&gt; which reflects the "widespread, if not universal, human need to pursue certain activities within an intimate sphere, free of outside interference. The possibility to do so is fundamental to personhood."&lt;ref&gt;E Heinze ''Sexual Orientation: A Human Right'' (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Dordrecht, 1995) at 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Intimate relationships, whether between two people of the same sex or of different sexes, are among those activities that are subject to a right of privacy.

It has been successfully argued in a number of cases that criminalization of homosexual relationships is an interference with the right to privacy, including decisions in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the UNHRC.&lt;ref&gt;''Dudgeon v UK'' A 45 (1981); (1982) 4 EHRR 149; ''Norris v Ireland'' A 142 (1988); (1988) 13 EHRR 186; ''Toonen v Australia'' (488/1992), CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992 (1994); 1-3 IHRR 97 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The freedom to decide on one's own consensual adult relationships, including the gender of that person, without the interference of the State is a fundamental human right. To prohibit the relationships of people of diverse sexual orientation is a breach of the right to sexuality and the right to privacy.

==Freedom of Expression, Assembly and Association==
{{Main| Freedom of Speech| Freedom of Assembly}}
Every person, by virtue of their [[individual autonomy]], is free to express themselves, assemble and join in association with others. [[Freedom of expression]] is a protected human right under Article 19 of the UDHR and  Article 19 of the ICCPR, as is the right to [[freedom of assembly]] under Article 20 of the UDHR and Article 21 of the ICCPR.

LGBT people are discriminated against in respect of their ability to defend and promote their rights. Gay pride marches, peaceful demonstrations and other events promoting LGBT rights are often banned by State governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G06/121/89/PDF/G0612189.pdf?OpenElement Report by the Special Rapporteur on Contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance] (2006) Commission of Human Rights E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.1 at [72].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 gay pride marches were banned in Serbia&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15134182 Serbia bans gay pride march citing violence fears], (2011) BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; and another march in Moscow was broken up by police, who arrested thirty leading gay rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/05/27/moscow-police-will-break-up-illegal-gay-pride-march/ Moscow police will break up banned gay pride march], (2011) Pink News.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogyakarta Principles==
In 2005, twenty-nine experts undertook the drafting of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm The Yogyakarta Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135718/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The document was intended to set out experiences of human rights violations against people of diverse sexual orientation and transgender people, the application of international human rights law to those experiences and the nature of obligations on States in respect of those experiences.&lt;ref&gt;M O'Flaherty and J Fisher ''Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and International Human Rights Law: Contextualising the Yogyakarta Principles'' (2008) 8 HRLR 207 at 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principles can be broadly categorised into the following:
* Principles 1 to 3 set out the universality of human rights and their application to all persons.
* Principles 4 to 11 address fundamental rights to life, freedom from violence and torture, privacy, access to justice and freedom from arbitrary detention.
* Principles 12 to 18 set out non-discrimination in relation of economic, social and cultural rights, including employment, accommodation, social security, education and health.
* Principles 19 to 21 emphasise the importance of freedom of expression, identity and sexuality, without State interference, including peaceful assembly.
* Principles 22 and 23 set out the right to seek asylum from persecution of based on sexual orientation.
* Principles 24 to 26 set out the right to participate in family and cultural life and public affairs.
* Principle 27 sets out the right to promote and defend human rights without discrimination based on sexual orientation.
* Principles 28 and 29 emphasise the importance of holding those who violate human rights accountable, and ensuring redress for those who face rights violations.

The Yogyakarta Principles is an instrument of [[soft law]] and is therefore not binding. But it does provide an important standard for States in their obligation to protect the rights of individuals of diverse sexual orientation.

On June 17, 2011 the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in a Resolution on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, adopted by a vote of 23 in favour, 19 against, and 3 abstentions, requested the commission of a study to document discriminatory laws and acts of violence against people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11167&amp;LangID=E UN Human Rights Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624081557/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11167&amp;LangID=E |date=2011-06-24 }}, June 17, 2011; see also [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38762 UN rights body hits out against violence based on sexual orientation], (2011) UN News Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 Resolution was intended to shed light on how international human rights could be used to prevent acts of violence and discrimination against people of diverse sexual orientation.

On 15 December 2011 the first Report on human rights of LGBT people was released by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Report made the following recommendations. In order to prevent such acts of violence occurring, [[United Nations Member States]] are recommended to:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011, at [84].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promptly investigate all reported killings and serious incidents of violence against LGBT people, regardless of whether carried out privately or publicly, by State or non-State actors, ensuring accountability for such violations and the establishment of reporting mechanisms for such incidents.
* Take measures to prevent torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensure accountability for such violations and establish reporting mechanisms.
* Repeal laws that criminalize homosexuality, same-sex sexual conduct, other criminal laws that detain people based on their sexuality and abolish the death penalty for offences involving consensual sexual relations within same-sex relationships.
* Enact comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, ensuring that combating discrimination based on sexual orientation is in the mandates of national human rights bodies.
* Ensure that freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly can be exercised safely without discrimination on sexual orientation or gender identity.
* Implement appropriate training programmes for law enforcement personnel, and support public information campaigns to counter homophobia and transphobia amongst the general public and in schools.
* Facilitate legal recognition of preferred gender of transgender persons.

Further action is yet to be taken by the United Nations, although a proposed declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity was brought before the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2008. However, that declaration has not been officially adopted by the General Assembly and remains open for signatories.

'''Rudder ratio''' refers to a value that is monitored by the computerized [[flight control system]]s in modern [[aircraft]]. The ratio relates the  aircraft airspeed to the [[rudder]] deflection setting that is in effect at the time. As an aircraft accelerates, the deflection of the rudder needs to be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot. This automatic reduction process is needed because if the rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high-speed flight, it will cause the plane to sharply and violently [[Flight dynamics|yaw]], or swing from side to side, leading to loss of control and rudder, tail and other damages, even causing the aircraft to crash.

{{Sociology}}
The '''ruling class''' is the [[social class]] of a given [[society]] that decides upon and sets that society's [[political agenda]].

[[sociology|Sociologist]] [[C. Wright Mills]] (1916–1962) argued that the ruling class differs from the [[power elite]]. The latter simply refers to the small group of people with the most political power. Many of them are politicians, hired political managers and/or military leaders. The ruling class are people who directly influence politics, education and government with the use of wealth or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Codevilla|first1=Angelo|title=America’s Ruling Class — And the Perils of Revolution |journal=The American Spectator|volume=2|issue=July 2010|pages=19|url=http://spectator.org/articles/39326/americas-ruling-class-and-perils-revolution|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Analogous to the class of the major capitalists, other [[mode of production|modes of production]] give rise to different ruling classes: under [[feudalism]] it was the feudal lords while under [[slavery]] it was the slave-owners. Under the feudal society, feudal lords had power over the vassals because of their control of the fiefs. This gave them political and military power over the people. In slavery, because complete rights of the person's life belonged to the slave owner, they could and did every implementation that would help the production in the farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USASownership.htm|title=Slave Ownership&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202306/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USASownership.htm|archivedate=2007-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his recent studies on elites in contemporary societies, [[Mattei Dogan]] has argued that because of their complexity and their heterogeneity and particularly because of the social division of work and the multiple levels of stratification, there is not, or can not be, a coherent ruling class, even if in the past there were solid examples of ruling classes as in the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s and the more recent [[totalitarian]] regimes of the 20th century ([[Communism|Communist]] and [[Fascism|Fascist]]).

[[Milovan Djilas]] said that in a Communist regime the [[nomenklatura]] form a ruling class, which "benefited from the use, enjoyment, and disposition of material goods", thus controls all of the property and thus all of the wealth of the nation. Furthermore, he argued, the Communist bureaucracy was not an accidental mistake, but the central inherent aspect of the Communist system since a Communist regime would not be possible without the system of bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XicFgasYzWQC&amp;pg=PT5&amp;lpg=PT5&amp;dq=barbarism+and+civilization:+a+history+of+europe+in+our+time&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w4XEEvVUgQ&amp;sig=E4qsoffdiIi9oFkZx_Vv4vFIs_s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fxuSVPKfNtSBygSoiYHQAw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=nomenklatura&amp;f=false|title=Barbarism and Civilization: A History of Europe in our Time|first=Bernard|last=Wasserstein|date=12 February 2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191622519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Globalization]] theorists argue that today a [[transnational capitalist class]] has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jhsprague/Sprague_Jeb_2009_Globalizations_Interview_with_Leslie_Sklair.pdf Transnational Capitalist Class&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816014925/http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jhsprague/Sprague_Jeb_2009_Globalizations_Interview_with_Leslie_Sklair.pdf |date=2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
There are several examples of ruling class systems in movies, novels and television shows. The 2005 American independent film ''[[The American Ruling Class]]'' written by former ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' editor Lewis Lapham and directed by John Kirby is a semi-documentary that examines how the American economy is structured and for whom. The 2017 Philippine political crime-suspense epic ''[[Wildflower (TV series)|Wildflower]]'' is about a rich influential and corrupt political family the Ardientes ruling over a town where a wave of murders and crimes which they have committed washed over.

Society, in the novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', by [[Aldous Huxley]], is [[eusociality|eusocial]] with a genetically engineered [[caste system]]. The [[World_State_in_Brave_New_World#Population|alpha++ class]] is the ruling class having been bred as scientists and administrators and control the World State in the novel. This situation can also be found in the [[George Orwell]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' where the inner party as symbolized by the fictitious [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] literally controls what everyone in the outer party hears, sees and learns, albeit without genetic engineering and on the model of Stalinist communism having taken over the Anglosphere (Oceania). In Oceania, the ignorant masses ("[[proles]]") are relatively free as they pose no threat to [[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism|oligarchical collectivism]] ("Big Brother").

Examples in movies include ''[[Gattaca]]'', where the genetically-born were superior and the ruling class; and ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', which depicted a powerful totalitarian government in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The comedic film ''[[The Ruling Class (film)|The Ruling Class]]'' was a satire of British [[aristocracy]], depicting nobility as self-serving and cruel, juxtaposed against an insane relative who believes that he is [[Jesus Christ]], whom they identify as a "bloody [[Bolshevik]]".

''Cultural Anthropology, second edition.'' Stamford, Connecticut: [[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth Publishing Company]] (Cengage Learning). {{ISBN|978-0-534-02749-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SCSdiagram.jpg|thumb|350px|Conceptual Model of a Sociocultural System.]] The term "sociocultural system" embraces three concepts: society, culture, and system. A society is a number of interdependent organisms of the same species.  A culture is the learned behaviors that are shared by the members of a society, together with the material products of such behaviors. The words "society" and "culture" are fused together to form the word "sociocultural". A system is "a collection of parts which interact with each other to function as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Draper L. (1980). ''Systems One: An Introduction to Systems Thinking.'' Minneapolis, MN: Future Systems Inc. {{ISBN|978-99962-805-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sociocultural system is most likely to be found in the writings of anthropologists who specialize in [[ecological anthropology]].

In 1979, Marvin Harris outlined a universal structure of sociocultural systems. He mentioned [[infrastructure]] (production and population), structure (which is behavioural, like corporations, political organizations, hierarchies, castes), and a [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] (which is mental, like beliefs, values, norms).&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W., 2013, "Harris on the Universal Structure of Society," Retrieved 2015-02-15, http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Essays/Harris1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120219 Sociocultural Systems:Principles of Structure and Change], Frank W.

The '''Southern Regional Council''' (SRC) is a reform-oriented organization created in 1944 to avoid racial violence and promote racial equality in the [[Southern United States]]. Voter registration and political-awareness campaigns are used toward this end.  The SRC evolved in 1944 from the [[Commission on Interracial Cooperation]].  It is headquartered in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==History==
{{See also|Commission on Interracial Cooperation}}
The Commission on Interracial Cooperation (CIC) was formed in 1919.&lt;ref name="dunbar-src"/&gt;  The CIC formed in response to the increased tensions between white Americans and [[Black people|black]] [[soldier]]s returning from fighting in Europe after [[World War I|World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="nge-cic"/&gt; Although most African Americans still lived in the South, the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] had started to the North and Midwestern industrial cities, and thousands of blacks were living in new urban environments. They often had to compete with immigrants and ethnic whites for jobs and housing. In the summer of 1919, race riots erupted in numerous major cities as whites attacked blacks. African-American veterans and others resisted being treated as second-class citizens and fought back, especially in Chicago and Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="proquest-cic"/&gt; during what has been called "[[Red Summer]]" because of all the violence. Black veterans in the South were confronted with expectations they would submit to [[Jim Crow]] and lynchings of black men rose after the war,  including of some veterans in uniform.

During [[World War II|World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;II]], members of the CIC realized that the same problem could recur during and following that war.&lt;ref name="proquest-src"/&gt;  In 1943, leaders from the CIC, including sociologist [[Howard W. Odum]], held a series of conferences in [[Durham, North Carolina]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]], and Atlanta, Georgia.  As a result, they formed the Southern Regional Council, with Odum selected as its leader.&lt;ref name="nge-src"/&gt;  The CIC was disbanded,&lt;ref name="proquest-src"/&gt; essentially being merged with the new SRC in 1944.&lt;ref name="nge-src"/&gt;&lt;ref name="src-timeline"/&gt; The SRC was formed "to attain through research and action the ideals and practices of equal opportunity for all peoples of the region."&lt;ref name="src-timeline"/&gt;

The SRC urged [[white people|whites]], particularly those with more [[Liberalism|liberal]] political attitudes,  to help [[black people]] obtain [[Racial integration|equal rights]].  Like the CIC before it, the SRC was a coalition of [[lawyer]]s, [[Minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]]s, and [[newspaper editor]]s from thirteen southern states. Although the group was bi-racial and included both men and women, the majority of its members were white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Steven P.|title=Whither Southern Liberalism in the Post-Civil Rights Era? The Southern Regional Council and its Peers, 1965-1972|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2006|volume=90|issue=4|pages=547-568|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=23695963&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Odum sought to bring about racial equality in the Southern US by improving economic, social and political conditions.&lt;ref name="dunbar-src"/&gt;  The SRC avoided taking a public stand against legal segregation, on the belief that this would hinder progress toward its economic-planning goals.  Critics of this approach, such as activist author [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]], believed that the SRC should condemn the state-imposed legal segregation.  In 1949 the SRC declared in a resolution that segregation "in and of itself constitutes discrimination and inequality of treatment."&lt;ref name="nge-src"/&gt;  As a result, many whites left the SRC, resulting in a decline of membership by almost half by 1954.&lt;ref name="nge-src"/&gt;

==Activities==

Often partners with other groups involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the SRC used [[communications]] and [[analysis]] to try to reach people through facts and education. It published literature related to racial justice, released studies on [[race relations]], and acted as a [[think tank]] for issues concerning the movement.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Publications===
Since 1944, the SRC has published some form of journal. The Council's first publication, ''Southern Frontier'', was published for two years before being reformatted and renamed as ''New South''.  In 1974, ''New South'' and a companion tabloid ''South Today'' were merged into a color glossy magazine, ''Southern Voices''. This published for ten months but ceased because of financial issues.&lt;ref name="newmag"/&gt;

The SRC journal ''Southern Changes'' was published between 1978 and 2003.&lt;ref name="sc-archive"/&gt; [[Emory University]], in partnership with the [[Library of Congress]], has digitally preserved the journal, described as "an alternative and groundbreaking news outlet for stories on social justice in the South."&lt;ref name="metarchive-interview"/&gt;

The Council publishes various issues briefs, position papers, and legislative reviews, including the annuals ''Southern States Legislative Review'' and ''State of the South Report''.&lt;ref name="src-programs"/&gt;

===Voter Education Project===
[[File:Vernon E. Jordan working on a voter education project.jpg|thumb|[[Vernon Jordan]] working on a voter education project at the Southern Regional Council in 1967.]]
The SRC served as a liaison between a number of southern organizations and northern foundations, providing resources and opportunities for mutual understanding. The organization created the [[Voter Education Project]], building on an idea from U.S. Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] during the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]; the project was run by the SRC from its inception on April 1, 1962 until it was made an independent organization on June 1, 1971.&lt;ref name="emory-vep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mediator"/&gt;  The Voter Education Project did not actually register voters; instead, it acted as a conduit between [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] grants and civil rights organizations conducting [[voter registration]] drives or voting-related research.&lt;ref name="emory-vep"/&gt;  For example, the Project funded voter-registration work by the [[National Urban League]]; in October 1962, the Jefferson County (Alabama) Voters Campaign received assistance with a registration effort from the League.&lt;ref name="mediator"/&gt;

===Lillian Smith Book Award===
The [[Lillian Smith Book Award]] was established by the SRC in 1968, shortly after writer [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]] died, to "recognize authors whose writing extends the legacy of this outspoken writer, educator and social critic who challenged her fellow Southerners and all Americans on issues of social and racial justice."&lt;ref name="src-programs"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31401">'''Speech production''' is the process by which thoughts are translated into speech. This includes the selection of [[word]]s, the organization of relevant [[Grammar|grammatical]] forms, and then the articulation of the resulting sounds by the [[motor system]] using the [[vocal apparatus]]. Speech production can be spontaneous such as when a person creates the words of a [[conversation]], reactive such as when they name a picture or [[reading (process)|read]] aloud a [[writing|written word]], or imitative, such as in [[speech repetition]]. Speech production is not the same as [[language production]] since [[language]] can also be produced manually by [[sign language|sign]]s.

In ordinary fluent [[conversation]] people pronounce roughly four [[syllables]], ten or twelve [[phoneme]]s and two to three words out of their [[vocabulary]] (that can contain 10 to 100 thousand words) each second.&lt;ref name="Levelt99"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~rmk7/HC/HC_Readings/Levelt.pdf |pmid=10354575|year=1999|last1=Levelt|first1=WJ|title=Models of word production.|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in speech production are relatively rare occurring at a rate of about once in every 900 words in spontaneous speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garnham, A, Shillcock RC, Brown GDA, Mill AID, Culter A|year=1981|url=http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/15615/1/6017.pdf|title= Slips of the tongue in the London–Lund corpus of spontaneous conversation|journal=Linguistics |volume=19|pages=805–817|doi=10.1515/ling.1981.19.7-8.805|issue=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words that are [[Frequency list|commonly spoken]] or learned early in life or easily imagined are quicker to say than ones that are rarely said, learnt later in life, or are abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Oldfield  RC, Wingfield  A |year=1965|title=Response latencies in naming objects|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=17|pages=273–281|doi=10.1080/17470216508416445|pmid=5852918|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/33/1/73.full.pdf|pmid=11296722|year=2001|last1=Bird|first1=H|last2=Franklin|first2=S|last3=Howard|first3=D|title=Age of acquisition and imageability ratings for a large set of words, including verbs and function words|volume=33|issue=1|pages=73–9|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers|doi=10.3758/BF03195349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally speech is created with pulmonary pressure provided by the [[lung]]s that generates sound by [[phonation]] through the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]] that then is modified by the [[vocal tract]] into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However speech production can occur without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]] by using the upper parts of the vocal tract. An example of such alaryngeal speech is [[Donald Duck talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=5163900|year=1971|last1=Weinberg|first1=B|last2=Westerhouse|first2=J|title=A study of buccal speech|volume=14|issue=3|pages=652–8|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Research|bibcode=1972ASAJ...51Q..91W|doi=10.1121/1.1981697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocal production of speech may be associated with the production of hand [[gestures]] that act to enhance the comprehensibility of what is being said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McNeill D|year=2005|title=Gesture and Thought|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-51463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of speech production throughout an individual's life starts from an infant's first babble and is transformed into fully developed speech by the age of five.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"&gt;Harley, T.A. (2011), Psycholinguistics. (Volume 1). SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of speech doesn't occur until around age one (holophrastic phase). Between the ages of one and a half and two and a half the infant can produce short sentences (telegraphic phase). After two and a half years the infant develops systems of [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]]s used in speech production. Around four or five the child's lemmas are largely increased, this enhances the child's production of correct speech and they can now produce speech like an adult. An adult now develops speech in four stages: Activation of lexical concepts, select lemmas needed, [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] and [[phonologically]] encode speech, and the word is phonetically encoded.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt;

==Three stages==
The production of [[spoken language]] involves three major levels of processing: conceptualization, formulation, and articulation.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levelt89"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levelt | first = WJM | year = 1989 | title = Speaking: From Intention to Articulation | publisher = MIT Press | isbn = 978-0-262-62089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jescheniak"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jescheniak | first1 = JD | last2 = Levelt | first2 = WJM | year = 1994 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.133.3919 | title = Word frequency effects in speech production: retrieval of syntactic information and of phonological form | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | pages = 824–843 | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.20.4.824 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first is the processes of [[conceptualization]] or conceptual preparation, in which the intention  to create speech links a desired concept to the particular spoken words to be expressed. Here the preverbal intended messages are formulated that specify the concepts to be expressed.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition"&gt;Levelt, W. (1999). "The neurocognition of language", p.87 -117. Oxford Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The second stage is formulation in which the linguistic form required for the expression of the desired message is created. Formulation includes grammatical encoding, morpho-phonological encoding, and phonetic encoding.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt; Grammatical encoding is the process of selecting the appropriate syntactic word or [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]]. The selected lemma then activates the appropriate [[Syntax|syntactic]] frame for the conceptualized message. Morpho-phonological encoding is the process of breaking words down into syllables to be produced in overt speech. Syllabification is dependent on the preceding and proceeding words, for instance:
''I-com-pre-hend'' vs. ''I-com-pre-hen-dit''.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;
The final part of the formulation stage is phonetic encoding. This involves the activation of [[articulatory gestures]] dependent on the syllables selected in the morpho-phonological process, creating an articulatory score as the utterance is pieced together and the order of movements of the [[vocal apparatus]] is completed.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;

The third stage of speech production is articulation, which is the execution of the articulatory score by the lungs, glottis, larynx, [[tongue]], [[lips]], [[jaw]] and other parts of the vocal apparatus resulting in speech.&lt;ref name="Levelt89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;
[[File:Blausen 0215 CerebralHemispheres.png|thumb|141x141px|For right handed people, the majority of speech production activity occurs in the left cerebral hemisphere.]]

==Neuroscience==

The [[motor control]] for speech production in [[right handed|right handed people]] depends mostly upon areas in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]]. These areas include the bilateral [[supplementary motor area]], the left posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]], the left [[Insular cortex|insula]], the left [[primary motor cortex]] and [[temporal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2002.06.001|pmid=15037128|year=2004|last1=Indefrey|first1=P|last2=Levelt|first2=WJ|title=The spatial and temporal signatures of word production components|volume=92|issue=1–2|pages=101–44|journal=Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also subcortical areas involved such as the [[basal ganglia]] and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17189619|year=2007|last1=Booth|first1=JR|last2=Wood|first2=L|last3=Lu|first3=D|last4=Houk|first4=JC|last5=Bitan|first5=T|title=The role of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in language processing|volume=1133|issue=1|pages=136–44|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.11.074|pmc=2424405|journal=Brain Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ackermann"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 18471906|year= 2008|last1= Ackermann|first1= H|title= Cerebellar contributions to speech production and speech perception: psycholinguistic and neurobiological perspectives|volume= 31|issue= 6|pages= 265–72|doi= 10.1016/j.tins.2008.02.011|journal= Trends in Neurosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum aids the sequencing of speech syllables into fast, smooth and rhythmically organized words and longer utterances.&lt;ref name="Ackermann" /&gt;

==History of speech production research==
[[File:Speecherrorchart2.png|thumb|608x608px|Examples of speech errors. The target is what the speaker intended to say. The error is what the speaker actually said. These mistakes have been studied to learn about the structure of speech production.]]
Until the late 1960s research on speech was focused on comprehension. As researchers collected greater volumes of [[speech error]] data, they began to investigate the psychological processes responsible for the production of speech sounds and to contemplate possible processes for fluent speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Bernstein|first2=Nan|title=Speech Production Processing Models|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|isbn=0155041061|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from speech error research were soon incorporated into speech production models. Evidence from speech error data supports the following conclusions about speech production.

Some of these ideas include:

# Speech is planned in advance.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstien Ratner|first2=Nan|title=Chapter 7 Speech Production|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|isbn=0155041061|pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[lexicon]] is organized both semantically and phonologically.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; That is by meaning, and by the sound of the words.
# [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphologically]] complex words are assembled.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; Words that we produce that contain morphemes are put together during the speech production process. [[Morpheme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are the smallest units of language that contain meaning. For example, "ed" on a past tense word.
# [[Affix]]es and  functors behave differently from context words in slips of the tongue.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; This means the rules about the ways in which a word can be used are likely stored with them, which means generally when speech errors are made, the mistake words maintain their functions and make grammatical sense.
# [[Speech error]]s reflect rule knowledge.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; Even in our mistakes, speech is not nonsensical. The words and sentences that are produced in speech errors are typically grammatical, and do not violate the rules of the language being spoken.

== Aspects of speech production models ==
Models of speech production must contain specific elements to be viable. These include the elements from which speech is composed, listed below. The accepted models of speech production discussed in more detail below all incorporate these stages either explicitly or implicitly, and the ones that are now outdated or disputed have been criticized for overlooking one or more of the following stages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=John|title=Psycholinguistics|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415258901|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attributes of accepted speech models are:

a) a conceptual stage where the speaker abstractly identifies what they wish to express.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

b) a syntactic stage where a frame is chosen that words will be placed into, this frame is usually [[Syntax|sentence structure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

c) a lexical stage where a search for a word occurs based on meaning. Once the word is selected and retrieved, information about it becomes available to the speaker involving [[phonology]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

d) a phonological stage where the abstract information is converted into a speech like form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

e) a [[Phonetics|phonetic]] stage where instructions are prepared to be sent to the [[Vocal muscle|muscles of articulation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Also, models must allow for forward planning mechanisms, a buffer, and a monitoring mechanism.

Following are a few of the influential models of speech production that account for or incorporate the previously mentioned stages and include information discovered as a result of speech error studies and other disfluency data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstein|first2=Nan|title=Speech Production Processing Models|isbn=0155041061|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Tip of the tongue|tip-of-the-tongue]] research.

==Models==

===The Utterance Generator Model (1971)===

The Utterance Generator Model was proposed by Fromkin (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Bernstein Ratner|first2=Nan|title=Chapter 7 Speech Production|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers|location=Florida|isbn=0155041061|pages=328–337|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of six stages and was an attempt to account for the previous findings of speech error research. The stages of the Utterance Generator Model were based on possible changes in representations of a particular utterance. The first stage is where a person generates the meaning they wish to convey. The second stage involves the message being translated onto a syntactic structure. Here, the message is given an outline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|title=Utterance Generator Model of Speech Production in Psycho-linguistics|date=1971|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=0155041061|page=328|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third stage proposed by Fromkin is where/when the message gains different stresses and intonations based on the meaning. The fourth stage Fromkin suggested  is concerned with the selection of words from the [[lexicon]]. After the words have been selected in Stage 4, the message undergoes phonological specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|title=Utterance Generator Model of Speech Production in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt|page=330|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth stage applies rules of pronunciation and produces syllables that are to be outputted. The sixth and final stage of Fromkin's Utterance Generator Model is the coordination of the motor commands necessary for speech. Here, phonetic features of the message are sent to the relevant muscles of the vocal tract so that the intended message can be produced. Despite the ingenuity of Fromkin's model, researchers  have criticized this interpretation of speech production. Although The Utterance Generator Model accounts for many nuances and data found by speech error studies, researchers decided it still had room to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|title=The Garrett Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt College|isbn=0155041061|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butterworth|title=Psycho-linguistics|date=1982|publisher=Harcourt College|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garrett model (1975)===

A more recent (than Fromkin's) attempt to explain speech production was published by Garrett in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstein|first2=Nan|title=The Garret Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt College|isbn=0155041061|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett also created this model by compiling speech error data and there are many overlaps between this model and the Fromkin model off which it was based, but he did add a few things to the Fromkin model that filled some of the gaps being pointed out by other researchers. The Garrett Model and the Fromkin model both distinguish between three levels—a conceptual level, and sentence level, and a motor level. These three levels are common to contemporary understanding of Speech Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|last2=Fromkin|first2=V.A.|last3=Ratner|first3=N.B|title=The Garrett Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt College|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moraghfigure4.png|thumb|240x240px|This is an interpretation of the Dell's model. The  words at the top represent the semantic category. The second level represents the words that describe the semantic category. And, the third level represents the phonemes ( syllabic information including onset, vowels, and codas).]]

===Dell's model (1994)===

In 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production - Wikiversity|url = https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics/Models_of_Speech_Production|website = en.wikiversity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell proposed a model of the lexical network that became fundamental in the understanding of the way speech is produced.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt; This model of the lexical network attempts to symbolically represent the lexicon, and in turn, explain how people choose the words they wish to produce, and how those words are to be organized into speech. Dell's model was composed of three stages, semantics, words, and phonemes. The  words in the highest stage of the model represent the semantic category. (In the image, the words representing semantic category are winter, footwear, feet, and snow represent the semantic categories of boot and skate.) The second level represents the words that describe the semantic category (In the image, boot and skate). And, the third level represents the phonemes ( [[Syllable|syllabic information]] including [[Onset (linguistics)|onset]], vowels, and codas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Analysis of Sentence Production|last = Dell|first = G.S.|date = 1997|journal = Psychology of Learning and Motivation|doi = 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60270-4|pmid = |pages=133–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levelt model (1999) ===

Levelt further refined the lexical network proposed by Dell. Through the use of speech error data, Levelt recreated the three levels in Dell's model. The conceptual stratum, the top and most abstract level, contains information a person has about ideas of particular concepts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=d6b00eb6-6f33-46fd-9144-85377e4868eb%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=126&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=000080761300003&amp;db=edswsc|title = Models of Word Production|last = Levelt|first = Willem J.M|date = 1999|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01319-4|pmid = 10354575|access-date = 25 October 2015|volume=3|pages=223–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptual stratum also contains ideas about how concepts relate to each other. This is where word selection would occur, a person would choose which words they wish to express. The next, or middle level, the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]]-stratum, contains information about the syntactic functions of individual words including [[Tense (grammar)|tense]] and function.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt;  This level functions to maintain syntax and place words correctly into sentence structure that makes sense to the speaker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The lowest and final level is the form stratum which, similarly to the Dell Model, contains syllabic information. From here, the information stored at the form stratum level is sent to the motor cortex where the vocal apparatus are coordinated to physically produce speech sounds.

==Places of articulation==
{{main|Place of articulation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Human vocal apparatus used to produce speech|left|168x168px]]
The physical structure of the human nose, throat, and vocal cords allows for the productions of many unique sounds, these areas can be further broken down into [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]]. Different sounds are produced in different areas, and with different muscles and breathing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Consonantal Place of Articulation|last = Keren, Rice|publisher = John Wily &amp; Sons Inc.|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-4443-3526-2|location = |pages = 519–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our ability to utilize these skills to create the various sounds needed to communicate effectively is essential to our speech production. Speech is a psychomotor activity. Speech between two people is a [[conversation]] - they can be casual, formal, factual, or transactional, and the language structure/ narrative genre employed differs depending upon the context. Affect is a significant factor that  controls speech, manifestations that disrupt memory in language use due to affect include feelings of tension, states of apprehension, as well as physical signs like nausea. Language level manifestations that affect brings could be observed with the speaker's hesitations, repetitions, false starts, incompletion, syntactic blends, etc. Difficulties in [[manner of articulation]] can contribute to speech difficulties and [[Speech impediment|impediments]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speech Disorders : Causes, Treatments, and Social Effects|last = Harrison|first = Allen. E|publisher = Nova Science Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 9781608762132|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that infants are capable of making the entire spectrum of possible vowel and consonant sounds. [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] has created a system for understanding and categorizing all possible speech sounds, which includes information about the way in which the sound is produced, and where the sounds is produced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is extremely useful in the understanding of speech production because speech can be transcribed based on sounds rather than spelling, which may be misleading depending on the language being spoken. Average speaking rates are in the 120 to 150 words per minute (wpm) range, and same is the recommended guidelines for recording audiobooks. As people grow accustomed to a particular language they are prone to lose not only the ability to produce certain speech sounds, but also to distinguish between these sounds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Articulation===
Articulation, often associated with speech production, is the term used to describe how people physically produced speech sounds. For people who speak fluently, articulation is automatic and allows 15 speech sounds to be produced per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=John|title=Psycholinguistics The Key Concepts|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415258901|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effective articulation of speech include the following elements – fluency, complexity, accuracy, and comprehensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rebecca Hughes|author2=Beatrice Szczepek Reed|title=Teaching and Researching Speaking: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cC4lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-43299-9|pages=6+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Fluency: Is the ability to communicate an intended message, or to affect the listener in the way that is intended by the speaker. While accurate use of language is a component in this ability, over-attention to accuracy may actually inhibit the development of fluency. Fluency involves constructing coherent utterances and stretches of speech, to respond and to speak without undue hesitation (limited use of fillers such as uh, er, eh, like, you know). It also involves the ability to use strategies such as simplification and gestures to aid communication. Fluency involves use of relevant information, appropriate vocabulary and [[syntax]].  

*Complexity: Speech where the message is communicated precisely. Ability to adjust the message or negotiate the control of conversation according to the responses of the listener, and use subordination and clausal forms appropriate per the roles and relationship between the speakers. It includes the use of sociolinguistic knowledge – the skills required to communicate effectively across cultures; the norms, the knowledge of what is appropriate to say in what situations and to whom.

*Accuracy: This refers to the use of proper and advanced grammar; subject-verb agreement; word order; and word form (excited/exciting), as well as appropriate word choice in spoken language. It is also the ability to self-correct during discourse, to clarify or modify spoken language for grammatical accuracy.

*Comprehensibility: This is the ability to be understood by others, it is related with the sound of the language.  There are three components that influence one’s comprehensibility and they are: ''Pronunciation'' – saying the sounds of words correctly; ''Intonation'' – applying proper stress on words and syllables, using rising and falling pitch to indicate questions or statements, using voice to indicate emotion or emphasis, speaking with an appropriate rhythm; and ''Enunciation'' – speaking clearly at an appropriate pace, with effective articulation of words and phrases and appropriate volume.

==Development==
{{main|Language acquisition}}
Before even producing a sound, infants imitate facial expressions and movements.&lt;ref name="Redford, M. A. 2015"&gt;Redford, M. A. (2015). The handbook of speech production. Chichester, West Sussex ; Malden, MA : John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 7 months of age, infants start to experiment with communicative sounds by trying to coordinate producing sound with opening and closing their mouths.

Until the first year of life infants cannot produce coherent words, instead they produce a reoccurring [[babbling]] sound. Babbling allows the infant to experiment with articulating sounds without having to attend to meaning. This repeated babbling starts the initial production of speech. Babbling works with [[object permanence]] and understanding of location to support the networks of our first [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] items or words.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; The infant’s vocabulary growth increases substantially when they are able to understand that objects exist even when they are not present.

The first stage of meaningful speech does not occur until around the age of one. This stage is the holophrastic phase.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. 2005"&gt;Shaffer, D., Wood, E., &amp; Willoughby, T. (2005). Developmental Psychology Childhood and Adolescence. (2nd Canadian Ed). Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt; The holistic stage refers to when infant speech consists of one word at a time (i.e. papa).

The next stage is the telegraphic phase. In this stage infants can form short sentences (i.e., Daddy sit, or Mommy drink). This typically occurs between the ages of one and a half and two and a half years old. This stage is particularly noteworthy because of the explosive growth of their [[lexicon]]. During this stage, infants must select and match stored representations of words to the specific perceptual target word in order to convey meaning or concepts.&lt;ref name="Redford, M. A. 2015"/&gt; With enough vocabulary, infants begin to extract sound patterns, and they learn to break down words into [[phonological]] segments, increasing further the number of words they can learn.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; At this point in an infant's development of speech their lexicon consists of 200 words or more and they are able to understand even more than they can speak.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. 2005"/&gt;
 
When they reach two and a half years their speech production becomes increasingly complex, particularly in its semantic structure. With a more detailed [[semantic network]] the infant learns to express a wider range of meanings, helping the infant develop a complex conceptual system of [[lemma (psycholinguistics)|lemma]]s.

Around the age of four or five the child lemmas have a wide range of diversity, this helps them select the right lemma needed to produce correct speech.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; Reading to infants enhances their lexicon. At this age, children who have been read to and are exposed to more uncommon and complex words have 32 million more words than a child who is [[linguistically]] impoverished.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, M. (2005). Proust and the squid:The story and science of the reading brain, New York, NY. Harper&lt;/ref&gt; At this age the child should be able to speak in full complete sentences, similar to an adult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7880">'''Tarski–Grothendieck set theory''' ('''TG''', named after mathematicians [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]]) is an [[axiomatic set theory]].  It is a [[non-conservative extension]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC) and is distinguished from other axiomatic set theories by the inclusion of '''Tarski's axiom''', which states that for each set there is a [[Grothendieck universe]] it belongs to (see below). Tarski's axiom implies the existence of [[inaccessible cardinal]]s, providing a richer [[ontology]] than that of conventional set theories such as ZFC.  For example, adding this axiom supports category theory.

The [[Mizar system]] and [[Metamath]] use Tarski–Grothendieck set theory for formal verification of proofs.

==Axioms==

Tarski–Grothendieck set theory starts with conventional [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and then adds "Tarski's axiom".  We will use the [[axiom]]s, [[definition]]s, and notation of Mizar to describe it.  Mizar's basic objects and processes are fully [[Formal system|formal]]; they are described informally below.  First, let us assume that:

* Given any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the singleton &lt;math&gt;\{A\}&lt;/math&gt; exists.
* Given any two sets, their unordered and ordered pairs exist.
* Given any family of sets, its union exists.

'''TG''' includes the following axioms, which are conventional because they are also part of [[ZFC]]:
* Set axiom:  Quantified variables range over sets alone; everything is a set (the same [[ontology]] as [[ZFC]]).
* [[Extensionality]] axiom:  Two sets are identical if they have the same members.
* [[Axiom of regularity]]:  No set is a member of itself, and circular chains of membership are impossible.
* [[Axiom schema of replacement]]: Let the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; (the values of &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all members &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) is also a set.

It is Tarski's axiom that distinguishes '''TG''' from other axiomatic set theories. Tarski's axiom also implies the axioms of [[axiom of infinity|infinity]], [[axiom of choice|choice]],&lt;ref&gt;Tarski (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mmlquery.mizar.org/mml/current/wellord2.html#T26&lt;/ref&gt; and [[axiom of power set|power set]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Solovay, [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2008-March/012783.html Re: AC and strongly inaccessible cardinals].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/grothpw.html Metamath '''grothpw'''.]&lt;/ref&gt; It also implies the existence of [[inaccessible cardinal]]s, thanks to which the [[ontology]] of '''TG''' is much richer than that of conventional set theories such as [[ZFC]].

* '''Tarski's axiom''' (adapted from Tarski 1939&lt;ref&gt;Tarski (1939)&lt;/ref&gt;). For every set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a set &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; whose members include:

- &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; itself;

- every subset of every member of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;;

- the power set of every member of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;;

- every subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of [[cardinality]] less than that of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

More formally:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\exists y [x\in y \wedge \forall z\in y(\mathcal P(z)\subseteq y\wedge\mathcal P(z)\in y) \wedge \forall z\in\mathcal P(y)(\neg( z\approx y)\to z\in y)]&lt;/math&gt;

where "&lt;math&gt;\mathcal P(x)&lt;/math&gt;" denotes the power class of ''x'' and "&lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt;" denotes [[equinumerosity]]. What Tarski's axiom states (in the vernacular) for each set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is a [[Grothendieck universe]] it belongs to.

There y looks much like a "universal set" for x - it not only has as members the powerset of x, and all subsets of x, it also has the powerset of that powerset and so on - its members are closed under the operations of taking powerset or taking a subset. It's like a "universal set" except that of course it is not a member of itself and is not a set of all sets. That's the guaranteed [[Grothendieck universe]] it belongs to. And then any such y is itself a member of an even larger "almost universal set" and so on. It's one of the strong cardinality axioms guaranteeing vastly more sets than one normally assumes to exist.

==Implementation in the Mizar system==

The Mizar language, underlying the implementation of '''TG''' and providing its logical syntax, is typed and the types are assumed to be non-empty. Hence, the theory is implicitly taken to be [[Axiom of empty set|non-empty]]. The existence axioms, e.g. the existence of the unordered pair, is also implemented indirectly by the definition of term constructors.

The system includes equality, the membership predicate and the following standard definitions:
* [[Singleton (mathematics)|Singleton]]:  A set with one member;
* [[Unordered pair]]:  A set with two distinct members. &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} = \{b,a\}&lt;/math&gt;;
* [[Ordered pair]]:  The set &lt;math&gt;\{\{a,b\},\{a\}\} = (a,b) \neq (b,a)&lt;/math&gt;;
* [[Subset]]:  A set all of whose members are members of another given set;
* The [[union (set theory)|union]] of a family of sets &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;:   The set of all members of any member of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Implementation in Metamath==

The Metamath system supports arbitrary higher-order logics, but it is typically used with the "set.mm" definitions of axioms.  The [http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-groth.html ax-groth axiom] adds Tarski's axiom, which in Metamath is defined as follows:

⊢ ∃y(x ∈ y ∧ ∀z ∈ y (∀w(w ⊆ z → w ∈ y) ∧ ∃w ∈ y ∀v(v ⊆ z → v ∈ w)) ∧ ∀z(z ⊆ y → (z ≈ y ∨ z ∈ y)))

The '''Tensor Contraction Engine (TCE)''' is a [[compiler]] for a domain-specific language that allows chemists to specify the computation in a high-level [[Wolfram Mathematica|Mathematica]]-style language. It transforms [[tensor]] summation expressions to low-level code (C/Fortran) for specific hardware being mindful of [[Computer memory|memory]] availability, communication costs, [[loop fusion]] and ordering, etc. It is used primarily in [[computational chemistry]].

{{for|the nickname of Karlstad|Karlstad}}
'''''The City of the Sun''''' ({{lang-it|La città del Sole}}; {{lang-la|Civitas Solis}}) is a philosophical work by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] philosopher [[Tommaso Campanella]]. It is an important early [[utopia]]n work. The work was written in Italian in 1602, shortly after Campanella's imprisonment for [[heresy]] and [[sedition]]. A [[Latin]] version was written in 1613&amp;ndash;1614 and published in [[Frankfurt]] in 1623.

==Synopsis==

The book is presented as a [[dialogue]] between "a Grandmaster of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] Sea-Captain". Inspired by [[Plato's Republic|Plato's ''Republic'']] and the description of [[Atlantis]] in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', it describes a [[theocracy|theocratic]] society where goods, women and children are held in common. It also resembles the City of Adocentyn in the ''[[Picatrix]]'', an Arabic [[grimoire]] of astrological magic. In the final part of the work, Campanella prophesies&amp;mdash;in the veiled language of astrology&amp;mdash;that the [[List of Spanish monarchs|Spanish kings]], in alliance with the [[Pope]], are destined to be the instruments of a Divine Plan: the final victory of the True Faith and its diffusion in the whole world. While one could argue that Campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the [[New World]], it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before ''The City of the Sun'', ''The Monarchy in Spain'', in which Campanella exposes his vision of a unified, peaceful world governed by a [[theocracy|theocratic]] monarchy.

== The City ==
Protected and defended by seven circles of walls, constructed of palaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens, the city is located in a place with an ideal climate, conducive to physical health, and on the slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer. One of the most significant aspects of this community is the distribution of work. Once again Campanella engages in an explicit [[polemic]] with Aristotle, who had excluded artisans, peasants and those involved in manual labor from the category of full citizenship and from the highest levels of virtue.

In the City of the Sun no occupation is vile or base, and [[equality before the law|all are of equal]] [[dignity]]—in fact, those workers who are required to expend greater effort, such as artisans and builders, receive more praise. Everyone must be acquainted with all lines of work, and then each person practices the one for which he shows the greatest aptitude. They have no servants, and no service is regarded as unworthy. The only thing that they consider to be despicable is idleness, and in this way they come to privilege the [[decent work|dignity of work]] and to overturn an absurd conception of nobility, linked to inactivity and vice.

Thanks to the equal [[division of labour]], it is sufficient for each person to spend only four [[working time|hours a day working]]; but it is essential that they all work, because the idleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort of the others. The citizens possess nothing; instead, everything is held in [[common ownership|common]], from food to houses, from the acquisition of knowledge to the exercise of activities, from honors to amusements, from women to children.

There are “officials” in charge of the [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] of each thing, who keep an eye out and make sure that this happens justly, but no one can appropriate anything for himself. According to them, possession of a house or a family reinforces “self-love”, with all the dire consequences this generates. They live “like philosophers in common” because they are aware of the negative impact, not only on the social but also on the moral level, of an unequal distribution of goods.

One of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of The City of the Sun, which immediately struck its readers, are the painted walls of the city. Apart from enclosing and protecting the city, the walls are also the curtains of an extraordinary theater and the pages of an illustrated encyclopedia of knowledge. The walls of the palaces are painted with images of all the arts and sciences.

Starting with the wall that holds up the columns of the temple and gradually descending in large circles, following the order of the planets from Mercury to Saturn, we encounter illustrations of the heavens and the stars, of mathematical figures, of every country on earth and of all the marvels and secrets of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds, until we arrive at mankind: on the internal wall of the sixth circle the mechanical arts and their inventors are represented.

Campanella was greatly interested in all ingenious discoveries, and in The City of the Sun he provides many examples of curious inventions, such as vessels able to navigate without wind and without sails, and stirrups that make it possible to guide a horse using only one's feet, leaving one's hands free. On the external wall legislators are depicted; and it is here, in “a place of great honor”—but along with Moses, Osiris, Jove, Mercury and Muhammad—that the Genoese sailor recognizes Christ and the twelve apostles. Knowledge is not enclosed in books kept in separate places such as libraries but is openly on show to everyone's eyes. Visualizing in this manner promotes a quicker, easier and more efficient form of learning, in that it is connected to the [[art of memory]], which underlines the evocative and emotive power of images. From a tender age children run around in this theater of knowledge, appropriately guided and following correct itineraries, so that they learn joyously, as if playing a game, without effort or pain.

In addition to the [[common ownership|community of goods]] and the painted walls, another characteristic feature of the City of the Sun, one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that Campanella himself describes as “hard and arduous”, is the community of wives. This is the solution adopted by the citizens to the problem of generation. Echoing the teaching of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Ocellus Lucanus]], Campanella says that they are amazed that humans are preoccupied by the breeding of horses and dogs while neglecting their own. The act of generation entails a large responsibility of the part of the parents; and if it is exercised in an incorrect manner, it can give rise to a long chain of suffering.

Moreover, there is a close connection between a person's natural “complexion” or character, which is inborn and not afterwards modifiable, and moral virtue, which needs a suitable terrain in order to take root and prosper. Generation should therefore respect precise norms and not be entrusted to chance nor to individual sentiments. The citizens distinguish between love and sex. [[Affection]] between men and women, based on friendship and respect more than sexual attraction, is expressed in acts that are far removed from sexuality, such as exchanges of gifts, conversation and dancing. Sexual generation, on the other hand, must obey strict rules regarding the physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a propitious time for conception, determined by an astrologer. Such a union is not the expression of a personal, emotional or passionate relationship, but rather is connected to the social responsibility of generation and to love for the collective community.

The religious beliefs of the citizenry, even though they include fundamental principles of Christianity (such as the [[immortality of the soul]] and divine providence), form a [[natural religion]] that establishes a sort of [[osmosis]] between the city and the stars. The temple is open and not surrounded by walls. In one of his poems Campanella promises: “I shall make the heavens a temple and the stars an altar”.&lt;ref&gt;''Le poesie'', 1998, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; On the vault of the temple's dome the stars are depicted together with their influence on earthly affairs. The altar, on which are placed a celestial and a terrestrial globe, is in the form of the sun. Prayers are directed toward the heavens. The task of the twenty-four priests, who live in cells located in the highest part of the temple, is to observe the stars and, using astronomical instruments, to take account of all their movements. It is their job to indicate the times most favorable for generation and for agricultural labors, acting in this way as intermediaries between God and human beings.

==Trento 1602 manuscript==
[[File:Pagina di manoscritto 1602.jpg|thumb|Manuscript page (Trento) 1602]]
In [[Trento]]'s Civic Library, there is kept a 1602 manuscript of ''The City of the Sun'' (shelf mark BCT1-1538), discovered in 1943 by Italian historian [[Luigi Firpo]]. It is considered the most ancient manuscript copy that has survived to present time. The text arrived at the Library through the baron Antonio Mazzetti [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Mazzetti] 's (1781–1841) bequest. He was a book collector and bibliophile and, as written in his will, he donated his book heritage to the Civic Library. 

The manuscript was restored in 1980. It is made of parchment tied on paperboard. It consists of two codicological unities joined together years after their writing: the first is a Venetian historical chronicle from 1297 to 1582, followed by a list of "Hospedali di Venezia" ("Hospitals in Venice"). At the bottom, it is sewed to a small-sized booklet independently enumerated: it's a copy by anonymous author of "The City of the Sun". The transcription is meticulous and there only are a few insignificant mistakes.

In 2016, the manuscript was uploaded to the digital library [[Wikisource]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:s:Indice:Campanella - La Città del Sole, manoscritto, 1602.djvu|La Città del Sole]] (Wikisource).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theta model''', or '''Ermentrout–Kopell [[canonical form|canonical]] model''', is a [[biological neuron model]] originally developed to model neurons in the animal [[Aplysia]], and later used in various fields of [[computational neuroscience]].  The model is particularly well suited to describe neuron [[bursting]], which are rapid oscillations in the [[membrane potential]] of a neuron interrupted by periods of relatively little oscillation.  Bursts are often found in [[neurons]] responsible for controlling and maintaining steady rhythms.  For example, breathing is controlled by a small network of bursting neurons in the brain stem.   Of the three main classes of bursting [[neurons]] ([[Bursting#Square-wave burster|square wave bursting]], [[parabolic bursting]], and [[elliptic bursting]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee |title=Stability Analysis Of Bursting Models |journal=Journal of the Korean Mathematical Society |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=827–45 |year=2005 |doi=10.4134/jkms.2005.42.4.827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vries G.

[[Parabolic bursting]] is characterized by a series of bursts that are regulated by a slower external oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an [[excitable system]] coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This slow oscillation changes the frequency of the faster oscillation so that the frequency curve of the burst pattern resembles a parabola.

The model has just one [[state variable]] which describes the membrane voltage of a neuron. In contrast, the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] consists of four state variables (one voltage variable and three gating variables) and the  [[Morris–Lecar model]] is defined by two state variables (one voltage variable and one gating variable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ermentrout B, Terman DH |title=Mathematical Foundations of Neuroscience |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-387-87707-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single [[state variable]] of the theta model, and the elegantly simple [[equations]] that govern its behavior allow for [[analytical expression|analytic]], or [[Closed-form expression|closed-form]] solutions (including an explicit expression for the [[phase response curve]]).  The [[dynamical system|dynamics]] of the model take place on the [[unit circle]], and are governed by two [[cosine]] functions and a real-valued input [[function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bursting is "an oscillation in which an observable [part] of the system, such as [[voltage]] or [[chemical concentration]], changes periodically between an active phase of rapid [[action potential|spike]] oscillations (the fast sub-system) and a phase of quiescence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bertram, R., M.

All three forms of bursting are capable of beating and periodic bursting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R. Kim, M. |title=Mathematical Description of a Bursting Pacemaker Neuron by a Modification of the Hodgkin–Huxley Equations |journal=Biophysical Journal | volume=16 | issue=3 |pages=227–44 |year=1976 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3495(76)85683-4 |pmid=1252578 |pmc=1334834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic bursting (or just bursting) is of more interest because many phenomena are controlled by, or arise from, bursting.  For example, bursting due to a changing [[membrane potential]] is common in various neurons, including but not limited to [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] chattering neurons, [[thalamacortical]] neurons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Izhikevich, E.M. |title=Bursting |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=1 | issue=3 |pages=1300 |year=2006 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1300}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pacemaker neurons]].  Pacemakers in general are known to burst and [[synchronize]] as a population, thus generating a robust rhythm that can maintain repetitive tasks like breathing, walking, and eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marder, E. |author2=R.

Bursting cells are important for motor generation and synchronization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Izhikevich, E.M. |title=Bursting |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=1 | issue=3 |pages=1300 |year=2006 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[pre-Bötzinger complex]] in the [[mammal]]ian [[brain stem]] contains many bursting neurons that control autonomous breathing rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Butera, J.

Since many biological processes involve bursting behavior, there is a wealth of various bursting models in scientific literature.  For instance, there exist several models for [[interneurons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Erisir, A., D. Lau, B. Rudy, and S. Leonard |title=Function of Specific K+ Channels in Sustained High-frequency Firing of Fast-spiking Neocortical Cells |journal=J. Neurophysiol. | volume=82 |pages=2476–489 |year=1999 |doi=10.1152/jn.1999.82.5.2476}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[spiking neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Izhikevich, E.M. |title=Which Model to Use for Cortical Spiking Neurons? |journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks | volume=15| issue=5 |pages=1063–070 |year=2004 |doi=10.1109/tnn.2004.832719}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the literature on parabolic bursting models is relatively scarce.

Parabolic bursting models are [[mathematical models]] that mimic parabolic bursting in real biological systems.  Each [[bursting|burst]] of a [[parabolic burster]] has a characteristic feature in the burst structure itself – the frequency at the beginning and end of the burst is low relative to the frequency in the middle of the burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee |title=Stability Analysis Of Bursting Models |journal=Journal of the Korean Mathematical Society |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=827–45 |year=2005 |doi=10.4134/jkms.2005.42.4.827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[frequency]] plot of one burst resembles a [[parabola]], hence the name "parabolic burst".  Furthermore, unlike elliptic or square-wave bursting, there is a slow modulating wave which, at its peak, excites the cell enough to generate a burst and inhibits the cell in regions near its minimum.  As a result, the neuron periodically transitions between bursting and quiescence.

Parabolic bursting has been studied most extensively in the R15 neuron, which is one of six types of neurons of the ''Aplysia'' abdominal ganglion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faber D, Klee M |title=Membrane Characteristics of Bursting Pacemaker Neurons in Aplysia |journal=Nature New Biology |volume=240 |pages=29–31 |year=1972 |doi=10.1038/newbio240029a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of thirty neurons comprising the [[abdominal ganglion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kandel, E. R., W. T. Frazier, R. Waziri, and R. E. Coggeshall |title=Direct and Common Connections Among Identified Neurons in Aplysia |journal=J.

Though there was no specific mention of the term "parabolic bursting" in Plant's papers, [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Plant_model Plant's model(s)] do involve a slow, modulating oscillation which control bursting in the model(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R.

Both of Plant's papers on the topic involve a model derived from the [[Hodgkin–Huxley equations]] and include extra conductances, which only add to the complexity of the model.

Carpenter developed her model primarily for a square wave burster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carpenter, Gail A. |title=Bursting Phenomena in Excitable Membranes |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume=36 | issue=2 |pages=334–372 |year=1979 |doi=10.1137/0136027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model was capable of producing a small variety of square wave bursts and produced parabolic bursts as a consequence of adding an extra [[Electrical conductance|conductance]].  However, the model applied to only spatial propagation down [[axons]] and not situations where oscillations are limited to a small region in space (i.e. it was not suited for "space-clamped" situations).

The lack of a simple, generalizable, space-clamped, parabolic bursting model motivated Ermentrout and Kopell to develop the theta model.

==Characteristics of the model==

===General equations===
It is possible to describe a multitude of parabolic bursting cells by deriving a simple mathematical model, called a canonical model.  Derivation of the Ermentrout and Kopell canonical model begins with the general form for parabolic bursting, and notation will be fixed to clarify the discussion.  The letters &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are reserved for functions; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for state variables; &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; for [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalars]].

In the following generalized system of equations for parabolic bursting, the values of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; describe the membrane potential and ion channels, typical of many [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Conductance-based_models conductance-based] biological neuron models.  Slow oscillations are controlled by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and ultimately described by &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  These slow oscillations can be, for example, slow fluctuations in calcium concentration inside a cell.  The function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; couples &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;, thereby allowing  the second system, &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt;, to influence the behavior of the first system, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  In more succinct terms, "&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; generates the spikes and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; generates the slow waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The equations are:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x) + \varepsilon^2 g(x,y,\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{y} = \varepsilon h(x,y,\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; entries (i.e. &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a vector with &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; entries (i.e. &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}^q&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is small and positive, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are [[Smooth function|smooth]] (i.e. infinitely differentiable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional constraints are required to guarantee parabolic bursting.  First, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; must produce a circle in [[phase space]] that is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], meaning it does not change under certain [[Transformation (function)|transformations]].  This circle must also be [[Attractor|attracting]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] located at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  The second criterion requires that when &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}=h(0,y,0)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a stable [[limit cycle]] solution.  These criteria can be summarized by the following points:

#When &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; "has an attracting invariant circle with a single critical point", with the critical point located at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, and
#When &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}=h(0,y,0)&lt;/math&gt; has a stable limit cycle solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theta model can be used in place of any parabolic bursting model that satisfies the assumptions above.

=== Model equations and properties ===

The theta model is a reduction of the generalized system from the previous section and takes the form,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\theta}{dt}=1-\cos\theta+(1+\cos\theta)I(t), \qquad \theta \in S^1.&lt;/math&gt;

This model is one of the simplest excitable neuron models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKennoch, S., Voegtlin T., and Bushnell L. |title=Spike-Timing Error Backpropagation in Theta Neuron Networks |journal=Neural Computation | volume=21 | issue=1 |pages=9–45| doi=10.1162/neco.2009.09-07-610 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; represents the angle in [[radian]]s, and the input function, &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is typically chosen to be [[Periodic function|periodic]].  Whenever &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; reaches the value &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;, the model is said to produce a spike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout–Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKennoch, S., Voegtlin T., and Bushnell L. |title=Spike-Timing Error Backpropagation in Theta Neuron Networks |journal=Neural Computation | volume=21 | issue=1 |pages=9–45| doi=10.1162/neco.2009.09-07-610 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theta model is capable of a single [[Saddle-node bifurcation|saddle-node]] [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] and can be shown to be the "[[Normal form (mathematics)|normal form]] for the saddle-node on a limit cycle bifurcation" ([http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Saddle-node_bifurcation_on_invariant_circle SNIC]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout-Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When &lt;math&gt;(I &lt; 0)&lt;/math&gt;, the system is excitable, i.e., given an appriate [[Perturbation (biology)|perturbation]] the system will produce a spike. Incidentally, when viewed in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;), the [[unstable]] critical point is actually a [[saddle point]] because &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; is attracting in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  When &lt;math&gt;(I &gt; 0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is also positive, and the system will give rise to a limit cycle.   Therefore, the bifurcation point is located at &lt;math&gt;I(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Near the bifurcation point, the theta model resembles the [[quadratic integrate and fire]] model:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 + I.&lt;/math&gt;

For I &gt; 0, the solutions "blow up" rather quickly.  By resetting the trajectory &lt;math&gt;x(t) &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; when it reaches &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the total period is then

: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{I}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the period diverges as &lt;math&gt;I \rightarrow 0^+&lt;/math&gt; and the frequency converges to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout–Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
When &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some slow wave which can be both negative and positive, the system is capable of producing parabolic bursts.  Consider the simple example &lt;math&gt;I(t) := \sin(\alpha t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is relatively small.  Then for &lt;math&gt;\alpha t \in (0, \pi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; is strictly positive and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; makes multiple passes through the angle &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in multiple bursts.   Note that whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha t&lt;/math&gt; is near zero or &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, the theta neuron will spike at relatively a low frequency, and whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha t&lt;/math&gt; is near &lt;math&gt;\alpha t = \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; the neuron will spike with very high frequency. When &lt;math&gt;\alpha t = \pi&lt;/math&gt;, the frequency of spikes is zero since the period is infinite since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can no longer pass through &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, for &lt;math&gt;\alpha t \in (\pi, 2\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, the neuron is excitable and will no longer burst.  This qualitative description highlights the characteristics that make the theta model a parabolic bursting model.  Not only does the model have periods of quiescence between bursts which are modulated by a slow wave, but the frequency of spikes at the beginning and end of each burst is high relative to the frequency at the middle of the burst.

===Derivation===
The derivation comes in the form of two [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] in Ermentrout and Kopell (1986).  Lemma 1, in summary, states that when viewing the general equations above in a subset &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the equations take the form:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x_1} = \overline{f}(x_1) + \varepsilon^2 \overline{g}(x_1, y, \varepsilon) \qquad x_1 \in S^1,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{y} = \varepsilon \overline{h}(x_1, y, \varepsilon) \;\;\;\;\;\; y \in \mathbb{R}^q.&lt;/math&gt;

By lemma 2 in Ermentrout and Kopell 1986, "There exists a change of coordinates... and a constant, c, such that in new coordinates, the two equations above [[Pointwise convergence|converge pointwise]] as &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; to the equations

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = (1-\cos\theta) + (1 + \cos\theta)\overline{g}(0,y,0),&lt;/math&gt;
 
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{y} = \frac{1}{c} \overline{h}(0,y,0),&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\theta \neq \pi&lt;/math&gt;.  Convergence is [[Uniform convergence|uniform]] except near &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;." (Ermentrout and Kopell, 1986).  By letting &lt;math&gt;I(t) := \overline{g}(0,y,0)&lt;/math&gt;, resemblance to the theta model is obvious.

===Phase response curve===
[[File:theta-prc.png|right|thumb|250px|The phase response curve of the theta model with K = 1. Since perturbations always result in a phase advance, this is a type 1 PRC.]]

In general, given a scalar phase model of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = f(\theta) + g(\theta)S(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the perturbation current, a closed form solution of the [[phase response curve]] (PRC) does not exist.

However, the theta model is a special case of such an oscillator and happens to have a closed-form solution for the PRC.  The theta model is recovered by defining &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;f(\theta) = (1-\cos\theta) + I(1+\cos\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;g(\theta) = (1 + \cos\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

In the appendix of Ermentrout 1996, the PRC is shown to be &lt;math&gt;Z(\theta) = K(1+\cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout, B. |title=Type I Membranes, Phase Resetting Curves, and Synchrony |journal=Neural Computation | volume=8 | issue=5 |pages=979–1001| year=1996 | doi=10.1162/neco.1996.8.5.979 | pmid=8697231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar models==

===Plant's model===
The authors of Soto-Treviño et al. (1996) discuss in great detail the similarities between Plant's (1976) model and the theta model.  At first glance, the mechanisms of bursting in both systems are very different:  In Plant's model, there are two slow oscillations – one for conductance of a specific current and one for the concentration of calcium.  The calcium oscillations are active only when the membrane potential is capable of oscillating.  This contrasts heavily against the theta model in which one slow wave modulates the burst of the neuron and the slow wave has no dependence upon the bursts.  Despite these differences, the theta model is shown to be similar to Plant's (1976) model by a series of coordinate transformations. In the process, Soto-Trevino, et al. discovered that the theta model was more general than originally believed.

===Quadratic integrate-and-fire===

The quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) model was created by Latham et al. in 2000 to explore the many questions related to networks of neurons with low firing rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P. E., B. J. Richmond, P. G. Nelson, and S. Nirenberg. |title=Intrinsic Dynamics in Neuronal Networks. I. Theory. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | volume=88 | issue=2 |pages=808–27 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear to Latham et al. why networks of neurons with "standard" parameters were unable to generate sustained low frequency firing rates, while networks with low firing rates were often seen in biological systems.

According to Gerstner and Kistler (2002), the [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Quadratic_integrate_and_fire_neuron quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) model] is given by the following differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\tau \dot{u} = a_0(u-u_\text{rest})(u-u_c) + R_m I,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is a strictly positive scalar, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane potential, &lt;math&gt;u_\text{rest}&lt;/math&gt; is the resting potential &lt;math&gt;u_c&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum potential necessary for the membrane to produce an action potential, &lt;math&gt;R_m&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane resistance, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; the membrane time constant and &lt;math&gt;u_c &gt; u_\text{rest}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Spiking Neuron Models. Single Neurons, Populations, Plasticity |author1=W. Gerstner  |author2=W. Kistler  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When there is no input current (i.e. &lt;math&gt;I = 0&lt;/math&gt;), the membrane potential quickly returns to rest following a perturbation.  When the input current, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, is large enough, the membrane potential (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;) surpasses its firing threshold and rises rapidly (indeed, it reaches arbitrarily large values in finite time); this represents the peak of the action potential.  To simulate the recovery after the action potential, the membrane voltage is then reset to a lower value &lt;math&gt;u_r&lt;/math&gt;.  To avoid dealing with arbitrarily large values in simulation, researchers will often set an upper limit on the membrane potential, above which the membrane potential will be reset; for example Latham et al. (2000) reset the voltage from +20&amp;nbsp;mV to −80&amp;nbsp;mV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P. E., B. J. Richmond, P. G. Nelson, and S. Nirenberg. |title=Intrinsic Dynamics in Neuronal Networks. I. Theory. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | volume=88 | issue=2 |pages=808–27 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This voltage reset constitutes an action potential.

The theta model is very similar to the QIF model since the theta model differs from the QIF model by means of a simple coordinate transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brunel, Nicolas, Latham |title=Firing Rate of the Noisy Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Neuron |journal=Neural Computation | volume=15 | issue=10 |pages=2281–306 |year=2003 |doi=10.1162/089976603322362365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P. E., B. J. Richmond, P. G. Nelson, and S. Nirenberg. |title=Intrinsic Dynamics in Neuronal Networks. I. Theory. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | volume=88 | issue=2 |pages=808–27 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By scaling the voltage appropriately and letting &lt;math&gt;\Delta I&lt;/math&gt; be the change in current from the minimum current required to elicit a spike, the QIF model can be rewritten in the form

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{u} = u^2 + \Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the theta model can be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = 1-\cos\theta +  (1+\cos\theta) \Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

The following proof will show that the QIF model becomes the theta model given an appropriate choice for the coordinate transform.

Define &lt;math&gt;u(t) = \tan(\theta/2)&lt;/math&gt;.  Recall that &lt;math&gt;d\tan(x)/dx = 1/\cos^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;, so taking the derivative yields

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{u} = \frac 1 {\cos^2\left(\frac \theta 2\right)} \frac 1 2 \dot{\theta} = u^2 + \Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

An additional substitution and rearranging in terms of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; yields

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = 2\left[ \cos^2\left(\frac\theta2\right)\tan^2 \left(\frac\theta2\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac\theta2\right)\Delta I \right] = 2\left[ \sin^2 \left(\frac \theta 2\right) + \cos^2 \left ( \frac \theta 2\right)\Delta I \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Using the trigonometric identities &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x/2) = \frac{1+\cos(x)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x/2) = \frac{1-\cos(x)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; as defined above, we have that

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = 2 \left[ \frac{1-\cos\theta} 2 + \left(\frac{1+\cos\theta}{2}\right) \Delta I \right] = 1-\cos\theta + (1+\cos\theta)\Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, there exists a change of coordinates, namely &lt;math&gt;u(t) = \tan(\theta/2)&lt;/math&gt;, which transforms the QIF model into the theta model.  The reverse transformation also exists, and is attained by taking the inverse of the first transformation.

===Neuroscience===

====Lobster stomatogastric ganglion====
Though the theta model was originally used to model slow cytoplasmic oscillations that modulate fast membrane oscillations in a single cell, Ermentrout and Kopell found that the theta model could be applied just as easily to systems of two electrically coupled cells such that the slow oscillations of one cell modulates the bursts of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such cells serve as the central pattern generator (CPG) of the [[Pylorus|pyloric]] system in the lobster stomatograstic ganglion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marder, E.  |author2=Eisen,  J.

Their computational results showed that this may happen due to strong stimulation of a large group of inhibitory neurons. This effect not only inhibits neighboring populations, but has the extra consequence of leaving the inhibitory neurons in disarray, thus increasing the effectiveness of inhibition.

===Theta networks===
Osan et al. (2002) found that in a network of theta neurons, there exist two different types of waves that propagate smoothly over the network, given a sufficiently large coupling strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osan R. |author2=Rubin J. |author3=Ermentrout B.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Regular Traveling Waves in a One-Dimensional Network of Theta Neurons |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume=62 | issue=4 |pages=1197–1221 |year=2002 |doi=10.1137/s0036139901387253|citeseerx=10.1.1.83.2413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such traveling waves are of interest because they are frequently observed in pharmacologically treated brain slices, but are hard to measure in intact animals brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osan R. |author2=Rubin J. |author3=Ermentrout B.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Regular Traveling Waves in a One-Dimensional Network of Theta Neurons |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume=62 | issue=4 |pages=1197–1221 |year=2002 |doi=10.1137/s0036139901387253|citeseerx=10.1.1.83.2413 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors used a network of theta models in favor of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models due to two primary advantages: first, the theta model is continuous, and second, the theta model retains information about "the delay between the crossing of the spiking threshold and the actual firing of an action potential".  The LIF fails to satisfy both conditions.

====Steepest gradient descent learning rule====
The theta model can also be applied to research beyond the realm of biology. McKennoch et al. (2008) derived a steepest [[gradient descent]] [[Association rule learning|learning rule]] based on theta neuron dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKennoch, S., Voegtlin T., and Bushnell L. |title=Spike-Timing Error Backpropagation in Theta Neuron Networks |journal=Neural Computation | volume=21 | issue=1 |pages=9–45| doi=10.1162/neco.2009.09-07-610 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their model is based on the assumption that "intrinsic neuron dynamics are sufficient to achieve consistent time coding, with no need to involve the precise shape of postsynaptic currents..."  contrary to similar models like SpikeProp and [[Tempotron]], which depend heavily on the shape of the [[postsynaptic potential]] (PSP).  Not only could the multilayer theta network perform just about as well as Tempotron learning, but the rule trained the multilayer theta network to perform certain tasks neither SpikeProp nor Tempotron were capable of.

==Limitations==
According to Kopell and Ermentrout (2004), a limitation of the theta lies in its relative difficulty in electrically coupling two theta neurons.  It is possible to create large networks of theta neurons – and much research has been done with such networks – but it may be advantageous to use Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons, which allow for electrical coupling in a "straightforward way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kopell N.  |author2=Ermentrout B.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Chemical and Electrical Synapses Perform Complementary Roles in the Synchronization of Interneuronal Networks |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=101 |issue=43 |pages=15482–5487 |year=2004 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0406343101 |pmid=15489269 |pmc=524455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

A '''tournament''' is a [[competition]] involving a relatively large number of competitors, all participating in a [[sport]] or [[game]]. More specifically, the term may be used in either of two overlapping senses:
# One or more competitions held at a single venue and concentrated into a relatively short time interval.
# A competition involving a number of matches, each involving a subset of the competitors, with the overall tournament winner determined based on the combined results of these individual matches. These are common in those sports and games where each match must involve a small number of competitors: often precisely two, as in most [[team sport]]s, [[racket sport]]s and [[combat sport]]s, many [[card game]]s and [[board game]]s, and many forms of [[debate|competitive debating]]. Such tournaments allow large numbers to compete against each other in spite of the restriction on numbers in a single match.

These two senses are distinct. All [[golf tournament]]s meet the first definition, but while [[match play]] tournaments meet the second, [[stroke play]] tournaments do not, since there are no distinct matches within the tournament. In contrast, [[football (soccer)|association football]] leagues like the [[Premier League]] are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many stadia over a period of up to a season. Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon tennis championship]]. Tournaments "are temporally demarcated events, participation in which confers levels of status and prestige amongst all participating members"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Alex|last2=Stringfellow|first2=Lindsay|last3=Maclean|first3=Mairi|last4=MacLaren|first4=Andrew|last5=O’Gorman|first5=Kevin|date=2015-03-24|title=Puppets of necessity? Celebritisation in structured reality television|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=31|issue=5–6|pages=478–501|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''tournament-match''' (or '''''tie''''' or '''''fixture''''' or '''''heat''''') may involve multiple game-matches (or '''''rubbers''''' or '''''legs''''') between the competitors. For example, in the [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] tournament, a tie between two nations involves five rubbers between the nations' players. The team that wins the most rubbers wins the tie. In the later rounds of [[UEFA Champions League]] , each fixture is [[two-legged tie|played over two legs]]. The scores of each leg are added, and the team with the higher aggregate score wins the fixture, with [[away goals rule|away goals]] used as a tiebreaker and a [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shoot out]] if away goals cannot determine a winner of the game.

=={{anchor|Knockout}}&lt;!-- [[Knockout tournament]] [[elimination tournament]] redirect here--&gt;Knockout tournaments==
A '''knockout tournament''' or '''elimination tournament''' is divided into successive rounds; each competitor plays in at least one fixture per round. The top-ranked competitors in each fixture progress to the next round. As rounds progress, the number of competitors and fixtures decreases. The final round, usually known as the final or cup final, consists of just one fixture; the winner of which is the overall champion.

In a [[single-elimination tournament]], only the top-ranked competitors in a fixture progress; in 2-competitor games, only the winner progresses. All other competitors are eliminated. This ensures a winner is decided with the minimum number of fixtures. However, most competitors will be eliminated after relatively few matches; a single bad or unlucky performance can nullify many preceding excellent ones.

A [[double-elimination tournament]] may be used in 2-competitor games to allow each competitor a single loss without being eliminated from the tournament. All losers from the main [[bracket (tournament)|bracket]] enter a losers' bracket, the winner of which plays off against the main bracket's winner.

A triple elimination tournament allows a competitor to lose two games, and creates a third bracket or fourth bracket, and are usually followed by a playoff. It is usually used in [[curling]] tournaments. 

Some elimination tournaments are in a [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|best-of-''x'' series]], allowing a competitor to lose at most four times (to the same competitor) before being eliminated.

Some formats use a [[repechage]], allowing losers to play extra rounds before re-entering the main competition in a later round. [[Sport rowing|Rowing]] [[regatta]]s often have repechage rounds for the "fastest losers" from the heats. The winners of these progress, but are at a disadvantage in later rounds owing to the extra effort expended during the repechage.

A [[McIntyre System|family of tournament systems]] that grew from a system devised for the Victorian Football League, the historic predecessor to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), allow the teams with the best record before the playoffs to lose a game without being eliminated, whereas lesser qualifiers are not. Several of the most prominent leagues in Australia use such a system, such as the AFL and the [[National Rugby League]] in rugby league. The [[A-League]] of association football also used such a system through its 2011–12 season, but now uses a pure knockout playoff. Similar systems are used in cricket's [[Indian Premier League]] and most [[curling]] tournaments, and were also used by the [[Super League]] of European rugby league before being scrapped after the 2014 season.

In [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] meetings, fastest losers may progress in a running event held over several rounds; e.g. the qualifiers for a later round might be the first 4 from each of 6 heats, plus the 8 fastest losers from among the remaining runners.

An extreme form of the knockout tournament is the stepladder format where the strongest team (or individual, depending on the sport) is assured of a berth at the final round while the next strongest teams are given byes according to their strength/seeds; for example, in a four team tournament, the fourth and third seed figure in the first round, then the winner goes to the semifinals against the second seed, while the survivor faces the first seed at the final. Four American sports organizations either currently use this format, or have in the past:
* Since the mid-1960s, most [[ten-pin bowling]] events use a stepladder final, usually involving five bowlers.
* Two U.S. college conferences operate a tournament format in basketball that combines two stepladder tournaments into one—that is, both halves of the bracket are organized as stepladder tournaments. When eight teams are involved in the tournament, the bottom four teams play in the first round; the survivors will face the #3 and #4 seeds, and the winners of those matches take on the top two seeds in the semifinals. This format was used by the [[West Coast Conference]] (WCC) for its men's and women's tournaments from 2003 through 2013, and has been used by the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] (OVC) for both sexes since 2011. From 2019 forward, the WCC tournaments will return to the aforementioned format, but add an extra round so that all 10 current conference members will participate (note that the OVC tournament does not involve all of the league's members, currently 12).
* In the Philippines, the [[UAAP Basketball Championship]] and the [[NCAA Basketball Championship (Philippines)|NCAA Basketball Championship]] both use the stepladder format if a team wins all elimination round (regular season) games. This format has been adopted to other sports in both leagues. If no team wins all elimination round games, the playoffs remains in the usual two-round playoff format.
* The now-defunct [[Women's Professional Soccer]] used this format in all of its three seasons of existence. For an example of its playoff system, see [[2009 Women's Professional Soccer Playoffs]].

==Group tournaments==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Division (sport)]] --&gt;
A group tournament, [[League system|league]], [[Division (sport)|division]] or [[conference (sports)|conference]] involves all competitors playing a number of ''fixtures'' (again, a fixture is one name for a tournament-match that determines who, out of two or three or more, will advance; a fixture may consist of one or more game-matches between competitors). Points are awarded for each fixture, with competitors ranked based either on total number of points or average points per fixture. Usually each competitor plays an equal number of fixtures, in which case rankings by total points and by average points are equivalent. The English [[County Championship]] in cricket did not require an equal number of matches prior to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.cricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/CC_HISTORY.html County Championship history] [[Cricinfo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[round-robin tournament]], each competitor plays all the others an equal number of times, once in a single round-robin tournament and twice in a double round-robin tournament. This is often seen as producing the most reliable rankings. However, for large numbers of competitors it may require an unfeasibly large number of rounds. A [[Swiss system tournament]] attempts to determine a winner reliably, based on a smaller number of fixtures. Fixtures are scheduled one round at a time; a competitor will play another who has a similar record in previous rounds of the tournament. This allows the top (and bottom) competitors to be determined with fewer rounds than a round-robin, though the middle rankings are unreliable.

There may be other considerations besides reliability of rankings. In some [[professional sport|professional]] team sports, weaker teams are given an easier slate of fixtures as a form of [[handicapping]]. Sometimes schedules are weighted in favour of [[local derby|local derbies]] or other [[sports rivalry|traditional rivalries]]. For example, NFL teams play two games against each of the other three teams in their division, one game against half of the other twelve teams in their conference, and one game against a quarter of the sixteen teams in the other conference.

American sports are also unusual in providing fixtures between competitors who are, for ranking purposes, in different groups.  Another, systematic, example of this was the [[2006 Women's Rugby World Cup]]: each of the teams in Group A played each of the teams in Group B, with the groups ranked separately based on the results. (Groups C and D intertwined similarly.)  An elaboration of this system is the Mitchell movement in duplicate bridge, discussed [[#Bridge tournaments|below]], where North-South pairs play East-West pairs.

{{main|Group tournament ranking system}}
In 2-competitor games where [[tie (draw)|tie]]s are rare or impossible, competitors are typically ranked by number of wins, with ties counting half; each competitors' listings are usually ordered Wins–Losses(–Ties). Where ties are more common, this may be 2 points for a win and 1 for a tie, which is mathematically equivalent but avoids having too many half-points in the listings. These are usually ordered Wins–Ties–Losses. If there are more than two competitors per fixture, points may be ordinal (for example, 3 for first, 2 for second, 1 for third).

==Multi-stage tournaments==
{{anchor|Group stage}}&lt;!--[[Group stage]] redirects here--&gt;
Many tournaments are held in multiple stages, with the top teams in one stage progressing to the next. American professional team sports have a "regular season" (group tournament) acting as qualification for the "post season" or "[[playoffs]]" (single-elimination tournament). A '''group stage''' (also known as '''pool play''' or the '''pool stage''') is a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] stage in a multi-stage tournament. The competitors are divided into multiple groups, which play separate round-robins in parallel. Measured by a [[Group tournament ranking system|points-based ranking system]], the top competitors in each group qualify for the next stage.  In most editions of the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals tournament, the first round has been a group stage with groups of four teams, the top two qualifying for the "knockout stage" played as a [[single-elimination tournament]]. This format is common in many international team events, such as [[World cup competition|World Cup]]s or [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] tournaments. Some tournaments have two group stages, for example the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] or the [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League]]. As well as a fixed number of qualifiers from each group, some may be determined by comparing between different groups: at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] the best four of six third-place sides qualified; at the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] the best one of five third-place sides did so.

Sometimes, results from an earlier phase are carried over into a later phase. In the [[Cricket World Cup]], the second stage, known as the Super Eight since [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]] and before that the Super Six, features two teams from each of four preliminary groups (previously three teams from two preliminary groups), who do not replay the teams they have already played, but instead reuse the original results in the new league table. Formerly in the [[Swiss Football League]], teams played a double round-robin, at which point they were split into a top "championship" group and a bottom "relegation" group; each played a separate double round-robin, with results of all 32 matches counting for ranking each group. A similar system is also used by the [[Scottish Premiership]] and its historic predecessor, the [[Scottish Premier League]], since 2000. After 33 games, when every club has played every other club three times, the division is split into two halves. Clubs play a further 5 matches, against the teams in their half of the division. This can (and often does) result in the team placed 7th having a higher points total than the team placed 6th (because their final 5 games are considerably easier), nevertheless, a team in the bottom half never receives a higher final ranking than a team which qualified for the top half.

A multi-stage pool system was implemented by [[Curling Canada]] for the Canadian championship curling tournaments (the [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] for women and the [[Tim Hortons Brier]] for men) starting in 2018. The change was intended to allow the expansion of the main stage of the tournament from twelve to sixteen teams while keeping the round robin at eleven games. The teams are seeded using [[CTRS standings|a ranking system]] in which points are calculated based on the teams' results in all competitive [[bonspiel]]s using a complicated formula. Seeds 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16 and placed in Pool A while seeds 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14 and 15 are placed in Pool B. After each team has played seven games, the top four teams from each pool advance to the "Championship Pool." Carrying over their entire round robin records with them, Championship Pool teams play one game against each of the four teams in the opposite pool, with the top four teams qualifying for the [[page playoffs]]. In contrast, teams that fail to qualify for the Championship Pool play only one additional "Placement Round" game against the team that finished in the same position in the opposite pool for the purposes of determining final tournament ranking. For these teams, there is little else to play for since there is no form of relegation (and, with the expansion of the field to sixteen teams, no "Pre-Qualifying Tournament") and seeding is based solely on the performances of the participating teams and not the past results of the provinces and territories they represent.

The [[Premier A Slovenian Basketball League|top Slovenian basketball league]] has a unique system. In its first phase, 12 of the league's 13 clubs compete in a full home-and-away season, with the country's representative in the [[Euroleague]] (an elite pan-European club competition) exempt. The league then splits. The top seven teams are joined by the Euroleague representative for a second home-and-away season, with no results carrying over from the first phase. These eight teams compete for four spots in a final playoff. The bottom five teams play their own home-and-away league, but their previous results ''do'' carry over. These teams are competing to avoid relegation, with the bottom team automatically relegated and the second-from-bottom team forced to play a mini-league with the second- and third-place teams from the second level for a place in the top league.

==Promotion and relegation==
{{main|Promotion and relegation}}
Where the number of competitors is larger than a tournament format permits, there may be multiple tournaments held in parallel, with competitors assigned to a particular tournament based on their ranking. In [[chess]], [[Scrabble]], and many other individual games, many tournaments over one or more years contribute to a player's ranking. However, many team sports involve teams in only one major tournament per year. In European sport, including football, this constitutes the sole ranking for the following season; the top teams from each division of the league are promoted to a higher division, while the bottom teams from a higher division are relegated to a lower one.

This promotion and relegation occurs mainly in league tournaments, but also features in Davis Cup and Fed Cup tennis:
* In the Davis Cup:
** The first-round losers in the top-level World Group compete in playoff ties against the winners of the second-round ties in Group I of the competition's three regional zones, with the winners of each playoff tie remaining in or promoted to the World Group.
** In the three regional zones, Group II is conducted in a knockout format. The winner of the knockout tournament is promoted to Group I of its zone. The first-round losers then play relegation ties, with the losers relegated to Group III.
** Groups III and IV in each zone are contested in a round-robin format. The top two teams in each group are promoted, while the bottom two teams are relegated (assuming there is a lower group in their zone).
* In the Fed Cup:
** The four first-round losers in World Group I compete in playoff ties against the four winners in World Group II, with the winners remaining in or promoted to World Group I.
** The losers in World Group II play ties against the four zonal Group I winners (two from Europe/Africa and one each from Asia/Oceania and Americas), with the winners playing in World Group II the following season.
** Groups I and II in all zones, plus Group III in the Europe/Africa Zone only, are conducted in a round-robin format. The bottom two teams in each group are relegated to the next group down, assuming one exists, while the top two teams in Groups II and III are promoted to the next-higher group.

The hierarchy of divisions may be linear, or tree-like, as with the [[English football league system#Structure|English football league pyramid]].

==Bridge tournaments==
{{main|Duplicate bridge}}
In [[contract bridge]] a "tournament" is a tournament in the first sense above, composed of multiple "events", which are tournaments in the second sense. Some events may be single-elimination, double-elimination, or Swiss style. However, "[[Duplicate bridge#Pairs game|Pair events]]" are the most widespread. In these events, a number of deals (or ''[[board (bridge)|board]]s'') are each played several times by different players. For each such board the score achieved by each North-South (NS) pair is then measured against all the other NS pairs playing the same board. Thus pairs are rewarded for playing the same cards better than others have played them. There is a predetermined schedule of fixtures depending on the number of pairs and boards to be played, to ensure a good mix of opponents, and that no pair plays the same board or the same opponents twice (see [[duplicate bridge movements]]).

==Poker tournaments==
In [[poker tournament]]s, as players are eliminated, the number of tables is gradually reduced, with the remaining players redistributed among the remaining tables. Play continues until one player has won all of the chips in play. Finishing order is determined by the order in which players are eliminated: last player remaining gets 1st place, last player eliminated gets 2nd, previous player eliminated gets 3rd, etc.

In a "shootout" tournament, players do not change tables until every table has been reduced to one player.

==Alternatives to tournament systems==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2015}}

While tournament structures attempt to provide an objective format for determining the best competitor in a game or sport, other methods exist.

;[[Challenge (competition)|Challenge]]{{anchor|Challenge}}: In this format, champions retain their title until they are defeated by an opponent, known as the ''challenger''. This system is used in [[Boxing#Professional boxing|professional boxing]] (see [[lineal championship]]), and the [[World Chess Championship]]. The right to become a contender may be awarded through a tournament, as in chess, or through a ranking system: the ranking systems used by boxing's governing bodies are controversial and opaque. If the champion retires or dies, then the current top challenger may be declared champion or the title may be vacant until a match between two challengers is held. Prior to 1920, the reigning Wimbledon champion received a bye to the final; the official name of the [[FA Cup|FA Challenge Cup]] reflects a similar arrangement which applied only in that tournament's very early years. The [[America's Cup]] is decided between the winners of separate champion and challenger tournaments, respectively for yachts from the country of the reigning champion, and of all other countries. The [[Ranfurly Shield]] in New Zealand rugby union is a challenge trophy between provincial teams, in which the holders of the Shield retain it until they are beaten by a challenging province.

;[[Ladder tournament]]: The ladder is an extension of the challenge system. All competitors are ranked on a "ladder". New contestants join the bottom of the ladder. Any contestant can challenge a competitor ranked slightly higher; if the challenger wins the match (or the challenge is refused) they swap places on the ladder. Ladders are common in internal club competitions in individual sports, like [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[Billiards|pool]]. Another ladder system is to give competitors a certain number of ranking points at the start. If two competitors play each other, then the winner will gain a percentage of the loser's ranking points. In this way competitors that join later will generally start in the middle, since top competitors already have won ranking points and bottom competitors have lost them.

;Selection: A champion may be selected by an authorised or self-appointed group, often after a [[voting|vote]]. While common in non-competitive activities, ranging from [[science fair]]s to [[Film|cinema]]'s [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], this is rarely significant in sports and games. Though unofficial, the polls run by the [[Associated Press]] and others were prestigious titles in [[College football|American college football]] prior to the creation in [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]] of the [[Bowl Championship Series]], a quasi-official national championship (to this day, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] does not officially award [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|a championship]] in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|the top division]] of college football). From [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005]] until the final season of the BCS in [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013]], the [[AP Poll]] operated independently from the BCS, and two other polls were part of the BCS formula. The BCS was replaced by the [[College Football Playoff]], a four-team tournament whose participants are chosen by a selection committee, in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]; since then, all polls have operated independently from the CFP.

==Tournaments of value==
 
Tournaments of value have come to legitimise what are often seen as marginalised practices that sit outside of popular culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garud|first=Raghu|date=2008-09-01|title=Conferences as Venues for the Configuration of Emerging Organizational Fields: The Case of Cochlear Implants|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2008.00783.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Management Studies|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1061–1088|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6486.2008.00783.x|issn=1467-6486}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Cows on Selsley Common - geograph.org.uk - 192472.jpg|thumb|Cows on [[Selsley Common]]. The "tragedy of the commons" is one way of accounting for [[overexploitation]].]]

The '''tragedy of the commons''' is a term used in [[social science]] to describe a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The concept and phrase originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist [[William Forster Lloyd]], who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on [[common land]] (also known as a "common") in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=forster&gt;{{Cite book |title=Two lectures on the checks to population |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |publisher=Oxford University |year=1833 |isbn= |location=England |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/twolecturesonch00lloygoog |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the American ecologist and philosopher [[Garrett Hardin]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68 /&gt;  In this modern economic context, [[commons]] is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as [[Carbon dioxide#In the Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[Great Pacific garbage patch|oceans]], [[river|rivers]], [[fish stocks]], or even an office refrigerator.

It has been argued {{By whom|date=September 2018}} that the very term 'tragedy of the Commons' is a misnomer, since 'the commons' referred to land resources with rights jointly owned by members of a community, and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource. However, the term is now used in social science and economics when describing a problem where ''all'' individuals have equal and open access to a resource. Hence, 'tragedy of open access regimes' or simply 'the open access problem' are more apt terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daly |first1=Herman E. |last2=Farley |first2=Joshua |authorlink1=Herman Daly |date=2011 |title=Ecological Economics.

The 'tragedy of the commons' is often cited in connection with [[sustainable development]], meshing economic growth and environmental protection, as well as in the [[Global warming controversy|debate over global warming]]. It has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of [[economics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[game theory]], [[politics]], [[taxation]] and [[sociology]].

Although common resource systems have been known to collapse due to overuse (such as in [[over-fishing]]), many examples have existed and still do exist where members of a community with access to a common resource co-operate or regulate to exploit those resources prudently without collapse.&lt;ref name="Robert Wade 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Management|first1=National Research Council (U S. ) Panel on Common Property Resource|title=Proceedings of the Conference on Common Property Resource Management, April 21-26, 1985|date=1986|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cCkrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Common+property+resource+management+in+South+Indian+Villages#v=onepage&amp;q=Common%20property%20resource%20management%20in%20South%20Indian%20Villages&amp;f=false|publisher=National Academies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dlc.dlib.indiana.edu"&gt;Susan Jane Buck Cox - "No tragedy on the Commons" ''Journal of Environmental Ethics'', Vol 7, Spring 1985 [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3113/buck_NoTragedy.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elinor Ostrom]] was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for demonstrating exactly this concept in her book Governing the Commons, which included examples of how local communities were able to do this without top-down regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2009/ostrom-facts.html|title=Elinor Ostrom - Facts|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lloyd's pamphlet===
In 1833, the English economist [[William Forster Lloyd]] published a pamphlet which included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource. This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, as was the custom in English villages. He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, [[overgrazing]] could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, but the whole group shared damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, to the detriment of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |title=Two Lectures on Population |year=1833 |jstor=1972412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, [[ecology|ecologist]] [[Garrett Hardin]] explored this [[social dilemma]] in his article "The Tragedy of the Commons", published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–1248 |year=1968 |pmid=5699198 |pmc= |author1=Hardin |first1=G|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/162/3859/1243.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abstract: "The population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension in morality".&lt;/ref&gt; The essay derived its title from the pamphlet by [[William Forster Lloyd|Lloyd]], which he cites, on the over-grazing of common land.

Hardin discussed problems that cannot be solved by technical means, as distinct from those with solutions that require "a change only in the techniques of the [[natural science]]s, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in [[Value (personal and cultural)|human values]] or ideas of [[morality]]". Hardin focused on human population growth, the use of the Earth's [[natural resource]]s, and the welfare state.&lt;ref name="Intolerable"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hardin |first=G. |authorlink=Garrett Hardin |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=162 |issue=3859 |date=1968-12-13 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/162/3859/1243.full.pdf |quote=it is the role of education to reveal to all the necessity of abandoning the freedom to breed. Only so, can we put an end to this aspect of the tragedy of the commons. |pages=1243–1248 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |pmid=5699198 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin argued that if individuals relied on themselves alone, and not on the relationship of society and man, then the number of children had by each family would not be of public concern. Parents breeding excessively would leave fewer descendants because they would be unable to provide for each child adequately. Such negative feedback is found in the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name="Intolerable" /&gt; Hardin said that if the children of improvident parents starved to death, if overbreeding was its own punishment, then there would be no public interest in controlling the breeding of families.&lt;ref name="Intolerable" /&gt; Hardin blamed the [[welfare state]] for allowing the tragedy of the commons; where the state provides for children and supports overbreeding as a fundamental human right, [[Malthusian catastrophe]] is inevitable. Consequently, in his article, Hardin lamented the following proposal from the [[United Nations]]:
{{quote|text= The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society. [Article 16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |date=10 December 1948 |accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;] It follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else. |source= Statement on Population by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]&lt;ref name="U Thant Statement"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Levels and trends of contraceptive use as assessed in 2002 |publisher=United Nations Publications |last=United Nations. Dept. of Economic and Social Affairs.

In addition, Hardin also pointed out the problem of individuals acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with no regard for others, all resources would still eventually be depleted. Overall, Hardin argued against relying on [[conscience]] as a means of policing commons, suggesting that this favors [[selfish]] individuals&amp;nbsp;– often known as [[free rider problem|free riders]]&amp;nbsp;– over those who are more altruistic.

In the context of avoiding [[over-exploitation]] of [[Common-pool resource|common resources]], Hardin concluded by restating [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] (which was quoted by [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]), "freedom is the recognition of necessity". He suggested that "freedom" completes the tragedy of the commons. By recognizing resources as commons in the first place, and by recognizing that, as such, they require management, Hardin believed that humans "can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms".

===The "Commons" as a modern resource concept===
Hardin's article was the start of the modern use of "Commons" as a term connoting a shared resource. As Frank van Laerhoven &amp; Elinor Ostrom have stated: "Prior to the publication of Hardin’s article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words 'the commons', 'common pool resources,' or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature." They go on to say: "In 2002, Barrett and Mabry conducted a major survey of biologists to determine which publications in the twentieth century had become classic books or benchmark publications in biology. They report that Hardin’s 1968 article was the one having the greatest career impact on biologists and is the most frequently cited".&lt;ref&gt;Traditions and Trends in the Study of the Commons Frank van Laerhoven &amp; Elinor Ostrom International Journal of the Commons Vol 1, no 1 October 2007, pp. 3-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Metaphoric meaning===
Like Lloyd and [[Thomas Malthus]] before him, Hardin was primarily interested in the problem of [[Human overpopulation|human population growth]]. But in his essay, he also focused on the use of larger (though finite) resources such as the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, as well as pointing out the "negative commons" of pollution (i.e., instead of dealing with the deliberate privatization of a positive resource, a "negative commons" deals with the deliberate commonization of a negative cost, pollution).

As a [[metaphor]], the tragedy of the commons should not be taken too literally. The "tragedy" is not in the word's conventional or theatric sense, nor a condemnation of the processes that lead to it. Similarly, Hardin's use of "commons" has frequently been misunderstood, leading him to later remark that he should have titled his work "The Tragedy of the Unregulated Commons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2006/07/26/life/will-commons-sense-dawn-again-in-time/ |title=Will commons sense dawn again in time? &amp;#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=2006-07-26 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |title=Extensions of "The Tragedy of the Commons" |journal=Science |date=May 1, 1998 |volume=280 |issue=5364 |pages=682–683 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5364.682 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/280/5364/682.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphor illustrates the argument that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through [[over-exploitation]], temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=1227745 |title=Brigham Daniels, Emerging Commons Tragic Institutions |journal=Environmental Law |volume=37 |date=2007 |pages=515–571 at 536 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concept is sometimes called the "tragedy of the fishers", because fishing too many fish before or during breeding could cause stocks to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Bowles: Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution, [[Princeton University Press]], pp. 27–29 (2004) {{ISBN|0-691-09163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern commons===
The ''tragedy of the commons'' can be considered in relation to environmental issues such as [[sustainability]]. The commons dilemma stands as a model for a great variety of resource problems in society today, such as water, forests,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Andersson [http://wildfirenews.com/oregon "Tragedy of the Common Forest"] Oregon Daily Emerald&lt;/ref&gt; fish, and [[non-renewable energy]] sources such as oil and coal.

Situations exemplifying the "tragedy of the commons" include the overfishing and destruction of the [[Grand Banks]], the destruction of [[salmon]] runs on rivers that have been dammed – most prominently in modern times on the [[Columbia River]] in the [[Northwest United States]], and historically in [[North Atlantic]] rivers – the devastation of the sturgeon fishery – in modern Russia, but historically in the United States as well – and, in terms of water supply, the limited water available in arid regions (e.g., the area of the [[Aral Sea]]) and the [[Los Angeles]] water system supply, especially at [[Mono Lake]] and [[Owens Lake]].

In economics, an [[externality]] is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.  Negative externalities are a well-known feature of the "tragedy of the commons".  For example, driving cars has many negative externalities; these include [[pollution]], [[carbon emissions]], and traffic accidents. Every time 'Person A' gets in a car, it becomes more likely that 'Person Z'{{spaced ndash}} and millions of others{{spaced ndash}} will suffer in each of those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Dunber and Steven D. Levitt [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/magazine/20wwln-freakonomics-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin "Not-So-Free-Ride"] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;  Economists often urge the government to adopt policies that "internalize" an externality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, William. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uhBkp5rmrXgC&amp;pg=PA80 Environmental Economics for Tree Huggers and Other Skeptics]'', p. 80 (Island Press 2012): "Economists often say that externalities need to be 'internalized,' meaning that some action needs to be taken to correct this kind of market failure."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application to evolutionary biology===
A parallel was drawn recently between the tragedy of the commons and the competing behaviour of parasites that through acting selfishly eventually diminish or destroy their common host.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000452/http://eao.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ENS/dionisio_evol_econ_rivalry_excludability.pdf The tragedy of the commons, the public goods dilemma, and the meaning of rivalry and excludability in evolutionary biology] ''Francisco Dionisio and Isabel Gordo'' Evolutionary Ecology Research 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has also been applied to areas such as the evolution of [[virulence]] or [[sexual conflict]], where males may fatally harm females when competing for matings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kokkonuts.org/wp-content/uploads/Sexdeathtragedy.pdf Sex, death and tragedy] ''Daniel J.

The idea of [[evolutionary suicide]], where adaptation at the level of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven [[extinct]], can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2005.14541.x | volume=111 | issue=3 | title=Can adaptation lead to extinction? | year=2005 | journal=Oikos | pages=616–619 | last1 = Rankin | first1 = Daniel J.| citeseerx=10.1.1.692.9713 | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.692.9713 | format=Full text }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kokkonuts.org/wp-content/uploads/Rankin_ToC.pdf The tragedy of the commons in evolutionary biology] Rankin, D.J., Bargum, K. &amp; [[Hanna Kokko|Kokko]], H.

==Commons dilemma==
{{anchor|The Commons Dilemma}}
The ''commons dilemma'' is a specific class of [[social dilemma]] in which people's short-term selfish interests are at odds with long-term group interests and the [[common good]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Druzin |first=Bryan |title=A Plan to strengthen the Paris Agreement |url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/18/ |journal=Fordham Law Review |volume=84 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In academia, a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it, including ''resource dilemma'', ''take-some dilemma'', and ''[[common pool resource]]''.

Commons dilemma researchers have studied conditions under which groups and communities are likely to under- or [[over-harvest]] common resources in both the laboratory and field. Research programs have concentrated on a number of motivational, strategic, and structural factors that might be conducive to management of commons.

In [[game theory]], which constructs mathematical models for individuals' behavior in strategic situations, the corresponding "game", developed by Hardin, is known as the Commonize Costs&amp;nbsp;– Privatize Profits Game ([[CC–PP game]]).

===Psychological factors===
Kopelman, Weber, &amp; Messick (2002), in a review of the experimental research on cooperation in commons dilemmas, identify nine classes of independent variables that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas: social motives, gender, payoff structure, uncertainty, power and status, group size, communication, causes, and frames. They organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences (stable personality traits) and situational factors (the environment). Situational factors include both the task (social and decision structure) and the perception of the task.&lt;ref&gt;Kopelman, Weber, &amp; Messick, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical findings support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor that needs to be studied in the context of situational variables.&lt;ref&gt;Gelfand &amp; Dyer, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than behaving in line with economic incentives, people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework.&lt;ref&gt;Weber et al., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; An expanded, four factor model of the Logic of Appropriateness,&lt;ref&gt;Kopelman, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Kopelman, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question: "What does a person like me (identity) do (rules) in a situation like this (recognition) given this culture (group)?"

===Strategic factors===
[[Strategy|Strategic]] factors also matter in commons dilemmas. One often-studied strategic factor is the order in which people take harvests from the resource. In simultaneous play, all people harvest at the same time, whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence&amp;nbsp;– first, second, third, etc. There is a clear order effect in the latter games: the harvests of those who come first&amp;nbsp;– the leaders&amp;nbsp;– are higher than the harvest of those coming later&amp;nbsp;– the followers. The interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more. With sequential play, individuals adopt a first come-first served rule, whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule. Another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations. Research {{By whom|date=December 2011}} found that people take less from the common pool in public situations than in anonymous private situations. Moreover, those who harvest less gain greater prestige and influence within their group.

===Structural factors===
Much research has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy. Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that "Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all."&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, 1244&lt;/ref&gt; One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer leaders who are elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to autocratic [[leadership]] exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.

The provision of rewards and punishments may also be effective in preserving common resources. Selective punishments for overuse can be effective in promoting domestic water and energy conservation&amp;nbsp;– for example, through installing water and electricity meters in houses. Selective rewards work, provided that they are open to everyone. An experimental carpool lane in the Netherlands failed because car commuters did not feel they were able to organize a carpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Vugt |first=M. |last2=van Lange |first2=P.

==Solutions==
{{see also|Externality#Possible solutions}}
Articulating solutions to the tragedy of the commons is one of the main problems of [[political philosophy]]. In many situations, locals implement (often complex) social schemes that work well. The best governmental solution may be to do nothing. When these fail, there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization, internalizing the externalities, and regulation.

===Non-governmental solution===
Sometimes the best governmental solution may be to do nothing. [[Robert Axelrod]] contends that even self-interested individuals will often find ways to cooperate, because collective restraint serves both the collective and individual interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Axelrod |first=Robert |year=1984 |title=The Evolution of Cooperation |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02121-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJZBCGbNs98C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist G. N. Appell criticized those who cited Hardin to "impos[e] their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Appell, G. N. (1993). [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/4532 Hardin's Myth of the Commons: The Tragedy of Conceptual Confusions]. Working Paper 8. Phillips, ME: Social Transformation and Adaptation Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Elinor Ostrom]], who was awarded 2009's [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for her work on the issue, and others revisited Hardin's work in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ostrom |first1=Elinor |last2=Burger |first2=Joanna |last3=Field |first3=Christopher B. |last4=Norgaard |first4=Richard B. |last5=Policansky |first5=David |year=1999 |title=Revisiting the Commons: Local Lessons, Global Challenges |url= http://dusk2.geo.orst.edu/prosem/Ostrom_etal1999.pdf|journal=Science |volume=284 |issue= 5412|pages=278–282 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5412.278 |pmid=10195886|format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; They found the tragedy of the commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as Hardin maintained, since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves.&lt;ref name="urlOstrom revisits the commons in Science"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/HomePages/041699/text/ostrom.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182446/http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/HomePages/041699/text/ostrom.htm |archivedate=2012-03-05 |title=Ostrom 'revisits the commons' in 'Science' |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it was found that a commons in the Swiss Alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since 1517, in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland. In general, it is in the users of a commons interests to keep the common running and complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at optimum efficiency.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-commons-nobel-economics-opinions-contributors-vernon-l-smith.html|title=Governing The Commons|first=Vernon L.|last=Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, geographer Douglas L. Johnson remarks that many [[nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralist]] societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact "balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound", reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit; in spite of this, it was often the case that "the nomad was blamed for problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien forces."&lt;ref name="johnson1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Douglas L. |date=1993 |title=Nomadism and Desertification in Africa and the Middle East |journal=GeoJournal |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=51–66 |url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/382/art%253A10.1007%252FBF00815903.pdf?auth66=1421130745_ae3711f8ec80384f3be245bd003e8be5&amp;ext=.pdf |doi=10.1007/bf00815903}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently finding precedent in the opinions of previous scholars such as [[Ibn Khaldun]] as well as common currency in antagonistic cultural attitudes towards non-sedentary peoples,&lt;ref name="johnson1993" /&gt; governments and international organizations have made use of Hardin's work to help justify restrictions on land access and the eventual [[sedentarization]] of pastoral nomads despite its weak empirical basis. Examining relations between historically nomadic [[Bedouin]] Arabs and the [[Syria]]n state in the 20th century, [[Dawn Chatty]] notes that "Hardin's argument […] was curiously accepted as the fundamental explanation for the degradation of the [[steppe]] land" in development schemes for the arid interior of the country, downplaying the larger role of agricultural [[overexploitation]] in [[desertification]] as it melded with prevailing nationalist ideology which viewed nomads as socially backward and economically harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chatty |first=Dawn |date=2010 |title=The Bedouin in Contemporary Syria: The Persistence of Tribal Authority and Control |journal=Middle East Journal |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=29–69 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4240985/Tribes_of_Syria |doi=10.3751/64.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elinor Ostrom]], and her colleagues looked at how real-world communities manage communal resources, such as fisheries, land irrigation systems, and farmlands, and they identified a number of factors conducive to successful resource management. One factor is the resource itself; resources with definable boundaries (e.g., land) can be preserved much more easily. A second factor is resource dependence; there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion, and it must be difficult to find substitutes. The third is the presence of a community; small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;Elinor Ostrom: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByXM47Ri1Kc ''Beyond the tragedy of commons'']. Stockholm whiteboard seminars. (Video, 8:26 min.)&lt;/ref&gt; A final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse. When the commons is taken over by non-locals, those solutions can no longer be used.&lt;ref name="urlOstrom revisits the commons in Science" /&gt;

===Governmental solutions===
Governmental solutions may be necessary when the above conditions are not met (such as a community being too big or too unstable to provide a thick social network). Examples of government regulation include privatization, regulation, and internalizing the externalities.

====Privatization====
One solution for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability. [[libertarianism|Libertarians]] and [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]] cite the tragedy of the commons as an example of what happens when [[John Locke|Lockean]] property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Robert J. |last=Smith |title=Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife |url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1981/11/cj1n2-7.pdf |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |series=[[Cato Journal]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=Fall 1981 |pages=439–468}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]], "Sect. 27" and following sections in [https://web.archive.org/web/20070304114414/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/locke/locke2/locke2nd-a.html#Sect.%2025.#Sect.%2027. ''Second Treatise of Government''] (1690). Also available [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7370 here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, this solution was attempted in the [[Inclosure Acts]].

====Regulation====
In a typical example, governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual. Permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining, fishing, hunting, livestock raising and timber extraction are examples of this approach. Similarly, limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons. This idea is used by the [[United Nations]] [[Moon Treaty]], [[Outer Space Treaty]] and [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] as well as the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]] which involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the [[Common Heritage of Mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Frakes, The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? Wisconsin International Law Journal. 2003; 21:409&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hardin's essay, he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon" and result in "relinquishing the freedom to breed". Hardin discussed this topic further in a 1979 book, ''Managing the Commons,'' co-written with [[John A. Baden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecobooks.com/books/commons.htm |title=Managing the Commons by Garrett Hardin and John Baden |publisher=Ecobooks.com |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the "[[reproductive rights|reproductive right]]", to safeguard all other [[rights]]. Several countries have a variety of [[Antinatalistic politics|population control laws]] in place.

German historian [[Joachim Radkau]] thought Hardin advocates strict management of common goods via increased government involvement or international regulation bodies.&lt;ref name="Rad"&gt;Radkau, Joachim. Nature and Power. A Global History of the Environment. Cambridge University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An asserted impending "tragedy of the commons" is frequently warned of as a consequence of the adoption of policies which restrict [[Property#Theories of property|private property]] and espouse expansion of public property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authorlink=Natalia Mirovitskaya, Marvin S.

====Internalizing externalities====
Privatization works when the person who owns the property (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving the tragedy of the commons. ''Internalizing the externalities'', in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.

==Criticism==
The environmentalist [[Derrick Jensen]] claims the tragedy of the commons is used as [[propaganda]] for [[private ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2007), "Endame Vol 1: The Problem of Civilisation" and "Endame Vol II: Resistance" (Seven Stories Press)&lt;/ref&gt;  He says it has been used by the political [[right wing]] to hasten the final enclosure of the "common resources" of [[third world]] and indigenous people worldwide, as a part of the [[Washington Consensus]].  He argues that in true situations, those who abuse the commons would have been warned to desist and if they failed would have punitive sanctions against them.  He says that rather than being called "The Tragedy of the Commons", it should be called "the Tragedy of the Failure of the Commons".

Hardin's work was also criticised&lt;ref name="urlwww.econ.cam.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/faculty/dasgupta/ |authorlink=Partha Dasgupta |first=Partha |last=Dasgupta |title=Human Well-Being and the Natural Environment |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the [[demographic transition]], and for failing to distinguish between [[Common-pool resource|common property]] and [[Open access (infrastructure)|open access]] resources.&lt;ref name=Ciriacy&gt;Ciriacy-Wantrup S.V., Bishop R.C., 1975. "Common Property" as a Concept in Natural Resources Policy. Nat. Res. J. 15, 713–727&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Carl Dahlman argues that commons were effectively managed to prevent overgrazing.&lt;ref name="urlSpringerLink"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/wm68g57188j282u4/ |title= The tragedy of the commons that wasn't: On technical solutions to the institutions game|accessdate= | doi=10.1007/BF01357919 |volume=12 |issue= 3|year=1991 |journal=Population and Environment |pages=285–296 | last1 = Dahlman | first1 = Carl J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Susan Jane Buck Cox argues that the common land example used to argue this economic concept is on very weak historical ground, and misrepresents what she terms was actually the "triumph of the commons": the successful common usage of land for many centuries. She argues that social changes and agricultural innovation, and not the behaviour of the commoners, led to the demise of the commons.&lt;ref name="dlc.dlib.indiana.edu"/&gt; 

Some authors, like [[Yochai Benkler]], say that with the rise of the Internet and digitalisation, an economics system based on commons becomes possible again. He wrote in his book ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]'' in 2006 that cheap computing power plus networks enable people to produce valuable products through non-commercial processes of interaction: "as human beings and as social beings, rather than as market actors through the price system". He uses the term 'networked [[information economy]]' to describe a "system of production, distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed, nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Benkler, Yochai |title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-300-11056-2 |oclc= |doi= |page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0Q0mAEACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also coined the term '[[commons-based peer production]]' to describe collaborative efforts based on sharing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] |coauthors= |title=The Internet? We Built That |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/the-internet-we-built-that.html?src=dayp |quote=The Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler has called this phenomenon 'commons-based peer production'. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=September 21, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of commons-based peer production are [[free and open source software]] and [[open-source hardware]].

==Comedy of the commons==
In certain cases, exploiting a resource more may be a good thing. Carol M. Rose, in a 1986 article, discussed the concept of the "comedy of the commons", where the public property in question exhibits "increasing returns to scale" in usage (hence the phrase, "the more the merrier"), in that the more people use the resource, the higher the benefit to each one. Rose cites as examples commerce and group recreational activities. According to Rose, public resources with the "comedic" characteristic may suffer from under-investment rather than over usage.&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2827&amp;context=fss_papers |title=The Comedy of the Commons: Commerce, Custom, and Inherently Public Property |author=Rose, Carol M. |journal=Faculty Scholarship Series, Yale Law School |year=1986 |volume=Paper 1828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Transmutation of species''' and '''transformism''' are 19th-century evolutionary ideas for the altering of one [[species]] into another that preceded [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, Phillip, "Evolution", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/evolution/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French ''Transformisme'' was a term used by [[Jean Baptiste Lamarck]] in 1809 for his theory, and other 19th century proponents of pre-Darwinian evolutionary ideas included [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Robert Edmund Grant|Robert Grant]], and [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], the anonymous author of the book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''. Opposition in the scientific community to these early theories of evolution, led by influential scientists like the anatomists [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Richard Owen]] and the geologist [[Charles Lyell]], was intense. The debate over them was an important stage in the [[history of evolutionary thought]] and would influence the subsequent [[reaction to Darwin's theory]].

==Terminology==
Transmutation was one of the names commonly used for evolutionary ideas in the 19th century before [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'' (1859).  Transmutation had previously been used as a term in alchemy to describe the transformation of base metals into gold. Other names for evolutionary ideas used in this period include ''the development hypothesis'' (one of the terms used by Darwin) and ''the theory of regular gradation'', used by [[William Chilton (printer) | William Chilton]] in the periodical press such as ''[[The Oracle of Reason]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Secord, James A. 2000. ''Victorian sensation: the extraordinary publication, reception, and secret authorship of the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation''. Chicago, p311&lt;/ref&gt; ''Transformation'' is another word used quite as often as transmutation in this context. These early 19th century evolutionary ideas played an important role in the [[history of evolutionary thought]].

The proto-evolutionary thinkers of the 18th and early 19th century had to invent terms to label their ideas, but it was first [[Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter]] who used the term "transmutation" to refer to species who have had biological changes through hybridization.&lt;ref&gt;http://plorenzano.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/xxi-joseph-gottlieb-kc3b6lreuter-plorenzano.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology did not settle down until some time after the publication of the ''Origin of Species''. The word ''evolution'' was quite a late-comer: it can be seen in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''[[Social Statics]]'' of 1851,&lt;ref&gt;There are three examples of the word 'evolution' in ''Social Statics'', but none in the sense that is used today in biology. See {{cite web |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=advanced_search.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918102523/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=advanced_search.php |archivedate=2010-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is at least one earlier example, but it was not in general use until about 1865-70.

==Historical development==
{{seealso|Lamarckism}}
[[Image:Vestiges dev diag.svg|thumb|right|Diagram from the 1844 book ''Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation'' by Robert Chambers shows a model of development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M).]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed a hypothesis on the transmutation of species in ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' (1809). Lamarck did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by [[spontaneous generation]]. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck also recognized that species were adapted to their environment. He explained this observation by saying that the same nervous fluid driving increasing complexity, also caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of that organ, just as muscles are affected by exercise. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that became closely associated with his name and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp = 86–94}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp = 38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A radical British school of comparative anatomy (the [[Edinburgh]] school) which included the surgeon [[Robert Knox]] and the [[anatomist]] [[Robert Edmund Grant|Robert Grant]] was closely in touch with Lamarck's school of French ''Transformationism'', which contained scientists such as [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. Grant developed Lamarck's and [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s ideas of transmutation and [[evolutionism]], investigating [[homology (biology)|homology]] to prove [[common descent]]. As a young student [[Charles Darwin]] joined Grant in investigations of the life cycle of marine animals. He also studied geology under professor [[Robert Jameson]] whose journal published an anonymous paper in 1826 praising "Mr. Lamarck" for explaining how the higher animals had "evolved" from the "simplest worms" – this was the first use of the word "evolved" in a modern sense. Jameson's course closed with lectures on the ''"Origin of the Species of Animals"''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Desmond|Moore|1994|p = 40}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler120-134"&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp = 120–134}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] published his unofficial ''[[Ninth Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required. In 1844 the Scottish publisher [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]] anonymously published an influential and extremely controversial book of popular science entitled ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for the origins of the solar system and life on earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed an ascent of animals with current animals being branches off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations led to the unfolding of a preordained [[orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] plan woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely [[Materialism|materialistic]] than the ideas of radicals like Robert Grant, but its implication that humans were just the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. Both conservatives like [[Adam Sedgwick]], and radical materialists like [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], who disliked Chambers' implications of preordained progress, were able to find scientific inaccuracies in the book that they could disparage. Darwin himself openly deplored the author's "poverty of intellect", and dismissed it as a "literary curiosity." However, the high profile of the public debate over ''Vestiges'', with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, and its popular success, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp = 134–138}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|Morus|2005|pp = 142–143}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Desmond|Moore|1994|p = 47}} &lt;/ref&gt; It also influenced some younger naturalists, including [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], to take an interest in the idea of transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bowler|2003|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to transmutation==
Ideas about the transmutation of species were strongly associated with the radical materialism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and were greeted with hostility by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and [[Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by re-population, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his reputation as a leading scientist helped keep transmutational ideas out of the scientific mainstream for decades.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Larson|2004|pp = 5–24}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In Britain, where the philosophy of [[natural theology]] remained influential, [[William Paley]] wrote the book ''Natural Theology'' with its famous [[watchmaker analogy]], at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of [[Erasmus Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|pp = 103–104}} &lt;/ref&gt; Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck and Grant, and Sedgwick wrote a famously harsh review of ''The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Larson|2004|pp = 37–38}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Harv|Bowler|2003|p = 138}} &lt;/ref&gt; Although the geologist [[Charles Lyell]] opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his ''Principles of Geology'' (1830–1833) he criticized and dismissed Lamarck's theories of development. Instead, he advocated a form of progressive creation, in which each species had its "centre of creation" and was designed for this particular habitat, but would go extinct when this habitat changed.&lt;ref name="Bowler120-134"/&gt;

[[Image:Vertebrate archetype.jpg|thumb|left|This 1847 diagram by Richard Owen shows his conceptual archetype for all vertebrates.]]
Another source of opposition to transmutation was a school of naturalists who were influenced by the German philosophers and naturalists associated with [[idealism]], such as [[Goethe]], [[Hegel]] and [[Lorenz Oken]]. Idealists such as [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[Richard Owen]] believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in [[embryology]], as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with [[Progressive creationism|progressive creation]] leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of "archetypes" in the divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as [[vertebrate]] limbs. Owen was concerned by the political implications of the ideas of transmutationists like Robert Grant, and he led a public campaign by conservatives that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. In his famous 1841 paper, which coined the term dinosaur for the giant reptiles discovered by Buckland and [[Gideon Mantell]], Owen argued that these reptiles contradicted the transmutational ideas of Lamarck because they were more sophisticated than the reptiles of the modern world. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, along with the controversy surrounding ''Vestiges'', would be factors in his decision to ensure that his theory was fully supported by facts and arguments before publishing his ideas.&lt;ref name="Bowler120-134"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Larson|2004|pp = 42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|van Wyhe|2007|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a two-fluid model which helps explain the behavior of [[superfluid]] [[helium]].  This model states that there will be two components in liquid helium below its [[lambda point]] (the temperature where superfluid forms).  These components are a normal fluid and a superfluid component.  Each liquid has a different density and together their sum makes the total density, which remains constant.  The ratio of superfluid density to the total density increases as the temperature approaches absolute zero.
