'''Adnan Khashoggi''' ({{lang-ar|عدنان خاشقجي}}; 25 July 1935&amp;nbsp;– 6 June 2017) was a [[Saudi Arabia]]n businessman, known for his lavish business deals and lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/22/arts/lavish-lifestyle-of-a-wheeler-dealer.html|title=Lavish Lifestyle Of a Wheeler-Dealer|last=Salmans|first=Sandra|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is estimated to have had a peak [[net worth]] of around US$4 billion in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |author=David Leigh and Rob Evans|title=Biography: Adnan Khashoggi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/08/bae52|website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=29 January 2012 |location=London |date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and education ==
Khashoggi was born in [[Mecca]], the son of [[Muhammad Khashoggi|Mohammad Khashoggi]], who was King [[Ibn Saud|Abdul Aziz Al Saud]]'s personal doctor.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite news|title=About the Bin Laden family|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/family.html|access-date=26 February 2013|newspaper=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family is of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-business/men/adnan-khashoggi-net-worth/ |title=Adnan Khashoggi Net Worth |publisher=Therichest.com |date=25 July 1935 |access-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Khashoggi himself has also said that he had a Jewish grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;New York Magazine, "Stepping Out", By Jeanie Kasindorf, 18 Dec 1989, Page 44. https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=NugCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=khashoggi+Jeanie+Kasindorf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimvtGk7JjeAhVDYxoKHQi9ACcQ6AEIMTAD#v=snippet&amp;q=grandfather&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Adnan Khashoggi's sister was author [[Samira Khashoggi]] who married businessman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] and was the mother of [[Dodi Fayed]].&lt;ref name="ponton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ponton|first1=Rebecca|title=Soheir Khashoggi: Success Is No Mirage|journal=Woman Abroad Magazine|volume=Sept/Oct 2001|issue=7|url=http://www.rebeccaponton.com/skhashoggi.htm|access-date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another sister, [[Soheir Khashoggi]], is a well-known Arab writer (''Mirage'', ''Nadia's Song'', ''Mosaic'').&lt;ref name="ponton" /&gt; He was an uncle of journalist [[Jamal Khashoggi]].

Khashoggi was educated at [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; and the [[United States|American]] universities [[California State University, Chico]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], and [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. Khashoggi left his studies in order to seek his fortune in business.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Brunei Darussalam"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bry0sOwstIMC |title=Historical Dictionary of Brunei Darussalam |last=Sidhu |first=Jatswan S.  |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780810870789 |edition=2, illustrated |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==

Khashoggi's early years were spent among some of Saudi Arabia's most influential figures. "While attending school he met [[Hussein bin Talal]], the future [[King of Jordan]]. It was at school that Khashoggi first learned the commercial value of facilitating a deal, bringing together a Libyan classmate whose father wanted to import towels with an Egyptian classmate whose father manufactured towels, earning US$1,000 for the introduction. Khashoggi's subsequent education at university would serve as a launchpad for his commercial career."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Cross|first=Jim|title=Adnan Khashoggi|date=1985-02-23|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7553370/|last2=Gessner|first2=Hal|accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his first big deals, a large construction company was experiencing difficulties with the trucks that it used on the shifting desert sands. Khashoggi, using money given to him by his father for a car, bought a number of [[Kenworth]] trucks, whose wide wheels made traversing the desert considerably easier. Khashoggi made his first US$250,000 leasing the trucks to the construction company, and became the Saudi Arabia-based agent for Kenworth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, Khashoggi helped bring together Western companies and the Saudi Arabian Government to satisfy the needs of the young Kingdom for its infrastructure and defense needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Between 1970 and 1975, Lockheed paid Khashoggi $106 million in commissions. His commissions started at 2.5% and eventually rose to as much as 15%. Khashoggi "became for all practical purposes a marketing arm of Lockheed. Khashoggi would provide not only an entrée but strategy, constant advice, and analysis", according to Max Helzel, then vice president of Lockheed's [[international marketing]].&lt;ref name="R000185"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963261-5,00.html|title=Cover Stories: Khashoggi's High-Flying Realm|last=Stengel|first=Richard|date=19 January 1987|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=25 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919071454/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C963261-5%2C00.html|archivedate=19 September 2008|deadurl=no|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commercial pioneer, he established companies in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to handle his commissions as well as developing contacts with notables such as [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officers [[James H. Critchfield]] and [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.|Kim Roosevelt]] and United States businessman [[Charles Rebozo|Bebe Rebozo]], a close associate of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. His yacht, the [[Kingdom 5KR|''Nabila'']], was the largest in the world at the time and was used in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After Khashoggi ran into financial problems he sold the yacht to the [[List of Sultans of Brunei|Sultan of Brunei]], who in turn sold it for $29 million to [[Donald Trump]], who sold it for $20 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inside-the-fabulous-world-of-donald-trump-where-money-is-no-problem/2015/10/09/e51ae0fc-6161-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html|title=Inside the fabulous world of Donald Trump, where money is no problem|last1=Roberts|first1=Roxanne|date=9 October 2015|access-date=16 August 2016|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]] as part of a deal to keep his [[Trump Taj Mahal|Taj Mahal]] casino out of bankruptcy.

Khashoggi headed a company called Triad International Holding Company, which among other things built the [[Triad Center]] in [[Salt Lake City]], which later went bankrupt.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-29/news/mn-2279_1_bankruptcy-court |title=Utah Company of Khashoggi Goes Bankrupt |access-date=7 June 2017 |work=Los Angeles Times |agency=Associated Press |publication-date=29 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was famed as an arms dealer, brokering deals between US firms and the [[Saudi Arabia#Politics|Saudi government]], most actively in the 1960s and 1970s. In the documentary series ''[[The Mayfair Set]]'', Saudi author Said Aburish states that one of Khashoggi's first weapons deals was providing [[David Stirling]] with weapons for a covert mission in [[Yemen]] during the [[Aden Emergency]] in 1963. Among his overseas clients were [[Arms industry|defense contractors]] [[Lockheed Corporation]] (now [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin Corporation]]), [[Raytheon]], [[Grumman|Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]] and [[Northrop Corporation]] (the last two of which have now merged into [[Northrop Grumman]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/world/middleeast/adnan-khashoggi-dead-saudi-arms-trader.html?_r=0 |title=Adnan Khashoggi, High-Living Saudi Arms Trader, Dies at 81 |last=Kinzer |first=Stephen |access-date=7 June 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publication-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triad International ==

'''Triad International''' is a multi-national private investment corporation that was owned by Khashoggi. Its investments include many notable properties and businesses throughout the world. The company consisted of subsidiary companies, including Triad Management, Triad Properties, Triad Energy, Triad Technology, and Triad Financial resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="standardmedia" /&gt;
[[File:Adnan Khashoggi Khalidia Yacht.jpg|thumb|Khashoggi's yacht Khalidia]]
The Global span of the businesses prompted the creation by the Khashoggi family of a board-game called Triopoly which was modeled after the classic game of Monopoly. The various game tiles represented properties and companies owned by Khashoggi and his Triad corporation. The game was manufactured and given to family and friends.

Triad International was formed in the early 1960s and as it grew spanned five continents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The company holdings included hotels, shopping centers, banks, oil refineries, a computer manufacturer, a gold mine, construction companies, car and truck franchises, and a professional sports team, the [[Utah Jazz]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="standardmedia" /&gt;
[[File:Adnan Khashoggi Triad Triopoly Board Game.jpg|thumb|Khashoggi's custom board game of his properties]]
The company was headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland with its subsidiary companies located in the United States, Canada, and Saudi Arabia.

Khashoggi, through Triad, owned the Mount Kenya Safari Club, known as [[Ol Pejeta Conservancy]], a several hundred acre reserve at the foot of Mount Kenya, San Francisco Town Center East a $250 million property, Long Beach Edgington Oil a $250 million per year oil refinery, Santa Ana based ATV computer systems, Arizona, Colorado Land &amp; Cattle company, Security National bank in Walnut Creek, CA, Barrick gold mine in Toronto, Canada, Saudi Arabian Kenworth, Chrysler and Fiat car and truck dealerships, the National Gypsum company in Saudi Arabia, and Sahuaro Petroleum in Phoenix, AZ.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The company also had major financial interests in Lloyd's of London, The Manera company, Las Brisas Resort in Acapulco, Mexico, The Houston Galleria, National car rental, Pyramid Oasis in Cairo, Egypt, Travel Lodge Australia, Pacific Harbor hotel in Fiji, Beirut Riyadh bank, and the bank of Contra Costa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Khashoggi's Triad real estate holdings included private residences in Beirut, Lebanon, Jeddah and Riyadh Saudi Arabia, Geneva, Switzerland, Cairo, Egypt, Salt Lake City Utah, Cone Ranch, Florida, Rome, Italy, Paris and Cannes, France, London, England, and a multi-floor penthouse in [[Olympic Tower|Olympic towers]] in New York.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Khashoggi also owned several private jets, and super-yachts through Triad, including a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 and DC-9, three Boeing 727's, and several smaller business jets and helicopters. His three super-yachts, the Nabila, The Mohammadia, and the Khalida,were named after his children, Nabila, Mohammed, and Khalid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Iran–Contra affair ==
Khashoggi was implicated in the [[Iran–Contra affair]] as a key middleman in the arms-for-hostages exchange along with [[Iran]]ian arms dealer [[Manucher Ghorbanifar]] and, in a complex series of events, was found to have borrowed money for these arms purchases from the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) with Saudi and United States backing.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; His role in the affair created a related controversy when Khashoggi donated millions to the [[American University]] in Washington, DC to build a sports arena which would bear his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/01/11/american-u-donation-stirs-debate/a8487a86-1788-4a79-ab8f-16e02c03df43/|title=AMERICAN U.

== Imelda Marcos affair ==
[[File:Adnan Khashoggi Omaria DC-9 H500E.jpg|thumb|Khashoggi's DC-9 Jet and Helicopter piloted by Karim Khashoggi]]
In 1988, Khashoggi was arrested in [[Switzerland]], accused of concealing funds, and held for three months. Khashoggi stopped fighting extradition when the U.S. prosecutors reduced the charges to obstruction of justice and mail fraud and dropped the more serious charges of [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] and conspiracy. In 1990, a United States federal jury in [[Manhattan]] acquitted Khashoggi and [[Imelda Marcos]], widow of the exiled Philippine President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], of racketeering and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-02/news/mn-640_1_imelda-marcos-acquitted |title=Imelda Marcos Acquitted : Cleared of Looting Philippines to Buy N.Y.

== Genesis Intermedia ==

Khashoggi was a financier behind Genesis Intermedia, Inc. (formerly [[NASDAQ]]: GENI), a publicly traded Internet company based in the US. In 2006, Khashoggi was sued by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] for securities fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg News in the New York Times. 14 April 2006 [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/14/business/14court.html S.E.C.

== Seymour Hersh report ==
In January 2003, [[Seymour Hersh]] reported in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine that former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Richard Perle]] had a meeting with Khashoggi in [[Marseille]] in order to use him as a conduit between [[Trireme Partners]], a private [[venture capital]] company of which he was one of three principals, and the Saudi government.&lt;ref name="Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TL9ictK2NMC&amp;pg=PT138 |title=Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude |last=Baer |first=Robert  |publisher=Crown/Archetype |year=2003 |isbn=9781400053377 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Perle was chair of the [[Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee]], a [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] advisory group, which provided him with access to classified information and a position to influence defense policy.&lt;ref name="Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude" /&gt;

Khashoggi told Hersh that Perle talked to him about the economic costs regarding a proposed invasion of Iraq. "'If there is no war,' he told me, 'why is there a need for security? If there is a war, of course, billions of dollars will have to be spent.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The New Yorker'': [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/03/17/030317fa_fact?currentPage=all Lunch With The Chairman.]  17 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew of Constantinople''' ('''Andrew the Fool-for-Christ''' or '''Andrew, the Fool''', {{lang-gr|Ἀνδρέας ὁ Σαλός}}; died in 936) is considered a [[saint]] by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and is revered as a [[Fool for Christ]].

Andrew, a [[Slav]] by birth, was a [[slave]] of Theognostus, who was serving as a bodyguard in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="orth"&gt;[http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/saints/andrew_foolish.htm Orthodox Church in USA]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he decided to become a [[Fool for Christ]], living out his goal with humility and patience.

According to certain sources, Andrew had a vision of Most Holy [[Theotokos]] in the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Blachernae church]] of Constantinople, while the city was surrounded by enemy troops (by some sources, Muslim Arabs).&lt;ref name="orth"/&gt;

Andrew and his disciple Epiphanus testified that they saw the [[Holy Virgin]] surrounded by many angels and Saints, praying and extending her [[homophorion]] (protection) over the faithful. After this vision, Constantinople was saved when its attackers retreated. That vision and the avoidance of Constantinople's destruction that was attributed to it inspired the creation of one of the most famous Eastern Orthodox holidays: the feast of the [[The Protection of the Mother of God|Protection of the Theotokos]].

Andrew died in 936. His memory is commemorated by [[Orthodox Christianity|Eastern Orthodox]] communities on October 15 (Oct. 2 old calendar). The earliest manuscript of his Greek [[hagiography]] is a [[Units of paper quantity#Quire|quire]] in Munich in a 10th-century [[uncial script]]. The work was also translated into Georgian and Slavonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB|page=93|title=Andrew the Fool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ari Bernardus Lasso''' (born 17 January 1973 in [[Madiun]], [[East Java]]), better known as '''Ari Lasso''' is an Indonesian musician and former lead vocalist of [[Dewa 19]].

==Biography==
Lasso was born in [[Madiun]], [[East Java]] on 17 January 1973{{sfn|Loka 2011, Ari Lasso:}} to Bartholomeus B. Lasso and Sri Noerhida.{{sfn|KapanLagi.com, Ari Lasso}} His mother told him that he could become a famous singer, saying that "[his] life should be beautiful" because of his voice.{{sfn|Loka 2011, Ari Lasso:}} While attending high school at [[SMA Negeri 2 Surabaya]], he established Outsider Band along with the drummer Wawan Juniarso, from [[Dewa 19]], and guitarist Piyu of [[Padi (band)|Padi]].{{sfn|KapanLagi.com, Ari Lasso}}{{sfn|Loka 2011, Ari Lasso:}} After graduating from high school, he attended [[Airlangga University]] and earned a degree in economics.{{sfn|Loka 2011, Ari Lasso:}}

Lasso eventually became a member of Dewa 19 together with Wawan Juniarson, Andra Junaidi, [[Ahmad Dhani]], and Erwin Prasetya. With Dewa 19, he released the album ''Kangen'', which was chosen as the best album of the year by BASF in 1993.{{sfn|KapanLagi.com, Ari Lasso}}

Beginning after Dewa 19's third album,{{sfn|KapanLagi.com, Ari Lasso}} Lasso used drugs heavily;{{sfn|Loka 2011, Ari Lasso:}} his drug addiction led to him being fired by the band in 2001{{sfn|Simanjuntak 2003, Dewa buries}} and going bankrupt. In order to overcome his addiction, he tried going to rehab and alternative medicine; he was also hospitalized and put under isolation at home. All of these efforts were to no avail. After promising his dying mother that he would beat his addiction, he became more adamant in attempting to recover, eventually succeeding.{{sfn|Loka 2011, Ari Lasso:}} He also quit his 20-year habit of smoking in 2010, after his son began taking and destroying his cigarettes.{{sfn|Jakarta Post 2010, Son motivates}}

After his dismissal from Dewa 19, Lasso became a solo singer.{{sfn|Simanjuntak 2003, Dewa buries}} He released his first solo album, the commercially successful ''Sendiri Dulu'', that year. Two years later, he released ''Keseimbangan'', which featured two songs performed with Dhani. In 2004 he released ''Kulihat Kudengar dan Kurasakan'', of which two songs became used for the movie ''Mengejar Matahari'' (''Chasing the Sun''). In 2006, he released the album ''Selalu Ada'', while the following year his album ''The Best of'' included a duet with [[Bunga Citra Lestari]].{{sfn|KapanLagi.com, Ari Lasso}}

In 2009 rumours spread that Lasso would become mute due to damage to his [[Larynx|voice box]]; although he did not perform for four months during that period, he performed in a series of concerts between May and June of that year.{{sfn|KapanLagi.com, Ari Lasso}} Lasso has expressed interest in becoming a [[music producer]] if he can no longer be a singer.{{sfn|Loka 2011, Ari Lasso:}}

In 2012, Lasso released a compilation album, [[Yang Terbaik (Ari Lasso album)|Yang Terbaik]]. The album was only sold at [[KFC]] outlets in Indonesia. The album compiled top hit singles and six new songs, "Kisah Kita", "Karena Aku Tlah Denganmu", "Cintailah Aku Sepenuh Hati", "Satu Cinta", "Doa Untuk Cinta" and "Cinta Adalah Misteri". Lasso also includes musicians who merged his albums sold in KFC stores like [[Cinta Laura]], [[Indah Dewi Pertiwi]], [[Agnes Monica]], [[SM*SH]], [[T.R.I.A.D]], [[Rossa (singer)|Rossa]], [[Slank]], [[Last Child (band)|Last Child]], [[Ello (singer)|Ello]], [[Sammy Simorangkir]], [[Armada (band)|Armada]] and [[Ungu]].

In 2016, Ari Lasso joined the judging panel of the [[The Voice Indonesia (season 2)|season 2]] of ''[[The Voice Indonesia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabloidbintang.com/articles/film-tv-musik/kabar/31798-the-voice-indonesia-rcti-agnes-monica-judika-ari-lasso-dan-kaka-slank-jadi-juri|title=The Voice Indonesia RCTI: Agnes Monica, Judika, Ari Lasso dan Kaka Slank Jadi Juri|language=Indonesian|publisher=Tabloid Bintang|date=18 January 2016|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
When not busy with music, Lasso tries to participate in his children's lives, assisting with their homework and attending school performances. Lasso has noted that [[Mitch Albom]]'s ''[[The Five People You Meet in Heaven]]'' has influenced his parenting style and belief that a parent's interest in their children's lives can be a large influence.{{sfn|Loka 2011, Ari Lasso:}}

'''Barbara Samson''' (born February 7, 1975) is a [[France|French]] poet who was infected with [[HIV]] at the age of seventeen. Her story was made into the French television film ''[[Being Seventeen]]''.

Samson sought treatment for an [[eating disorder]] at the age of seventeen. While staying in a French health clinic, she fell in love with another patient who wrote love poems for her. She later discovered that the poems were translations of [[Jim Morrison]]'s lyrics of [[The Doors]]' rock songs. Her lover had also concealed his [[HIV]]-positive status, which Samson in turn contracted. She told nobody about her illness, because she was so ashamed. Barbara met Eric and in 1994 they opened together the "sidaction", a programme which was on almost every French television channel. She also toured numerous schools to speak about AIDS.

Samson wrote an autobiography, ''On n'est pas sérieux quand on a dix-sept ans'' ("Nobody Is Serious When They're Seventeen"). The book became a [[bestseller]] in France and was translated into eight languages.

{{As of|2005}}, Barbara Samson lives and works in France. She visited [[Ohio University]] in the spring of 2003 to speak about living with HIV.

'''Cher''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɛər}}; born '''Cherilyn Sarkisian'''; May 20, 1946) is an American singer and actress. Commonly referred to by the media as the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Goddess of Pop]],&lt;ref name=GoddessOfPop /&gt; she has been described as embodying female autonomy in a male-dominated industry. She is known for her distinctive [[contralto]] singing voice and for having worked in numerous areas of entertainment, as well as adopting a variety of styles and appearances during her six-decade-long career.

Cher gained popularity in 1965 as one-half of the [[folk rock]] husband-wife duo [[Sonny &amp; Cher]] after their song "[[I Got You Babe]]" reached number one on the American and British charts. By the end of 1967, they had sold 40&amp;nbsp;million records worldwide and had become, according to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, rock's "it" couple.&lt;ref name=time1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bellafante|first=Ginia|authorlink=Ginia Bellafante|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/01/12/time/Bellafante.html|title=Appreciation: The Sonny Side of Life|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=January 19, 1998|accessdate=January 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201195234/http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/01/12/time/Bellafante.html|archivedate=February 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her solo career simultaneously, releasing in 1966 her first million-seller song, "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]". She became a television personality in the 1970s with her shows ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour]]'', watched by over 30 million viewers weekly during its three-year run, and ''[[Cher (TV series)|Cher]]''. She emerged as a fashion trendsetter by wearing elaborate outfits on her television shows.

While working on television, Cher established herself as a solo artist with the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart-topping singles "[[Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves]]", "[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]]", and "[[Dark Lady (song)|Dark Lady]]". After her divorce from [[Sonny Bono]] in 1975, she launched a comeback in 1979 with the [[disco]] album ''[[Take Me Home (Cher album)|Take Me Home]]'' and earned $300,000 a week for her 1980–1982 [[Cher in Concert#A Celebration at Caesars Palace|concert residency]] in Las Vegas.

In 1982, Cher made her Broadway debut in the play ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' and starred in its [[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|film adaptation]]. She subsequently earned critical acclaim for her performances in films such as ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), ''[[Mask (film)|Mask]]'' (1985), and ''[[Moonstruck]]'' (1987), for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She then revived her musical career by recording the [[Rock music|rock]]-inflected albums ''[[Cher (1987 album)|Cher]]'' (1987), ''[[Heart of Stone (Cher album)|Heart of Stone]]'' (1989), and ''[[Love Hurts (Cher album)|Love Hurts]]'' (1991), all of which yielded successful singles such as [[I Found Someone#Cher version|"I Found Someone"]], "[[If I Could Turn Back Time]]" and "[[Love and Understanding]]".

Cher reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the album ''[[Believe (Cher album)|Believe]]'', whose [[Believe (Cher song)|title track]] became the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK. It features the pioneering use of [[Auto-Tune]], also known as the "Cher effect". Her 2002–2005 [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour]] became one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time, earning $250 million. In 2008, she signed a $180&amp;nbsp;million deal to headline [[the Colosseum at Caesars Palace]] in Las Vegas for three years. In 2018, Cher returned to film for her first on-screen role since 2010's ''[[Burlesque (2010 American film)|Burlesque]]'', starring in the musical romantic comedy film ''[[Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again]]''. Inspired by the film, the album ''[[Dancing Queen (album)|Dancing Queen]]'' (2018) debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], tying with 2013's ''[[Closer to the Truth (Cher album)|Closer to the Truth]]'' for Cher's highest-charting solo album in the U.S.

Cher has won a [[Grammy Award]], an [[Emmy Award]], an [[Academy Award]], three [[Golden Globe Award]]s, a [[Cannes Film Festival]] Award, a special [[Council of Fashion Designers of America|CFDA Fashion Award]], and a [[Kennedy Center Honors]] prize, among several other honors. She has sold 100 million records worldwide to date, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] in history. She is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a ''Billboard'' chart in six consecutive decades, from the 1960s to the 2010s. Outside of her music and acting, she is noted for her political views, philanthropic endeavors, and social activism, including [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention.

== Life and career ==
=== 1946–1961: Early life ===
[[File:Cher HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photograph of a young, dark-haired girl looking at the camera and smiling.|Cher as a high school student in 1960]]
Cher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in [[El Centro, California]], on May 20, 1946.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=17}} Her father, John Sarkisian, was an [[Armenian-American]] truck driver with drug and gambling problems; her mother, [[Georgia Holt]] (born Jackie Jean Crouch), was an occasional model and bit-part actress who claimed Irish, English, German, and [[Cherokee people|Cherokee]] ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bego|2001|p=11}}: Sarkisian's profession;&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=17}}: Sarkisian's nationality and personal problems, Crouch's profession;&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheever|first=Susan|authorlink=Susan Cheever|url=http://people.com/archive/in-a-broken-land-vol-39-no-19/|title=In a Broken Land|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 17, 1993|accessdate=January 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227055224/http://people.com/archive/in-a-broken-land-vol-39-no-19/|archivedate=December 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}: Sarkisian's nationality, Crouch's ancestry.&lt;/ref&gt; though Cher is predominantly [[Armenians|Armenian]].&lt;ref&gt;https://etcanada.com/news/284868/cher-refuses-to-apologize-for-half-breed-after-twitter-war-fuelled-by-trumps-diversity-coalition-appointee/&lt;/ref&gt; Cher's father was rarely home when she was an infant,{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}} and her parents divorced when Cher was ten months old.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=17}} Her mother later married actor John Southall, with whom she had another daughter, Georganne, Cher's half-sister.{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=17–18}}

Now living in Los Angeles, Cher's mother began acting while working as a waitress. She changed her name to Georgia Holt and played minor roles in films and on television. Holt also secured acting parts for her daughters as [[Extra (actor)|extras]] on television shows like ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}} Her mother's relationship with Southall ended when Cher was nine years old, but she considers him her father and remembers him as a "good-natured man who turned belligerent when he drank too much".{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=18}} Holt remarried and divorced several more times, and she moved her family around the country (including New York, Texas, and California).{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}} They often had little money, and Cher recounted having had to use rubber bands to hold her shoes together.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=18}} At one point, her mother left Cher at an orphanage for several weeks.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=10}} Although they met every day, both found the experience traumatic.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=18}}

When Cher was in fifth grade, she produced a performance of the musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice.{{sfn|Cher|Coplon|1998|p=39}} Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was [[Audrey Hepburn]], particularly due to her role in the 1961 film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=22}} She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=22}} She had wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, "I couldn't think of anything that I could do&amp;nbsp;... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. I just thought, well, I'll be famous. That was my goal."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=21}}

In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under the name Cheryl LaPiere)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/cheryl_lapiere_born_1946_3214561|title=Cheryl Lapiere, Born 05/20/1946 in California|publisher=[[California Birth Index]]|accessdate=January 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131222317/http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/cheryl_lapiere_born_1946_3214561|archivedate=January 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Georganne, and enrolled them at [[Montclair College Preparatory School]], a private school in [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]], whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, "[she] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=21}} A former classmate commented, "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special&amp;nbsp;... She was like a movie star, right then and there&amp;nbsp;... She said she was going to be a movie star and we knew she would."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=21}} Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had [[dyslexia]]. Cher's unconventional behavior stood out: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=22}} She later recalled, "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous."{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}}

=== 1962–1965: Solo career breakthrough ===
At age 16, Cher dropped out of school, left her mother's house, and moved to Los Angeles with a friend. She took acting classes and worked to support herself, dancing in small [[nightclub|clubs]] along Hollywood's [[Sunset Strip]] and introducing herself to performers, managers, and agents.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=23}} According to Berman, "[Cher] did not hesitate to approach anyone she thought could help her get a break, make a new contact, or get an audition."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=24}} Cher met performer [[Sonny Bono]] in November 1962 when he was working for record producer [[Phil Spector]].{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=24}} Cher's friend moved out, and Cher accepted Sonny's offer to be his [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]].{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=27}} Sonny introduced Cher to Spector, who used her as a [[Backing vocalist|backup singer]] on many recordings, including [[the Ronettes]]' "[[Be My Baby]]" and [[the Righteous Brothers]]' "[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]".{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=28}} Spector produced her first single, the commercially unsuccessful "[[Ringo, I Love You]]", which Cher recorded under the name Bonnie Jo Mason.&lt;ref name=Eder2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Eder|first=Bruce|title=Cher&amp;nbsp;– Biography &amp; History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cher-mn0000107090/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201025517/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cher-mn0000107090/biography|archivedate=February 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cher and Sonny became close friends, eventual lovers, and performed their own unofficial wedding ceremony in a hotel room in Tijuana, Mexico, on October 27, 1964.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2512&amp;dat=19750628&amp;id=dRNIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hgANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3860,3724402|title=Cher divorces Sonny|newspaper=[[Record-Journal]]|date=June 28, 1975|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sonny had wanted to launch Cher as a solo artist, she encouraged him to perform with her because she suffered from [[stage fright]], and he began joining her onstage, singing the harmonies. Cher disguised her nervousness by looking at Sonny; she later commented that she sang to the people through him.{{sfn|Cher|Coplon|1998|p=94}} In late 1964, they emerged as a duo called Caesar &amp; Cleo, releasing the poorly received singles "[[Do You Wanna Dance?#Other versions|Do You Wanna Dance?]]", "[[Love Is Strange]]", and "[[Let the Good Times Roll (Shirley and Lee song)|Let the Good Times Roll]]".{{sfn|Bego|2001|pp=29–30}}

Cher signed with [[Liberty Records]]' [[Imperial Records|Imperial]] imprint in the end of 1964, and Sonny became her producer. The single "Dream Baby", released under the name "Cherilyn", received airplay in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=Eder2009 /&gt; Encouraged by Imperial, Cher worked with Sonny on her second solo single on the label, a cover version of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[All I Really Want to Do]]",&lt;ref name=Eder2009 /&gt; which peaked at number 15 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=BiggestBBHits&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1563030/cher-birthday-billboard-hits|title=Cher's 20 Biggest Billboard Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=January 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105221030/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1563030/cher-birthday-billboard-hits|archivedate=January 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[the Byrds]] had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group's record label began to promote the [[I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better|B-side]] of the Byrds' single. [[Roger McGuinn]] of the Byrds commented, "We loved the Cher version&amp;nbsp;... We didn't want to hassle. So we just turned our record over."{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=40}} Cher's debut album, ''[[All I Really Want to Do (album)|All I Really Want to Do]]'' (1965), reached number 16 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cher&amp;nbsp;– Awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cher-mn0000107090/biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=January 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201025517/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cher-mn0000107090/biography|archivedate=February 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was later described by [[AllMusic]]'s Tim Sendra as "one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sendra|first=Tim|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-i-really-want-to-do-mw0000457386|title=All I Really Want to Do – Cher&amp;nbsp;– Songs, Reviews, redits|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=January 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128015527/http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-i-really-want-to-do-mw0000457386|archivedate=January 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1965–1967: Sonny and Cher's rise to pop stardom ===
[[File:SonnyCher1966.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sonny &amp; Cher]] in [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], 1966]]

By the end of the 1960s, Sonny and Cher's music had ceased to chart. According to Berman, "the heavy, loud sound of groups like [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] made the folk-rock music of Sonny and Cher seem too bland."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=31}} Cher later said, "I loved the new sound of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Eric Clapton]], the electric-guitar oriented bands.

The duo spent $500,000 and mortgaged their home to make the film ''[[Chastity (film)|Chastity]]'' (1969).

In 1971, Sonny and Cher signed with the [[Kapp Records]] division of [[MCA Records]], and Cher released the single "Classified 1A", in which she sings from the point of view of a soldier who bleeds to death in Vietnam.

Since Sonny's first attempts at reviving their recording career as a duo had also been unsuccessful, Kapp Records recruited [[Snuff Garrett]] to work with them.

In 1972, Cher released the all-ballad set ''[[Foxy Lady (Cher album)|Foxy Lady]]'', demonstrating the evolution of her vocal abilities, according to Bego.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=81}} Following the release of the album, Garrett quit as producer after disagreeing with Sonny about the kind of material Cher should record.{{sfn|Bronson|1997|p=345}} At Sonny's insistence, in 1973 Cher released an album of [[Standard (music)|standards]] called ''[[Bittersweet White Light]]'', which was commercially unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bego|2001|pp=81–82}} That year, lyricist Mary Dean brought Garrett "[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]]", a song about the daughter of a Cherokee mother and a white father, that she had written especially for Cher. Although Garrett did not have Cher as a client at the time, he was convinced that "it's a smash for Cher and for nobody else", so he held the song for months until he got Cher back.{{sfn|Bronson|1997|p=345}} "Half-Breed" was featured on the [[Half-Breed (album)|album of the same name]] and became Cher's second U.S. solo number-one single.{{sfn|Bronson|1997|p=359}} Both the album and the single were certified gold by the RIAA.&lt;ref name=RIAA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Gold &amp; Platinum|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=January 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212231947/https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|archivedate=February 12, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bego, "it was their intention that [this album] was going to make millions of fans around the world take her seriously as a rock star, and not just a pop singer."{{sfn|Bego|2001|pp=97–98}}

Despite Cher's efforts to develop her musical range by listening to artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Elton John]], [[James Taylor]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Bob Dylan]], the resulting album ''[[Stars (Cher album)|Stars]]'' was commercially and critically unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bego|2001|pp=97–98}} [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote, "Cher is just no rock and roller&amp;nbsp;...

On February 16, 1975, Cher returned to television with a solo show on CBS. Called ''[[Cher (TV series)|Cher]]'', it began as a highly rated special with guests [[Flip Wilson]], [[Elton John]], and [[Bette Midler]].{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=101}} The show was produced by Geffen and centered on Cher's songs, monologues, comedy performance, and her variation of clothing,{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=36}} which was the largest for a weekly TV show.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=102}} Early critical reception was favorable; the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' exclaimed that "Sonny without Cher was a disaster. Cher without Sonny, on the other hand, could be the best thing that's happened to weekly television this season."{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=102}} ''Cher'' lasted for less than a year, replaced by a new show in which she professionally reunited with ex-husband Sonny;{{sfn|Lonergan|Studwell|1999|p=208}} she said, "doing a show alone was more than I could handle."{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=105}}

On June 30, 1975, four days after finalizing her divorce from Sonny, Cher married rock musician [[Gregg Allman]], co-founder of [[The Allman Brothers Band]].&lt;ref name=HistoryJun75&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/cher-marries-greg-allman|title=Cher marries Greg Allman&amp;nbsp;– Jun 30, 1975|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|accessdate=January 17, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106054924/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/cher-marries-greg-allman|archivedate=January 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She filed for divorce nine days later because of his heroin and liquor problems, but they reconciled within a month.&lt;ref name=greggcher&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1992/07/10/gregg-allman-and-chers-troubled-marriage|title=Gregg Allman and Cher's troubled marriage|first=Jess|last=Cagle|date=July 10, 1992|accessdate=January 17, 2016|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117034138/http://www.ew.com/article/1992/07/10/gregg-allman-and-chers-troubled-marriage|archivedate=November 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had one son, [[Elijah Blue Allman|Elijah Blue]], on July 10, 1976.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=42}} Sonny and Cher's TV reunion, ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour#The Sonny &amp; Cher Show (1976–1977)|The Sonny and Cher Show]]'', debuted on CBS in February 1976—the first show ever to star a divorced couple. Although the show was a ratings success on its premiere,{{sfn|Hochman|1999|p=1004}} Cher and Sonny's insulting onscreen banter about their divorce,{{sfn|Lonergan|Studwell|1999|p=208}} her reportedly extravagant lifestyle, and her troubled relationship with Allman caused a public backlash{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=150}} that eventually contributed to the show's cancellation in August 1977.{{sfn|Hochman|1999|p=1004}}

In 1976, [[Mego Corporation|Mego Toys]] released a line of [[Sonny &amp; Cher dolls|toys and dolls]] in the likeness of Sonny and Cher, which coincided with the popularity of ''The Sonny and Cher Show''. The miniature version of Cher ended up being the highest selling doll of 1976, surpassing [[Barbie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/12/19/archives/toying-with-a-name-toying-with-a-name-helps-sell-the-toys.html|title=Toying With a Name|first=Rona|last=Cherry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cher's next albums, ''[[I'd Rather Believe in You]]'' (1976) and ''[[Cherished]]'' (1977), the latter a return to her pop style at Warner's producers' insistence, were commercially unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=116}} In 1977, under the rubric "Allman and Woman", she recorded alongside Allman the duet album ''[[Two the Hard Way]]''.

=== 1979–1982: Second musical comeback, shift from disco music to rock ===
[[File:Cher live 1981.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Cher performing in Las Vegas, 1981]]
A single mother with two children, Cher realized that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with [[Casablanca Records]] and launched a comeback with the single "[[Take Me Home (Cher song)|Take Me Home]]" and the [[Take Me Home (Cher album)|album of the same name]], both of which capitalized on the [[disco]] craze.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=44}} Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers for more than half of 1979,{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=44}} and were certified gold by the RIAA.&lt;ref name=RIAA /&gt; Sales of the album may have been boosted{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=44}} by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a [[Viking]] outfit on its cover.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=124}} Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, "I never thought I would want to do disco&amp;nbsp;... [but] it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=44}}

Encouraged by the popularity of ''Take Me Home'', Cher planned to return to rock music in her next album, ''[[Prisoner (Cher album)|Prisoner]]'' (1979).{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=45}} The album's cover features Cher draped in chains as a "prisoner of the press",{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=45–46}} which caused controversy among feminist groups for her perceived portrayal of a sex slave.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=272}} She included rock songs, which made the disco release seem unfocused and led to its commercial failure.{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=45–46}} ''Prisoner'' produced the single "[[Hell on Wheels (song)|Hell on Wheels]]", featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Roller Boogie]]''. The song exploits the late 1970s [[Roller skating|roller-skating]] fad and contributed to its popularity.&lt;ref name=CherInterview1999 /&gt;

In 1980, alongside Italian record producer [[Giorgio Moroder]], Cher wrote her last Casablanca disco recording, "Bad Love", for the film ''[[Foxes (film)|Foxes]]''.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=139}} She formed the rock band Black Rose that year with her then-lover, guitarist [[Les Dudek]]. Although Cher was the lead singer, she did not receive top billing because she wanted to create the impression that all band members were equal. Since she was easily recognized when she performed with the band, she developed a [[Punk fashion|punk look]] by cutting her trademark long hair. Despite appearances on television, the band failed to earn concert dates.{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=46–47}} Their album ''[[Black Rose (Cher album)|Black Rose]]'' received unfavorable reviews; Cher told ''Rolling Stone'', "The critics panned us, and they didn't attack the record. They attacked me. It was like, 'How dare Cher sing rock &amp; roll?'"&lt;ref name=Johnson2002 /&gt;

During Black Rose's active period, Cher was simultaneously doing a [[Cher in Concert#A Celebration at Caesars Palace|concert residency]] in Las Vegas, earning $300,000 a week.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=47}} Its companion television special ''Cher&amp;nbsp;...

Guarisco as "one of the more inspired rock duets of the 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guarisco|first=Donald A.|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/dead-ringer-for-love-mt0004520252|title=Dead Ringer for Love – Meat Loaf&amp;nbsp;– Song Info|accessdate=January 17, 2016|publisher=AllMusic|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126032701/http://www.allmusic.com/song/dead-ringer-for-love-mt0004520252|archivedate=January 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[Columbia Records]] released the album ''[[I Paralyze]]'', later deemed by Bego as Cher's "strongest and most consistent solo album in years" despite its low sales.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=159}}

=== 1982–1987: Film career breakthrough, musical hiatus ===
With decreasing album sales and a lack of commercially successful singles, Cher decided to further develop her acting career.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=49}} While she had previously aspired to venture into film, she had only the critically and commercially unsuccessful movies ''Good Times'' and ''Chastity'' to her credit, and the Hollywood establishment did not take her seriously as an actress.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=49}} She moved to New York in 1982 to take acting lessons with [[Lee Strasberg]], founder of the [[Actors Studio]], but never enrolled after her plans changed.&lt;ref name=CintraWilson /&gt; She auditioned for and was signed by director [[Robert Altman]] for the Broadway stage production ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', playing a member of a [[James Dean]] fan club holding a 20-year reunion. That year, Altman cast her again in the [[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|film adaptation]] of the same title.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} Cher credits Altman for launching her acting career: "Without Bob [Robert Altman] I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me&amp;nbsp;... I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it."{{sfn|Zuckoff|2009|p=431}}

Director [[Mike Nichols]], who had seen Cher onstage in ''Jimmy Dean'', offered her the part of [[Dusty Ellis|Dolly Pelliker]], a plant co-worker and [[Meryl Streep]]'s lesbian roommate in the film ''[[Silkwood]]''.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} When it premiered in 1983, audiences questioned Cher's ability as an actress. She recalls attending a film preview during which the audience laughed when they saw her name in the credits.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=54}} For her performance, Cher received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture]].{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}}

She attended the [[58th Academy Awards]] in a tarantula-like costume "to show her scorn for the 'system'", according to authors James Parish and Michael Pitts.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} The incident garnered her much publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8557447.stm|title=Talking Shop: Designer Bob Mackie|publisher=BBC News|date=March 18, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2016|last=Hassan|first=Genevieve|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131231928/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8557447.stm|archivedate=January 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1987, Cher was receiving attention for her controversial lifestyle, including her tattoos, plastic surgeries, exhibitionist fashion sense, and affairs with younger men.{{sfn|Mansour|2005|p=82}} She had romantic relationships with actors [[Val Kilmer]], [[Eric Stoltz]], and [[Tom Cruise]], hockey player [[Ron Duguay]], film producer Josh Donen, [[Bon Jovi]] guitarist [[Richie Sambora]], and Rob Camilletti, an 18-years-younger bagel baker whom she dated from 1986 to 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Cher's romantic relationships during the 1980s:

Cher starred in three films in 1987.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} In ''[[Suspect (1987 film)|Suspect]]'', she played a public defender who is both helped and romanced by one of the jurors in the homicide case she is handling.

In [[Norman Jewison]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Moonstruck]]'', she played an Italian widow in love with her fiancé's younger brother.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} The two latter films ranked among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1987, at number ten and five, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1987|title=1987 Yearly Box Office Results|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=March 14, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307024545/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1987|archivedate=March 7, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Not.com.mercial]]'' (2000) was written mostly by Cher after she had attended a songwriters' conference in 1994; it marked her first attempt at writing most of the tracks for an album. As the album was rejected by her record label for being uncommercial, she chose to sell it only on her website. In the song "Sisters of Mercy", she criticized as "cruel, heartless and wicked" the nuns who prevented her mother from retrieving her from a Catholic orphanage. The Catholic church denounced the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Deborah|last=Wilker|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-11-14/features/0011130180_1_cher-songwriting-record|title=I've Got E, Babe|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=November 14, 2000|accessdate=January 17, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105025506/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-11-14/features/0011130180_1_cher-songwriting-record|archivedate=November 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about Cher's musical output during the 1960s, Robert Hilburn of the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated that "Rock was subsequently blessed with the staggering blues exclamations of [[Janis Joplin]] in the late '60s and the raw poetic force of [[Patti Smith]] in the mid-'70s.

The 1998 song "Believe" has an electronic vocal effect proposed by Cher,&lt;ref name=Flick98 /&gt; and was the first commercial recording to feature [[Auto-Tune]]—an [[audio processor]] originally intended to disguise or correct [[off-key]] inaccuracies in vocal music recordings—as a deliberate creative effect; according to ''Rolling Stone'''s Christopher R.

In an interview in 2013, Cher reflected on how her voice had evolved during the course of her career, eventually getting stronger and suppler over the years. While she didn't really like it at the beginning, working with vocal coaches had made a significant difference; she stated in the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'': "It's so freaky because people my age are having to lose notes and I'm gaining notes, so that's pretty shocking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Rechtshaffen|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/09/13/cher-finds-truth-in-new-album|title=Cher finds 'Truth' in new album|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|accessdate=July 29, 2017|date=September 13, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729061945/http://www.torontosun.com/2013/09/13/cher-finds-truth-in-new-album|archivedate=July 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Yvonne Tasker, in her book ''Working Girls: Gender and Sexuality in Popular Cinema'' (2002), notes that Cher's film roles often mirrors her public image as a rebellious, sexually autonomous, and [[Self-made man|self-made]] woman.{{sfn|Tasker|2002|pp=191–192}} In her films, she recurrently serves as a social intermediary to disenfranchised male characters, such as [[Eric Stoltz]]'s [[Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia]] victim in ''Mask'' (1985), [[Liam Neeson]]'s mute homeless veteran in ''Suspect'' (1987), and [[Nicolas Cage]]'s socially isolated baker with a wooden hand in ''Moonstruck'' (1987).{{sfn|Negra|2001|pp=170–171}} Film critic Kathleen Rowe wrote of ''Moonstruck'' that the depiction of Cher's character as "a 'woman on top' [is] enhanced by the unruly star persona Cher brings to the part'".{{sfn|Tasker|2002|p=192}} For ''Moonstruck'', Cher was ranked 1st on ''Billboard'''s list of "The 100 Best Acting Performances by Musicians in Movies", and her performance was described as "the standard by which you mentally check all others".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8477854/musician-movie-performances-top-100&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moonstruck'' was acknowledged by the [[American Film Institute]] as the eighth best [[romantic comedy]] film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/category.aspx?cat=2 |title=10 Top 10 |publisher=AFI |date= |accessdate=2018-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222429/http://www.afi.com/10top10/category.aspx?cat=2 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Yarbrough of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' wrote that Cher was "one of the first superstars to 'play gay' with compassion and without a hint of stereotyping", as she portrays a lesbian in the 1983 film ''Silkwood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;pg=PA6|magazine=The Advocate|title=Hollywood lives|first=Jeff|last=Yarbrough|date=August 20, 1996|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cher has attracted media attention for her physical appearance—particularly her youthful looks and her tattoos.

It is hyperbolic, extreme, over the top&amp;nbsp;... Cher has engaged in a transformational technology that is dramatic and irreversible."&lt;ref name=McCracken /&gt; Caroline Ramazanoglu, author of ''Up Against Foucault: Explorations of Some Tensions Between Foucault and Feminism'' (1993), wrote that "Cher's operations have gradually replaced a strong, decidedly 'ethnic' look with a more symmetrical, delicate, 'conventional'&amp;nbsp;... and ever-youthful version of female beauty&amp;nbsp;... Her normalised image&amp;nbsp;... now acts as a standard against which other women will measure, judge, discipline and 'correct' themselves."{{sfn|Ramazanoglu|1993|p=197}}

In an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', she was critical of a variety of political topics, including Republican politicians like [[Sarah Palin]] and [[Jan Brewer]].&lt;ref name=VF2010 /&gt; She has commented that she did not understand why anyone would be a Republican because eight years under the administration of [[George W.

On October 27, 2003, Cher anonymously called a [[C-SPAN]] phone-in program to recount a visit she made to maimed soldiers at the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] and criticized the lack of media coverage and government attention given to injured servicemen.

Author [[Craig Crawford]], in his book ''The Politics of Life: 25 Rules for Survival in a Brutal and Manipulative World'' (2007), describes Cher as "a model of flexible career management", and relates her career successes to a constant reshaping of her image according to the evolving trends of popular culture.{{sfn|Crawford|2007|pp=31–32}} He further explains that she billed "each dramatic turnaround of style as another example of rebellion—an image that allowed her to make calculated changes while appearing to be consistent."{{sfn|Crawford|2007|pp=31–32}} Author Grant McCracken stated, "The term 'reinvention' is now often used to talk about the careers of American celebrities. But in Cher's case, it is particularly apt [because she] is inclined to lock on to each new fashion wave [and] is swept violently down the diffusion stream and out of fashion. Only substantial re-creation permits her to return to stardom."&lt;ref name=McCracken /&gt; Her "integrity" and "perseverance" are highlighted in the ''Reaching Your Goals'' book series of illustrated inspirational stories for children, in which her life is detailed emphasizing the importance of [[self-actualization]]: "For years, Cher worked hard to become a successful singer. Then she worked hard to become an actress. Even when she needed money, she turned down movie roles that weren't right for her. Her goal has always been to be a good actress, not just a rich and famous one."{{sfn|Negra|2001|pp=170–171}}

Cher's "ability to forge an immensely successful and lengthy career as a woman in a male-dominated entertainment world"&lt;ref name=buffalo /&gt; has drawn attention from feminist critics.{{sfn|Negra|2001|p=164}} According to author Diane Negra, Cher was presented in the beginning of her career as a product of male creativity;{{sfn|Negra|2001|p=170}} Cher remembers, "It was a time when girl singers were patted on the head for being good and told not to think".&lt;ref name=QueenComeback /&gt; However, her image eventually changed due to her "refusal of dependence on a man and the determination not only to forge a career (as an actor) on her own terms but to refuse the conventional role assigned to women over forty years old in an industry that fetishises youth", wrote author Yvonne Tasker.{{sfn|Tasker|2002|p=191}} She was featured in the 16th-anniversary edition of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine as an "authentic feminist hero" and a 1980s role model for women: "Cher, the straightforward, tattooed, dyslexic single mother, the first Oscar winner to have entered into matrimony with a known heroin addict and to have admitted to being a fashion victim by choice, has finally landed in an era that's not afraid to applaud real women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-07-20/lifestyle/0050360144_1_cher-extraordinaire-real-women|title=Cher As 'Feminist Extraordinaire' Is A Ms.-erable Choice|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=July 20, 1988|accessdate=January 18, 2016|last=Parker|first=Kathleen|authorlink=Kathleen Parker|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201030811/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-07-20/lifestyle/0050360144_1_cher-extraordinaire-real-women|archivedate=February 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephanie Brush from ''The New York Times'' wrote, following the telecast of Cher's Oscar win in 1988, that she "performs the function for women moviegoers that [[Jack Nicholson]] has always fulfilled for men. Free of the burden of ever having been America's sweetheart, she is the one who represents us [women] in our revenge fantasies, telling all the fatheads&amp;nbsp;... exactly where they can go. You need to be more than beautiful to get away with this. You need to have been Cher for 40 years."&lt;ref name=Brush1988 /&gt;

[[Alec Mapa]] of ''The Advocate'' elaborates: "While the rest of us were sleeping, Cher's been out there for the last four decades living out every single one of our childhood fantasies&amp;nbsp;... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to."&lt;ref name=alecmapa /&gt; ''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} [[Jancee Dunn]] wrote, "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/cher-19960919|title=Cher|date=September 19, 1996|accessdate=January 18, 2016|first=Jancee|last=Dunn|authorlink=Jancee Dunn|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202150510/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/cher-19960919|archivedate=February 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Fury of ''The Independent'' wrote that Cher "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame."&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Bego stated: "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage."{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=3}}

The first female president in the Philippines, Aquino was the most prominent figure of the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]], which toppled the [[History of the Philippines (1965-1986)|21-year rule]] of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. She was named ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Time Person of the Year|Woman of the Year]] in 1986. Prior to this, she had not held any other elective office.

She emerged as leader of the opposition after her husband [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.|was assassinated]] on August 21, 1983 upon returning to the Philippines from exile in the [[United States]]. In late 1985, Marcos called for [[snap election]]s, and Aquino ran for president with former senator [[Salvador Laurel]] as her [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]]. After the [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|elections]] were held on February 7, 1986, the [[Batasang Pambansa]] proclaimed Marcos and his running mate, [[Arturo Tolentino]], as the winners amid allegations of [[electoral fraud]], with Aquino calling for massive [[civil disobedience]] actions. Defections from the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the support of the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|local Catholic hierarchy]] led to the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and secured Aquino's accession on February 25, 1986.

As President, Aquino oversaw the promulgation of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], which limited the powers of the Presidency and re-established the [[bicameral]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]]. Her administration gave strong emphasis and concern for [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]], and on peace talks to resolve the ongoing [[CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion|Communist insurgency]] and [[Islamic insurgency in the Philippines|Islamist secession movements]]. Her economic policies centered on restoring economic health and confidence and focused on creating a market-oriented and socially responsible economy. She became the first Filipino to be bestowed with the prestigious [[Prize For Freedom]] Award in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;https://liberal-international.org/what-we-do/awards-and-prizes/prize-for-freedom/&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquino faced [[1986–90 Philippine coup attempts|several coup attempts]] against her government and various natural calamities until the end of her term in 1992. She was succeeded as President by [[Fidel Ramos]], and returned to civilian life while remaining public about her opinions on political issues. In recognition for her role in the world's most peaceful revolution to attain democracy, she was awarded the prestigious [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] in 1998.

In 2008, Aquino was diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]] and died on August 1, 2009. Her monuments of peace and democracy were established in the capital [[Manila]] and her home province of [[Tarlac]] after her death. Her son [[Benigno Aquino III]] became President of the Philippines from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2016. Throughout her life, Aquino was known to be a devout [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]], and was fluent in [[French language|French]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[English language|English]] aside from her native [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]].&lt;ref name="9facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/facts-about-cory-aquino/ |title=9 Interesting Facts You May Not Know About Corazon Aquino |website=filipiknow |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Aquino was born '''Maria Corazon Sumulong Cojuangco''' on January 25, 1933 in [[Paniqui, Tarlac|Paniqui]], [[Tarlac]],&lt;ref name="malacanang.gov.ph"/&gt; and was the sixth (of whom two died in infancy) of eight children of [[José Cojuangco]], a former congressman, and Demetria Sumulong, a pharmacist. Her siblings were Pedro, Josephine, Teresita, Jose Jr. and Maria Paz. Both Aquino's parents came from prominent clans. Her father was a prominent Tarlac businessman and politician, and her grandfather, Melecio Cojuangco, was a member of the historic [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]]. Her mother belonged to the Sumulong family of [[Rizal province]] who were also politically influential; [[Juan Sumulong]], a prominent member of the clan, ran against [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="corazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coryaquino.ph/index.php/essential/article/4a66ceac-f098-11df-b3cf-001617d76479 |title=Essential Cory Aquino: The Young Cory  |accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Ninoy &amp; Cory Aquino Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young girl, Aquino spent her elementary school days at [[St. Scholastica's College Manila|St. Scholastica's College]] in Manila, where she graduated on top of her class as valedictorian. She transferred to [[Assumption College (Philippines)|Assumption Convent]] to pursue high school studies. Afterwards, she and her family went to the United States and attended the Assumption-run [[Ravenhill Academy]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1949, she graduated from [[Notre Dame School (Manhattan)|Notre Dame Convent School]] in New York. She then pursued her college education in the U.S. graduating from the [[College of Mount Saint Vincent]] in 1953 in New York, with a major in French and minor in mathematics. During her stay in the United States, Aquino volunteered for the campaign of U.S. [[Republican Party in the United States|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Thomas Dewey]] against then [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 U.S. Presidential Election]].&lt;ref name="corazon"/&gt;

After graduating from college, she returned to the Philippines and studied law at [[Far Eastern University]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="9facts"/&gt; She later met [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" S. Aquino Jr.]]—son of the late Speaker [[Benigno Aquino Sr.|Benigno S. Aquino Sr.]] and a grandson of General [[Servillano Aquino]]. She discontinued her law education and married Ninoy in Our Lady of Sorrows church in [[Pasay]] on October 11, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/08/01/14/throwback-how-ninoy-cory-got-engaged |title=Throwback: How Ninoy, Cory got engaged |work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]] |date=August 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple raised five children: Maria Elena ("Ballsy"; born 1954), Aurora Corazon ("Pinky"; born 1957), [[Benigno Aquino III|Benigno Simeon III]] ("Noynoy"; born 1960), Victoria Elisa ("Viel"; born 1961) and [[Kris Aquino|Kristina Bernadette]] ("Kris"; born 1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/37181-ninoy-children-bad-times-good-times |last=Tah |first=B. Allie |title=Ninoy's children remember bad times, good times |work=[[Rappler]] |date=August 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cory1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coryaquino.ph/index.php/essential/article/516835d2-f099-11df-b3cf-001617d76479 |title=Essential Cory Aquino: Her life with Ninoy Aquino |website=coryaquino.com.ph |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquino had initially had difficulty adjusting to provincial life when she and her husband moved to [[Concepcion, Tarlac]] in 1955. Aquino found herself bored in Concepcion, and welcomed the opportunity to have dinner with her husband inside the [[Clark Air Base|American military facility at nearby Clark Field]].&lt;ref name=lt&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorna Kalaw-Tirol|title=Public Faces, Private Lives|year=2000|publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc|location=Pasig City, Philippines|pages=2–23|isbn=971-27-0851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unknown to many, she voluntarily sold some of her prized inheritance to fund the candidacy of her husband. She led a modest existence in a bungalow in suburban Quezon City. A member of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], Aquino's husband Ninoy rose to become the youngest governor in the country and eventually became the youngest senator ever elected to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] in 1967. During her husband's political career, Aquino remained a housewife who helped raise their children and played hostess to her spouse's political allies who would frequent their Quezon City home.&lt;ref name=pi&gt;{{Cite news |author=Pico Iyer |title=Corazon Aquino |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1986.html |work=Time Magazine |date=1987-01-05 |accessdate=2008-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220000538/http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1986.html |archivedate=20 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; She would decline to join her husband on stage during campaign rallies, preferring instead to stand at the back of the audience and listen to him.&lt;ref name=lt/&gt;

Ninoy Aquino soon emerged as a leading critic of the government of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. He was then touted as a strong candidate for president to succeed Marcos in the 1973 elections. However, Marcos, being barred by the Constitution to seek a third term, declared [[martial law]] on September 21, 1972, and later abolished the existing [[Constitution of the Philippines#Commonwealth and Third Republic (1935)|1935 Constitution]], thereby allowing him to remain in office. As a consequence, her husband was among those to be first arrested at the onset of martial law, later being sentenced to death. During his incarceration, Ninoy sought strength from prayer, attending daily [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and saying the [[rosary]] three times a day. As a measure of sacrifice and solidarity with her husband and all other political prisoners, she enjoined her children from attending parties and she also stopped going to the [[beauty salon]] or buying new clothes until a priest advised her and her children to instead live as normal lives as possible.&lt;ref name=lt/&gt;

In 1978, despite her initial opposition, Aquino decided to run in the [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1978|1978 Batasang Pambansa elections]]. A reluctant speaker, Corazon Aquino campaigned on behalf of her husband, and for the first time in her life delivered a political speech. In 1980, upon the intervention of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]],&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; Marcos allowed Senator Aquino and his family to leave for exile in the United States, where he sought medical treatment.&lt;ref name=campaign&gt;{{cite news|title=Aquino's 'Flesh-to-Flesh Campaign'|author=Branigin, William|work=The Washington Post|date=1986-02-02|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family settled in [[Boston]], and Aquino would later call the next three years as the happiest days of her marriage and family life. On August 21, 1983, however, Ninoy ended his stay in the United States and returned without his family to the Philippines, only to be assassinated on a staircase leading to the tarmac of the Manila International Airport (now [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] or NAIA), which was later renamed in his honor (see [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.]]). Corazon Aquino returned to the Philippines a few days later and led her husband's funeral procession, in which more than two million people participated.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt;

==1986 Presidential campaign==
{{Main|Philippine presidential election, 1986}}
Following her husband's assassination in 1983, Aquino became active and visible in various demonstrations and protests held against the Marcos regime. She began to assume the mantle of leadership left by her husband Ninoy and started to become the symbolic figurehead of the anti-Marcos political opposition. In the last week of November 1985, Marcos surprised the nation by announcing on American television that he would hold a snap presidential election in February 1986, in order to dispel and remove doubts against his regime's legitimacy and authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Milt Freudenheim, Henry Giniger &amp; Richard Levine|title=Marcos Moves Toward A Vote|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/weekinreview/the-world-marcos-moves-toward-a-vote.html|work=New York Times|date=1985-11-17|accessdate=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially reluctant, Aquino was eventually prevailed upon to heed the people's clamor, after one million signatures urging her to run for president were presented to her. Despite this, [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization|United Opposition (UNIDO)]] leader Laurel, did not immediately give way to his close friend's widow. Salvador Laurel only gave way to Cory after a political deal which was later reneged by Cory after the election. According to Salvador Laurel's diary, Cory offered Laurel that he would be her Prime Minister, that she would step down in two years, that Laurel would name 30 percent of the Cabinet, that she would appoint the remaining 70 percent after close consultations with Laurel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com/category/diary-of-salvador-h-laurel/|title=Diary of Salvador H. Laurel - The Philippine Diary Project|website=philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salvador Laurel]] eventually ran as Cory Aquino's running mate for vice-president under the United Opposition (UNIDO) party. With that, the Aquino-Laurel tandem was formally launched to challenge Marcos and finally put an end to his two-decade rule.

In the subsequent political developments and events, given Ninoy's links with the Communist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ninoy linked up with the Left to aid presidential ambition|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/198820/news/specialreports/ninoy-networked-with-everyone-reds-included|newspaper=GMA News|date=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos charged that Aquino was being supported by [[Philippine Communist Party|communists]] and agreed to share power with them once elected into power. A political novice, Aquino categorically denied Marcos' charge and even stated that she would not appoint a single communist to her cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Milt Freudenheim &amp; Richard Levine|title=A Marcos Charge Irks Mrs. Aquino|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/weekinreview/the-world-a-marcos-charge-irks-mrs-aquino.html|work=New York Times|date=1986-01-12|accessdate=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Running on the offensive, the ailing Marcos also accused Aquino of playing "political football" with the United States with respect to the continued United States military presence in the Philippines at [[Clark Air Base]] and [[Subic Naval Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=United Press International|title= Marcos Says Rival Trifles With U.S. Bases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/31/world/around-the-world-marcos-says-rival-trifles-with-us-bases.html|work=New York Times|date=1985-12-31|accessdate=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the male strongman derided Aquino's womanhood, by saying that she was "just a woman" whose place was in the bedroom.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; In response to her opponent's [[sexism|sexist]] remark, and in reference to the fact that the ailing and feeble Marcos was increasingly seen as being largely a front man for his wife, [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]], Aquino simply remarked that "may the better woman win in this election". Marcos also attacked Aquino's inexperience and warned the country that it would be a disaster if a woman like her with no previous political experience was to be elected president, to which Aquino cleverly and sarcastically responded, admitting that she had "no experience in cheating, lying to the public, stealing government money, and killing political opponents".

The [[snap election]] called by Marcos which was held on February 7, 1986, was marred by massive electoral fraud, violence, intimidation, coercion and disenfranchisement of voters. Election Day proved to be bloody as one of Aquino's staunchest allies, former Antique province Governor [[Evelio Javier]], was brutally murdered, allegedly by some of Marcos' supporters in his province. Furthermore, during the counting and tallying of votes conducted by the [[Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC), 30 poll computer technicians walked out to dispute and contest the alleged election-rigging being done in favor of Marcos. However, not known to many, the walkout of computer technicians was led by Linda Kapunan,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/1990/10/03/the-final-report-of-the-fact-finding-commission-iv-military-intervention-in-the-philippines-1986-1987/&lt;/ref&gt; wife of Lt Col Eduardo Kapunan, a leader of [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]], which plotted to attack the [[Malacañang Palace]] and kill Marcos and his family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/84953-gringo-plot-kill-marcos-almonte-memoir|title=Gringo plotted to kill Marcos – Almonte|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading some to believe that the walkout could have been planned with ulterior motives.&lt;ref name="Manila Times"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manila Times|title='Setting the record straight on Edsa 1'|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/virtual-reality-by-tony-lopez/141677/setting-the-record-straight-on-edsa-1.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610115431/http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/virtual-reality-by-tony-lopez/141677/setting-the-record-straight-on-edsa-1.html|archivedate=10 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Batasang Pamabansa, which was dominated by Marcos' ruling party and its allies, declared President Marcos as the winner on February 15, 1986. In protest to the declaration of the Philippine parliament, Aquino called for a rally dubbed "Tagumpay ng Bayan" (People's Victory Rally) the following day, during which she claimed that she was the real winner in the snap election and urged Filipinos to boycott the products and services by companies controlled or owned by Marcos' cronies. The rally held at the historic Rizal Park in Luneta, Manila drew a mammoth-sized crowd, which sent a strong signal that Filipinos were quite tired of Marcos' two decades of rule and the lengths to which he would go to perpetuate it. Further, the dubious election results drew sharp reactions from both local quarters and foreign countries. The [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] (CBCP) issued a statement strongly criticizing the conduct of the election which was characterized by violence and fraud. The [[United States Senate]] likewise condemned the election.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Filipino coup leaders tell Marcos to go|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/22/newsid_2519000/2519155.stm|publisher=BBC|date=1986-02-22|accessdate=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquino rejected a power-sharing agreement proposed by the American diplomat [[Philip Habib]], who had been sent as an emissary by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] to help defuse the tension.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; On February 25, 1986 supporters of Aquino and Marcos celebrated the inauguration of their supported President.

===Accession as President===

On February 22, 1986, disgruntled and reformist military officers led by then-Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] and General [[Fidel V. Ramos]], surprised the entire nation and the international community when they announced their defection from the Marcos government, citing strong belief that Aquino was the real winner in the contested presidential elections. Enrile, Ramos, and the rebel soldiers then set up operations in [[Camp Aguinaldo]], the headquarters of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], and [[Camp Crame]] (headquarters of the [[Philippine Constabulary]]) across [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA). Cardinal Sin appealed to the public in a broadcast over Church-run [[Radio Veritas]], and millions of Filipinos trooped to the part of [[Epifanio De los Santos Avenue]] between the two camps to give their support and prayers for the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/579772/timeline-feb-22-1986-day-one |title=Timeline: Feb. 22, 1986, Day One |website=Inquirer.net |date=February 22, 2014 |accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Aquino was meditating in a [[Carmelite]] convent in [[Cebu]], and upon learning of the defection, she urged people to rally behind Minister Enrile and General Ramos. Aquino flew back to Manila to prepare for the takeover of the government, and after [[1986 People Power Revolution|three days of peaceful mass protests]], was sworn in as the eleventh President of the Philippines on February 25, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Crisostomo |first=Isabelo T. |publication-date=|title=Cory, Profile of a President: The Historic Rise to Power of Corazon. |publication-place= |publisher= Branden Books|isbn= 978-0-8283-1913-3|page=257 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Cory-Profile-President-Isabelo-Crisostomo/dp/0828319138 |accessdate= 2007-12-03 |date=1987-04-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The triumph of the peaceful People Power Revolution and the ascension of Corazon Aquino into power signaled the end of authoritarian rule in the Philippines and the dawning of a new era for Filipinos. The relatively peaceful manner by which Aquino came into power drew international acclaim and admiration not only for her but for the Filipino people, as well.

She was the first female president of the country and the only president with no political background. She is also regarded as the first [[List of elected and appointed female heads of state|female president]] in [[Asia]]. One of Aquino's first moves was the creation of the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG), which was tasked to go after the Marcos ill-gotten wealth.

===Constitutional and political reforms===

Immediately after assuming the presidency, President Aquino issued [[s:Constitution of the Philippines (1973)#1986 Amendment .28Proclamation No. 3 and the 1986 Provisional Constitution.29|Proclamation № 3]], which established a revolutionary government. She abolished the [[Constitution of the Philippines#The New Society and the Fourth Republic (1973)|1973 Constitution]] that was in force during [[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law]], and by decree issued the [[provisional constitution|provisional]] [[Constitution of the Philippines#"Freedom Constitution" (1986)|1986 Freedom Constitution]] pending the ratification of a more formal, comprehensive charter. This allowed her to exercise both executive and legislative powers until the ratification of the [[1987 Constitution]] and the restoration of Congress in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Joaquin G. Bernas]]|title=The Intent of the 1986 Constitution Writers|publisher=Rex Book Store|location=Manila, Philippines|year=1995|isbn=|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquino promulgated two landmark [[Philippine legal codes|legal codes]], namely, the [[Civil Code of the Philippines#The Family Code of 1987|Family Code of 1987]], which reformed the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] on family relations, and the [[Philippine legal codes#Administrative Code|Administrative Code of 1987]], which reorganized the structure of the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|executive branch of government]]. Another landmark law that was enacted during her tenure was the 1991 [[Philippine legal codes#Local Government Code|Local Government Code]], which devolved national government powers to local government units (LGUs). The new Code enhanced the power of LGUs to enact local taxation measures and assured them of a share in the national revenue. Aquino closed down the Marcos-dominated [[Batasang Pambansa]] to prevent the new Marcos loyalist opposition from undermining her democratic reforms and reorganized the membership of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] to restore its [[Judicial independence|independence]].

In May 1986, the reorganized Supreme Court declared the Aquino government as "not merely a ''[[de facto]]'' government but in fact and law a ''[[de jure]]'' government", whose legitimacy had been affirmed by the community of nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Lawyers League v. President Aquino, G.R. No. 73748|court=Supreme Court of the Philippines|date=1986-05-22|url=http://elibrary.supremecourt.gov.ph/resolutions.php?doctype=Minute%20Resolutions&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd645abb094dee22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Supreme Court decision affirmed the status of Aquino as the rightful leader of the Philippines. To fast-track the restoration of a full constitutional government and the writing of a new charter, she appointed 48 members of the 1986 Constitutional Commission ("Con-Com"), led by retired activist Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Cecilia Muñoz-Palma]]. The Con-Com completed its final draft in October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Bernas, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2, 1987, the new [[Constitution of the Philippines]], which put strong emphasis on civil liberties, human rights and social justice, was overwhelmingly approved by the Filipino people. The ratification of the new Constitution was followed by the election of senators and congress that same year and the holding of local elections in 1988.

====Economic management====
As soon as she assumed the presidency of the Philippines, Aquino moved quickly to tackle the issue of the [[United States dollar|US$]]28 billion-foreign debt incurred by her predecessor, which has badly tarnished the international credit standing and economic reputation of the country. After weighing all possible options such as choosing not to pay, Aquino eventually chose to honor all the debts that were previously incurred in order to clear the country's image. Her decision proved to be unpopular but Aquino defended that it was the most practical move. It was crucial for the country at that time to regain the investors' confidence in the Philippine economy. Beginning in 1986, the Aquino administration paid off $4 billion of the country's outstanding debts to regain good international credit ratings and attract the attention of future markets. Although it borrowed an additional $9 billion, increasing the net national debt by $5 billion within six years after the ouster of former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Manila Plan To Cut Debt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/21/business/manila-plan-to-cut-debt.html|accessdate=2010-02-27|date=1992-02-21|work=[[The New York Times]]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the need to infuse capital and money into the economy, the Aquino administration succeeded in wrangling lower interest rates and longer payment terms in settling the country's debts. From 87.9 percent when it inherited the foreign debt from the Marcos regime, the Cory Aquino administration was able to reduce by 30.1 percent the Philippines' external [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] to 67.8 percent in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/ThePresidentReport.pdf |title=The Aquino Management of the Presidency |website=malacanang.gov.ph |accessdate=August 25, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083529/http://malacanang.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/ThePresidentReport.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, recognizing how [[crony capitalism]] weakened the economy due to collusion between government and big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of [[Subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], President Aquino set out on a course of market liberalization agenda while at the same time emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through [[privatization]] of bad government assets and [[deregulation]] of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the [[cartel]]s, [[monopoly|monopolies]] and [[oligopoly|oligopolies]] of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.

The economy posted a positive growth of 3.4% during her first year in office. But in the aftermath of the [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|1989 coup attempt]] by the rightist [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]], international confidence in the Philippine economy was seriously damaged. During her presidency, Aquino made fighting inflation one of her priorities, after reeling from skyrocketing prices during the Martial Law years, in which at one point inflation reached 50.3 percent in 1984. Although inflation peaked at 18.1 percent during the 1991 [[Gulf War]], which caused panic among Filipinos who have many family members working in the Middle East, inflation during Aquino's time averaged 9.6 percent from 1986 to 1992, which was way lower than the average 20.9 percent-inflation rate that was recorded during the last 6 years of the Marcos dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Her Term About to End, Aquino 'Hasn't Made Much Difference' to the Poor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/08/world/her-term-about-to-end-aquino-hasn-t-made-much-difference-to-the-poor.html|accessdate=2010-02-27|first=DE|last=Sanger|date=1992-06-08|work=[[The New York Times]]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bles.dole.gov.ph/PUBLICATIONS/Yearbook%20of%20Labor%20Statistics/STATISTICAL%20TABLES/PDF/CHAPTER%2011/Tab11.2.pdf ''Year of Labor Statistics'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the economy under Aquino had an average growth of 3.8% from 1986 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Philippines-OVERVIEW-OF-ECONOMY.html|title=Philippines Overview of economy, Information about Overview of economy in Philippines|publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after taking office, Aquino declared that the presence of U.S. military forces in the Philippines was an affront to national sovereignty. She ordered the United States military to vacate [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]] and [[Clark Air Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/28/world/philippines-orders-us-to-leave-strategic-navy-base-at-subic-bay.html |last=Sanger |first=David E. |title=Philippines Orders U.S. to Leave Strategic Navy Base at Subic Bay |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 28, 1991 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States objected, pointing that they had leased the property and the leases were still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2004 p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Also, thousands of Filipinos worked at these military facilities and they would lose their jobs and the Filipino economy would suffer if the U.S. military moved out. The United States stated that the facilities at [[Subic Bay]] were unequaled anywhere in [[Southeast Asia]] and a U.S. pullout could make all of that region of the world vulnerable to an incursion by the Soviet Union or by a resurgent Japan. She refused to back down and insisted that the United States get out. The matter was still being debated when [[Mount Pinatubo]] erupted in June 1991, covering the entire area with [[volcanic ash]]. The destruction to the bases was so severe that the United States decided that it would best to pull out after all, so the bases were closed and the United States departed.

====Agrarian reform====
{{See also|Land reform in the Philippines}}

President Aquino envisioned agrarian and land reform as the centerpiece of her administration's social legislative agenda. However, her family background and social class as a privileged daughter of a wealthy and landed clan became a lightning rod of criticisms against her land reform agenda. On February 22, 1987, three weeks after the resounding ratification of the 1987 Constitution, agrarian workers and farmers marched to the historic Mendiola Street near the [[Malacañan Palace]] to demand genuine land reform from Aquino's administration. However, the march turned violent when Marine forces fired at farmers who tried to go beyond the designated demarcation line set by the police. As a result, at least 12 were killed and 51 protesters were injured&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1993/mar1993/gr_84607_1993.html|title=Supreme Court G.R. No. 84607|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lawphil.net|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this incident now known as the [[Mendiola Massacre]]. This incident led some prominent members of the Aquino Cabinet to resign their government posts.

In response to calls for agrarian reform, President Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229 on July 22, 1987, which outlined her land reform program, which included sugar lands. In 1988, with the backing of Aquino, the new [[Congress of the Philippines]] passed [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act]] No. 6657, more popularly known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law". The law paved the way for the redistribution of agricultural lands to tenant-farmers from landowners, who were paid in exchange by the government through [[just compensation]] but were also allowed to retain not more than five hectares of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html |title=Section 6, Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2010-03-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823212620/http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html |archivedate=23 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, corporate landowners were also allowed under the law to "voluntarily divest a proportion of their [[stock|capital stock]], equity or participation in favor of their workers or other qualified beneficiaries", in lieu of turning over their land to the government for redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html |title=Section 31, Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2010-03-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823212620/http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html |archivedate=23 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the flaws in the law, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 1989, declaring that the implementation of the comprehensive agrarian reform program (CARP) provided by the said law, was "a revolutionary kind of expropriation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Association of Small Landowners v. Luz|vol=175|reporter=SCRA|opinion=343|pinpoint=386|court=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]|date=1989-07-14|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1989/jul1989/gr_78742_1989.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the implementation of CARP, Aquino was not spared from the controversies that eventually centered on [[Hacienda Luisita]], a 6,453-hectare estate located in the Province of [[Tarlac]], which she, together with her siblings inherited from her father [[Jose Cojuangco]] (Don Pepe).&lt;ref name=pdihl&gt;{{cite news |author=Russell Arador |title=Life once 'sweeter' at Hacienda Luisita |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=64019 |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2008-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005095533/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=64019 |archivedate=5 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argued that Aquino bowed to pressure from relatives by allowing stock redistribution under Executive Order 229. Instead of land distribution, Hacienda Luisita reorganized itself into a corporation and distributed stock. As such, ownership of agricultural portions of the hacienda were transferred to the corporation, which in turn, gave its shares of stocks to farmers.&lt;ref name=pdihl/&gt;

The arrangement remained in force until 2006, when the [[Department of Agrarian Reform (Philippines)|Department of Agrarian Reform]] revoked the stock distribution scheme adopted in Hacienda Luisita, and ordered instead the redistribution of a large portion of the property to the tenant-farmers. The Department stepped into the controversy when in 2004, violence erupted over the retrenchment of workers in the Hacienda, eventually leaving seven people dead.&lt;ref name=pdihl/&gt;

===Natural disasters and calamities===
During her last two years in office, President Aquino's administration faced series of natural disasters and calamities. Among these were the [[1990 Luzon earthquake]], which left around 1,600 people dead and the 1991 volcanic eruption of what was then thought to be a dormant [[Mount Pinatubo]], which was the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century, killing around 300 people and causing widespread long-term devastation of agricultural lands in [[Central Luzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Cataclysmic 1991 Eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1997/fs113-97|accessdate=2008-03-22|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 1991 [[Tropical Storm Thelma]] (also known as Typhoon Uring) caused massive flooding in [[Ormoc City]], leaving around 5,000 dead in what was then considered to be the deadliest typhoon in Philippine history. On November 8, Aquino declared all of [[Leyte]] a [[disaster area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|newspaper=The Vindicator|date=November 9, 1991|accessdate=May 7, 2013|title=The Philippines: Search continues for bodies of victims|page=A3|location=Manila, Philippines|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CedYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dIUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1325%2C4260781}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 20, 1987, the [[MV Doña Paz|MV ''Doña Paz'']] sank which ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and others have dubbed as "the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster of the 20th century",&lt;ref name=Hooke/&gt; given the death toll which were initially estimated to be around 1,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Omar Acosta |author2=Dave Veridiano |author3=Gerry Lirio  |last-author-amp=yes |title=238 Bodies Washed Ashore in Mindoro |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=1987-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which later grew for at least 3,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=3,159 people were on ‘Dona Paz’|publisher=Lloyd’s List|date=1988-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally exceeded about 4,300.&lt;ref name=Hooke&gt;Hooke, Norman. ''Maritime Casualties, 1963-1996''. Lloyd’s of London Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Aquino described the aftermath as "a national tragedy of harrowing proportions...[the Filipino people's] sadness is all the more painful because the tragedy struck with the approach of [[Christmas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barbara Crosette |title=It's Gloom And Glitter For Manila |date=1987-12-23 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/23/world/it-s-gloom-and-glitter-for-manila.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2008-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical power grid inadequacy===
During Aquino's presidency, electric [[power outage|blackouts]] became common in Manila. The capital experienced blackouts lasting 7–12 hours, bringing numerous businesses to a halt. By the departure of Aquino in June 1992, businesses in Manila and nearby provinces had lost nearly $800 million since the preceding March.

Corazon Aquino's decision to mothball the Bataan Nuclear Plant built during the Marcos administration contributed to the power crisis in the 1990s, as the 620 megawatts capacity of the plant was enough to cover the shortfall at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brownouts Darken Outlook for Aquino : Philippines: Power outages cripple industry and snarl traffic.

===Controversies and Cabinet Infighting===
When 15 farmers staging a peaceful rally in Mendiola were gunned down by the military under Aquino on January 22, 1987 during the [[Mendiola Massacre]], [[Jose Diokno]], head of the Presidential Committee on Human Rights and chairman of the government panel in charge of negotiations with rebel forces resigned from his two government posts in deep disgust and great sadness. His daughter Maris said, "It was the only time we saw him near tears.”&lt;ref name=dalisaybio&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalisay|first=Jose Jr.|authorlink=|title=Jose W. Diokno: The Scholar-Warrior|work=|publisher=|date=|url=http://diokno.org/about|format=|doi=|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1987, Vice President Doy Laurel resigned as Cory's Secretary of Foreign Affairs. In his letter to Cory, he said: "the past years of Marcos are now beginning to look no worse than your first two years in office. And the reported controversies and scandals involving your closest relatives have become the object of our people’s outrage. From 16,500 NPA regular when Marcos fell, the communists now claim an armed strength of 25,200. From city to countryside, anarchy has spread. There is anarchy within the government, anarchy within the ruling coalesced parties, and anarchy in the streets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/back-channel-by-alejandro-del-rosario/140961/doy-laurel-s-letter-to-cory-aquino.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927015810/http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/back-channel-by-alejandro-del-rosario/140961/doy-laurel-s-letter-to-cory-aquino.html |archivedate=27 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence in 1992 presidential campaign===
[[File:Corazon Aquino 1992.jpg|thumb|left|President Corazon Aquino addresses base workers at a rally at Remy Field concerning jobs for Filipino workers after the Americans withdraw from the U.S. facilities]]

In part due to Marcos' excesses, the framers of the 1987 Constitution limited the president to a single six-year term, with no possibility of re-election. As the end of her presidency drew near, close advisers and friends told Aquino that since she was not inaugurated under the 1987 Constitution, she was still eligible to seek the presidency again in the upcoming [[Philippine presidential election, 1992|1992 elections]], the first presidential elections held under normal and peaceful circumstances since 1965. However, Aquino strongly declined the requests for her to seek reelection and wanted to set an example to both citizens and politicians that the presidency was not a lifetime position.

Initially, she named [[Ramon V. Mitra]], a friend of her husband Ninoy and then Speaker of the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], as her candidate for the presidential race in 1992. However, she later on backtracked and instead threw her support behind the candidacy of her defense secretary and EDSA Revolution hero, General Fidel V. Ramos, who constantly stood by and defended her government from the various coup attempts and rebellions that were launched against her. Her sudden change of mind and withdrawal of support from Mitra drew criticism not only from her supporters in the liberal and [[social democratic]] sectors but also from the Roman Catholic Church, which questioned her anointing of Ramos since the latter was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. Nevertheless, Aquino's candidate eventually won the 1992 elections, albeit with only 23.58% of the total votes in a wide-open campaign, and was sworn in as the 12th President of the Philippines on June 30, 1992.

==Post-presidency and continued political activism==
[[File:Aquino 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Mrs. Aquino speaking before the 2003 Ninoy Aquino Award ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Manila.]]

===Activities and drives===

====Political causes====
On June 30, 1992, President Aquino formally and peacefully handed over power to Ramos, after six years of hard-fought democratic transition and restoration. After the inauguration of the new President, Aquino chose to leave by riding in a simple white [[Toyota Crown]] she had purchased, rather than the lavish government-issued [[Mercedes Benz]] which she and Ramos had ridden in on the way to the ceremonies, to make the point that she was once again an ordinary citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sandra|last=Burton|title=Time 100: Corazon Aquino|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/aquino1.html|work=Time Magazine|date=August 23–30, 1999|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Aquino retired to private life following the end of her term she remained active in the Philippine political scene, constantly voicing opposition and dissent to government actions and policies, which she deemed as threats to the liberal traditions and democratic foundations of the country. In 1997, Aquino, together with Cardinal [[Jaime Sin]], led a huge rally which succeeded in thwarting then President Fidel Ramos' attempt to extend his term by amending the 1987 Constitution's restriction on presidential term limits. In 1998, Aquino endorsed the candidacy of former police general and Manila Mayor [[Alfredo Lim]] for president. Lim, however, lost to then Vice-President [[Joseph Estrada]], who won by a landslide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lozada misses Cory Aquino in Navotas Mass|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/86302/Lozada-misses-Cory-Aquino-in-Navotas-Mass|publisher=GMA News.TV|date=2008-03-26|accessdate=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Aquino again with Cardinal Sin successfully opposed President Estrada's plan to amend the Constitution, which he said was intended to lift provisions that 'restrict' economic activities and investments; he denied that it was another ploy for him to extend his stay in office.

In 2000, Aquino joined the mounting calls for Estrada to resign from office, amid strong allegations of bribery charges and gambling kickbacks and a series of corruption scandals, which eventually led to his unsuccessful impeachment in December of that year. In her Preface to [[Frank-Jürgen Richter]] and Pamela Mar's book ''Asia's New Crisis'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank-Jürgen Richter]], Pamela Mar: ''Asia's New Crisis'', John Wiley &amp; Sons Singapore, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; she decries that the unique Asian way of doing business has given rise to much crony capitalism and opacity in Asia, including the Philippines. In January 2001, during the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]] which ousted Estrada, Aquino enthusiastically supported the ascendancy of another woman, then Vice-President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Landler|title=In Philippines, The Economy As Casualty; The ped, a Credibility Repair Job|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/09/business/philippines-economy-casualty-president-ousted-credibility-repair-job.html|work=New York Times|date=2001-02-09|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, after a series of revelations and exposes alleged and implicated President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] in [[2005 Philippine electoral crisis|rigging]] the [[Philippine general election, 2004|2004 presidential elections]], Aquino called on Macapagal-Arroyo to resign in order to prevent bloodshed, violence and further political deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carlos H. Conde|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/09/international/asia/09filip.html|title=Allies of Philippine President Call on Her to Step Down|work=New York Times|date=2005-07-09|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquino was once again in the streets leading massive demonstrations demanding the resignation of President Arroyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carlos H.

In the [[Philippine general election, 2007|2007 senatorial elections]], Aquino actively campaigned for the senatorial bid of her only son, [[Benigno Aquino III|Noynoy Aquino]], who ran successfully. In December 2008, Corazon Aquino publicly expressed regret for her participation in the EDSA Revolution of 2001, which installed Arroyo into power. She apologized to former President Joseph Estrada for the role she played in his ouster in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aquino says sorry to Estrada; concedes EDSA II was a mistake|author=Leah Salaverria|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081223-179471/Aquino-says-sorry-to-Estrada|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=2008-12-23|accessdate=2008-12-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108152044/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081223-179471/Aquino-says-sorry-to-Estrada|archivedate=8 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this action, many politicians criticized Aquino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cory apologizes for EDSA 2, gets flak|url=http://angperyodiko.net/home/?p=9|accessdate=2010-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723013602/http://angperyodiko.net/home/?p=9|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, two months before her death, Aquino issued a public statement which strongly denounced and condemned the Arroyo administration's plan of amending the 1987 Constitution, calling such attempt as a "shameless abuse of power."

====International engagements====
Shortly after leaving the presidency, Aquino traveled abroad, giving speeches and lectures on issues of democracy, development, human rights and women empowerment. In 1997, Aquino attended the wake and funeral of Saint [[Mother Teresa of Calcutta]], whom she met during the latter's visit in Manila in 1989. In the 2000s (decade), Aquino joined various global leaders and democratic icons in urging the Government of [[Burma]] to unconditionally release Burmese democratic leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] from detention, whom she delivered a speech on behalf in the 1994 meeting of the [[UNESCO]] World Commission on Culture and Development in Manila. In 2005, Aquino joined the international community in mourning the death of [[Pope John Paul II]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

====Charitable and social initiatives====
Aside from being visible in various political gatherings and demonstrations, Aquino was heavily involved in several charitable activities and socio-economic initiatives. From 1992 until her death, Aquino was chairperson of the Benigno S. Aquino, Jr. Foundation which she set up in her husband's honor right after his brutal assassination in 1983. Further, she supported other causes such as the [[Gawad Kalinga]] social housing project for the poor and homeless. In 2007, Aquino helped establish the PinoyME Foundation, a non-profit organization which aims to provide microfinancing programs and projects for the poor. She was also a lifelong member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international organization of former and current female heads of state and government. She also studied painting, and would occasionally give away her paintings to friends and family. In some events, Aquino auctioned her painting and gave all of the money to charity. She never sold her art for her own profit.&lt;ref name="RCATA"/&gt;

==Illness and death==

On March 24, 2008, Aquino's family announced that the former President had been diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]]. Upon her being earlier informed by her doctors that she had only three months to live,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Maila Ager|title=Aquino blood pressure fluctuating – family|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090728-217645/Aquino-blood-pressure-fluctuating--family|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=2009-07-28|accessdate=2009-07-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729212054/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090728-217645/Aquino-blood-pressure-fluctuating--family|archivedate=29 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; she pursued medical treatment and [[chemotherapy]]. A series of healing [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es for Aquino (a devout Catholic) were held throughout the country intended for her recovery. In a public statement during one healing Mass on May 13, 2008, Aquino said that her blood tests indicated that she was responding well to treatment; her hair and appetite loss were apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Abigail Kwok|title=Aquino: 'My body is responding positively to the treatment'|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080513-136351/Aquino-My-body-is-responding-positively-to-the-treatment|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=2008-05-13|accessdate=2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon learning of Aquino's death, then incumbent President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], who was then on a state visit to the United States, announced a 10-day mourning period for the former President and issued Administrative Order No. 269 detailing the necessary arrangements for a [[state funeral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palace declares week of mourning on the passing of Cory|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/168753/Palace-declares-week-of-mourning-on-passing-of-Cory|work=GMANews.tv|accessdate=2009-08-01|date=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquino's children, however, declined the government's offer of a state funeral for their mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noel Orsal &amp; Paul Mata|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/22688/Kris-Aquino-explains-why-family-chose-not-to-have-state-funeral-for-former-President-Corazon-Aquino|title=Kris Aquino explains why family chose not to have state funeral for former President Corazon Aquino|publisher=Pep.ph|accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All churches in the Philippines celebrated requiem masses simultaneously throughout the country and all government offices flew the Philippine flag at half mast. Hours after her death, Aquino's body [[lay in repose]] for public viewing at the [[La Salle Green Hills]] campus in [[Mandaluyong City]]. On August 3, 2009, Aquino's body was transferred from La Salle Greenhills to [[Manila Cathedral]] in [[Intramuros]], during which hundreds of thousands of Filipinos lined the streets to view and escort the former leader's body. On the way to the Cathedral, Aquino's funeral cortege passed along [[Ayala Avenue]] in Makati, stopping in front of the monument to her husband Ninoy, where throngs of mourners gathered and sang the patriotic protest anthem "''[[Bayan Ko]]''{{-"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abs-cbnnews.com/nation/08/03/09/120000-show-cory|title=120,000 Show up for Cory|publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com|accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquino's casket was solemnly brought inside the Cathedral by mid-afternoon that day.

On August 4, 2009, [[Bongbong Marcos|Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, Jr.]], and [[Imee Marcos]]—children of the late former President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]—paid their last respects to Aquino despite the two families' fierce political rivalry; the Aquinos have been blaming the late dictator for [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.|the assassination]] of [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Ninoy Aquino Jr.]] in 1983. The Marcos siblings were received by Aquino's daughters María Elena, Aurora Corazon, and Victoria Elisa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marcos children pay last respects to Aquino |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090804-218722/Marcos-children-pay-last-respects-to-Aquino |work=INQUIRER.net|accessdate=2009-08-04|date=2009-08-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805201342/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090804-218722/Marcos-children-pay-last-respects-to-Aquino|archivedate=5 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early the next day, President Arroyo, who had cut short her trip in the United States, briefly paid her last respects to her erstwhile ally President Aquino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090805-218816/Arroyo-pays-last-respects-to-Aquino|title=Arroyo pays last respects to Aquino|author=Veronica Uy, Kristine L.

Aquino's flag-draped casket was escorted from the Cathedral to Manila Memorial Park in [[Parañaque]], where she was interred beside her husband in the family mausoleum. Aquino's funeral procession took more than eight hours to reach the burial site, as tens of thousands of civilians lined the route to pay their respects. [[Philippine Air Force]] [[UH-1]] helicopters showered the procession with yellow confetti and ships docked at Manila's harbour blared their sirens, all to salute the late President, .

===Reaction===
Both local and international leaders showed respect for Aquino's achievements in the process of democratization in the Philippines.

====Local reaction====

Various politicians across the political spectrum expressed their grief and praise for the former Philippine leader. President Arroyo, once an ally of Aquino, remembered the sacrifices she made for the country and called her a "national treasure."&lt;ref name="AgerInquirer2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/coryaquino/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090801-218238|title=Arroyo orders 10 days of mourning|last=Cabacungan, Jr.|first=Gil|date=2009-08-01|publisher=INQUIRER.net|accessdate=2009-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810212450/http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/coryaquino/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090801-218238|archivedate=10 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President Estrada said that the country had lost its mother and guiding voice with her sudden death.

Former Senate President [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Aquino's defense minister and later fierce critic, asked the public to pray for her eternal repose. Although former Aquino interior minister and Senate Minority floor leader [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]], revealed that he had "mixed feelings" about Aquino's death, he also said that the country "shall be forever indebted to Cory for rallying the nation behind the campaign to topple dictatorial rule and restore democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senators remember Cory's greatness|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/168760/Senators-remember-Corys-greatness|work=GMANews.tv|accessdate=2009-08-01|date=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary Filipinos throughout the country wore either yellow shirts or held masses for Aquino as their way of paying tribute to the woman who once led them in a revolution that changed the course of their country's history. Yellow Ribbons, which were once used during Aquino's battle with Marcos, were tied along major national roads and streets as a sign of solidarity and support for the now deceased Aquino and her grieving family. In popular social networking sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], Filipinos posted yellow ribbons in their accounts as a tribute to the former Philippine leader. Following her death, Filipino Catholics called on the Church to have Aquino canonized and declared as a [[saint]]. During her lifetime, Aquino was known and praised for her strong spirituality and sincere devotion to the Catholic faith. Days after her funeral, the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (BSP) announced that it supported calls to put the former President on the 500-Peso banknote alongside her husband, Ninoy Aquino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BSP backs adding Cory image to P500 bill|url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view/20090806-219048/BSP-backs-adding-Cory-image-to-P500-bill|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=2009-08-06|date=2009-08-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808203647/http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view/20090806-219048/BSP-backs-adding-Cory-image-to-P500-bill|archivedate=8 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International reaction====
Across the globe, messages of sympathy and solidarity with the Filipino people were sent by various heads of state and international leaders. Pope [[Benedict XVI]], in his letter to Archbishop Rosales, recalled Aquino's "courageous commitment to the freedom of the Filipino people, her firm rejection of violence and intolerance" and called her a woman of courage and faith. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], through White House Press Secretary [[Robert Gibbs]], said that "her courage, determination, and moral leadership are an inspiration to us all and exemplify the best in the Filipino nation". U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] expressed sadness over the passing of Aquino, to whom she had sent a personal letter of best wishes for recovery while she was still in hospital in July 2009. Clinton said that Aquino was "admired by the world for her extraordinary courage" in leading the fight against dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World mourns Aquino's death|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090801-218251/World-mourns-Aquinos-death|work=INQUIRER.net|accessdate=2009-08-01|date=2009-08-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804033534/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090801-218251/World-mourns-Aquinos-death|archivedate=4 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, South Africa President [[Jacob Zuma]] called Aquino "a great leader who set a shining example of peaceful transition to democracy in her country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aquino mourned at wake by thousands of Filipinos |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hgwQ8MfOS2fuOym9WcK126G9-UQgD99QM71O0 |last=Gomez |first=Jim |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Google News]] |accessdate=2009-08-04 |date=2009-08-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5imI9aEUA?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hgwQ8MfOS2fuOym9WcK126G9-UQgD99QM71O0 |archivedate=4 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom, through the British Ambassador in Manila, sent a message to the Filipino people which read: "I am saddened to hear of the death of Corazon 'Cory' Aquino the former President of the Republic of the Philippines". She also added, "I send my sincere condolences to her family and to the people of the Philippines. Signed, Elizabeth R".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/08/06/09/british-queen-saddened-death-rps-true-queen|title=British Queen saddened with death of RP's 'true queen'|date=2008-08-06|newspaper=ABS-CBN News|accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]], in a telegram to President Arroyo, said that "the name of Corazon Aquino is associated with a period of profound reforms and the democratic transformation of Filipino society". Medvedev also lauded Aquino's sympathy to Russian people and her contribution to the improvement of [[Philippines–Russia relations|Russian-Filipino relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/news/2009/08/220411.shtml|title=Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences to President of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo following the passing of former President of the Republic Corazon Aquino.|date=August 1, 2009|publisher=[[Presidential Press and Information Office]]|accessdate=2009-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807055946/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/news/2009/08/220411.shtml|archivedate=7 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, global democratic icons such as [[Timor-Leste]] President [[José Ramos-Horta]] and [[Wan Azizah]], wife of Malaysian opposition leader [[Anwar Ibrahim]], came to the Philippines not just to express their sympathies but to attend their friend Aquino's death and funeral, as well.

After her release from imprisonment for almost 20 years, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], Burma's democratic opposition leader, publicly stated that Aquino is one of her inspirations as she continues to champion the cause of democracy in [[Myanmar]]. She has also expressed her good wishes for Aquino's son, then incumbent Philippine president [[Benigno S. Aquino III]].

''[[Foreign Policy]]'' listed Corazon Aquino, along with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], and [[Sari Nusseibeh]], as people who "never won the [[Nobel Prize]], but should have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Kenner |title=Nobel Peace Prize Also-Rans |date=7 October 2009 |publisher=The Washington Post Company |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/07/nobel_peace_prize_also_rans |work=Foreign Policy |pages=1–7 |accessdate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125073527/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/07/nobel_peace_prize_also_rans |archivedate=25 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Corazon Aquino ended her term in 1992 with the country reeling under severe power shortage crisis. It was the offshoot of her administration's failure to provide replacement for the more than 600-MW of electricity foregone with the government's decision to mothball the Bataan nuclear power plant (BNPP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2014/09/19/1370749/legacy-darkness|title=A legacy of darkness|first=Marichu A.|last=Villanueva|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the guiding light of the People Power Revolution, Corazon Aquino is fondly remembered and deeply revered by most Filipinos as the "mother of Philippine democracy",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/filipinos-mourn-mother-of-democracy-cory-aquino/ |author=Barnaby Lo |website=[[CBS News]] |title=Filipinos Mourn "Mother of Democracy" Cory Aquino |date=August 5, 2009 |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "housewife who led a revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=8 FACTS ABOUT PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT CORAZON AQUINO |author=Linnea Crowther |website=Legacy |url=http://www.legacy.com/news/celebrity-deaths/article/the-housewife-who-led-a-revolution |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been hailed by [[American people|American]] columnist [[Georgie Anne Geyer]] as a modern-day [[Joan of Arc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Philippines' Joan of Arc |author= Georgie Anne Geyer| periodical=[[Gettysburg Times]] |date=September 4, 1986 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19860924&amp;id=VMIlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aPwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2771,4205559 |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the accolades she has received for assuming the mantle of leadership of the democratic struggle against the Marcos dictatorship, Aquino has always stated that it was actually the Filipino people, not her, who restored democracy in the Philippines and maintained that she was only an instrument.

To preserve and celebrate her legacy, various types of commemorations and memorials in honor of President Aquino were made. Among these are as follow:

*On February 3, 2010, Grand Prize winner Julian Eymard Paguiligan of [[Bulacan State University]]'s College of Architecture and Fine Arts (CAFA) made his painting entry entitled ''Ika-25 ng Pebrero, 1986'' presented in the last year's 24th Visual Arts National Competition for the Directories Philippines Corporation's directory cover as a paid tribute. He made a portrait of the late President Aquino in 27.5x34.25" [[watercolor]] on paper, as a symbol for her contribution not only for [[democracy]], but also in the successes of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/547206/images-tita-cory |last=Yuson |first=Alfred A. |title=Images of Tita Cory |website=Philstar.com |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 1, 2010, the first anniversary of her death, a 200x250 wide [[Photographic mosaic|photo mosaic]] of Aquino was unveiled near the Quirino Grandstand at the [[Luneta Park]] in the presence of her son, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] and her supporters. It has been submitted to the Guinness World Records to be certified as the largest photo mosaic in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/197469/news/nation/despite-rains-noynoy-leads-unfurling-of-giant-photo-mosaic-for-cory |last=Merueñas |first=Mark |title=Despite rains, Noynoy leads unfurling of giant photo mosaic for Cory |website=GMA News |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On December 16, 2010, President Benigno Aquino III and the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (Central Bank of the Philippines) announced the release of new 500-peso bank notes and unveiled their new design, which features both the late Senator [[Benigno Aquino Jr|Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr.]] and Corazon Aquino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/208501/money/cory-ninoy-together-again-on-new-500-peso-bill |last=Sisante |first=Jam |title=Cory, Ninoy together again on new 500-peso bill |website=GMA News |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dan Billany''' (14 November 1913 – disappeared 20 November 1943) was an English [[novelist]].

==Biography==
Billany was born and raised in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].&lt;ref name=hullweb&gt;{{cite web|title=Dan Billany - Hull's Lost Hero|url=http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/l-20c/people/dan-billany/dan-billany.htm|website=Hullwebs}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Labour League of Youth]] and later the Hull Branch of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]], but was expelled from the latter in 1933 for his involvement in an internal dispute. He later joined the [[National Unemployed Workers' Movement]].

Billany received a degree in [[English studies|English]] from the [[University College of Hull]] in 1937. His career in teaching was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War II]]; Billany joined the army in 1940 and became an officer as lieutenant in the 4th battalion of the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]].&lt;ref name=cwgc&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/206920/BILLANY,%20DAN CWGC casualty record, Cassino Memorial].&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured by the Germans and spent June 1942 through September 1943 as a [[prisoner of war]] in Italy.&lt;ref name=hullweb /&gt;

Throughout the war off duty, Billany concentrated on his writing. ''[[The Opera House Murders]]'', a thriller, and ''[[The Magic Door]]'', a book for boys, were published in 1940 and 1943, respectively. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Billany fled to the countryside with his manuscripts, working on them for weeks while hiding from the German army. He deposited them with a friendly local who promised to post them to Britain at the conclusion of the war. These manuscripts, ''The Cage'' and ''The Trap'', were received by Billany's family in 1946 and eventually published to wide acclaim. In ''Dockers and Detectives'', [[Ken Worpole]] lauded ''The Trap'' as "the finest novel to come out of the war".

==Disappearance==
In October 1943, Billany and three friends began to make their way over the [[Apennines]] towards the Allied forces. They were last seen in [[Capistrello]] on 20 November 1943, and presumably died in the mountains a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dan Billany|url=http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biob3/billan01.html|website=andrejkoymasky.com|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=March 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Dan Billany is listed on the [[Commonwealth War Grave Commission]]'s [[Cassino War Cemetery|Cassino Memorial]], to Commonwealth military personnel who have no known [[grave]], as having died on 1 January 1944.&lt;ref name=cwgc/&gt;

'''David Edward''' "'''Puck'''" '''Rainey''' (born 1968) is an American [[reality television]] personality who first gained fame as a cast member on ''[[The Real World: San Francisco]]'' in 1994. A [[bicycle messenger]] during the show's shooting, he became notorious as the second ''Real World'' cast member ever to be evicted from the house, due to his increasingly antagonistic relationship with his housemates, most notably with [[Pedro Zamora]], an HIV-positive [[AIDS]] educator. Rainey's conflict with Zamora is credited with helping make ''The Real World'' a hit show, for which ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' ranked it #7 on their list of ''32 Epic Moments in Reality-TV History''.&lt;ref&gt;Webley, Kayla. [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2063886_2063809_2063821,00.html "32 Epic Moments in Reality-TV History: 7. The Real World: Puck vs. Pedro"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Retrieved April 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' included him in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;Bretts, Bruce; Roush, Matt; (March 25, 2013). "Baddies to the Bone: The 60 nastiest villains of all time". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rainey was born and raised in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/shows/realworld-season3/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=1018 The Real World: San Francisco: Cast: Puck]. MTV. 1994. Retrieved March 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He has characterized his mother as a "[[hippie]]".&lt;ref name=MTVNews2013&gt;Montgomery, James; White Wolf, Vanessa (March 22, 2013).

[[MTV News]].&lt;/ref&gt; He and his sister are of partial [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent through their grandfather.&lt;ref name=collision&gt;''The Real World Diaries''. pp. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Collision Course|series=The Real World: San Francisco|network=MTV|season=3|number=9|airdate=August 25, 1994|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/357834/the-odd-couple.jhtml#id=1607559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Real World''==
Rainey was a cast member on the MTV reality TV series ''[[The Real World: San Francisco]]'' in 1994.   He and his castmates moved into the house at 953 [[Lombard Street, San Francisco|Lombard Street]] on [[Russian Hill]] on February 12 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Winick, Judd]]. ''[[Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss, and What I Learned]]''. 2000. Henry Holt &amp; Co. pp. 61-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the cast, Rainey was an eccentric center of attention. In the season premiere he arrived at the house last because he was detained by police for a traffic incident.

His housemates also complained of his lack of consideration for others, and his need to monopolize conversation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Real World Diaries''. pp. 130, 133 and 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=You Gotta Have Art|series=The Real World: San Francisco|network=MTV|season=3|number=5|airdate=July 28, 1994|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/357674/simple-pleasures.jhtml#id=1607527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainey's housemate, [[Judd Winick]], who is [[Jewish]], was also offended at Rainey's wearing of a T-shirt that depicted four guns arranged in the shape of a [[swastika]], and his refusal to accede to Winick's request not to wear the shirt (though this confrontation was only revealed in ''The Real World Diaries'', a book published by MTV, and depicted in the 2009 film ''[[Pedro (film)|Pedro]]'', not the series itself).&lt;ref&gt;''The Real World Diaries''. Page 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Rainey's closest relationships in the house was with [[Rachel Campos]]. Although their relationship became romantic when they kissed on three occasions, it eventually dissolved when, during a heated argument, he revealed this to the other housemates, despite having promised her he would not. Although the others were not surprised at this revelation, Campos saw this as a betrayal of trust.&lt;ref name="collision"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Kiss and Tell|series=The Real World: San Francisco|network=MTV|season=3|number=10|airdate=September 1, 1994|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/357846/love-triangle.jhtml#id=1607563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainey's most contentious relationship was with Zamora. Rainey denigrated Zamora's career as an [[AIDS]] educator and mocked his Cuban accent. Winick described Rainey as "obnoxious and [[homophobic]]." Zamora, who had AIDS himself, distanced himself from Rainey, and thereby from the other housemates, fearing the stress of his relationship with Rainey was affecting his health.&lt;ref name=collision/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winick; 2000. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; When Zamora threatened to move out, the other housemates voted to evict Rainey instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Getting Dropped|series=The Real World: San Francisco|network=MTV|season=3|number=11|airdate=September 8, 1994|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/357851/talking-in-circles.jhtml#id=1607566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainey later appeared in subsequent episodes in which he encountered former housemates Cory Murphy, Campos, and Winick, but their meetings typically ended in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Old Fish, New Fish|series=The Real World: San Francisco|network=MTV|season=3|number=14|airdate=September 29, 1994|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/357864/the-new-roommate.jhtml#id=1607571}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season finale, he phoned Campos just before she left the house and accused his ex-roommates of harboring ill feelings towards him, calling them "judases'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Last Call|series=The Real World: San Francisco|network=MTV|season=3|number=20|airdate=November 10, 1994|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/357846/love-triangle.jhtml#id=1607563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During ''The Real World Reunion'' in 1995, which assembled the casts of the first four seasons of ''The Real World'', Rainey resumed his conflict with his former housemates, including Bilal and Winick, as well as cast members from other seasons. Following Winick's encouragement to the audience to get involved in fighting the AIDS epidemic, and his statement that Zamora's recent death made his decision to attend the reunion difficult, Rainey claimed that he too used his time to help AIDS patients. Winick countered by stating that Rainey had reacted to Zamora's death with the remark "Good riddance". Rainey denied this, and cast various aspersions on Winick and cast members present before temporarily leaving the taping.&lt;ref&gt;''The Real World Reunion'' 1995. MTV.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appearances==
Rainey made a [[cameo appearance]] in 1998 on ''[[Road Rules: All Stars]]'', Celebrity Death match, and competed in 2003 on ''[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle of the Sexes|Battle of the Sexes]]'', during which he came into conflict with David Edwards of ''[[The Real World: Los Angeles]]'', and married (on-camera) Betty Garcia, his fiancee and mother of his son, Bogart.

In 2009, Rainey was sentenced to a year in a [[Los Angeles County]] jail after pleading no contest to charges of committing battery upon his girlfriend. That same year, he also pleaded no contest to felony possession of ammunition and was placed on 3 years’ probation.&lt;ref name=MailOnline&gt;Schreffler, Laura (June 29, 2011).

On June 19, 2011, Rainey was arrested on suspicion of felony corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant,&lt;ref name=MailOnline/&gt; and was held at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail on $30,000 bail until his July 6 appearance in a San Fernando court.&lt;ref name=MailOnline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Cliff.

'''Donnie Demers''' is an American musician and multi-platinum selling songwriter &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snepmusique.com/les-disques-dor/?awards_cat=65&amp;awards_artist=Amir&amp;awards_title=Au+Coeur+De+Moi]&lt;/ref&gt;. Donnie's songs have been recorded and performed by various artists from around the world, including [[Amir Haddad]] and [[Joanna Forest]].
==Life and work==

Born with [[muscular dystrophy]] and raised in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], Donnie began playing the piano when he was just four years old. His first taste of "show biz" was during his apprenticeship as [[Poster child]] for the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] for the state of [[Massachusetts]]. He attended [[Doherty Memorial High School]], where his interests in songwriting began to flourish.

In 1982, Donnie made his first national television appearance on the "[[Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]]" broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mda.org/telethon/media/pdfs/helpfulinfo/Celebrity%20Appearances.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219151631/http://mda.org/telethon/media/pdfs/helpfulinfo/Celebrity%20Appearances.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed his song, "If We Fell in Love Again," receiving a standing ovation that prompted [[Jerry Lewis]] to hold an unscheduled interview with the young composer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxMZSkxYBaU Jerry Lewis Extra Special SPECIAL 1982 with Donnie Demers - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, producers of the Jerry Lewis Telethon commissioned Donnie to write their national jingle promoting the annual Labor Day broadcast. That jingle, "Labor Day Is America's Day (for MDA)" premiered over television and radio stations nationwide from 1983-1984 during pre-Telethon promotion.

In 1992, Donnie's song, "Second Chance" appeared in the film "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104135/ Double Trouble]" directed by [[John Paragon]] and starred David Paul, Peter Paul, [[Roddy McDowall]] and [[David Carradine]]. The song was performed by Donnie and [[Pepper MaShay]].

On October 11, 2007, Donnie was a special guest artist at the Closing Ceremony of the [[2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games]] at Jiangwan Stadium in [[Shanghai, China]] where he performed and premiered his original composition, "Benediction (Let The Best of You Go Free)" written especially for the 2009 World Winter Games of the Special Olympics

In 2008, Donnie Demers appeared as Arranger, Art Director, Composer, Executive Producer, Package Designer, Pianist and Vocal Producer on the [[Concord Records]] release of the debut album "[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1433513|pure_url=yes}} Dream a Little]" by his brother [[Jimmy Demers]]. This was the first major [[record label]] that the brothers worked on together.

In February 2009, Donnie Demers performed "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbTiGM_axb4 Benediction (Let the Best of You Go Free)]", the theme song that he wrote for the [[2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games]] in [[Boise, Idaho]]. He performed the song with his brother Jimmy, along with a full orchestra and choir live at the [[Ford Idaho Center]] for the Opening Ceremonies. The Demers brothers also performed [[Over the Rainbow]] at the Closing Ceremonies."

On September 27, 2014, Donnie's song, "Save Your Love For Me"  premiered in [[Calgary, Alberta Canada]] at the 2014 David Foster Foundation Miracle Concert under the musical direction of [[David Foster]].

'''Désiré, Baron Collen''' (born in [[Sint-Truiden]], [[Belgium]], 21 June 1943) is a Belgian [[physician]], [[chemist]], [[biotechnology]] entrepreneur and [[life science]] investor.&lt;ref name= "memoires"&gt;Memoires Désiré Collen (2009) Een hart voor onderzoek en ondernemen. {{ISBN|978 90 4960 056 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made several discoveries in [[thrombosis]], [[haemostasis]] and vascular biology in many of which serendipity played a significant role.&lt;ref name= "Lijnen_1"&gt;Lijnen R. Retirement of Désiré Collen. J Thromb Haemost. 2009 Jan;7(1):2-3. {{doi|10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.03194.x}}. Epub 2008 Oct 18. {{PMID|18983506}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  His main achievement has been his role in the development of tissue-type plasminogen activator ([[t-PA]]) from a laboratory concept to a life-saving drug for dissolving blood clots causing acute [[myocardial infarction]] or acute [[ischemic stroke]]. [[Recombinant protein|Recombinant]] t-PA was produced and marketed by [[Genentech]] Inc as [[Activase]] and by [[Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH]] as [[Actilyse]], and is considered biotechnology’s first life saving drug.&lt;ref name= "Delude"&gt;Delude C. Clot-Busters !! – Discovery of thrombolitic therapy for treating heart attack and stroke. Breakthroughs in Bioscience, FASEB 2004, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Collen reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 years as Professor of the Faculty of Medicine at [[KU Leuven]] (Belgium), where he served as Director of the Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Research (now Center for Molecular and Vascular Biology) and the VIB Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy (now VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology). He authored and co-authored over 650 research papers in peer reviewed international journals which as of mid 2017 have been cited over 70,000 times. He was ranked among the 100 most cited scientific authors of the 1980s &lt;ref&gt;Current contents, 31 Aug 1992, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; and among the top 100 living contributors to [[biotechnology]] in polls conducted by [[Reed Elsevier]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The top 100 Living Contributors to Biotechnology, http://www.goldenrice.org/PDFs/Top_100.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 SciTech Strategies [http://scitechstrategies.com] placed him among the top 400 most influential scientists in biomedical research for the period 1996-2011.&lt;ref&gt;Boyack KW, Klavans R, Sorensen AA, Ioannidis JP. A list of highly influential  biomedical researchers, 1996-2011. Eur J Clin Invest. 2013 Dec;43(12):1339-65 {{doi|10.1111/eci.12171}}. Epub 2013 Oct 21. {{PMID|24134636}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Désiré Collen founded the ‘D. Collen Research Foundation vzw’,&lt;ref&gt;Collen Foundation opgericht. Financieel Economische Tijd. 8 November 1988, http://www.lsrp.be/pdfs/tijd_1988_11_08.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oprichting D.

De Standaard, 8 November 1988, http://www.lsrp.be/pdfs/Standaard1_1988_11_08.png&lt;/ref&gt; a not-for-profit organization with the mission to invest the mayor part of the royalties earned from [[Genentech]] on the [[t-PA]] patent in scientific research. The Foundation was renamed in 2007 into ‘Life Sciences Research Partners vzw’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsrp.be&lt;/ref&gt; of which Collen remains the Statutory Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Life Sciences Research Partners vzw, Current Contents August 31, 1982, p3. http://www.lsrp.be/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 he spun out the company Thromb-X nv from the [[KU Leuven]] in Belgium. The primary focus of Thromb-X was in the cardiovascular space with an initial effort to develop [[staphylokinase]] as a more affordable thrombolytic medicine compared to [[t-PA]] (“poor man’s t-PA"). With the constitution of ThromboGenics Ltd [http://www.thrombogenics.com] in Ireland in 1998, the company expanded its R&amp;D scope to include cardiovascular, oncology and ophthalmology programs.&lt;ref&gt;Our history.

With the help of Chris Buyse [https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-buyse-b969a42/?ppe=1] [http://fundplus.be/team], his CFO and “companion de route” during their 7 years at ThromboGenics, he co-financed the start of Fund&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,  an ever-green investment fund that currently manages over 139 million euro . Fund&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is a private Fund for long term equity investment in innovative life sciences companies with a strong patient-centered approach aiming at both a financial return and a tangible societal impact.&lt;ref&gt;Fund&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Impacting Life Sciences. http://fundplus.be&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King Albert II of Belgium]] awarded Désiré Collen hereditary nobility, with the personal rank of [[Baron]] in 2012. He was also recipient of the Belgian [[Francqui Prize]], [[Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine]], [[Bristol-Myers Squibb Award]] for Cardiovascular Research, [[Interbrew-Baillet Latour Health Prize]], [[Insead]] Innovator Prize, Robert P. Grant Medal [https://www.isth.org/?page=Awards] of the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis [https://www.isth.org], Lifetime Achievement Award of the Belgian-American Chamber of Commerce (BelCham) [https://www.belcham.org], and Lifetime Achievement Award of [[Scrip]]. He received honorary doctorates from [[Erasmus University]], [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]]; [[Free University of Brussels]] (VUB), [[Brussels]], Belgium; [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Notre Dame, Indiana|Notre Dame]], IN, [[United States]]; and [[Université de la Méditerranée]], [[Marseille]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt;

==Education==
Désiré Collen, born on 21 June 1943 in the Flemish town of [[Sint-Truiden]] as the first of two children of Frans Collen and Maria Hoebrechs, started his studies in medicine at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]] ([[KU Leuven]]) in 1961. Since his third year of the seven year curriculum he combined his studies with research: first in the laboratory of Belgian physiologist Professor Joseph P. Bouckaert, and from the next year on in the Laboratory for Blood Coagulation under the direction of Professor Marc Verstraete [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Verstraete]. Under the guidance of young gastroenterologist Guido Tytgat [https://www.narcis.nl/person/RecordID/PRS1234691/Language/en] and biochemist René De Vreker he studied the rate at which the [[coagulation]] proteins [[fibrinogen]] and [[plasminogen]] are cleared from the circulation. This early experience with biochemical lab work inspired Désiré Collen to become a [[researcher]] rather than a practicing general [[physician]] or [[medical specialist]]. Realising his knowledge in [[chemistry]] was inadequate, he combined his education in medicine with academic studies in chemistry. He graduated from the [[KU Leuven]] as [[Doctor in Medicine]] in 1968 and as [[Master's degree|Master]] (“Licentiaat”) in [[Chemistry]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt;

Mid 1968 Désiré Collen became research assistant of the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research in the Laboratory of Marc Verstraete. He worked simultaneously in the Department of Physical Chemistry under the supervision of Professor Leo De Maeyer [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_De_Maeyer]. He started a research project on factors influencing the [[polymerization]] of [[fibrinogen]] to [[fibrin]].&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt; Only months later, he published his first, although a very short one, scientific paper in [[Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Collen D, Vandereycken G, De Maeyer L. Influence of hydrostatic pressure on the reversible polymerization of fibrin monomers. Nature. 1970 Nov 14;228(5272):669-71. {{PMID|5529056}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971-1972 he went as an Associate Research Scientist of the [[National Institutes of Health]] ([[United States]]) to the [[New York University Medical Center]] to work with Alan Johnson. In 1972-1973 he worked in the laboratory of Birger Blombäck&lt;ref&gt;Lord ST, Henschen-Edman A. Birger Blombäck (May 7, 1926 - October 2, 2008). J Thromb Haemost. 2009 May;7(5):908-9. {{doi|10.1111/j.1538-7836.2009.03320.x}}. Epub 2009 Feb 13. {{PMID|19220733}}; {{PMC|2965830}}.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Karolinska Institutet]] in [[Stockholm]] ([[Sweden]]) as a NATO Research Fellow. After obtaining his [[Ph.D.]] in [[Chemistry]] at the [[KU Leuven]] in 1974 and concluding his mandatory military service, Désiré Collen was appointed in 1976 as [[Lecturer]] (Docent) in the Faculty of Medicine at [[KU Leuven]] and as Adjunct Head of Clinic in the Section Bleeding and Vascular Diseases in the Department of Internal Medicine at the [[University Hospital Leuven]].&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt;

==Career and research==
===Research output===
The scientific output of Désiré Collen between 1968 and 2008 consists of over 650 peer-reviewed research papers in international journals, 170 review articles and 28 issued US patents. His publications have been cited over 70,000 times in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt; He made seminal contributions to the fields of [[thrombosis]], [[haemostasis]] and vascular biology.&lt;ref name= "Lijnen_1" /&gt; His pivotal achievement has been the development of tissue-type plasminogen activator ([[t-PA]]) from a laboratory concept to the first life saving biotech drug. [[Recombinant protein|Recombinant]] [[t-PA]] has been primarily used for dissolving blood clots causing acute [[myocardial infarction]] or acute [[ischemic stroke]].&lt;ref name="Delude" /&gt;

===The cloning of t-PA and preclinical research===
[[T-PA]] is a [[protease]] that converts inactive [[plasminogen]] into active [[plasmin]], which in turn cleaves [[fibrin]], the main component of blood clots. Upon cleavage of the long [[fibrin]] strands by [[plasmin]], the clot falls apart and dissolves. Between August 1977 and September 1978 Désiré Collen and Bjorn Wiman elucidated that the conversion of [[plasminogen]] to [[plasmin]] takes place when both [[proteins]] are bound to [[fibrin]] in the blood clot.&lt;ref&gt;Wiman B, Collen D. Molecular mechanism of physiological fibrinolysis. Nature. 1978; 272: 549-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collen D, Wiman B. Fast-acting plasmin inhibitor in human plasma. Blood. 1978; 51: 563-9. Review.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collen D, Wiman B. The fast-acting plasmin inhibitor of human plasma: The Prix Servier Lecture 1978. In: ‘Progress in Chemical Fibrinolysis and Thrombolysis, Vol. 4’. Ed.: J.F. Davidson. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburg, 1979; 11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; This molecular model for the regulation and control of fibrinolysis was presented in 1979 during an invited plenary lecture (Edward Kowalski Memorial Lecture) at the VIIth International Congress on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in [[London]].  The written report of this presentation has been cited over 1000 times in the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Collen D. On the regulation and control of fibrinolysis. Edward Kowalski Memorial Lecture. Thromb Haemost. 1980; 43: 77-89. Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collen collaborated in the same period with Professor Alfons Billiau [http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00007763] of the [[Rega Institute for Medical Research]] in [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]] on the inhibition of [[Tissue plasminogen activator|plasminogen activator]]s secreted by [[malignant cells]] in culture, hypothesizing that synthetic inhibitors might suppress the [[malignant]] [[phenotype]] of these cells. In order to have a source for these “malignant plasminogen activators” the Bowes Melanoma Cell line was obtained from Professor Daniel Rifkin [https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/daniel-b-rifkin] of the [[Rockefeller University]], [[New York City]] at the end of 1978. It quickly appeared that this cell line produced large amounts of a [[plasminogen activator]] with a molecular weight of 70,000 [[dalton (unit)|dalton]] and a high affinity for [[fibrin]], characteristic of human tissue-type plasminogen activator ([[t-PA]]), whereas most other [[malignant cells]] produced a [[plasminogen activator]] with a molecular weight of 54,000 [[dalton (unit)|dalton]] without affinity for [[fibrin]], which is characteristic of pro-[[urokinase]]. This game-changing, although trivial serendipitous observation, made on 9 February 1979,&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt; was to change the course of [[thrombolytic therapy]].

In order to produce sufficient amounts of [[t-PA]] for further [[biochemical]] and [[preclinical]] studies, [[post-doctoral fellow]] Dingeman (Dick) Rijken succeeded in isolating sufficient amounts of pure and homogeneous [[t-PA]] from conditioned culture medium from the Bowes Melanoma Cell line.&lt;ref&gt;Rijken DC and Collen D. Purification and characterization of the plasminogen activator secreted by human melanoma cells in culture. J Biol Chem. 1981; 256: 7035-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collen D, Rijken DC, Van Damme J, Billiau A. Purification of human tissue-type plasminogen activator in centigram quantities from human melanoma cell culture fluid and its conditioning for use in vivo. Thromb Haemost. 1982; 48: 294-6.&lt;/ref&gt; This purified protein was used by [[post-doctoral fellow]] Osamu Matsuo [http://www.iups.org/committees/people/osamu-matsuo/] to evaluate the [[thrombolytic]] potential of [[t-PA]] in [[rabbits]] suffering from an experimental [[pulmonary embolus]].&lt;ref&gt;Matsuo O, Rijken DC, Collen D. Thrombolysis by human tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase in rabbits with experimental pulmonary embolus. Nature. 1981; 291: 590-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The research led to a key patent (US4752603) entitled ‘Plasminogen activator and pharmaceutical composition having thrombolytic activity’ &lt;ref&gt;Collen DJ, Rijken DC, Matsuo OM. Plasminogen activator and pharmaceutical composition having thrombolytic activity. US 4752603. http://www.google.com/patents/US4752603&lt;/ref&gt; which was first submitted in the Netherlands on 11 June 1980.

On 12 June 1980, one day after the submission of the patent application, Collen presented the results at the Fifth Congress on [[Fibrinolysis]] in [[Malmö]] ([[Sweden]]) in the presence of Diane Pennica [https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-pennica-b276284/], a young scientist from biotech company [[Genentech]] Inc, based in South [[San Francisco]]. [[Collen]], [[KU Leuven]] and [[Genentech]] agreed to collaborate on the production of a [[recombinant protein|recombinant]] version of [[t-PA]] (rt-PA), embarking on a new model for drug development: academic and biotech collaboration, today routine, but at that time a new modus operandi.&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt; Within 18 months, Pennica and her team had cloned the [[cDNA]] ([[complementary DNA]]) of human [[t-PA]] [[messenger RNA]] and was producing rt-PA in cultures of [[Chinese hamster]] [[ovary]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;Pennica D. et al. Cloning and expression of human tissue-type plasminogen activator cDNA in E. coli. Nature. 1983 Jan 20;301(5897):214-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapeutic potential of r[[t-PA]] and its functional identity with natural [[t-PA]] was proven in a collaboration with Steven R. Bergman [https://www.princetonhcs.org/care-services/princeton-medicine/primary-care-providers/steven-r-bergmann-phd-md] and Burton Sobel [https://source.wustl.edu/2013/05/obituary-burton-e-sobel-md-former-director-of-cardiovascular-division-75/] ([[Washington University School of Medicine]], [[St. Louis|Saint Louis]]), [[Frans Van de Werf]] ([[KU Leuven]]), and Herman 'Chip' Gold [http://www.massgeneral.org/about/newsarticle.aspx?id=1266] and Tsunehori Yasuda ([[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Boston]]) using [[canidae|canine]] models of [[coronary thrombosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann SR, Fox KA, Ter-Pogossian MM, Sobel BE, Collen D.

===Clinical studies with t-PA===

Also in 1981, following a discussion with Alfons Billiau at a scientific congress in [[Amsterdam]], Dutch [[nephrologist]] Willem Weimar [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Willem_Weimar] of the [[Dijkzigt]] Hospital in [[Rotterdam]] treated for the first time a patient with [[t-PA]] purified from the Bowes Melanoma Cell line. The patient, a 29 year old lady, was suffering from a renal transplant vein thrombosis and was successfully treated resulting in a decennia-long survival.&lt;ref&gt;Weimar W, Stibbe J, van Seyen AJ, Billiau A, De Somer P, Collen D. Specific lysis of an iliofemoral thrombus by administration of extrinsic (tissue-type) plasminogen activator. Lancet. 1981; 2: 1018-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiologists [[Frans Van de Werf]] and Burton Sobel tested [[t-PA]] in 1983 in a pilot [[clinical study]] on patients with acute [[myocardial infarction]].&lt;ref&gt;Van de Werf F et al. Coronary thrombolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator in patients with evolving myocardial infarction. N Engl J Med. 1984; 310: 609-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1983, the first prospective, [[randomized]] and [[placebo-controlled]] trial of recombinant [[t-PA]] took place in three US hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Collen D et al. Coronary thrombolysis with recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Circulation. 1984 Dec; 70: 1012-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancet. 1985; 1: 842-7.&lt;/ref&gt; culminated in the final approval of r[[t-PA]] as [[thrombolytic]] agent by the [[FDA]] on 13 November 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Boffey PM U.S. To Back Gene-Engineered Drug For Clotting. New York Times. 12 November 1987. https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/13/us/us-to-back-gene-engineered-drug-for-clotting.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genentech]] immediately started to market the drug in the US under the brand name [[Activase]]®,&lt;ref&gt;Genentech Press Release.

===A lifesaving drug===
The controversy over whether the more expensive r[[t-PA]] was clinically superior over [[streptokinase]] as a [[thrombolytic]] agent climaxed in the scientific press between 1988 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Marx J.L. Which clot-dissolving drug is best? Science. 1988; 242: 1505-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collen D. Coronary thrombolysis: streptokinase or recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator? Ann Intern Med. 1990; 112: 529-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sobel BE, Collen D. After ISIS-3. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1225-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sobel BE, Collen D. Questions unresolved by the Third International Study of Infarct Survival. Am J Cardiol. 1992; 70: 385-9.&lt;/ref&gt; To end this controversy, the GUSTO trial (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries) was set up, a head-to-head comparison between r[[t-PA]] and [[streptokinase]]. In the GUSTO-trial 41,021 heart attack patients were treated in 1,081 hospitals in 15 countries. [[Cardiologist]] [[Eric Topol]] of the [[Cleveland Clinic]] (USA), [[cardiologist]]/[[statistician]] [[Robert Califf]] of [[Duke University Medical Center]] (USA) and David Stump [https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=206572&amp;privcapId=29617] of [[Genentech]] coordinated the trial. In absolute figures the 30-day [[mortality rate]] in the r[[t-PA]] group was 1% lower (or in relative figures 14%) compared to the mortality in the [[streptokinase]] group.&lt;ref&gt;An international randomized trial comparing four thrombolytic strategies for acute myocardial infarction. The GUSTO investigators. N Engl J Med. 1993; 329: 673-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The effects of tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, or both on coronary-artery patency, ventricular function, and survival after acute myocardial infarction. The GUSTO Angiographic Investigators. N Engl J Med. 1993; 329: 1615-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sobel BE and Collen D. Controversy and clarification: preliminary results of the GUSTO trial. In: “Coronary thrombolysis in perspective”, Eds. BE Sobel and D Collen, Marcel Dekker Inc, New York, N.Y. 1993, p. 303-316.&lt;/ref&gt; After the GUSTO studies, r[[t-PA]] became the [[thrombolytic]] drug of choice for most of the [[cardiologists]] in the Western world and would save the lives of many tens of thousands of [[heart attack]] patients.&lt;ref name="Delude" /&gt;

Nowadays, [[cardiologists]] agree that timely performed [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] ([[Percutaneous coronary intervention|PCI]]), also known as '[[angioplasty]]’ and ‘[[stenting]]', is the preferred strategy to treat acute [[myocardial infarction]] instead of [[thrombolysis]]. [[Percutaneous coronary intervention|PCI]] is associated with less [[mortality rate|mortality]] on the short term (7% versus 9% for [[thrombolysis]]), a lower risk of a recurrent [[infarct]] (3% versus 7%) and a lower frequency of [[cerebral hemorrhage]] (1% versus 2%). Also over a longer period of time, [[Percutaneous coronary intervention|PCI]] leads to a lower [[mortality rate|mortality]] rate.&lt;ref&gt;Keeley EC, Boura JA, Grines CL. Primary angioplasty versus intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: a quantitative review of 23 randomised trials. Lancet. 2003; 361: 13-20. Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because access to invasive facilities is limited in many countries, [[thrombolytic]] therapy is still employed in many centers worldwide for treating acute [[myocardial infarction]].&lt;ref&gt;Van de Werf FJ, Topol EJ, Sobel BE. The impact of fibrinolytic therapy for ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction. J Thromb Haemost 2009; 7: 14_20.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, r[[t-PA]] based [[thrombolysis]] still is an important strategy to treat [[ischemic stroke]] &lt;ref&gt;Tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke.

===Staphylokinase - poor man's t-PA===
On many occasions Désiré Collen expressed his frustration that the lives of many more people could have been saved, had r[[t-PA]] been more readily available, also to people who were not living in the affluent western world.&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt; Therefore, he invested part of [[Genentech]]’s [[t-PA]] royalty stream in the search for a “t-PA for the poor”.

In the early 1990s, together with Roger Lijnen [https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00004959] ([[KU Leuven]]) and Osamu Matsuo ([[Kindai University]], [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]), Collen started to evaluate whether [[staphylokinase]] (STAR), a bacterial profibrinolytic agent with high [[fibrin]] specificity, could be a valid alternative for r[[t-PA]] in less wealthy territories.&lt;ref&gt;Lijnen HR, Van Hoef B, De Cock F, Okada K, Ueshima S, Matsuo O, Collen D. On the mechanism of fibrin-specific plasminogen activation by staphylokinase. J Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 11826-32.&lt;/ref&gt; By setting up spin off company Thromb-X, Collen had the clear objective to further develop [[staphylokinase]] through the preclinical and clinical research phases up to the market introduction. Although wild type [[staphylokinase]] and variants with reduced [[immunogenicity]] and preserved lytic potency have been tested with success in humans,&lt;ref&gt;Collen D, Van de Werf F. Coronary thrombolysis with recombinant staphylokinase in patients with evolving myocardial infarction. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1850-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanderschueren S, et al. A randomized trial of recombinant staphylokinase versus alteplase for coronary artery patency in acute myocardial infarction. The STAR Trial Group. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2044-9.&lt;/ref&gt; its further development came to an unfortunate standstill because of the prohibitive expense of a GUSTO-like clinical trial with a mortality end-point that had become the standard in the West. Not even licensing out the further clinical development, production and commercialization of [[staphylokinase]] to companies in developing countries (where for most people r[[t-PA]] is hardly available) could  save this project.&lt;ref&gt;Press release ThromboGenics, 6 December 2006: ThromboGenics sign a licence agreement with Bharat Biotech for a new blood clot dissolvent.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press release ThromboGenics, 4 September 2007: ThromboGenics announce the successful conclusion of the technology transfer to  Bharat Biotech for the production of a new blood clot dissolvent.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press release ThromboGenics, 4 October 2007: ThromboGenics and Rhein Minapharm announce an agreement on next generation thrombolytic medicines.&lt;/ref&gt;

===VIB Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy===
With the constitution of the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology ([[Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie]] - VIB), Collen was able to extend the capacity of his Leuven-based academic research laboratories. He became Director of the VIB Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy (now VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology) based on the Gasthuisberg Campus of the [[KU Leuven]]. Together with Professor [[Peter Carmeliet]] and colleagues, landmark contributions were made to the fields of vascular biology, [[tumor]] biology and [[neurobiology]], e.g. between 1995 and 2008 the Department conducted breakthrough research on the role of [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] ([[VEGF]]) and [[placental growth factor]] ([[PlGF]]) in [[angiogenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Carmeliet P, et al.

===Academic Appointments===
From 1981 to 2008 Désiré Collen was Professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the [[KU Leuven]] in [[Belgium]]. Between 1998 and 2002 he temporarily resigned to develop ThromboGenics, but remained ‘Extraordinary Professor’ (Buitengewoon hoogleraar). In 2008 he reached the age of mandatory retirement at Belgian Universities.&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt;

Désiré Collen was also Professor of [[Biochemistry]] and [[Medicine]] in the Department of Kenneth G. Mann [https://www.med.uvm.edu/biochemistry/lab_mann_research] at the [[University of Vermont]] College of Medicine, [[Burlington, Vermont]], USA (1984-2005), Visiting Professor of Medicine in the group of Herman 'Chip' Gold of [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] at [[Harvard School of Medicine]], [[Boston]], MA, USA (1987-1994), Consultant in Medicine at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Boston]], MA, USA (1987-2005) and Visiting Professor at the Division of Surgery and Anaesthesia of Kevin Burnand [http://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/membership/council-of-governors/meet-the-governors.aspx] at [[United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals]], [[London]], UK (1999-2002).&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt;

Désiré Collen was Director of the Center for Molecular and Vascular Biology at the Faculty of Medicine of the [[KU Leuven]] from 1994 to 2008, Division Head of the Protein Research Division of Leuven Research and Development vzw [https://lrd.kuleuven.be/en] of the [[KU Leuven]] from 1976 to 1998 and Director of the Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy of the [[Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie]] (VIB) from 1994 to 2008.&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt;

===D. Collen Research Foundation===
On 2 July 1988 the D. Collen Research Foundation was constituted by Désiré Collen, Roger Dillemans [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Dillemans], Rector of the [[KU Leuven]], Karel Tavernier, General Manager of the [[KU Leuven]], Jacques Vander Eecken, Chairman of Leuven Research and Development and Lawrence Fouraker, former Dean of the [[Harvard Business School]] representing the [[Harvard Medical School]].&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt; The mission of the Foundation was to canalize the major part of the income from the r[[t-PA]] royalties towards “the execution, promotion and support of scientific research in general, and biomedical and biotechnological research in particular, by making available research grants, research positions, travel bursaries, by organizing scientific congresses and symposia, providing financial support for publications and all related activities that support the advancement of science.” With the support of the Foundation, over 100 young researchers were able to obtain further specialisation abroad; numerous congresses and symposia and two academic chairs were sponsored, the 9th floor of the research building on the Gasthuisberg Research Campus and a guesthouse on the Groot Begijnhof campus were built with financial support of the Foundation. These buildings housed for many years the Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Research and the VIB Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy and their postdoctoral researchers, respectively.&lt;ref name="memoires" /&gt;

In 2007 the D. Collen Research Foundation was renamed to Life Sciences Research Partners vzw [http://www.lsrp.be]. It continued the activities of the D. Collen Research Foundation, but also started to invest in life science companies, such as Celyad [https://www.celyad.com], Ogeda [https://www.ogeda.com], Amakem, Bone Therapeutics [http://www.bonetherapeutics.com/en] and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsrp.be/LSRP2-investments.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thromb-X and ThromboGenics===
In 1991, Désiré Collen spun out Thromb-X nv from the [[KU Leuven]] with an initial mission to develop [[staphylokinase]] as an equally effective but less expensive successor of r[[t-PA]]. With the foundation of ThromboGenics Ltd in Ireland in 1998, the Company expanded its R&amp;D scope to include various cardiovascular, oncology and ophthalmology programs in-licensed from the [[KU Leuven]] and the [[Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie]] (Flemish Institute for Biotechnologie - VIB). Collen was CEO and Chairman of ThromboGenics from 1998 to 2008. In 2008 Patrick De Haes [https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrik-de-haes-md-10176612/?ppe=1] succeeded him as CEO.

Following a successful [[IPO]] in 2006 on the basis of the expanded R&amp;D portfolio, the company nevertheless narrowed its scope to the clinical development of [[ocriplasmin]], a truncated form of [[plasmin]] for ophthalmology indications, culminating in the completion of a pivotal phase III program in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Stalmans P, Benz MS, Gandorfer A, Kampik A, Girach A, Pakola S, Haller JA; MIVI-TRUST Study Group. Enzymatic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin for vitreomacular traction and macular holes.

Disappointed by the, in his opinion, inadequate strategic and commercial governance of the company, Collen stepped down as Chairman and member of the board in December 2013.&lt;ref name= "stepping down" /&gt;

===Fund&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;===
In May 2015 Désiré Collen, through the private foundation Désiré Collen Stichting and the non-profit organisation Life Sciences Research Partners, founded Fund&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [http://fundplus.be] of which he is the Chairman. Fund&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; will invest in innovative life sciences companies seeking series A or B financing and with a Proof of Concept in therapeutics, diagnostics or medical devices. The Fund made investments in Ogeda [http://fundplus.be] (acquired by [[Astellas]]), Iteos [http://www.iteostherapeutics.com], MaSTherCell [http://www.masthercell.com], Promethera [http://www.promethera.com], Q-Biologicals [http://www.q-biologicals.be] (acquired by Amatsi Group [http://www.amatsigroup.com/en/]), Novadip [https://www.novadip.com], eTheRNA [http://www.etherna.be] and Octimet [http://www.octimet.com].
Fund&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; aims at realizing an attractive financial return for its investors, as well as a societal return. Fund&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; wants to contribute in a sustainable way to the improvement of the eco system for biotech companies. Therefore, its major geographical focus will be Belgium. 
As of July 2017 Fund&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; had raised over 139 Million euro of financing commitments. The intended investment size per company will be between 3 and 10 million euro spread over different milestones.

==Awards and honours==
Désiré Collen was awarded the Belgian [[Francqui Prize]] in Biological and Medical Sciences in 1984. He received the [[Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine]] (Fondation L. Jeantet, Geneva, [[Switzerland]]) in 1986, the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb Award]] for Cardiovascular Research (New York, NY, USA) jointly with Mark Verstraete in 1994, the [[Interbrew-Baillet Latour Health Prize]] ([[Belgium]]) jointly with [[Peter Carmeliet]] in 2005, the Harvard Leadership Prize by the Harvard Club of Belgium [http://hcbelgium.clubs.harvard.edu] in 2007, the [[Insead]] Innovator Prize in 2009, the Robert P. Grant Medal from the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis in 2011, the Lifetime Achievement Award of Belcham (New York, NY, USA) in 2013 and the Lifetime Achievement Award of [[Scrip]] (London, UK) in 2013

He became Ereburger (Honorary Citizen) of his native town [[Sint-Truiden]] ([[Belgium]]) in 2013 and [[Alumnus]] of the Year 2014 of Alfagen [[KU Leuven]]. In 2012 his majesty [[King Albert II of Belgium]] awarded him the hereditary nobility status (personal title of [[Baron]]).

In addition he received [[honorary doctorates]] from [[Erasmus University]], [[Rotterdam]] ([[The Netherlands]]) in 1988, [[Free University of Brussels]] ([[VUB]]), [[Brussels]] ([[Belgium]]) in 1994, [[University of Notre Dame]], Notre Dame (IN, USA) in 1995 and [[Université de la Méditerranée]], [[Marseille]] (France) in 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13651">'''Edgar Ray Butterworth''' (March 3, 1847 – January 1, 1921) was an [[United States|American]] [[funeral director]], believed to have coined the professional terms ''[[wikt:mortuary|mortuary]]'' and ''[[wikt:mortician|mortician]]''.&lt;ref name=Bagley&gt;Clarence B. Bagley, History of King County Washington, The S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago-Seattle, 1929, Volume III, pages 781-785.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A slow migration west==

Butterworth was born in 1847 in [[Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts|Newton Upper Falls]], [[Massachusetts]]. His paternal grandfather, Noah Butterworth, served in the [[American Revolution]]. His father was  William Ray Butterworth; his mother's name was Eliza ''née'' Norwood, also from an old [[New England]] family. In 1857 his family moved to [[Wright County, Minnesota|Wright County]], [[Minnesota]], where his father worked as a millwright for six years. This was during the period of the [[Sioux Wars]] in that frontier region. When the [[American Civil War]], broke out, Edgar Butterworth tried to enlist but he was too young. In 1863, the family returned to Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt;

From the age of 16—that is, roughly from the time of the family's return to Massachusetts—he  was the prime breadwinner in his family. He worked for a time as a hatter; then, still in his teens and despite a limited formal education, he began to study law and was [[admission to practice law|admitted to the bar]] in Massachusetts just after he reached the age of 21. In 1869, he married Grace M. Whipple, a direct descendant of [[William Whipple]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. She died only two years into the marriage, after bearing a child, Gilbert M. Butterworth.&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt;

In 1873, Butterworth moved to [[Saint Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]], [[Missouri]] where he again worked as a hatter. Also in that year, he remarried to Maria L. Gillespie. They relocated to [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]], [[Kansas]] and in 1876 to the rangelands of southwest Kansas, where he became a cattleman. He also hauled the bones of dead [[American Bison|bison]] {{convert|125|mi|km}} to the nearest railroad where he received [[United States dollar|US$]]10 per ton (907&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt;

There, on the plains of Kansas, he also had his first occasion to make a [[coffin]]. Traveling with his team and wagon, he encountered a settler in front of a "[[dugout (shelter)|dugout]]" home, grieving for his wife and newborn child, both of whom had just died. With no lumber available on the grasslands, Butterworth fashioned a coffin from his own wagon box.&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt;

==Becoming an undertaker==
In 1881 the Butterworths moved farther west, to [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], arriving in [[Chehalis, Washington|Chehalis]] in August of that year. He came with the intent of engaging in stock-raising, but that enterprise was not yet under way in Eastern Washington and Butterworth correctly gauged that Washington west of the [[Cascade Range]] was not cattle country. Instead, he built the first steam-powered [[flour mill]] west of the Cascades. The following spring the Butterworths relocated a short distance to Centerville, (later [[Centralia, Washington|Centralia]]), where Butterworth set up a small furniture business. He served as a member of the first city council of Centralia and later as the city's mayor; he also served two terms was in the [[Washington State Legislature|state legislature]].&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt; When an epidemic of "black [[diphtheria]]"  hit the region, Butterworth was called upon to make coffins, which is the point at which he effectively entered the undertaking business.&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt;

Initially continuing in the furniture business, he also went into the business of selling coffins; he stocked a line of ready made coffins manufactured in [[Olympia, Washington]]. In 1892, by now a successful businessman, he relocated to [[Seattle]], where he went into the undertaking business in a bigger way.&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt; He purchased a controlling interest in the Cross &amp; Co. Undertakers&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Beason&gt;Tyrone Beason, [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980221&amp;slug=2735719 5 Generations Of Tradition Laid To Rest -- Butterworth Funeral Home Sold To New Orleans-Based Chain], ''Seattle Times'', February 21, 1998.

The business was soon renamed E. R. Butterworth &amp; Sons. Five of his sons joined him in the business: the aforementioned Gilbert Butterworth and his half-brothers Charles Norwood Butterworth, Frederick Ray Butterworth, Harry Edgar Butterworth, and Benjamin Kent Butterworth. Gilbert and Frederick would be the longest-lived, and were followed into the business by several of their own sons. By 1929, when Butterworth's son Gilbert was managing the business, it had already remained in the hands of a single family longer than any other Seattle funerary business.&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt; It would retain that status nearly until the family sold the business to [[New Orleans]]-based [[Stewart Enterprises]] in 1998, by which time it was one of the city's longest-running family-owned business of any type.&lt;ref name=Beason /&gt; The last Butterworth to run the business—which was by then Butterworth-Manning-Ashmore, after a series of mergers—was Edgar's great-great grandson, Bert Butterworth Jr.&lt;ref name=Beason /&gt;

From Second and Pike, the business moved to 1425 Second Avenue (later the 1896–1929 location of [[The Bon Marché]] department store);&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dates for Bon Marché from James R.

==Character==
Butterworth was a pioneer of the modern approach to the business of undertaking. Clarence Bagley credits him as the likely coiner of the terms''mortuary'' and ''mortician''. He owned the first hearse north of the [[Columbia River]]. During Butterworth's lifetime, his business annually forgave the debts of customers who were not able to pay.&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt; Butterworth &amp; Sons were also early adopters of the [[embalm]]ing techniques that now distinguish American funerary traditions from those more common in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=Yandel /&gt;

He was a member of numerous fraternal organizations. He helped organize the Seattle lodges of the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]] and the [[Ancient Order of United Workmen]], and was also a member of the [[Knights of Pythias]], the [[Independent Order of Foresters]], the [[Woodmen of the World]], the [[Royal Arcanum]] and the [[Independent Order of Good Templars]], as well as being a charter member of the [[Alaskan Brotherhood Association]], and a life member Seattle's [[Arctic Club]]. He was an active member of Temple Baptist Church,&lt;ref name=Bagley /&gt; but also a practicing [[spiritualism|spiritualist]].&lt;ref name=Yandel /&gt;

Inevitably, not all of the corpses handled by Butterworth had died peacefully.&lt;ref name=Yandel /&gt; During the years of the [[Yukon Gold Rush]] (which began in 1897), parts of Seattle were dangerous and violent. Undertakers were paid $50 per body to take dead bodies off the street; Butterworth &amp; Sons partook of that business.&lt;ref name=Yandel /&gt; Butterworth, the city's leading undertaking business of the period, also handled many victims of the [[Spanish flu]] pandemic.&lt;ref name=Yandel /&gt; Later, when health faddist doctor [[Linda Burfield Hazzard]] was convicted over one of the several patients she starved to death, Butterworth &amp; Sons were implicated in the scandal, because they had cremated one of her victims, then produced a different, less emaciated body for the funeral. The mortuary was not convicted of any wrongdoing, but Hazzard went to prison.&lt;ref name=Yandel /&gt;

'''Florence Elizabeth, Lady Barrett,''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|CH|CBE}} (1867 - 7 August 1945) was a [[consultant]] [[surgeon]] at the Mothers' Hospital in Clapton and the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in London. She was one of the leading [[gynaecologist]]s and [[obstetrician]]s of her time.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Early and private life==
Lady Barrett was born in [[Henbury]] in [[Gloucestershire]] now part of [[Bristol]], and she was the fourth child of merchant Benjamin Perry. Even though she received little formal education in the early part of her life, she studied [[physiology]] and [[organic chemistry]] at [[University College, Bristol]], and graduated with a first-class [[BSc]] in 1895. She received a [[Bachelor of Medicine]] (MB) in 1900 and a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) in 1906 at the [[London School of Medicine for Women]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary|last=|first=|date=9 August 1945|work=The Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrett married surgeon [[Frederick George Ingor Willey]], the son of [[Josiah Willey]] FRCS, in 1896.

In 1916, Barrett married Sir [[William Fletcher Barrett]] FRS. At the time of their marriage, Sir Barrett, aged 72, was a former Professor of Physics at the [[Royal College of Science for Ireland]] in Dublin. His research focused on [[psychic phenomena]], and he later founded the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in 1882. She claimed to have conversed with her husband after his death in 1925 through the help of a third-party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/930376608|title=Deathbed visions|last=Barrett|first=William|date=1 January 2011|publisher=White Crow|year=|isbn=9781907661020|location=|pages=|oclc=930376608}}&lt;/ref&gt; She published an account of the sittings, entitled ''Personality Survives Death'', in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality survives death; messages from Sir William Barrett|last=Barrett|first=Lady Florence Elizabeth|publisher=London, New York Longmans, Green and Co.|year=1937|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==
Barrett joined the staff of the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.hackneysociety.org/page_id__147.aspx?path=0p5p59p|title=A most decorated lady|last=Jessop|first=Claudia|date=21 December 2009|website=The Story of Healthcare in Hackney|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the only hospital in England where women could train in medical practice at the time. In 1916 she led a fund-raising campaign to extend the hospital, adding maternity, paediatric and infant welfare facilities. She helped to develop the [[London School of Medicine for Women]] at the Royal Free Hospital, of which she became Dean and then President in 1937. She also established voluntary centres in London to provide food for undernourished children and pregnant women before the [[World War I|First World War]].

She was an obstetric surgeon at the Mothers’ Hospital from 1913 to 1945, and an obstetric and gynaecological surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital. She was also an honorary surgeon at the [[Marie Curie Hospital]] in Hampstead.

Barrett served as president of the [[Medical Women's Federation]] in 1923, and joint vice-president of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Section of the [[British Medical Association]]. She was also a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and president of the [[Medical Women's International Association]].

She was an active member of the [[British Eugenics Society|Eugenics Society]], and served on its council since 1917. She strongly opposed [[contraception]], arguing that it would "interfere with the natural course of lovemaking" and "degrade it to the grossly physical".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

She reportedly was interested in a wide range of subjects, from the [[supernatural]] to [[eugenics]] and [[women's rights]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Barrett supported [[women's suffrage]], and equal employment rights for women. She supported the [[Marriage Guidance Council]], and raised funds for Red Cross ambulances during the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Later life==
She was appointed as a CBE in the first list of awards for the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1917, and became a [[Companion of Honour]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;"The New Year Honours." Times [London, England] 1 March 1929: 8. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 30 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in [[Maidenhead]], and a memorial service was held at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. Her obituary in ''The Times'' stated "She was unquestionably one of the most distinguished of medical women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She left her husband’s library to the [[Society for Psychical Research]], and also left £1,000 to endow a scholarship at the London School of Medicine for Women.

{{Chinese name|[[Hu (surname)|Hu]]}}

'''Hu Songshan''' (1880–1955), a [[Hui people|Hui]], was born in 1880, in [[Tongxin County]], [[Ningxia]], China. His Muslim name in Arabic was Sa'd al-Din ({{lang-ar|سعد الدين}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Sa'd ad-Dīn}}''; {{zh|s=赛尔敦丁|t=賽爾敦丁|p=sài ěr dūn dīng}}). Although he was born Sufi and turned Wahhabi, he changed his views and turned his back on Wahhabism after a Hajj to Mecca and later became an important imam, scripturalist, and leader of the Yihewani Muslim sect in China. He was influential and played an important role in Chinese Islam in this position as he propagated reformist doctrines in Ningxia in his later life. Hu also played a role in rallying Muslims against the Japanese invasion of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=  海宝明 |date= 2009-05-26|title=著名经学家虎嵩山阿訇的爱国情  |url= http://www.mzzjw.cn/zgmzb/html/2009-05/26/content_61018.htm |newspaper= 中国民族报电子版 |location= |publisher= |number=第07版 |page = 3 |accessdate= 30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Hu's father was a [[Gansu]] ''[[ahong]]'' (imam) belonging to the [[Khafiya]] ''[[menhuan]]'', a Chinese-style [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi order]]. When Hu Songshan was 18, he joined Wang Naibi of [[Haicheng, Ningxia|Haicheng]]. At age 21, he became imam of the anti-Sufi [[Yihewani]] ([[Ikhwan]] in Arabic) sect, which was founded by the Wahhabi [[Ma Wanfu]]. Hu opposed wasteful rituals and cash payments for religious services, which Sufi orders practiced. Being a member of the Yihewani, he was so against [[Sufism]] and the ''menhuan'' to the point where he destroyed his own father's [[gongbei (Islamic architecture)|gongbei]] (a Hui Islamic shrine centered around a Sufi master's grave) built at [[Tongxin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4e2e767701000dg2.html 虎嵩山会晤白崇禧]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Islam and China|figures}}

==Life==
He went on [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]] in 1924 at age 45, traveling through [[Shanghai]] and he reached Mecca in 1925. When Hu was in Mecca, he did not feel solidarity with other Muslims, he was treated racistly on hajj because he was from China, so he became a Chinese nationalist working to build a strong China, and abandoned salafism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Remapping China: Fissures in Historical Terrain|editor-first=Gail|editor-last=Hershatter|volume=|edition=illustrated|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvDOudr5M6MC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Hu+songshan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qCu9UPLQA8iN0QHJvYDwBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hu%20songshan&amp;f=false|page=107|isbn=0804725098|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Religious Question in Modern China|first1=Vincent|last1=Goossaert|first2=David A.|last2=Palmer|volume=|edition=|year=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bx83dlLMPdMC&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=88|isbn=0226304167|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Religiosities Afflictions of Modernity and State Formation|chapter=8 Republican Church Engineering The National Religious Associations in 1912 China|first=Vincent|last=Goossaert|editor-first=Mayfair Mei-hui|editor-last=Yang|volume=|edition=|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|url=http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/34/08/38/PDF/UC_Yang_Goossaert.pdf|page=222|isbn=978-0-520-09864-0|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=8S69ULCTCani0gGll4GIDw&amp;id=1kggAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Hu+songshan+muslim&amp;q=+songshan#search_anchor|title=Archives de sciences sociales des religions, Issues 113-116|last=|first=|publisher=Centre national de la recherche scientifique (France)|others=Contributor Institut de sciences sociales des religions|year=2001|isbn=|edition=|volume=|location=|page=17|pages=|ref=harv|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=ALLÈS |first=ÉLISABETH |last2=CHÉRIF-CHEBBI |first2= LEÏLA|last3=HALFON |first3= CONSTANCE-HÉLÈNE|others=Translated from the French by Anne Evans|date=2003|title=Chinese Islam: Unity and Fragmentation |url= http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/31-1_007.pdf |archiveurl=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:pDnsCQgeZD4J:www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/31-1_007.pdf+suite+One+notable+leader+of+the+movement,+Imam+Hu+Songshan,+actively+supported+the+teaching+of+Chinese,+modern+subjects,+and+patriotism+in+Muslim+schools.&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShCeVTg0mFLmwvuyGt215K-BtO9VYthWo4jBFaDkn5jT60lghcS0VKzEfKNP_BZ8_YGMyCMBXZy5YSU73LtsP90YX4c13HG9Tj3537eJA8oXpYILKBH55KwQdp72NuvQWVG36F4&amp;sig=AHIEtbTtsNs371SGn4irbaSGmrQ4AeKdqQ|archivedate=March 2010|journal= Archives de Sciences Sociales des Religions |publisher= Keston Institute  |issn=0963-7494|volume=  31|issue=  1 |page=8 |doi= 10.1080/0963749032000045837 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://islaminchina.info/between-expectations-and-ideals-hui-women-finding-a-place-in-the-public-sphere-through-islamic-education/|title= Between Expectations and Ideals:Hui Women Finding a Place in the Public Sphere through Islamic Education |last1= Reiser |first1= Esther |last2= |first2= |date= July 2, 2011 |website= The Islam in China Project: A project on Sino-Islamic Art, History, Culture.

Hu encouraged unity and cooperation both between Muslims in China, and between non-Muslims and Muslims in China too, using Chinese classics to advance Chinese nationalism.

Students flocked to it from province across China after it became a public institution in the following year. Ten days prior to Ramadan's end in 1935, Ma Hongkui arranged for Chinese New Year celebrations. Hu Songshan pronounced kufr upon Ma Hongkui for this, while delivering an aggressive and fierce sermon in public. Ma Hongkui then sacked Hu from his position and exiled him. Hu then received clemency from Ma and was sent to head the Sino-Arabic Normal School in Wuzhong in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devout societies vs. impious states?: transmitting Islamic learning in Russia, Central Asia and China, through the twentieth century : proceedings of an international colloquium held in the Carré des Sciences, French Ministry of Research, Paris, November 12-13, 2001|editor-first=Stéphane A.|editor-last=Dudoignon|volume=Volume 258 of Islamkundliche Untersuchungen|edition=|year=2004|publisher=Schwarz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NyhtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Hu+songshan&amp;dq=Hu+songshan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wSy9UIXbFdKM0QH5_oCQCA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBw|page=67|isbn=3879973148|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeanne de Clisson''' (1300–1359), also known as '''Jeanne de Belleville''' and the '''Lioness of Brittany''', was a [[Breton people|Breton]] [[privateer]] who plied the [[English Channel]].

Jeanne Louise de Belleville, de Clisson, Dame de [[Montaigu, Vendée|Montaigu]], was born in 1300 in [[Belleville-sur-Vie]] in the [[Vendee]], a daughter of nobleman Maurice IV Montaigu of Belleville and [[Palluau]] (1263–1304) and Létice de Parthenay of [[Parthenay]] (1276–?) in the [[Gâtine Vendéenne]].

== Married at twelve ==
In 1312, Jeanne married her first husband, 19-year-old Geoffrey de [[Châteaubriant]] VIII (died 1326), a Breton nobleman, and had two children:
* Geoffrey IX (1314–1347), inherited his father's estates as Baron, died in the [[Battle of La Roche-Derrien]]; and
* Louise (1316–1383), married Guy XII de Laval and inherited her brother's estate as Baroness.

== Second marriage ==
In 1328, Jeanne married, Guy of Penthièvre [[:fr:Guy de Penthièvre|(''fr'')]] [[Counts and dukes of Penthièvre]], widower of Joan of [[Avaugour]] and son of the Duke of Brittany. Jeanne may have done this to protect her underage children.

===Intrigue and Annulment===
The union was short lived as relatives of the Ducal family in particular from the de Blois faction, laid a complaint with the bishops of Vannes and Rennes to protect their heritage and an investigation was conducted on February 10, 1330, resulting in the marriage being annulled by [[Pope John XXII]] in 1330. Guy then married into the de Blois faction to Maire de Blois who was also a niece of Phillip VI of France. Guy however unexpectedly died on the 26th March  1331 and his heritage passed to his daughter [[Joan, Duchess of Brittany|Jeanne of Penthièvre]].

== Third marriage ==
In 1330, Jeanne remarried to Olivier de Clisson IV, a wealthy Breton, holding a castle at [[Clisson]], a manor house in Nantes and lands at [[Blain, Loire-Atlantique|Blain]]. Olivier was initially married to Blanche de Bouville (died 1329).

Jeanne a recent widow herself of the lord of Chateaubriant controlled areas in Poitou just south of the Breton border from [[Beauvoir-sur-Mer]] in the west to [[Cheaumur]] in the southeast of Clisson. Combining these assets would make Jeanne and Olivier the seigneurial power (senior Lord of an area) in the [[March (territorial entity)|marches]]. Jeanne and Olivier had five children:

* Isabeau, (1325–1343) born out of wedlock, married John I of Rieux and therefore mother of [[Jean II de Rieux]] (died 1343) and
* Maurice, (1333–1334, in Blain)
* [[Olivier de Clisson|Olivier V]], (1336–1407),his father's successor, a future [[Constable of France]], nicknamed the butcher
* Guillaume, (1338–1345) died of exposure
* Jeanne, (1340–?) married Jean Harpedane, Lord of [[Montendre]] IV's successor.

== De Clissons choose sides ==
During the [[Breton War of Succession]], the de Clissons sided with the French choice for the empty Breton ducal crown, [[Charles de Blois]], against the English preference, [[John II of Montfort|John de Montfort]].

The extended de Clisson family was not in full agreement in this matter and  Olivier IV's brother, Amaury de Clisson embraced the de Montfort party.

== Intrigue of Vannes ==
In 1342, the English, after four attempts, captured [[Siege of Vannes (1342)|Vannes]]. Her husband Olivier and Hervé VII de Léon, the military commanders defending this city, were captured. Olivier was the only one released after an exchange for [[Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford]] (a prisoner of the French), and a surprisingly low sum was demanded. This led Olivier to be subsequently suspected of not having defended the city to his fullest, and he was alleged by Charles de Blois to be a traitor.

== Tournament and trial ==
On 19 January 1343, the Truce of [[Malestroit]] was signed between England and France. Under the perceived safe conditions of this truce, Olivier and fifteen other Breton lords were invited to a tournament on French soil, where he was arrested, taken to Paris, tried by his peers and on 2 August 1343, executed by beheading at [[Les Halles]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the year of our Grace one thousand three hundred and forty-three, on Saturday, the second day of August, Olivier, Lord of Clisson, knight, prisoner in the Chatelet of Paris for several treasons and other crimes perpetrated by him against the king and the crown of France, and for alliances that he made with the king of England, enemy of the king and kingdom of France, as the said Olivier ... has confessed, was by judgement of the king given at Orleans drawn from the Chatelet of Paris to Les Halles ... and there on a scaffold had his head cut off. And then from there his corpse was drawn to the gibbet of Paris and there hanged on the highest level; and his head was sent to [[Nantes]] in Brittany to be put on a lance over the Sauvetout gate as a warning to others.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Treason and Treason Trials in Later Medieval France'' (''Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought'': Third Series). 18 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This execution shocked the nobility as the evidence of guilt was not publicly demonstrated, and the process of exposing a body was reserved mainly for low-class criminals. This execution was judged harshly by [[Froissart]] and his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/index.jsp|title=The Online Froissart|website=www.hrionline.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Exécution d'Olivier IV de Clisson (1343).jpg|thumb|300px|Execution of Olivier IV de Clisson. Painting attributed to Loyset Liédet,
Flemish illuminator (v.1420-v.1483) in the "Chronicles of Lord Jehan Froissart ]]

== Shock and revenge ==
Jeanne took her two young sons, Olivier and Guillaume, from Clisson to Nantes, to show them the head of their father at the Sauvetout gate.

Jeanne, enraged by her husband's execution, swore retribution against the French King, [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], and Charles de Blois. She considered their actions a cowardly murder.

== Change of allegiances ==
Jeanne then sold the de Clisson estates, raised a  force of loyal men and started attacking French forces in Brittany.

Jeanne is said to have attacked a castle at Touffou  and a castle occupied by Galois de la Heuse, an officer of Charles de Blois, massacring the entire garrison with the exception of one individual.

Jeanne also attacked another garrison at [[Château-Thébaud]], about 20&amp;nbsp;km south east of Nantes which had been a former post under control of her husband.

== Black Fleet ==
With the English king's assistance and Breton sympathizers, Jeanne outfitted three warships. These were painted black and their sails dyed red. The flagship was named ''My Revenge''. The ships of this Black Fleet then patrolled the English Channel hunting down French ships, whereupon her force would kill entire crews, leaving only a few witnesses to transmit the news to the French King. This earned Jeanne the moniker "The Lioness of Brittany". Jeanne continued her piracy in the channel for another 13 years.

Jeanne is also said to have attacked coastal villages in Normandy and have put several to sword and fire. In 1346, during the [[Battle of Crecy]], south of [[Calais]], in northern France, Jeanne used her ships to supply the English forces.

After the sinking of her flagship, Jeanne with her two sons were adrift for five days, her son Guillaume died of exposure. Jeanne and Olivier were finally rescued and taken to [[Morlaix]] by Montfort supporters.

== Fourth marriage ==
In 1356, Jeanne married for a fourth time to [[Sir Walter Bentley (soldier)|Sir Walter Bentley]], one of [[King Edward III]]'s military deputies during the campaign. Bentley had previously won the [[battle of Mauron]] on 4 August 1352 and was rewarded for his services with "the lands and castles" Beauvoir-sur-mer, of Ampant, of Barre, Blaye, Châteauneuf, Ville Maine, the island Chauvet and from the islands of Noirmoutier and Bouin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_mauron.html|title=Battle of Mauron, 14 August 1352 (Brittany)|website=www.historyofwar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeanne finally settled at the Castle of [[Hennebont]], a port town on the Brittany coast, which was in the territory of her de Montfort allies, where she died in 1359.

== Historical evidence ==
Verifiable references relating to Jeanne’s exploits are limited, but do exist. These include:

* A French judgement from 1343 convicting Jeanne as a traitor and confirmed the confiscation of the de Clisson lands.
* Records from the English court from 1343, indicating King Edward granting Jeanne an income from lands controlled in Brittany by the English.
* Jeanne is mentioned in the truce between France and England in 1347 as an English ally. (Treaty of Calais, 28 September 1347)&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, J. A. ''Encyclopedia of the Hundred Years War'' {{ISBN|0-313-32736-X}}, Greenwood Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 15th-century manuscript, known as the ''Chronographia Regum Francorum'', confirms some of the details of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Régis Rech. "[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-the-medieval-chronicle/chronographia-regum-francorum-SIM_00727 Chronographia regum Francorum]". ''Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle''. Edited by Graeme Dunphy. Brill Online, 2014. 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amaury de Clisson, the brother of Olivier, is used as an emissary from [[Joanna of Flanders]] (Jehanne de Montfort) to ask King Edward III for aid to relieve Hennebont. The de Clisson family was at that stage definitely on the de Montfort side.
* Records exist where shortly after Olivier de Clisson's execution, several other knights were accused of similar crimes. The lord of Malestroit and his son, the lord of Avaugour, sir Tibaut de Morillon, and other lords of Brittany, to the number of ten knights and squires, were beheaded at Paris. Four other knights of Normandy, sir William Baron, sir Henry de Malestroit, the lord of Rochetesson, and Sir Richard de Persy, were put to death upon reports.
* The name of Jeanne de Belleville is also attached to the Breviary of Belleville, a book of prayers that follow the liturgical year. This manuscript in Latin and in French and in two volumes dated around 1323-1326 with illuminations by Jean Pucelle . Jeanne de Belleville would have received it as a gift for her wedding with Olivier in 1328. Around 1379-1380, an inventory was made of King Charles V property and the breviary was described herein.
* Great Chronicles of France, t.5, of John (II) the Good to Charles (V) the Wise (1350/1380);
* Latin chronicle of Guillaume de Nangis and his continuations, (1317/1368);
* Chronicles of the first four Valois, (1327/1393)
* Chronicles of Mont-Saint-Michel, t.1 (1343/1432)

== Literature ==
In 1868, French writer Émile Pehant's novel ''Jeanne de Belleville'' was published in France.  Written at the height of the French romantic movement, Pehant's novel shares many details with the legend attached to Jeanne.

She began her comedy career as a regular improviser and sketch performer at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York and Los Angeles, originally as a member of the improv team "Mother". Her first major television work was as a regular panelist on the [[VH1]] series ''[[Best Week Ever]]'', offering comedic insights on pop-culture and the news of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestweekever.tv/tag/Jessica+St.+Clair|title=Latest Celebrity Gossip, Celebrity News, Entertainment News - VH1|website=VH1 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She co-starred in the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[In the Motherhood]]'' in 2009.

St. Clair has gained notice for her frequent guest appearances (often alongside performing partner [[Lennon Parham]]) on podcasts such as ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'', where she plays the show's teenage intern Marissa Wompler. In 2015, St. Clair and Parham spun-off their characters in a new [[Earwolf]] podcast called ''[[Womp It Up!|WOMP It Up!]]'', with St. Clair as host Marissa Wompler and Parham co-hosting as Marissa's teacher Miss Listler. Frequent guests on the podcast include [[Brian Huskey]] as Marissa's stepdad "Seth" and [[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Marissa's former flame Eric "Gutterballs" Gutterman. The podcast ran through the summer of 2015, returning after a hiatus on November 16, 2015.

St. Clair and frequent collaborator [[Lennon Parham]] created and starred in the [[NBC]] comedy series ''[[Best Friends Forever (TV series)|Best Friends Forever]]'', which premiered on April 4, 2012 and aired for one season. St. Clair and Parham created and starred in their second comedy ''[[Playing House (TV series)|Playing House]]'', which premiered on [[USA Network|USA]] on April 29, 2014 and concluded its final, third season in July 2017.

St. Clair has had recurring roles on television programs such as ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]'', ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', ''[[The McCarthys]]'', ''[[Marry Me (U.S. TV series)|Marry Me]]'', ''[[American Housewife]]'', ''[[Worst Week]]'', and ''[[United States of Tara]]''. She was also part of the recurring cast on the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Review (TV series)|Review]]'', playing the role of Suzanne, the long-suffering wife of host Forrest MacNeil (played by [[Andy Daly]]). St. Clair's notable work in film includes supporting roles in ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'', ''[[She's Out of My League]]'', ''[[Afternoon Delight (film)|Afternoon Delight]]'', and ''[[Enough Said (film)|Enough Said]]''.

In 2015, St. Clair said she and Lennon Parham had both learned [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corridan |first1=Kara |title=A Convo with Two Really Cool Moms |url=http://www.parents.com/parents-magazine/parents-perspective/a-convo-with-two-really-cool-moms/ |website=Parents |accessdate=18 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bddWQKys?url=http://www.parents.com/parents-magazine/parents-perspective/a-convo-with-two-really-cool-moms/ |archivedate=18 September 2015 |date=2015 |quote=Lennon’s husband worked at a school where they taught transcendental meditation and took time out of the school day to meditate. … So Lennon and I learned meditation ... through the David Lynch Foundation, and we try and meditate at least once a day. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, St. Clair revealed that she had undergone treatment for [[breast cancer]] after being diagnosed in September 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actress Jessica St. Clair Opens Up About Her Breast Cancer Diagnosis|url=http://www.standup2cancer.org/blog/view/actress_jessica_st_clair_opens_up_about_her_breast_cancer_diagnosis|date=May 9, 2017|work=Stand Up To Cancer|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was incorporated into the third season of ''Playing House,'' when her character Emma was similarly diagnosed.

'''Kosoko''' (died 1872) was a member of the [[Ologun Kutere]] Lagos Royal Family who reigned as [[Oba of Lagos]] from 1845 to 1851. His father was Oba [[Osinlokun]] and his siblings were [[Idewu Ojulari]] (who was Oba from 1829 to 1834/35) and Opo Olu, a wealthy and powerful female slave holder.&lt;ref name="Mann-45"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Kristin|title=Slavery and the Birth of an African City: Lagos, 1760–1900|publisher=Indiana University Press, 2007|isbn=9780253348845|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascendancy==
Kosoko's ascendancy to the Obaship of Lagos in 1845 was predated by a series of dramatic events.

===Rift between the Osinlokun and Adele lines===
When Oba [[Ologun Kutere]] died (between 1800 and 1805), a succession struggle ensued between his older son (Osinlokun) and his younger and preferred son (Adele). Though the kingship was not determined by birth order but by Kingmakers and a consultation of the [[Ifá|Ifa Oracle]], Osinlokun and his followers mounted opposition to Adele's kingship.&lt;ref name="Smith-Struggle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851–1861|publisher=University of California Press, 1979|isbn=9780520037465|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adele's reign was then cut short in 1821 by his older brother, Osinlokun, around 1821, forcing Adele to exile to [[Badagry]] where he assumed headship of the town.

===Genesis of Kosoko's feud with Eletu Odibo===
Kosoko offended the powerful prime minister ([[Eletu Odibo]])and Kingmaker by marrying a woman betrothed to Chief Eletu Odibo.&lt;ref name="Mann-Odibo-Kosoko"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Kristin|title=Slavery and the Birth of an African City: Lagos, 1760—1900|publisher=Indiana University Press, 2007|isbn=9780253117083|pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eletu Odibo, as head of the Akarigbere class of chiefs, was vested with the authority to oversee the selection and installation of obas. Kosoko's arrogant decision would come to haunt his bid for the throne as Chief Eletu Odibo took great offense and the feud between both men altered the Obaship succession many times and set the stage for British intervention in Lagos later in 1851.&lt;ref name="Mann-Odibo-Kosoko" /&gt;

===Osinlokun's death, Idewu Ojulari's short term, and manifestation of the Eletu and Kosoko feud===
When Osinlokun died in 1829, Kosoko's brother, Idewu Ojulari, became Oba and reigned from 1829 to around 1834/5. However, Idewu Ojulari's reign was unpopular and at the behest of the [[Oba of Benin]], to whom the people of Lagos had petitioned, Idewu Ojulari committed suicide. Notably, Lagos had hitherto been under Benin suzerainty up until the reign of Oba Kosoko who was dethroned by British forces in 1851. Thereafter, Oba Akitoye and his successor, Oba Dosunmu, rebuffed payment of annual tributes to Benin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851–1861|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0333240545|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryder|first1=Alan Frederick Charles|title=Benin and the Europeans: 1485–1897|publisher=Humanities Press, 1969 – Benin|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Kosoko was now unacceptable to Eletu Odibo, the Kingmakers invited Adele home from Badagry to rule as Oba of Lagos for a second term. Oba Adele's second reign terminated upon his death in 1837 and again, Eletu Odibo blocked Kosoko's accession and installed [[Oluwole]], Adele's son.

===Increased strife between Kosoko and Eletu Odibo's allies===
The intensity of the Eletu Odibo and Kosoko feud increased with Eletu Odibo extending his vendetta to Opo Olu, Kosoko's sister, accusing her of witchcraft.&lt;ref name="Mann-Odibo-Kosoko" /&gt; The diviners found Opo Olu innocent however Oba Oluwole banished Opo Olu from Lagos, leading Kosoko and his followers to pursue a failed armed uprising known as Ogun Ewe Koko ("leaves of the coco-yam war") which resulted in Kosoko and his followers fleeing to Epe.&lt;ref name="Smith-Struggle" /&gt;

Eletu Odibo then ratcheted up the hatred between both camps by digging up Kosoko's mother's remains and throwing her corpse into the Lagos lagoon.&lt;ref name="Mann-Odibo-Kosoko" /&gt;

===Oba Oluwole's death and Akitoye's ascendancy===
Oba [[Oluwole]] was killed in 1841 when lighting triggered an explosion at the Oba's place. Oluwole's body was blown to pieces and could only be identified by his royal beads adorning his body. Kingmakers would have invited Kosoko to become Oba but his whereabouts were unknown. &lt;ref name="Smith-Struggle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann-Odibo-Kosoko" /&gt; Consequently, [[Akitoye]], Kosoko's uncle, younger brother to Osinlokun &amp; Adele, and son of [[Ologun Kutere]] was installed as Oba of Lagos.

===Akitoye's naivety and Kosoko's revenge ===
In an attempt at reconciliation (met with fierce resistance from chiefs, not least Eletu Odibo) with his nephew, Oba Akitoye naively recalled Kosoko to Lagos. Kosoko returned to Lagos aboard the ship of the famous slave trader Jose Domingo Martinez. Akitoye tried to placate Kosoko with gifts and granted him the title Oloja of Ereko or owner of Ereko. Kosoko quickly consolidated his position and found support among many war chiefs and among the Muslim community. Eletu Odibo was concerned with Kosoko's power consolidation and departed for Badagry. In turn, Akitoye recalled Eletu Odibo from Badagry, leading Kosoko to declare that if Eletu Odibo returned to Lagos, he would "make himself king".

A war of words ensued between Oba Akitoye and Kosoko sending his crier around Lagos singing "Tell that little child at court yonder to be careful; for if he is not careful he will be punished". Akitoye deployed his crier singing "I am like a pin firmly driven into the ground, which is always hard to root out but ever remains firm". Kosoko retorted "I am the digger who always roots out a pin".&lt;ref name="Mann-Odibo-Kosoko" /&gt;

The tensions led to an rising named Ogun Olomiro (Salt Water War) by the Kosoko faction in July 1845. The Kosoko faction laid siege to the Oba's Palace for three weeks. Akitoye eventually accepted defeat, escaped up the lagoon to the north, and was granted safe passage through the Agboyi Creek by [[Oshodi Tapa]], Kosoko's war captain. Oshodi Tapa explained Akitoye's escape to Kosoko by saying that Akitoye put his enemies in a trance. Akitoye thereafter arrived in Abeokuta where he was granted asylum.&lt;ref name="Smith-Struggle" /&gt; Recognizing Akitoye's escape as a threat, Kosoko demanded Akitoye's head from the Egbas who refused Kosoko's demands. In March 1845, the Egbas provided the now deposed Akitoye with an escort to Badagry, the traditional town of refuge for Lagosians where he rallied his followers and built a partnership with European missionaries and with the British through their Consul [[John Beecroft]].

Importantly, Eletu Odibo was captured in the battle and Kosoko avenged the scattering of his mother's bones by the Eletu by placing Eletu Odibo in an empty oil barrel, sealing it, setting it alight, and dumping it in the Lagos Lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Patrick|title=Modern and Traditional Elites in the Politics of Lagos|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 1975|isbn=9780521204392|page=195 n39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann-Odibo-Kosoko" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JHK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herskovits Kopytoff|first1=Jean|title=A Preface to Modern Nigeria: The "Sierra Leoneans" in Yoruba, 1830 – 1890|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British intervention in Lagos, Kosoko's removal and Akitoye's re-installation as Oba==
A confluence of interests in Lagos from the now deposed Akitoye who allied himself with the anti-slavery cause in order to get British support, the Anglican missionaries in Badagry who were in contact with Akitoye, and Egba and European traders who wanted freer movement of goods ratcheted up British intervention in Lagos.  Akitoye's anti-slavery position appears born of self-interest considering his connection with the well known slave trader Domingo Martinez who backed Akitoyes's unsuccessful attack on Lagos in 1846.

In November 1851 a British party met with Oba Kosoko to present a proposal of British friendly relations along with giving up the [[Trans Atlantic Slave Trade]]. The proposal was rejected by Kosoko "on the technical reason that Lagos was under the [[Oba of Benin]] and that it was only that Oba who could deal with foreign powers concerning the status of Lagos"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Onabamiro|first1=Sanya|title=Glimpses Into Nigerian History: Historical Essays|publisher=Macmillan Nigeria, 1983|isbn=9789781327292|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dioka|first1=L.C.|title=Lagos and Its Environs|publisher=First Academic, 2001|isbn=9789783490253|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 1851, upon Kosoko's successful repulsion and defeat of British forces, Consul Beecroft wrote to the [[Oba of Benin]] declaring that "Kosoko, by opening fire on a flag of truce, had declared war on England" and therefore had to be replaced by Akitoye. He threatened that Kosoko had till the end of the month to surrender otherwise "Lagos would be totally destroyed by fire". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851–1861|publisher=University of California Press, 1979|isbn=9780520037465|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 December 1851, in what is now known as the [[Bombardment of Lagos]] or [[Reduction of Lagos]], ''HMS Bloodhound'', ''HMS Teazer'', and a flotilla of boats mounted an attack on the Oba's palace. Kosoko put up a spirited defense but by 28 December 1851 the battle known locally as Ogun Ahoyaya or Ogun Agidingbi (after boiling cannons) was over with Kosoko and his followers fleeing to Ijebu. Akitoye was now installed Oba of Lagos with British support.

On 1 January 1852 Akitoye signed the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] abolishing the slave trade.

==Kosoko in exile at Epe==
Kosoko eventually settled in Epe with the permission of the Awujale of Ijebu. Epe was the place where about 15 years earlier a number of his followers such as his chiefs Dada Antonio and Osho Akanbi had taken refuge. By 1852, Kosoko had built up an independent base with about 400 warriors (including [[Oshodi Tapa]]) to mount his opposition to Akitoye.

In 1853 Kosoko mounted two attacks on Lagos; one on 5 August 1853 and another on 11 August 1853 which came dangerously close to the Oba's palace but was rebuffed just in time by a burst of fire from the British naval force under Commander Phillips of HMS Polyphemus.

Kosoko eventually signed [[The Treaty of Epe]] on 28 September 1854 with Consul [[Benjamin Campbell (consular agent)|Benjamin Campbell]], agreeing not to make any claims to Lagos or to endanger commerce in Lagos. The treaty was a tactical success for Kosoko who got the British to recognize his state in Epe. In the big picture, however, the Lagos throne remained out of reach with Akitoye and Dosunmu's descendants firmly rooted.

==Kosoko's return to Lagos after Annexation as a Crown Colony in 1861==
In 1860, Kosoko persuaded the [[Oba of Benin]] to send messages to Dosunmu pressing him to allow Kosoko's return to Lagos. Dosunmu, now under British authority, refused this request and noted that things were "not as in former times when Lagos was under the King of Benin to whom annually a tribute was paid" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851–1861|publisher=University of California Press, 1979|isbn=9780520037465|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Britain annexed Lagos via the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession|Treaty of 1861]], Kosoko was allowed to return to Lagos with the title of Oloja of Ereko, receiving a pension of £400 annually. Oshodi Tapa, settled in Epetedo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851–1861|publisher=University of California Press, 1979|isbn=9780520037465|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Kosoko died in 1872 and was buried at Iga Ereko in Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851–1861|publisher=University of California Press, 1979|isbn=9780520037465|page=175 n 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kosoko-Akitoye/Dosunmu rivalry spilled over into the economic realm. Oba Dosunmu's supporters didn't fully appreciate the British presence in Lagos, while Kosoko's allies exploited the relationship. Kosoko's camp comprised men such as [[Oshodi Tapa]] and  [[Taiwo Olowo]], who enthusiastically entered into trade with European firms. At the head of the Dosunmu economic faction was Chief Apena Ajasa, who repeatedly clashed with Taiwo Olowo. When Kosoko died, the colonial government estimated that his economic faction was the more powerful one due to the fact that it was composed of at least 20,000 followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Patrick|title=Modern and Traditional Elites in the Politics of Lagos|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 1975|isbn=9780521204392|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent descendant of his is [[Oba (ruler)#Oloye|Omoba]] [[Jide Kosoko]], a noted [[Nollywood]] actor.

'''Krystyna Ceynowa''', also spelled as ''Cejnowa'' (died 1836), was an ethnic Polish victim of [[murder]] by [[lynching]] and an alleged [[Witchcraft|witch]] in [[Germany]]. Accused of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], she was subjected to the [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]] of water and drowned in [[Chałupy|Ceynowa]] (today Chałupy). She was among the last people in [[Europe]] to be subjected to [[lynching]] on the grounds of sorcery and witchcraft. 

== Background ==
Krystyna Ceynowa was the [[widow]] of a [[fisherman]], living at [[Chałupy|Ceynowa]] on the [[Hel Peninsula]], in the German [[Province of Prussia]]. She was regarded as suspicious by the community for various reasons, including the fact that she never went to church, and it was said that black [[crow]]s were attracted to her [[chimney]] .This gave her a bad reputation in the eyes of the congregation and people suspected that she was a witch. However, the authorities at that time were not willing to conduct a witch trial.

== The murder ==

She was taken captive by a lynch mob determined to test her to see if she was a witch. Her suppressors were called from [[Sopot|Zoppot]], and she was subjected to the ordeal of water during an illegal trial. The ordeal took place in the [[Baltic Sea]] - she was transported in a boat and thrown overboard. To the disbelief of many, she remained afloat for a long time, which was taken as an evidence of witchcraft, whereas nobody thought that her gown and skirt had acted as a buoy. When Ceynowa did not drown, the people found her to be a real witch and killed her with their paddles.

Her case demonstrates that a belief in witchcraft continued among the public long after the legal authorities stopped accepting the charges of witchcraft, and that people occasionally took the law into their own hands when they suspected witchcraft.

== Countries/Territories by number of finalists ==
=== 1st runner-up ===
The first runner-up of each edition of Miss Universe is the second placer behind the candidate who is crowned as Miss Universe.
In some cases, she shall take over the title of Miss Universe, if:
* The outgoing titleholder cannot fulfill her duties. This could happen and may result to resignation, giving up the title, or dethronement
* The titleholder is dethroned due to deeds that violate the organization's policies.
This has only happened in [[Miss Universe 2002|2002]].

There were instances that the winner is not replaced by the first runner-up, when she decides to voluntarily resign from her position, given the formal permission from the organization (1952 and 1974).

This table lists the number of 1st runner-up titles by country. There are some special considerations:
* [[Hawaii]] competed as an independent territory from 1952 to 1959, before it joined the United States, holding one 1st runner-up title on its own.
* The [[United Kingdom]] (currently competing under the name of ''Great Britain'') competed separatedly as England (from 1955 to 1962 and then again from 1964 to 1990), Scotland (from 1961 to 1986 and then again from 1988 to 1990) and Wales (from 1961 to 1990), holding a total of four 1st runner-up titles which are counted together.
* As [[Panama]] took over the Miss Universe title in [[Miss Universe 2002|2002]], it is unknown if the 1st runner-up position was taken by another candidate after the succession took place.

=== 2nd runner-up ===
The second runner-up of each edition of Miss Universe is the third placer behind the candidate who is crowned as Miss Universe and the first runner-up (second placer).
Although it has never happened, the second runner-up is supposed to take over the Miss Universe title if both the original winner and the first runner-up are unable to fulfill their duties/resign their titles. For example, if a Miss Universe winner is required to give up her title and the first runner-up is unable/does not want to assume the winner's position, the title then passes to the second runner-up.

This table lists the number of 2nd runner-up titles by country. There are some special considerations as well:
* [[Hawaii]] competed as an independent territory from 1952 to 1959, before it joined the United States, holding one 2nd runner-up title on its own.
* The [[United Kingdom]] (currently competing under the name of ''Great Britain'') competed separatedly as England (from 1955 to 1962 and then again from 1964 to 1990), Scotland (from 1961 to 1986 and then again from 1988 to 1990) and Wales (from 1961 to 1990), holding a total of five 2nd runner-up titles which are counted together.
* It is unknown if Zhuo Ling, [[Miss Universe 2002]] second runner-up, took over the first runner-up position after Justine Pasek took over the winner's place, as no official statements regarding this matter were made by the organization.

This list documents all 998 mythical, historical and notable women whose names are displayed on the handmade white tiles of the ''Heritage Floor'' as part of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' art installation (1979); there is also one man listed, [[Kresilas]], who was mistakenly included in the installation as he was thought to have been a woman called Cresilla. The names appear as they are spelled on the floor. Since 2007 the installation has been on permanent exhibition in the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York.

'''Lock Martin''' (October 12, 1916&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; January 19, 1959) was the stage name of American actor '''Joseph Lockard Martin Jr.''' He is best remembered for playing the robot [[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Gort]] in ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951).

He was from [[Pennsylvania]] and had a series of odd jobs before going into acting.  He was working as a [[bouncer (doorman)|doorman]] at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] when he was hired for the role of Gort, although this was not his first acting job. He was reportedly 7 feet 7&amp;nbsp;inches tall (about 231&amp;nbsp;cm); however [[Robert Wise]], director of ''The Day The Earth Stood Still'', states his height was 7 feet 1&amp;nbsp;inch in the DVD commentary. His great height did not translate into strength and he had difficulty managing his robot suit. For scenes where he was supposed to physically lift [[Patricia Neal]] and [[Michael Rennie]], they were either held up by wires, a hidden dolly or replaced with lightweight dummies.

He was also in ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'' as a giant, but his scenes were deleted. He was nicknamed "the Gentle Giant" as he liked reading stories to children and for a time had a local show devoted to that.

Martin was married to Ethel Babcock from 1946 until his death in 1959.

'''Lorraine Bethel''' is an [[African-American]] [[lesbian]] [[feminist]] [[poet]] and [[author]]. She is a graduate of [[Yale University]].  Bethel has taught and lectured on black women's literature and black female culture at various institutions. She currently works as a [[freelance]] [[journalist]] in [[New York City]].  She participated in the [[Combahee River Collective]], an organization that was part of the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] in the 1960s and 1970s.  The Combahee River Collective was a black feminist group founded in [[Boston]] in 1974.  It fought against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression.

In an issue of ''[[off our backs]]'', a feminist news journal, a participant recounts her experience in the 3rd World Lesbian Writers Conference on February 24, 1979 at New York City's Women's Center, in which Lorraine Bethel and [[Barbara Smith]] moderated one of the five workshops available.  In their workshop, called "Third World Feminist Criticism", Bethel and Smith discussed various topics such as the definition of "criticism", criticism as a "creative" art, white feminism versus black feminism, intersectional feminism, and the unification of black lesbians.

Later that year, in November 1979, Lorraine Bethel and Barbara Smith guest-edited "The Black Women's Issue" of ''[[Conditions (magazine)|Conditions]]: Five'', a literary magazine primarily for black lesbian women.  In the introduction, it is stated that the issue "disproves the 'non-existence' of Black feminist and Black lesbian writers and challenges forever our invisibility, particularly in the feminist press." (''Conditions: Five'').  Bethel wrote the poem, "What Chou Mean We, White Girl? Or, The Cullud Lesbian Feminist Declaration of Independence", which was published in this issue.  Deborah E. McDowell states in a review that this poem "confronts head-on the hostility that black feminists often feel for their white counterparts" (McDowell).

'''Lynne Segal''' (born 29 March 1944)&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; is an Australian-born, British-based [[Socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] academic and activist, author of many books and articles, and participant in many campaigns, from local community to international. She has taught in higher education in London, England since 1970, at [[Middlesex University|Middlesex Polytechnic]] from 1973. In 1999 she was appointed Anniversary Professor of Psychology and Gender Studies at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], where she now works in the School of Psychosocial Studies.&lt;ref name="Podcast" /&gt;

==Early life==
Segal is the daughter of Iza and Reuben Segal, who were both physicians. Her brother Graeme is a mathematician, her sister Barbara a baroque dancer. She was born in Sydney, and studied psychology at [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]], obtaining her PhD in 1969, while immersed in the anti-authoritarian milieu of the Sydney Libertarians (known as '[[Sydney Push|The Push]]'), and has always remained within the libertarian wing of Left politics.

==Emigration to London==
She emigrated to London in 1970 and for the next decade her main energies went into grass roots politics in [[Islington]], North London, helping to set up and run a women's centre, an alternative newspaper, the ''Islington Gutter Press'', and supporting [[Anti-racism|anti-racist politics]]. It was a decade in which the extra-party Left was on the ascendant, but divided structurally and ideologically.

In 1979, the three friends, Segal, [[Sheila Rowbotham]] and [[Hilary Wainwright]] wrote ''Beyond the Fragments'',&lt;ref name="Fragments" /&gt; arguing for broader alliances among trade unionists, feminists and left political groups.  Its argument quickly won a large following leading to a major conference in [[Leeds]], Yorkshire, in 1980 and a second edition in 1981.  In 1984, publisher [[Ursula Owen]] invited her to join the [[Virago Press|Virago]] Advisory Board and write an appraisal of the state of feminism, resulting in her first book, ''Is the Future Female? Troubled Thoughts on Contemporary Feminism''.&lt;ref name="FutureFemale" /&gt; This book reached a broad audience, with its questioning of gender mythologies, whether of women's intrinsic virtues, or men's inevitable rapaciousness, which had been appearing in the work of many popular feminist writers in the 1980s.

Reflecting her socialist feminist milieu, Segal argued that feminists always needed to confront the ubiquitous negation of the 'feminine', but women's battles could neither be reduced simply to battles with men, nor solved purely by revaluing the 'feminine'.&lt;ref name="Violence" /&gt; All Segal's consequent books have argued for a more inclusive form of [[left-feminism]], arguing for a more compassionate and egalitarian world.&lt;ref name="Family" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Exposed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agendas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WhyFeminism" /&gt; Her next book, ''Slow Motion: Changing Masculinities, Changing Men''&lt;ref name="SlowMotion" /&gt; rejected the equating of '[[male sexuality]]' with 'male violence', noting the complexity of forces generating very differing patterns of masculinity across time and place. Discussing the volatile fluidity of sexual experience, the same theoretical perspectives appeared in ''Straight Sex: The Politics of Pleasure''.&lt;ref name="Straight" /&gt; There she deconstructs the notion of male activity and [[female passivity]] that underpin normative understandings of heterosexuality, and serve to shore up the language and practices of male dominance. In 2007 Segal published ''Making Trouble: Life and Politics, a Political Memoir''&lt;ref name="Trouble" /&gt; covering her generation of post-war activists, pondering what has become of their politics in the grimmer, more divided world of the 21st century.

She has a son, Zimri Segal, working in design technology. Segal has lived in Islington, North London since she arrived from Sydney. Since 2000, she has worked, as a secular Jew, with [[Jews for Justice for Palestinians]], [[Independent Jewish Voices]] and [[Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace]] (FFIPP) engaged in efforts to end the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli occupation of Palestinian land]] and create a just [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|peace between Israel and Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

==Political views==
Segal is a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] member of the [[Islington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington North]] [[Constituency Labour Party]]&lt;ref name="jewishvoiceforlabour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/jvl/a-jvl-statement-on-the-current-attacks-on-jeremy-corbyn/|title=A statement from Jewish Labour members on the current attacks on Jeremy Corbyn|publisher=Jewish Voice for Labour|date=26 March 2018|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Highbury East branch.&lt;ref name="theguardian3"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/05/antisemitism-on-the-left-and-jeremy-corbyn|title= Antisemitism on the left and Jeremy Corbyn |work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=5 April 2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, she was one of 82 Jewish members and supporters of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Labour Party leadership of Jeremy Corbyn|leadership]] who wrote an open letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' stating that they "do not accept that antisemitism is 'rife' in the Labour party" and that "these accusations are part of a wider campaign against the Labour leadership, and they have been timed particularly to do damage to the Labour party and its prospects in [[United Kingdom local elections, 2016|elections in the coming week]]."&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/labour-antisemitism-and-where-jeremy-corbyn-goes-from-here|title=Labour, antisemitism and where Jeremy Corbyn goes from here|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, she was one of 40 senior academics who wrote an open letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' condemning what they called anti-Corbyn bias in media coverage of [[Antisemitism in the Labour Party|the antisemitism debate]] saying it was "framed in such a way as to mystify the real sources of [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] bigotry and to weaponise it against a single political figure just ahead of [[United Kingdom local elections, 2018|important elections]]."&lt;ref name="theguardian2"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/02/stop-jeremy-corbyns-trial-by-media-over-antisemitism|title=Stop Jeremy Corbyn’s trial by media over antisemitism|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2 April 2018|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maddy Coy''' is the deputy director of the [[London Metropolitan University#Faculties and schools|Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit (CWASU), London Metropolitan University]] and has collaborated with the [[End Violence Against Women Coalition]] (EVAW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Maddy Coy |url= http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/faculties/faculty-of-social-sciences-and-humanities/people/surnames-a-to-c/maddy-coy/ | publisher= [[London Metropolitan University#Faculties and schools|Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit (CWASU), London Metropolitan University]] | accessdate = 7 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Prior to becoming a researcher, Coy worked for several years with sexually exploited girls and women. She has published a number of articles and book chapters on the sex industry, including links between local authority care and sexual exploitation, women's experiences of selling sex and men's motivations for buying sex. More recently Coy has focused on developing a gendered analysis of sexualised popular culture, including how this might be addressed in popular approaches and everyday practice with young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Ellis | first1 = Jane | last2 = Thiara | first2 = Ravi K. | contribution = Notes on contributors | editor-last1 = Ellis | editor-first1 = Jane | editor-last2 = Thiara | editor-first2 = Ravi K. | title = Preventing violence against women and girls: educational work with children and young people | page = ix | publisher = Policy Press | location = Bristol, UK Chicago, Illinois, USA | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781447307310 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marco Antonio Rubio''' (born May 28, 1971) is an American politician, attorney, and the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] for the State of [[Florida]]. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Rubio previously served as [[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives]]. Rubio unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016, winning presidential primaries in the State of Minnesota, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

Rubio is a [[Cuban American]] from [[Miami]], Florida. After serving as a [[City commission government|City Commissioner]] for [[West Miami]] in the 1990s, he was elected to represent the 111th district in the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 2000. Subsequently, he was elected [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the Florida House, and was Speaker for two years beginning in November 2006. Upon leaving the Florida legislature in 2008 due to term limits, Rubio started a new [[law firm]] and taught at [[Florida International University]].

Rubio successfully [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2010|ran for United States Senate]] in 2010. In April 2015, Rubio announced that he would forego seeking reelection to the Senate to [[Marco Rubio presidential campaign, 2016|run for President]]. He suspended his campaign for President on March 15, 2016 after losing the Florida [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican primary]] to the eventual winner of the presidential election, [[Donald Trump]]. On June 22, Rubio reversed his decision not to seek reelection to the Senate; he went on to defeat [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Patrick Murphy (Florida politician)|Patrick Murphy]] in the [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2016|2016 U.S. Senate election in Florida]].

Rubio will become Florida's senior senator when [[Bill Nelson]] leaves office in January 2019.

==Florida House of Representatives==
[[File:Marco Rubio and Mario Diaz-Balart in the House chamber.jpg|thumb|right|Rubio and [[Mario Díaz-Balart]] in 2001]]

===Elections and concurrent employment===

In late 1999, a [[By-election|special election]] was called to fill the seat for the 111th House District in the [[Florida House of Representatives]], representing Miami.

Rubio spent almost nine years in the Florida House of Representatives. Since the Florida legislative session officially lasted only 60 days, he was able to spend about half of each year in Miami, where he worked first at a law firm that specialized in land use and zoning, and later starting in 2004, took a position with [[Broad and Cassel]], a Miami law and lobbying firm, though state law precluded him from engaging in lobbying or introducing legislation on behalf of the firm's clients.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hamburger, Tom|author2=Sullivan, Sean|date=June 29, 2015|title=How Marco Rubio turned political star power into a soaring personal income|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-marco-rubio-turned-political-star-power-into-a-soaring-personal-income/2015/06/29/8cdae1aa-13a8-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure in legislature===
[[File:Marco Rubio.jpg|thumb|Rubio's official portrait as a State Representative]]
At the time Rubio took his seat in the legislature in [[Tallahassee]] in January 2000, voters in Florida had recently approved a constitutional amendment on [[term limits]]. This created openings for new legislative leaders due to many senior incumbents having to retire.  According to an article in ''[[National Journal]]'', Rubio also gained an extra advantage in that regard, because he was sworn in early due to the special election, and he would take advantage of these opportunities to join the GOP leadership.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;

====Majority whip and majority leader====
Later in 2000, the [[majority leader]] of the House, [[Mike Fasano (politician)|Mike Fasano]], promoted Rubio to be one of two majority [[whip (politics)|whips]].&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;  ''National Journal'' described that position as typically requiring a lot of arm-twisting, but said Rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;

Fasano resigned in September 2001 as majority leader of the House due to disagreements with the House speaker, and the speaker passed over Rubio to appoint a more experienced replacement for Fasano.  Rubio volunteered to work on [[redistricting]], which he accomplished by dividing the state into five regions, then working individually with the lawmakers involved, and this work helped to cement his relationships with GOP leaders.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;

In December 2002, Rubio was appointed House Majority Leader by Speaker [[Johnnie Byrd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F7DC37DA1706DF7&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Dade Hispanics Set to Get Top Posts in House|publisher=Nl.newsbank.com|accessdate=September 9, 2012|date=December 10, 2002}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F832B87CC108EB4&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Two S.

According to ''National Journal'', during this period Rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire conservative principles, and some colleagues described him as a [[centrist]] "who sought out Democrats and groups that don’t typically align with the GOP".&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt; He co-sponsored legislation that would have let farm workers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay, and co-sponsored a bill for giving in-state tuition rates to the children of [[Illegal immigration to the United States|undocumented immigrants]].&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;  In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers, and helped defeat a GOP bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;

As a state representative, Rubio requested legislative [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]] (called "Community Budget Issue Requests" in Florida), totaling about $145 million for 2001 and 2002, but none thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Sharockman, Aaron. [http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/nov/16/steven-schale/marco-rubio-wasnt-always-against-earmarks-florida/ "Marco Rubio wasn't always against earmarks, Florida Democrat claims"], ''[[PolitiFact]]'' (November 16, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roig&gt;Roig-Franzia, Manuel.

[http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/rubios-campaign-image-belies-history-of-250-million-in-pork-requests/1078548 "Rubio's campaign image belies history of $250 million in pork requests"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031211815/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/rubios-campaign-image-belies-history-of-250-million-in-pork-requests/1078548 |date=October 31, 2015 }}, ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' (March 9, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; as did the non-profit group Florida TaxWatch.&lt;ref name=JK&gt;Kennedy, John.

====House speaker====
On September 13, 2005, at age 34,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-speaker-20150710|title=The Speaker|work=National Journal|accessdate=July 23, 2015|date=July 11, 2015|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubio became speaker after State Representatives [[Dennis Baxley]], [[Jeff Kottkamp]], and [[Dennis A. Ross]] dropped out. He was sworn in a year later, in November 2006.  He became the first [[Cuban American]] to be [[speaker of the Florida House of Representatives]], and would remain speaker until November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fineout |first=Gary |url=http://www.ocala.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031115/NEWS/211150381/1047 |title=Baxley backs off House leader bid |publisher=Ocala.com |date=November 15, 2003 |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Speaker-designate Marco Rubio with a blank book titled 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future.jpg|thumb|Then Speaker-Designate Rubio, challenging [[Florida House of Representatives|House]] colleagues to help write "100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future", September 2005]]

When he was chosen as future speaker in 2005, Rubio delivered a speech to the House in which he asked members to look in their desks, where they each found a hardcover book titled ''100 Innovative Ideas For Florida’s Future''; but the book was blank because it had not yet been written, and Rubio told his colleagues that they would fill in the pages together with the help of ordinary Floridians.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt; In 2006, after traveling around the state and talking with citizens, and compiling their ideas, Rubio published the book.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Marco. ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/100_Innovative_Ideas_for_Florida_s_Futur.html?id=I6cXIZs6TogC 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future]'' (Regnery 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="100IdeasPolitifact"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rubio claims 57 of his 100 ideas were made law by the Florida Legislature |url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/feb/26/marco-rubio/rubio-claims-57-his-100-ideas-were-made-law-florid/ |publisher=Politifact |accessdate=May 24, 2012|last=Sharockman|first=Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Journal'' called this book "the centerpiece of Rubio’s early speakership".&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;  About 24 of the "ideas" became law, while another 10 were partially enacted.&lt;ref name="100IdeasPolitifact"/&gt; Among the items from his 2006 book that became law were multiple-year car registrations, a requirement that high schools provide more vocational courses, and an expanded voucher-like school-choice program.  Rubio's defenders, and some critics, point out that [[Great Recession|nationwide economic difficulties]] overlapped with much of Rubio's speakership, and so funding new legislative proposals became difficult.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;

As Rubio took office as speaker, [[Jeb Bush]] was completing his term as governor, and Bush left office in January 2007.  Rubio hired 18 Bush aides, leading capitol insiders to say the speaker's suite was "the governor’s office in exile."  An article in ''National Journal'' described Rubio's style as being very different from Bush's; where Bush was a very assertive manager of affairs in Tallahassee, Rubio's style was to delegate certain powers, relinquish others, and invite political rivals into his inner circle.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;  As incoming speaker, he decided to open a private dining room for legislators, which he said would give members more privacy, free from being pursued by lobbyists, though the expense led to a public relations problem.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;

[[File:House Select Committee on Private Property Rights Chairman Rep. Marco Rubio, R-Miami, left, guides discussion 2005-10-18.jpg|thumb|left|Rubio as Chairman of the [[Florida House of Representatives|House]] Select Committee on Private Property Rights, October 2005]]

In 2006, Florida enacted into law limitations upon the authority of the state government to take private property, in response to the 2005 Supreme Court decision in [[Kelo v. City of New London]] which took a broad view of governmental power to take private property under [[eminent domain]].  This state legislation had been proposed by a special committee chaired by Rubio prior to his speakership.&lt;ref name=NR1 /&gt;

Jeb Bush was succeeded by [[Charlie Crist]], a moderate Republican who took office in January 2007.  Rubio and Crist clashed frequently.  Their sharpest clash involved the governor's initiative to expand casino [[Gambling in the United States|gambling]] in Florida. Rubio sued Crist for bypassing the Florida Legislature in order to make a deal with the [[Seminole Tribe]].  The [[Supreme Court of Florida|Florida Supreme Court]] sided with Rubio and blocked the deal.&lt;ref&gt;Deb, Sopan.

Rubio also was a critic of Crist's strategy to fight [[climate change]] through an executive order creating new automobile and utility [[emissions standards]].  Rubio accused Crist of imposing "European-style big government mandates," and the legislature under Rubio's leadership weakened the impact of Crist's climate change initiative.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;&lt;ref name="BaconRevolt"/&gt;  Rubio said that Crist’s approach would harm consumers by driving up utility bills without having much effect upon the environment, and that a better approach would be to promote [[biofuel]] (e.g. [[ethanol]]), [[solar panel]]s, and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunkelberger, Lloyd.

Rubio introduced a plan to reduce [[Property tax in the United States|state property taxes]] to 2001 levels (and potentially eliminate them altogether), while increasing [[Sales taxes in the United States|sales taxes]] by 1% to 2.5% to fund schools.  The proposal would have reduced property taxes in the state by $40–50 billion. His proposal passed the House, but was opposed by Governor Crist and Florida Senate Republicans, who said that the increase in sales tax would disproportionately affect the poor. So, Rubio agreed to smaller changes, and Crist's proposal to double the state's [[Homestead exemption|property tax exemption]] from $25,000 to $50,000 (for a tax reduction estimated by Crist to be $33 billion) ultimately passed.&lt;ref name=Mishak /&gt;&lt;ref name=NR1&gt;{{cite news |title=When Rubio Was the Man of Florida's House |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416889/when-rubio-was-man-floridas-house-jim-geraghty |accessdate=July 23, 2015 |work=National Review |date=April 13, 2015|last=Geraghty|first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TB1&gt;{{cite news |title=Marco Rubio's U.S. Senate campaign grew out of his 2007 antitax roots |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/marco-rubios-us-senate-campaign-grew-out-of-his-2007-antitax-roots/1108354 |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times |date=July 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224101917/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/marco-rubios-us-senate-campaign-grew-out-of-his-2007-antitax-roots/1108354 |archivedate=February 24, 2013 |df=mdy-all |last=Leary|first=Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators called it the largest tax cut in Florida's history up until then.&lt;ref name=NR1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bousquet|first1=Steve|title=Confused now?

[[File:Speaker Rubio standing with Dem leader.jpg|thumb|Rubio conferring with Democratic leader [[Dan Gelber]] in 2007]]

As speaker, Rubio "aggressively tried to push Florida to the [[Right-wing politics|political right]]," according to [[NBC News]], and frequently clashed with the [[Florida Senate]], which was run by more [[moderate Republican]]s, and with then-Governor Charlie Crist, a centrist Republican at the time.&lt;ref name="BaconRevolt"&gt;Perry Bacon Jr., [http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/florida-house-rubio-lead-conservative-revolt-against-fellow-republicans-n338736 In Florida House, Rubio Led a Conservative Revolt Against Fellow Republicans], NBC News, ''Meet the Press'' (April 14, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a conservative, "behind the scenes many Democrats considered Rubio someone with whom they could work," according to biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia.&lt;ref&gt;Roig-Franzia, Manuel.  ''The Rise of Marco Rubio'', p. 110 (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Gelber]] of Miami, the House Democratic leader at the time of Rubio's speakership, considered him "a true conservative" but not "a reflexive partisan," saying: "He didn't have an objection to working with the other side simply because they were the other side. To put it bluntly, he wasn't a jerk."&lt;ref name="AdamsBipartisanship"&gt;Chris Adams, [http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article27392902.html Moderate Marco?

While Speaker of the Florida House, Rubio shared a residence in Tallahassee with another Florida State Representative, [[David Rivera]], which the two co-owned.

The following month, Rubio and Senator [[Chris Coons]], Democrat of Delaware, co-sponsored the American Growth, Recovery, Empowerment and Entrepreneurship Act (AGREE Act), which would have extended many [[tax credit]]s and exemptions for businesses investing in [[research and development]], equipment, and other capital; provided a tax credit for veterans who start a business franchise; allowed an increase in immigration for certain types of work visas; and strengthened copyright protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Laura Green |title=Sen.

Rubio voted against the 2012 "[[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]" resolutions. Although he received some criticism for this position, he responded: "Thousands of small businesses, not just the wealthy, will now be forced to decide how they'll pay this new tax, and, chances are, they'll do it by firing employees, cutting back their hours and benefits, or postponing the new hires they were looking to make.

In July 2013, Rubio and Senator [[Ben Cardin]], Democrat of Maryland, introduced the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2013.  The bill would require federal agencies to monitor and regularly report on the performance of foreign assistance programs based on specified goals and metrics.  The reports would be published publicly.

In 2014, Rubio co-sponsored legislation with Senator [[Mark Warner]], Democrat of Virginia, to revise the process for calculating and collecting student loans.

The risk corridors were intended to be funded by profitable insurers participating in the PPACA.  However, since insurer losses have significantly exceeded their profits in the program, the risk corridors have been depleted.  His efforts contributed to the inclusion of a provision in the 2014 federal budget which prevented other funding sources from being tapped to replenish the risk corridors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/261244-rubio-budget-win-is-dealing-heavy-blow-to-obamacare | publisher=The Hill | title=Rubio budget win is dealing heavy blow to ObamaCare | date=November 24, 2015|last=Ferris|first=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Rubio took the position that the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] was "simply buckling under the weight of its own bureaucracy", and he endorsed their proposal to open veterans' care to private providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/02/26/va-health-care-task-force/24052871/ |title=Veterans propose major changes in VA health care |last1=Wagner |first1=Dennis |date=February 26, 2015 |website=USA Today |publisher=USA TODAY |accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Rubio and Senator [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]], Republican of Utah, proposed a tax plan which, according to ''The Wall Street Journal'', combined thinking from "old-fashioned, Reagan-era supply siders" and a "breed of largely younger conservative reform thinkers" who are concerned with the tax burden on the middle-class.  The plan would lower the top corporate income tax rate from 38% to 25%, eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends and inherited estates, and create a new child tax credit worth up to $2,500 per child.  The plan would set the top individual income tax rate at 35%. It also included a proposal to replace the means-tested welfare system, including food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit, with a new "consolidated system of benefits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/03/13/lee-rubio-plan-gives-life-to-2016-tax-debate/ |title=Lee-Rubio Plan Gives Life to 2016 Tax Debate |last1=King Jr. |first1=Neil |date=March 13, 2015 |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, it was reported that Rubio had begun contacting top donors and appointing advisors for a potential 2016 run, including [[George Edward Seay III|George Seay]], who previously worked on such campaigns as [[Rick Perry]]'s [[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012|in 2012]] and [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|Mitt Romney's in 2008]], and Jim Rubright, who had previously worked for Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/23/rubio-signs-on-top-fundraiser-lines-up-donors-in-move-toward-2016-bid/|title=Rubio signs on top fundraiser, lines up donors in move toward 2016 bid|publisher=Fox News Channel|last=Gomez|first=Serafin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/marco-rubio-takes-steps-towards-2016-run-n292031 | title=Marco Rubio Takes Steps Towards 2016 Run | publisher=NBC News | date=January 23, 2015 | accessdate=January 24, 2015 | author=Murray, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubio also instructed his aides to "prepare for a presidential campaign" prior to a Team Marco 2016 fundraising meeting in [[South Beach]].&lt;ref name=Caputo2&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article8013126.html | title=Sen.

=== Republican primaries ===
In the first Republican primary, the February 1 [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2016|Iowa caucuses]], Rubio finished third, behind candidates [[Ted Cruz]] and [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/02/marco-rubios-very-big-night-in-iowa/|title=Marco Rubio's very big night in Iowa|first=Amber|last=Phillips|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a nationally televised debate among Republican candidates in [[New Hampshire]] on February 6, 2016, Rubio was criticized by rival [[Chris Christie]] for speaking repetitiously and sounding scripted.

He also believes there should be more vetting of refugees and that seeking a single comprehensive immigration reform bill would be delusional.

'''Mary Adams''' (née Ritchie) (3 November 1922 – 12 July 2010) was a Scottish interceptor for [[Bletchley Park]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/1313F1E4F1499978?p=UKNB|title=Mary Adams|last=Shaw|first=Alison|date=27 July 2010|work=The Herald (Glasgow)|access-date=19 August 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituary-mary-adams-1-817799|title=Mary Adams|last=|first=|date=18 July 2010|work=The Scotsman|access-date=19 August 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams was born in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], Scotland to Maggie and John Ritchie. Her father was a railway foreman. Her parents moved to [[Stonehaven]] where she attended [[Mackie Academy]] before going on to take a job as a clerk in solicitors' office. In 1943 she signed up for the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] and was selected for the [[Royal Corps of Signals]], where she was trained in receiving [[Morse code]]. She was then assigned to Bletchley Park as an interceptor of German and Italian coded signals. Adams stated that she preferred to intercept Italian signals as Italians were often excitable when transmitting which lead them to make mistakes causing them to repeat their messages, and thereby giving her a second chance to capture their messages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Having signed the Official Secrets Act, Adams did not talk to anyone, not even her husband, about her work during the war. When [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] officer [[F. W. Winterbotham|Frederick Winterbotham]] published his book ''The Ultra Secret'' in 1974, she then felt able to mention her work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Adams married Bob Adams, an accountant, in 1950. They had three children, Bob, David and Lorna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the war Adams trained as a [[radiographer]] at [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]]. After her children were born she worked as a volunteer at the [[Citizens Advice|Citizens' Advice Bureau]], going on to work as trainer and tutor at its Edinburgh offices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2009 Adams was presented with the Bletchley Park Commemorative Badge in recognition of her role during the war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In later life she suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and was cared for at a nursing home. She died on 12 July 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===2010 election===
[[File:CO2010c3.png|thumb|right|County results of the race]]
{{Main|United States Senate election in Colorado, 2010}}
Bennet ran for election for a full term as Senator from Colorado in the 2010 election.&lt;ref name=rival/&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2016}} On September 16, 2009, former [[Colorado House of Representatives|Colorado House]] [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] [[Andrew Romanoff]] announced his campaign to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_13353969 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914075440/http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_13353969 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 14, 2010 |title=Sources: Romanoff launches Senate bid: "Colorado is my cause" |work=Denver Post |accessdate=September 18, 2009 |first=Lynn |last=Bartels |date=September 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign became one of the most expensive in the country, with the candidates spending a reported $15 million combined, and outside groups another $30 million. Bennet portrayed Buck as an extremist conservative opposed to [[abortion]] and [[direct election]] of Senators, while Buck and the groups supporting him characterized Bennet as a big-spending liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jeff | last = Brady | title = Money Has Poured Into Colorado's Senate Race | date = October 27, 2010 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130864318 | work = NPR | accessdate = October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bennet won election, President Obama said Bennet "perfectly reflects the qualities of the ruggedly independent state he has been chosen to serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama praises new Colorado senator, Michael Bennet|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/03/obama-praises-new-colorado-sen-bennet/|accessdate=31 October 2014|publisher=CNN|date=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, the day after polls closed, Bennet was declared the winner and Buck conceded. Bennet won by 851,590 votes (48.1%) to 822,731 (46.4%). He subsequently returned to Washington in January 2011 to start a full six-year term.

===2016 election===
[[File:Colorado Senate Election Results by County, 2016.svg|thumb|right|County results of the race]]
Bennet was re-elected to a second term on November 8, 2016. He defeated Republican Candidate and El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn. Bennet received 1.36 million votes, 156,248 more than Glenn. He received 31,780 more votes than Democratic presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]], who also won the state in the [[United States elections, 2016|general election]]. Bennet received more votes than any other Democrat in a statewide race in Colorado history. He also won more votes in Colorado's rural counties than any other statewide Democrat in state history.

Following the election, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said Bennet was one of the "gifted Democratic politicians" that could lead the party in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Remnick, David (28 November 2016).

==Political positions==
[[File:MichaelBennetofficialphoto.jpg|thumb|right|Senator Michael Bennet]]

===Gun law===
As of 2010, Bennet had earned a "C+" rating from the [[National Rifle Association]] for a mixed record regarding his votes for [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]].&lt;ref name="OTI103"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Bennet on Gun Control|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Michael_Bennet_Gun_Control.htm|website=On The Issues|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Bennet joined then Colorado Senator [[Mark Udall]] in asking for stricter gun control, in response to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]]. In response to the shooting, Bennet stated that "In Colorado, we support the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, we support the ability of people to hunt and recreate and to protect their families and homes, and we want to keep the wrong weapons out of the hands of the wrong people."&lt;ref name="HP1003"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sens.

Bennet participated in the [[Chris Murphy gun control filibuster]], demanding that gun laws be changed in the wake of the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]]. During his participation in the filibuster, Bennet talked about the [[2012 Aurora shooting]], citing that as a response to the shooting, the state of Colorado closed gun sale loopholes and now requires background checks for any gun purchase.&lt;ref name="AP1003"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Associated Press|title=Michael Bennet joins Senate filibuster over gun violence|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/15/michael-bennet-joins-senate-filibuster-over-gun-violence/|website=The Denver Post|accessdate=4 October 2017|date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], Bennet demanded [[universal background checks]] regarding gun sales and described the shooting as [[domestic terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Clark1003"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Kyle|title=Debating the definition of 'terrorism' after the Las Vegas shooting|url=http://www.9news.com/news/local/next/debating-the-definition-of-terrorism-after-the-las-vegas-shooting/480668441|website=KUSA|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care policy===
Bennet voted in support of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] signed by President [[Barack Obama]] on March 23, 2010. In November 2009, when the bill was still working its way through Congress, Bennet said that he would support [[health care]] reform even if it meant losing the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/22/michael-bennet-ill-lose-m_n_366780.html|title=Sources: Michael Bennet: I'll Lose My Seat To Support Health Care (VIDEO)|work=Huffington Post |accessdate=January 6, 2011|first=Sam|last=Stein|date=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, in response to healthcare costs in western and central Colorado, which has some of the highest healthcare costs in the United States, Bennet said he "didn't have answers" and called it "next to impossible" to fix the Affordable Care Act given partisan attitudes at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmon|first1=Gary|title=Sen.

As part of a group of Democrats proposing "more incremental steps to broaden health care coverage", as opposed to [[Bernie Sanders]]'s push of "Medicare for All", Senator [[Tim Kaine]] and Michael Bennet have proposed "Medicare X". Medicare X would "create a public option modeled after [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] alongside private options on the [[ObamaCare]] [[Health insurance marketplace|marketplaces]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Peter|title=Democrats march toward single-payer health care|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/375376-democrats-march-toward-single-payer-health-care|website=The Hill|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration policy===
In September 2009, Bennet cosponsored the [[DREAM Act]] (S. 729), which proposed amending the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] by giving residency to immigrants enrolled in higher education programs or serving in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosa|first1=Erin|title=Bennet on the record: Supports DREAM Act for immigration reform|url=http://www.coloradoindependent.com/25564/bennet-on-the-record-supports-dream-act-for-immigration-reform|accessdate=8 August 2016|publisher=Colorado Independent|date=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Bennet was a member of the [[Gang of Eight (immigration)|Gang of Eight]], a bipartisan group of four Democratic and four Republican U.S. Senators who introduced comprehensive [[immigration reform]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senators Reach a Bipartisan Agreement for Comprehensive Immigration Reform|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/senators-reach-bipartisan-agreement-comprehensive-immigration-reform| publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |work=The National Law Review |date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their bill, the [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013]], passed the U.S. Senate with a vote of 68-32, but stalled in the House due to opposition from the Republican majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/744|title=S.744 - Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|access-date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy policy===
In 2009, Bennet co-sponsored the Solar Manufacturing Jobs Creation Act, legislation that would have provided a tax credit to support solar manufacturing in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senators Introduce Solar Manufacturing Jobs Creation Act|url=http://solarindustrymag.com/senators-introduce-solar-manufacturing-jobs-creation-act|accessdate=8 August 2016|publisher=Solar Industry Magazine|date=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was not enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2755 (111th): Solar Manufacturing Jobs Creation Act|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/s2755|publisher=GovTrack.us|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michael Shadid.jpg|thumb|right|Michael Shadid]]
'''Dr. Michael Abraham Shadid''' (1882 &amp;ndash; August 13, 1966) was a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] physician who founded the first medical [[cooperative]] in [[Elk City, Oklahoma]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,761173-1,00.html|title=Medicine: Cooperative Doctor|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]| date=1939-05-01 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first president of the Cooperative Health Federation of America and an advocate for cooperative health care and preventive medicine.

==Early life==
Shadid was born in 1882 in [[Marjayoun]], [[Lebanon]], the youngest of 12 children. He attended the [[American University of Beirut|American University's]] high school in Beirut and in 1898 immigrated to the United States where he was a pack peddler and sold cheap jewelry and buttons door to door. Shadid attended [[Tarleton State University|John Tarleton College]] in [[Stephenville, Texas]] in 1902 and received a degree in medicine from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1907. While in medical school, Shadid joined the [[Socialist Party of America]]. He ran for Congress as a [[New Deal coalition|New Deal democrat]] but was defeated by [[Sam Massingale]]. He married Adeeba Shadid and they had six children: Bess, Fred, Ethel, Alexander, Ruth, and Helen.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1923, Shadid left a successful practice in [[Carter, Oklahoma]] and settled in Elk City. He found that farmers of the region were not receiving adequate medical care and did not have a hospital they could afford. Shadid called a meeting of his farmer patients and proposed a cooperatively owned clinic and hospital in Elk City. The Oklahoma Farmers' Union supported the measure and the hospital was opened by the Community Health Association, Inc. in August 1931. The reception from the medical community was icy. Although he had been a member of the Beckham County Medical Society for over 20 years, the society expelled him. The Oklahoma Board of Medical Examiners attempted to revoke Shadid's license and the State Medical Association tried to get a bill passed against medical cooperatives in the Oklahoma Legislature. The bill was defeated with the help of the Oklahoma Farmers' Union.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; The Farmers' Union took control of the hospital and the health plan in 1934. By 1939, Community Hospital served 15,000 farmers in the southwestern Oklahoma. During the later years of his life, Dr. Shadid suffered from diabetes, resulting in having both legs amputated. With both legs missing, Dr. Shadid traveled to Russia alone in a wheel chair to speak about socialized medicine.(Authority: first-hand knowledge of Dr. Shadid's grand-daughter, S. Candice Campbell, whose mother was Bess Campbell, Dr. Shadid's daughter.)

==Later life==
Shadid traveled throughout the United States and Europe and gave speeches where he advocated for cooperative health care. He helped launch a health co-op in [[Deer Park, Washington]] and assisted the organizing committee that led to the formation of [[Group Health Cooperative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=7411 Health care reformer Dr. Michael Shadid speaks to future founders of Group Health Cooperative in Seattle on August 14, 1945.] ''History Link.'' 9 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Shadid helped found the Cooperative Health Federation of America in 1947. He served as the Foundation's president from 1947 to 1949. In 1960 he built Hospital Haramoon in the Lebanese village where he was born. Shadid died in Kansas on August 13, 1966 and is buried in Oklahoma City at Fairlawn Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Huls, Glenna L.

'''Nikolay Fyodorovich Makarov''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Фёдорович Мака́ров; {{OldStyleDate|22 May|1914|9 May}} – 13 May 1988}}) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[firearms]] designer, most notable for his [[Makarov pistol]].

==Biography==
Makarov was born on 22 May 1914 in the village of Sasovo to the family of a railway worker. In 1936, he enrolled to the [[Tula State University|Tula Mechanical Institute]]. At the onset of the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]], he was preparing for his graduation. He was hastily qualified as an engineer and sent to the Zagorski Machine Works (now in [[Sergiyev Posad]]). The plant was soon evacuated to [[Kirov Oblast]]. In 1944, Makarov returned to Tula, and graduated from the Tula Mechanical Institute with honors. In 1945, he took part in a pistol design competition that aimed to find a replacement for the [[TT pistol]] and [[M1895 Nagant]] revolver (the former was in use since 1930 and the latter since the late 1800s). Makarov's work, which made use of some elements of the [[Walther PP]], won the competition and was adopted by the army in 1951. Makarov continued designing firearms in Tula until his retirement in 1974.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Later, he was elected to the Soviet of Working People's Deputies in Tula Oblast, and was chosen as a council member of the scientific and technological society Mashprom.

He died on 13 May 1988 as a result of his seventh heart attack and was buried at the 1st Municipal Cemetery in Tula.

==Career==
Dissatisfied as a teacher, Serrell changed careers to become an [[auction]]eer, working in the local [[livestock]] trade until qualifying as a [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors|Chartered Surveyor]] in 1988, specialising in [[fine art]] and [[antique]]s.&lt;ref name=BBCBio/&gt;

Serrell owns an auctioneers and valuers firm with offices in [[Worcester]] and a salesroom in [[Great Malvern]], established in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serrell.com/History.asp |title=Our History |accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a regular expert on the [[BBC]] series ''[[Bargain Hunt]]'' and ''[[Flog It!]]'' and has also made a couple of appearances on [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s ''[[Dickinson's Real Deal]]''. He has also featured on other BBC series ''[[Antiques Road Trip]]'' and ''[[Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is (TV series)|Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is]]'' (where he is light-heartedly billed as Phil "The Fox" Serrell).

He has regularly appeared on [[BBC Hereford and Worcester|BBC Local Radio]], and has also written a biweekly [[newspaper column|column]] for the ''[[Worcester News]]''.

==Personal life==
Married, he lives in Worcester with his wife. Serrell is an avid collector, living in a "house full of tat". He is a fan of [[Aston Martin]] cars and is a supporter of  [[Worcester Warriors]] rugby team.

'''Ruben Cornelis Talberg''' (born 24 August 1964 in [[Heidelberg]]) is a [[Germany|German]]-[[Israel]]i [[painting|painter]] and [[photographer]]. Before Talberg turned 40, he invented PINTURA ALCHEMICA in which he inverts the canvasses according to the ancient alchemic principle of "conversio oppositorum".

==Work==
R. C. Talberg's oeuvre deals with antagonistic positions such as Nature &amp; Alchemy, Asymmetry &amp; Dynamics or Eros &amp; Thanathos. During the last decade he has intensified his interest for Jewish mysticism and magic. On extensive journeys he creates new serials of photography that in turn shape the base for new artwork cycles. Likewise the surfaces of his artworks contain references to his lyrics, [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]], symbols, grids and codes.

2011 the Talberg Museum was founded in Offenbach am Main. Talberg's works are represented in more than 100 public and private international collections as well as the auction trade.

Talberg lives and works in [[Heidelberg]] and [[Southern France]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Tapandegan''' (''Palpitaters'' in [[Persian language|Persian]])  is an [[Iran]]ian hacker group known for hacking twice the arrival and departure monitors at two major international airports in Iran ([[Mashhad International Airport|Mashhad]] and [[Tabriz International Airport|Tabriz]]) on May 24, 2018 and June 6, 2018 respectively, posting anti-government messages and images, forcing the airports’ authorities to turn off manually those monitors one-by-one.&lt;ref name="ENR"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Hackers Post Protest Messages On Mashad Airport Displays | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''en.radiofarda.com''| date =25 May 2018 | url =https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-hackers-post-protest-messages-mashad-airport/29250247.html | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Hackers briefly shut off airport monitors in Iran’s Tabriz | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''seattletimes.com''| date =7 June 2018 | url =https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/hackers-briefly-shut-off-airport-monitors-in-irans-tabriz/ | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Hackers briefly shut off airport monitors in Iran's Tabriz | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''foxnews.com''| date =7 June 2018 | url =http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/06/07/hackers-briefly-shut-off-airport-monitors-in-irans-tabriz.html | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tapandegan refers to its acts as an act of protest demanding from the Iranian leadership to improve the economy and to stop ignoring the demands of the Iranian people.&lt;ref name="VOA"&gt;{{cite news | last =Lipin | first =Michael  | title =Hackers Hit Second Iranian Airport with Opposition Message | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''voanews.com''| date =7  June 2018 | url =https://www.voanews.com/a/hackers-hit-second-iranian-airport-opposition-message/4429261.html | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; News agencies categorized this group’s acts as “a new form of protest in Iran.”&lt;ref name="ENR"/&gt;

==History==
The Tapandegan first appeared publicly on May 24, 2018 when they hacked  the arrival and departure monitors at [[Mashhad International Airport]]  and  on June 6, 2018 when they also hacked the arrival and departure monitors at [[Tabriz International Airport]].&lt;ref name="ENR"/&gt; The group posted anti-government messages and images, forcing the airports’ authorities to turn off manually those monitors one-by-one.&lt;ref name="ENR"/&gt; Airport officials in both cities turned off the sign boards for several hours after the hacking and made apologetic public statements.&lt;ref name="ENR"/&gt;

The Iranian authorities confirmed both cyber-attacks shortly after they took place and they were widely reported by the Iranian official press and the international news wires and agencies.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Screens at Iran airport said hacked with anti-regime messages | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''timesofisrael.com''| date =25 May 2018 | url =https://www.timesofisrael.com/screens-at-iran-airport-said-hacked-with-anti-regime-messages/ | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name and alias===
The group’s name is in the [[Persian language]] meaning ''Palpitaters''. Based on the messages they posted on those hacked monitors, the news sources noted that the group supports the national protests of the people in Iran demanding economic improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Hackers post protest messages on Iranian airport monitors | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''azernews.az''| date =7 June 2018 | url =https://www.azernews.az/region/133149.html | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has seen frequent nationwide protests this year by demonstrators angered by local and national officials and business leaders who they accuse of corruption and oppression. The two anti-government hacks at Iranian airports are the only incidents of their kind since the protests began in late December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Son  | first =Do | title =Iranian Airport Electronic Display Screened Protest Messages | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''securityonline.info''| date =29 May 2018 | url =https://securityonline.info/iranian-airport-electronic-display-screened-protest-messages/ | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hacking history==
Hacking attacks in Iran have been on the rise recently. In August 2016, Internet security experts warned that hackers have found access to banking and contact details of millions of Iranians by hacking into their Telegram accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =McGoogan | first =Cara | title =Iranian hackers attack Telegram to find 15 million accounts | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''telegraph.co.uk''| date =3 August 2016 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/08/03/iranian-hackers-attack-telegram-to-find-15-million-accounts/ | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not yet clear whether this was a genuine warning or an attempt by hardliners in the Iranian government to convince people to leave Telegram and migrate to home-grown messaging services, where the government has easy access to users’ private information and can intercept their communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Iran Poised to Block Popular Telegram Messaging App But Lacks Feasible Alternative | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''iranhumanrights.org''| date =5 April 2018 | url =https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2018/04/iran-poised-to-block-popular-telegram-messaging-app-but-lacks-feasible-alternative/ | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =DeGeurin | first =Mack  | title =What Iran and Russia’s Telegram Ban Means for Secure Messaging Apps| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''nymag.com''| date =| url =http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/06/the-implications-of-iran-and-russias-attack-on-telegram.html | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First hack: The Mashhad International Airport===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mashhad airport monitor attack.jpg|thumb|Image showing Tapandegan's attack on Mashhad International Airport Monitors on May 24, 2018]] --&gt;

According to [[The Associated Press]]’ report from [[Tehran]], Iran’s official IRNA news agency reported that The Tapandegan “managed to interrupt routine broadcasts on monitors” at the Mashhad International Airport on Thursday evening, May 24, 2018,  “replacing them with images of anti-government protests from January [2018]”“for several hours.”&lt;ref name="ENR"/&gt;

Sources report that according to a statement posted by the hackers on the monitors, the group protested to “wasting Iranians lives and financial resources in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] by the [[Islamic Revolution Guards Corps]] (IRGC).” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =The site of the Mashhad airport was hacked by the demonic  protest| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''fa.euronews.com''| date =25 May 2018| url =http://fa.euronews.com/2018/05/25/mashhad-international-airport-website-hacked-by-tapandegan| accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The message posted on sign boards also protested against the IRGC’s presence in [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], and elsewhere in the region.&lt;ref name="ENR"/&gt; The group also hacked the email of Mashhad airport civil aviation head, Mohsen Eidizadeh and sent the news of its hack from his account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Waqas | first = | title =Hackers deface Airport screens in Iran with anti-government messages| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''hackread.com''| date =26 May 2018| url =https://www.hackread.com/hackers-deface-airport-screens-in-iran/| accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mashhad]] is the city where massive anti-government demonstrations started on December 28 and spread to over 100 other Iranians cities. It is a religious city where the holy shrine of the 8th Shiite Imam is located. Local authorities and clerics in the city are among the staunchest hardliners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Iranian cities hit by anti-government protests| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''bbc.com''| date =29 December 2017| url =https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42512946| accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group expressed support for the people of [[Kazeroon]], a city in [[Fars Province]], where people have been demonstrating against the state of months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Hackers post protest messages on Iranian airport monitors| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''en.presspark.az''| date = | url =http://en.presspark.az/iqtisadiyyat/1699-hackers-post-protest-messages-on-iranian-airport-monitors.html| accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second hack: The Tabriz International Airport===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tabrizpic airport monitor attack.jpg|thumb|Image showing Tapandegan's attack on Tabriz International Airport Monitors on June 6, 2018]] --&gt;

According to The Associated Press’ report from Tehran, Iran’s official IRNA news agency reported that on June 6, 2018, the hackers “have disrupted the arrival and departure monitors in the Tabriz international airport in the country’s northwest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Hackers briefly shut off airport monitors in Iran's Tabriz| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''nydailynews.com''| date =7 June 2018 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/news/world/hackers-briefly-shut-airport-monitors-iran-tabriz-article-1.4027315| accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers defaced sign boards in the evening, showing a protest message against “wasting Iranians’ resources" and expressing support for Iranian truckers who have been on strike across Iran for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =ASSOCIATED PRESS | first = | title =Hackers briefly shut off airport monitors in Iran's Tabriz| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''dailymail.co.uk''| date =7 June 2018 | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-5816751/Hackers-briefly-shut-airport-monitors-Irans-Tabriz.html| accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian truck drivers went on strike for more than a week beginning May 22 in several parts of Iran, using social media to mobilize and share images of themselves protesting low wages and rising business costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Iran: Truckers surpass 11th day of nationwide strike| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''english.mojahedin.org''| date =1 June 2018 | url =https://english.mojahedin.org/i/iran-truckers-surpass-11th-day-of-nationwide-strike | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Government 'Meets' Striking Truckers Demands To Prevent More Disruption| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''en.radiofarda.com''| date =25 May 2018 | url =https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-truckers-strike-disruption/29250450.html | accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian state-run site, ''Young Journalists’ Club (YJC)'', “quoted Tabriz Governor Aliyar Rastgoo as saying the incident happened Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. local time.”&lt;ref name="VOA"/&gt; A Tabriz airport official Mostafa Safaei confirmed the day after the cyber-attack that the monitors turned off following the hack and engineers quickly restored the system, and the incident was under investigation.&lt;ref name="VOA"/&gt;

Translation of the message posted by the hackers on the monitors in Persian reads:

''Attention, attention. We, Tapandegan, in another protest action, are currently taking control of the computer systems of this airport. Two weeks ago, in protest against the wastage of the Iranian people’s money and lives by (Iran’s) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, we took control of the computer systems in Mashhad airport. Today, by voicing our support for Iranian strikers, we are doing the same thing. Until when will this regime deprive people of their rights to have a better livelihood and economic situation?! Until when?! We will not choke off our voices. We will continue these actions. If you support us, take a photo of this and share it''

The Tapandegan assumed responsibility for the hacking in a tweet on June 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Tapandegan tweets| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''twitter.com''| date =7 June 2018 | url =https://twitter.com/tapandegan| accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the posts came under pseudonyms as users inside Iran fear a heavy-handed clampdown by the government.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt;

Sources report that The Tapandegan sent an email to Iranian journalists saying, “Two weeks ago, we took over the computer systems of Mashhad Airport in support of the national protests. We protested against wasting Iranian lives and assets by IRGC [The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]. And, today, we support the truck drivers, the bazar, and the strikers”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Hackers post protest messages on Iranian airport monitors| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''en.trend.az''| date =7 June 2018 | url =https://en.trend.az/iran/politics/2914159.html| accessdate =26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shearer stated in the preface to his 1971 book that he withdrew from a promising career in conventional [[broadcast journalism]] in the 1960s in order to investigate the [[meaning of life]], leading him to research and experience beliefs and practices of ancient and modern [[Mesoamerican]]s.

'''Ulpia Marciana''' (August 48 – 112) was the beloved elder sister of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]]. She was the eldest child born to Roman woman [[Marcia (mother of Trajan)|Marcia]] and the [[Hispania|Spanish Roman]] senator [[Marcus Ulpius Traianus (senator)|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]]. Her second name ''Marciana'' she inherited from her mother’s paternal ancestors. Her birthplace is unknown. 

Marciana married [[Gaius Salonius Matidius Patruinus]]. Patruinus was a wealthy man, who served as a [[praetor]] and later became a senator. He originally came from Vicetia (modern [[Vicenza]] in northern [[Italy]]). She bore Patruinus a daughter and only child [[Salonina Matidia]], who was born on July 4, 68. Patruinus died in 78 and Marciana never remarried. After Patruinus’ death, Marciana and Matidia went to live with Trajan and his wife. 

After 105, her brother awarded her with the title of [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]. She was the first sister of a Roman Emperor to receive this title. Marciana did not accept this at first, but her sister-in-law, the Empress [[Pompeia Plotina]], insisted that she take the title. She thus became part of the official imperial iconography and her statue was placed together with Trajan's and Plotina's over the [[Arch of Trajan (Ancona)|Arches of Trajan]] in [[Ancona]]. Marciana was very close to Trajan and Plotina. 

[[Image:Marciana Coin.jpg|thumb|left|Marciana on a sestertius of Trajan]]
Marciana would often travel with her brother and assist him in decision making. Throughout the Roman Empire, Marciana was honored with monuments and inscriptions in her name. There are two towns that Trajan founded in her honor in the [[Roman Empire]]. The first town was called ''Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi'' (modern [[Timgad]], [[Algeria]]) and was founded around 100. This town was also named after the late parents of Marciana and Trajan. The other town was founded in 106 and was called [[Marcianopolis]] (which is now a part of modern [[Devnya]], [[Bulgaria]]). Marciana died between 112 and 114 and was [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deified by the Senate]] at Trajan's behest.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Bickerman, "Diva Augusta Marciana," ''The Journal of Philology'' 95.4 (Winter, 1974): 362-376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livius.org/person/ulpia-marciana/ |title=Ulpia Marciana |website=livius.org |accessdate=11 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her daughter [[Salonina Matidia]]'s third marriage, Marciana was the great-great-great grandmother of future emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7824">A '''womance''', also called '''sismance''', is a close but non-[[Human sexuality|sexual]] relationship between two or more [[Woman|women]].&lt;ref name="Winch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammarén"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNamara20130602"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNamara20110919"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt; It is an exceptionally tight [[affectional orientation|affectional]], [[Homosociality|homosocial]] [[female bonding]] relationship exceeding that of usual friendship, and is distinguished by a particularly high level of emotional intimacy.

The word ''womance'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''woman'' and ''romance''.&lt;ref name="Meanley"/&gt; The emergence of the terms [[bromance]] and womance has been seen as reflecting increased relationship-seeking as a modern behavior.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt; Although womance is sometimes seen as the female flip side of ''[[bromance]]'',&lt;ref name="Koehn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wloszczyna"/&gt; some have seen different nuances in the [[social construction]] of the two concepts.&lt;ref name="Winch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammarén"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strait"/&gt; Hammarén sees "different values assigned to male and female friendships" and a dissimilarity in the "underlying power relation between the concepts",&lt;ref name="Hammarén"/&gt; and Winch has asserted several differences in the [[social construction]].&lt;ref name="Winch"/&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

A '''yogi''' (sometimes spelled '''jogi''') is a practitioner of [[yoga]].{{sfn|White|2012|p=8}} In [[Vedic Sanskrit]], yoga (from the root ''yuj'') means "to add", "to join", "to unite", or "to attach" in its most common literal sense, whereas in recent days, especially in the West, [[yoga]] often refers to physical exercises only. The term ''yogi'' is used broadly to refer to [[sannyasi]] or practitioners of [[meditation]] in a number of [[Indian religions]].&lt;ref name="Banerjea"&gt;A. K. Banerjea (2014), ''Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805347}}, pp. xxiii, 297-299, 331&lt;/ref&gt;  The feminine form is ''[[yogini]]'', but is not always used, especially in the West.

''Yogi'', or ''jogi'', since the 12th century [[Common era|CE]], while meaning those dedicated to Yoga practice, has also referred to members of the [[Nath]] [[siddha]] tradition of [[Hinduism]].{{sfn|White|2012|p=8-9}} Alternatively, in [[tantra]] traditions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], a practitioner of tantra (a ''tantrika'') may also be called a ''yogi''.&lt;ref name=ritagross87&gt;Rita Gross (1993), ''Buddhism After Patriarchy'', SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0791414033}}, pages 85–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon White (2013), Tantra in Practice, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817784}}, pp. xiii–xv&lt;/ref&gt; In Hindu mythology, god [[Shiva]] and goddess [[Parvati]] are depicted as an emblematic yogi–yogini pair.&lt;ref&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1994), ''The Presence of Siva'', Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019307}}, pp. 305-309, 356&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Hinduism small}}
In [[Classical Sanskrit]], the word ''yogi'' ([[Sanskrit]]: masc ''{{IAST|yogī}}'', [[Devanagari|योगी]]; fem ''{{IAST|[[yogini|yoginī]]}}'') is derived from ''yogin'', which refers to a practitioner of yoga. ''Yogi'' is technically male, and ''yoginī''  is the term used for female practitioners.&lt;ref name=ritagross87/&gt; The two terms are still used with those meanings today, but the word ''yogi'' is also used generically to refer to both male and female practitioners of yoga and related meditative practices belonging to any religion or spiritual method.

The term yogini is also used for divine goddesses and enlightened mothers, all revered as aspects of the [[mother goddess]], [[Devi]].&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia and Thomas B. Coburn (1999), ''Devi: The Great Goddess'', Smithsonian Institution, {{ISBN|978-3791321295}}, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

A yogi, states Banerjea, should not be confused with someone practicing [[asceticism]] and excessive self-mortification.&lt;ref name="Banerjea" /&gt;{{rp|297}}

==Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]] the term ''yogi'' refers to an adherent of [[yoga]].{{sfn|White|2012|p=8}}

{{Quote|
Carrying within oneself fire and poison, heaven and earth, ranging from enthusiasm and creativity to depression and agony, from the heights of spritual bliss to the heaviness of earth-bound labor. This is true of man in general and the [Vedic] Keśin in particular, but the latter has mastered and transformed these contrary forces and is a visible embodiment of accomplished spirituality. He is said to be light and enlightenment itself. The Keśin does not live a normal life of convention. His hair and beard grow longer, he spends long periods of time in absorption, musing and meditating and therefore he is called "sage" (muni). They wear clothes made of yellow rags fluttering in the wind, or perhaps more likely, they go naked, clad only in the yellow dust of the Indian soil. But their personalities are not bound to earth, for they follow the path of the mysterious wind when the gods enter them. He is someone lost in thoughts: he is miles away.
|Karel Werner (1977)|"Yoga and the Ṛg Veda: An Interpretation of the Keśin Hymn"&lt;ref name="karelwernerkesinrv" /&gt;}}

The term yogin appears in ''Katyayana Shrauta-sutra'' and chapter 6 of Maitri Upanishad, where the implied context and meaning is "a follower of the Yoga system , a contemplative saint".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche yogin], ''Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' (2008 revision), Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The term sometimes refers to a person who belongs to the Natha tradition.{{sfn|White|2012|p=8-9}} They usually belong to [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] tradition, but some Natha belong to the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] tradition.&lt;ref name="lorenzenmunozx" /&gt; In both cases, states David Lorenzen, they practice yoga and their principal god tends to be [[Nirguna]], that is a god that is without form and semi-[[Monism|monistic]],&lt;ref name="lorenzenmunozx" /&gt; influenced in the medieval era by the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, [[Madhyamaka]] school of Buddhism, as well as Tantra and Yogic practices.&lt;ref&gt;David Lorenzen (2004), ''Religious Movements in South Asia, 600-1800'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195664485}}, pp. 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David N.

===Sexuality===
A yogi or yogini aspires to [[Brahmacharya]] (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मचर्य), which means celibacy if single, or non-cheating on one's partner.&lt;ref name=ad&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), "The dharma of ethics, the ethics of dharma: Quizzing the ideals of Hinduism", ''Journal of Religious Ethics'', 30(3), pp. 347-372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yajnavalkya tells Gargi in verse 1.55 of [[Yoga Yajnavalkya]] that one who copulates (मैथुन) only with and always with one's sexual partner is a Brahmachari; see "[http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_yoga/yogayAjnyavalkya.pdf योगयाज्ञवल्क्य १-५५]" (Sanskrit text of "Yoga Yajnavalkya"), ''SanskritDocuments Archives'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two parallel views, in Hindu texts, on sexuality for a yogi and yogini. One view asserts restraint in sexual activity, towards [[monk]]- and [[nun]]-like asexuality, as transmutation away from worldly desires and onto a spiritual path.&lt;ref name=sovatskybrahmacharya/&gt; It is not considered, states Stuart Sovatsky, as a form of moralistic repression but a personal choice that empowers the yoga practitioner to redirect his or her energies.&lt;ref name=sovatskybrahmacharya&gt;Stuart Sovatsky (1987), "The pleasures of celibacy", ''Yoga Journal'', March/April Issue, pp. 41-47&lt;/ref&gt; The second view, found particularly in [[Tantra]] traditions according to David Gordon White, asserts that sexuality is an additional means for a yogi or yogini to journey towards and experience the bliss of "one realized god-consciousness for oneself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=White | first=David Gordon |date=2012 |title=The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second view, sexuality is a yogic practice,&lt;ref&gt;Machelle Seibel and Hari Kaur Khalsa (2002), ''A Woman's Book of Yoga'', Penguin, {{ISBN|978-1583331378}}, pp. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; and one broadly revered through the ''[[lingam]]''–''[[yoni]]'' iconography of [[Shiva]]–[[Parvati]], the divine yogi–yogini in Hindu mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1981), ''Siva: The Erotic Ascetic'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195202502}}, pp. 262-263&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical duties===
{{Quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#FFE0BB |align=right |salign = right 
|quote='''Yogi versus Philosopher'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Both a yogi and a philosopher are seekers of an absolute truth. But they differ in their modes of approach. A philosopher advances in the path of rational logic (theory) and wants to intellectually understand the Truth. A yogi advances in the path of self discipline (practice) and aspires to spiritually realize truth.

===Nath siddha===
[[File:Gorakshanath.jpg|200px|thumb|A sculpture of [[Gorakhnath]], a celebrated yogi of Nath tradition and a major proponent of Hatha yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Akshaya Kumar Banerjea|title=Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljn1koKa0CQC |year=1983|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0534-7 |pages=xxi }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to David White,
{{quote|''[[Siddha|&amp;#91;S&amp;#93;iddha]]'' means 'realized, perfected one',{{refn|group=note|Compare Siddhartha Gautama, one of the names of [[Buddha]].}} a term generally applied to a practitioner (''[[sādhaka]]'', ''[[sadhu]]'') who has, through his practice (''[[sadhana]]''), realized his dual goal of superhuman powers (''[[siddhi]]s'', 'realizations', 'perfections') and bodily immortality (''[[jivanmukti]]'').{{sfn|White|2012|p=2}}}}

====Respect====
Archeological evidence suggests that in some contexts and regions, yogi of the [[Nath]] Siddha tradition were respected and recognized in India. For example, inscriptions suggest a general of the Yadava king Ramacandra donated a village to a yogi in 13th-century.{{sfn|White|2012|p=94}} Near Mangalore, that later became a hub of Nath yogis, a monastery and temple was dedicated to yogis in the 10th-century.{{sfn|White|2012|p=94}}

David Lorenzen states that the Nath yogis have been very popular with the rural population in South Asia, with medieval era "tales and stories about Nath yogis such as Gorakhnath, Matsyendra, Jalandhar, Gopichand, Bharthari, Kanhapa and Chaurangi" continuing to be remembered in contemporary times, in the Deccan, western and northern states of India and in Nepal.&lt;ref name=lorenzenmunozx&gt;David N. Lorenzen and Adrián Muñoz (2012), ''Yogi Heroes and Poets: Histories and Legends of the Naths'', SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-1438438900}}, pp. x–xi&lt;/ref&gt;

====Persecution====
In some contexts, adds White, the term ''yogi'' has also been a pejorative term used in medieval India for a Nath siddha, particularly on the part of India's social, cultural and religious elites.{{sfn|White|2012|p=8-9}} The term ''siddha'' has become a broad sectarian appellation, applying to Saiva-devotees in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (''[[Maheśvara]] siddhas''), alchemists in Tamil Nadu ([[Siddhar|''siddhars'' or ''sittars]]''), a group of early Buddhist [[Tantra|tantrikas]] from Bengal (''[[mahasiddha]]s'', ''siddhacaryas''), the alchemists of medieval India (''rasa siddha''), and a mainly north Indian group known as the ''Nath siddhas''.{{sfn|White|2012|p=2}} The Nath siddhas are the only still existing representatives of the medieval Tantric tradition, which had disappeared due to its excesses.{{sfn|White|2012|p=7}} While the Nath siddhas enjoyed persistent popular success, they attracted the scorn of the elite classes.{{sfn|White|2012|p=7}}

[[File:17th century Hindu female Nath yogi painting.jpg|thumb|200px|17th century Hindu female Nath yogis. The earliest records mentioning female Nath yogis (or yogini) trace to 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alf Hiltebeitel|author2=Kathleen M. Erndl|title=Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQJzTr4c-g4C |year=2000|publisher=New York University Press |isbn=978-0-8147-3619-7 |pages=40–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to White, the term ''yogi'', has "for at least eight hundred years, been an all-purpose term employed to designate those Saiva specialists whom orthodox Hindus have considered suspect, heterodox, and even heretical in their doctrine and practice".{{sfn|White|2012|p=8}} The yoga as practiced by these Yogis, states White, is more closely identified in the eyes of those critics with black magic, sorcery and sexual perversions than with yoga in the conventional sense of the word.{{sfn|White|2012|p=9}}

The Nath Yogis were targets of Islamic persecution in the [[Mughal Empire]].  The texts of Yogi traditions from this period, state Shail Mayaram, refer to oppressions by Mughal officials such as governor. The Mughal documents confirm the existence of Nath Yogis in each ''pargana'' (household neighborhoods), and their persecution wherein Nath Yogis were beheaded by [[Aurangzeb]].&lt;ref&gt;Shail Mayaram (2003), ''Against History, Against State'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231127301}}, pp. 40-41, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resistance to persecution====
According to David Lorenzen, the religious groups in Hinduism that militarized and took up arms following the Muslim conquest of India, to resist persecution, appeared among the Nath or Kanphata yogis, often called simply yogis or jogis.&lt;ref&gt;David Lorenzen (2006), ''Who Invented Hinduism?'', Yoda Press, {{ISBN|978-8190227261}}, pp. 51-63&lt;/ref&gt;

The warrior [[ascetic]]s were institutionalized as a religious order by Gorakhnath and were expanding in the 13th century, after the establishment of the first Islamic Sultanate in India. They interacted and cooperated with ''[[fakir]]s'' of Sufi Muslims.&lt;ref name="whitesyogi198"&gt;David Gordon White (2011), ''Sinister Yogis'', University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226895147}}, pp. 198-207&lt;/ref&gt; The yogis feature prominently in Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire period official documents, states David White, both in terms of impressing the ruling elite in the Muslim administration and awards of receiving land grants in some cases such as by [[Akbar]], as well as those yogis who targeted the elite merchants and disrupted the business of administrative Islamic elites in urban areas.&lt;ref name="whitesyogi198" /&gt;&lt;ref name="williampinchwarascetic"&gt;William Pinch (2012), ''Warrior Ascetics and Indian Empires'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107406377}}, pp. 4-9, 28-34, 61-65, 150-151, 189-191, 194-207&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, yogis from the Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism marshaled armed resistance against the Mughal and British colonial armies.&lt;ref name="whitesyogi198" /&gt;&lt;ref name="williampinchwarascetic" /&gt;

====Cultural contributions: founding Hindu temples====
The history of Nath yogis has been diverse, such as in the 11th and 12th centuries, when Buddhists in South India converted to Nath siddha traditions and helped establish Shiva Hindu temples and monasteries.{{sfn|White|2012|pp=94-101}}
