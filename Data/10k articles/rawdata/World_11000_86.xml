      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">The '''1985 World Health Organization AIDS surveillance case definition''' was developed in October 1985, at a conference of [[public health]] officials including representatives of the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in [[Bangui]], [[Central African Republic]]. For this reason, it became to be known as the '''Bangui definition''' for AIDS.  It was developed to provide surveiling case definition of [[AIDS]] for use in countries where [[HIV test|testing for HIV antibodies]] was not available.

It stated the following:

==Revision==

The 1985 WHO AIDS surveillance case definition was heavily criticised, for both medical and political reasons. The [[1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition]] was introduced in 1994 to incorporate the statement that HIV testing ''should'' be done.  However, if testing was unavailable, then the Bangui definition should be used.

'''''African Independence''''' (2013) is a feature-length documentary film. This is the first film from producer [[Tukufu Zuberi]]. African Independence premiered at the [[San Diego Black Film Festival]] in January 2013.

''African Independence'' tells the story of some of the most important events to happen on the African continent since the slave trade and colonization by the Europeans. The film focuses on the [[African independence movements|African Independence Movements]] and the problems confronted by these movements to win independence. The film tells the story through interviews with independence activists and leaders who helped achieve independence for the African people.  By focusing on four watershed events-World War Two, the end of colonialism, the Cold War, and the era of African Republics, ''African Independence'' tells the story of African history, past and present. Tukufu Zuberi is also the host of the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanindependencefilm.wordpress.com African Independence Film]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Archaeological Institute of America''' ('''AIA''') is a [[North America]]n [[nonprofit organization]] devoted to the promotion of public interest in [[archaeology]], and the preservation of archaeological sites. It has offices on the campus of [[Boston University]] and in [[New York City]].

The institute was founded in 1879, with [[Charles Eliot Norton]] as its first President until 1890.  It was chartered in 1906 by the [[United States Congress]].  The institute currently has over 200,000 members and more than 100 local societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917095804/http://archaeological.org/|title=Archaeological Institute of America - Archaeology - Site Preservation|date=17 September 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Journal of Archaeology]]'', ''AJA'', is the AIA's peer-reviewed academic journal that appears four times each year.  The institute has also been publishing the magazine ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' since 1948.

==Governance==
The AIA is governed by a Council that meets once per year during the annual meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeological.org/about/governanc |title= Governing Board |author= |date= |work= |website=Archaeological.org |accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other times the Governing Board acts on behalf of the Council, with an Executive Committee of the board further acting on the board's behalf between meetings. An Executive Director, who is also known as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is appointed by the board to run day-to-day operations.

Actor [[Harrison Ford]], who portrayed the fictional archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]] in the titular series, has served as a General Trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeological.org/news/aianews/282|title=Harrison Ford Elected to AIA Board - Archaeological Institute of America|website=Archaeological.org|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president of the AIA is [[Jodi Magness]], while the first vice president is Laetitia La Follette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archaeological.org/about/governance|title=Governance - Archaeological Institute of America|website=Archaeological.org|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew M.

The '''Chervonokutska coal mine''' is an [[underground coal mine]] in the [[Luhansk]] region of [[Ukraine]]. 

An explosion in the mine on August 4, 2011, killed one worker and injured 25&amp;nbsp;others, including several who received severe burns.&lt;ref name=PlattsAug5&gt;[http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Coal/8203113 Ukrainian coalmine blast was caused by engineer mistake: minister], ''Platts News'', August 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion, at a depth of 155 m, was attributed to [[methane|methane gas]] accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Coal/8197044 New Ukraine coal mine explosion as safety review launched], ''Platts News'', August 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine's Minister of Energy and Coal Industry, [[Yuriy Boyko]], speculated that there had been errors in installation of a ventilation system intended to prevent methane build-up. Boyko announced that the mine's director and safety manager would be suspended while the accident was investigated.&lt;ref name=PlattsAug5/&gt;

'''Collège et Lycée Raponda Walker''' is in [[Port-Gentil]], the second largest city in [[Gabon]]. The school has just over a thousand pupils. Since 1975 it has been named for [[André Raponda Walker]], a writer and the first Catholic priest in Gabon.&lt;ref name=lef&gt;[http://www2.unil.ch/lefaitmissionnaire/Intro_19_final.pdf LFM: "Social Sciences and Missions"]. December 2006. Retrieved 11 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school was started in 1930 in the grounds of the new church of St. Louis by Father René Lefèbre. (The church had only been built in 1927.) The school was named then after the church.&lt;ref name=school&gt;[http://rapondawalker.free.fr/HISTOIRE.htm History of Raponda Walker], School web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the school was taken over by the [[Brothers of St. Gabriel]], but it was not until 1965 that a section for girls was introduced.&lt;ref name=school/&gt; In 1969, the school started mixed classes.{{clarify|date=June 2016|reason=somewhat contradicts previous sentence "it was not until 1965 that a section for girls was introduced". from 1965 to 1969, classes were not mixed (even though school was)?}}

In 1975, the school took on its existing name which is in honour of the first Gabonese person to be ordained as a catholic priest.&lt;ref name=lef/&gt;&lt;ref name=school/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2589">A '''development finance institution''' ('''DFI''') or '''development bank''' is a [[financial institution]] that provides [[risk capital]] for [[Economic development|economic development projects]].  They are often established by governments or charitable institutions to provide funds to projects that would otherwise not be able to get funds from commercial lenders.  Some development banks include [[socially responsible investing]] and [[impact investing]] criteria into their mandates.  Governments often use development banks to form part of their [[development aid]].

DFIs can include [[multilateral development bank]]s, bilateral development banks, [[microfinance institution]]s, [[community development financial institution]] and [[revolving loan fund]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Levere, Bill Schweke, and Beadsie Woo, Development Finance and Regional Economnic Development, Washington, DC: CFED, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions provide a crucial role in providing credit in the form of higher risk loans, equity positions and risk guarantee instruments to private sector investments in developing countries.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Dirk Willem te Velde and Michael Warner (2007) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=433&amp;title=use-subsidies-development-finance-institutions-infrastructure-sector Use of subsidies by Development Finance Institutions in the infrastructure sector] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; DFIs are typically backed by countries with developed economies. 

{{as of|2005}}, total commitments (as loans, equity, guarantees and debt securities) of the major regional, multilateral and bilateral DFIs totalled US$45 billion (US$21.3 billion of which went to support the private sector).&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;  DFIs often provide finance to the private sector for investments that promote development and to help companies to invest, especially in countries with various restrictions on the market.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

Development banks include:

* [[Community development bank]]s which fund low-income areas in the United States
* [[International financial institutions]] conducting development-oriented finance on a bilateral or multilateral basis
* [[National development bank]]s are government-owned financial institution that provides financing for economic development.
* [[multilateral development bank]] are development banks set up by a group of countries and often operate under international laws.

The '''[[Great Depression]]''' had a pronounced economic and political effect on '''[[South Africa]]''', as it did on most nations at the time.  As world trade slumped, demand for South African agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically.  It is believed that the social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the 1933 split between the "gesuiwerde" ([[Purified National Party|purified]]) and "smelter" (fusionist) factions within the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] and the National Party's subsequent fusion with the [[South African Party]].

The sudden lack of demand destroyed prices on commodities that were profitable to many [[Afrikaner]] farmers. For example, the price of wool fell 75% between 1925 and 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigarioseminars.co.za/great%20depression.doc Vigario Seminars: The Fall of the Greatest Monetary "Tower of Babel", part 3]&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of the agricultural industry were unable to repay [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] on their over-capitalized farms.  Thus, the National Party found itself losing favour with one of its largest constituencies&amp;mdash;conservative, rural Boers.

South Africa was saved from a complete collapse by the [[gold]] mining industry&amp;mdash;one of the largest and most advanced at the time&amp;mdash;as the price of gold rose rapidly as [[investors]] sought a haven from the dead securities market.  Growing gold exports compensated somewhat for the loss of other trade revenue.  However, like the situation with the Boers, the National party lost support as the weak economy forced the gold corporations to replace white labourers with lower-paid blacks.

The National Party-led government staved off bankruptcy by raising taxes on imports, [[petrol]] and [[postage]], amongst other things.  This "unfair" taxation led to further dislike of the ruling government.

The coalition government between [[Jan Smuts]] and [[J.B.M. Hertzog]] was successful in 1933 partly because Smuts presented the public with a mock budget showing how South Africa's economic [[malaise]] could be lifted by floating the [[South African pound]] and removing it from the [[Gold standard]], thus making exports more attractive, and creating a scenario in which undue taxation could be removed.

'''Hispasat''' is the operating company for a number of Spanish [[communications satellite]]s that cover the [[Americas]], Europe and North Africa from orbital positions 30° west and 61° west.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispasat.com/Detail.aspx?sectionsId=56&amp;lang=en]&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 1989 and its activities include provision of communication services in the commercial and government sectors (corporate networks, advanced telecommunications services, [[Telephone|telephony]], [[videoconferencing]], etc.). Hispasat's fleet of satellites broadcast more than 1,250 television channels and radio stations to more than 30 million homes, as well as providing services such as broadband to mobile telephones and landlines.&lt;ref name="informes"&gt;[http://www.hispasat.com/Detail.aspx?SectionsId=81&amp;lang=es Informes anuales de Hispasat].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Hispasat satellite sent into orbit was [[Hispasat 1A]], which was launched on 11 September 1992 on board an [[Ariane 4]] rocket from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] near [[Kourou]] in French Guiana. It was put into [[geostationary orbit]] at [[30th meridian west|30° west]] at a height of 36,000 [[Kilometre|km]], which is the location of all their subsequent satellites serving Spain and Europe.

The Amazonas satellites (61° west) were inaugurated in 2004 with the launch of [[Amazonas 1]], which serves the American market (mainly Latin America). [[Amazonas 2]] was launched on 1 October 2009 and [[Amazonas 3]] 7 February 2013&lt;ref name="amazonas3"&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/ciencia/noticia-hispasat-lanza-decimo-satelite-amazonas-20130208104508.html Hispasat lanza su décimo satélite, Amazonas 3]&lt;/ref&gt; replacing Amazonas 1, which was moved to a new position at 36° west in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Spacenews: [http://www.spacenews.com/article/satellite-telecom/34825amazonas-1-repositioned-to-inaugurate-new-slot Amazonas 1 Repositioned To Inaugurate New Slot]&lt;/ref&gt; Amazonas 4A was launched on 22 March 2014. A fifth generation of this satellite series, Amazonas 5, was launched on 11 September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/amazonas-5.htm Amazonas 5 on Gunter's Space Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate structure and shareholders ==
[[File:LOGO_color_sin_lema_fondo_negro_2.JPG|thumb|Former Hispasat logo, used from 2001 until May 2017]]
The Hispasat Group is formed of Hispasat SA, its subsidiaries Hispasat Canarias, Hispamar Satellites (a joint venture with the Brazilian telephone operator [[Oi (telecommunications)|Oi]]), Hispasat Brazil and associated companies Hisdesat Strategic Services and Galileo Systems and Services.

The range of Hispasat shareholders demonstrates the company's strategic nature both for the government and the Spanish telecommunications market. In 2012 Hispasat's shareholders included representatives from the Spanish public sector, [[Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales|State Industrial Holding Company]] (Sepi) with 7.41%, and the [[Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology]] (CDTI) with 1.85%, and [[Eutelsat]] with 33.6% and [[Abertis]], a group that specializes in the management of telecommunication's infrastructure and services, with 40.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hispasat |title=Accionistas de hispasat |url=http://www.hispasat.com/media//NotasDePrensa/ES/Accionistas_2009.pdf |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2012, the press were informed that [[Telefónica]] would sell Abertis its shares in Hispasat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Telefónica vende a Abertis su participación del 13,23% en Hispasat por 124 millones |url=http://www.larazon.es/noticia/1169-telefonica-vende-a-abertis-su-participacion-del-13-23-en-hispasat-por-124-millones |publisher=La Razón |date=21 February 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cabinet of Spain|Spanish government]] authorized the sale in December 2012.

Abertis bought 16.42% of Hispasat from the [[Ministry of Defence (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Defence]] on 25 July 2013, taking its stake in the company to 57.05% - with France's [[Eutelsat]] holding 33.69%, Spain's [[Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales|Sepi]] 7.41% and the country's  Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology 1.85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Abertis compra el 16,42% de Hispasat a Defensa y toma el control de la compañía | url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/07/25/economia/1374771776.html |publisher=El Mundo |date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== R+D+I projects ==

[[Image:Ccsarganda.jpg|derecha|thumb|250px|Antennas at Hispasat's Satellite Control Centre in Arganda del Rey (Madrid).]]

'''Ignis''': The IGNIS project (integral communications system for the control of forest fires) is part of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation's Innpacto project. It was launched in September 2011 with the main objective of developing short-term solutions to improve the telecommunications used while fighting forest fires.

'''Saturno''': Hispasat is coordinating the SATURNO Project (SATellite Universal Redistribution NetwOrk). SATURNO is a tractor project, included within the Spanish government's 2010 Plan Avanza for R+D Competitiveness, the plan's main objective is to investigate innovative solutions for content distribution via satellites in the digital home in order to maximise use of existing infrastructure and develop necessary equipment and systems. Solutions developed as part of SATURNO are based on the use of high-speed IP technologies and the reuse of domestic cabling.

'''Jedi''': The JEDI project (Just Exploring DImensions) started in 2010 with the objective of improving knowledge regarding the different formats and technologies related to 3D TV and how it will evolve and develop for consumers. JEDI is part of a European research project, ITEA 2, which forms part of the European [[EUREKA]] initiatives. Hispasat participates in the European JEDI consortium and is also a partner in the Spanish JEDI consortium collaborating on research and development projects under the aegis of Plan Avanza.

'''Phidias''': PHIDIAS (Hybrid Platform for the Intelligent Diffusion of Applications and Services for Television) is an Avanza Plan project. Its objective is the development of an integrated platform for hybrid broadcast broadband television (HbbTV) that combines the broadcast and broadband delivery of television through the Internet. The aim is to investigate different alternatives for technological solutions for HbbTV by developing specific applications (social networks, personalized advertising, interactive applications etc.). The ultimate objective is to produce a working model for both terrestrial and satellite television.

'''Intogener''': Hispasat participates in the INTOGENER Project to design a system to more precisely measure the flow of water in mountain watersheds with the objective of making the generation of hydroelectric power more efficient and sustainable. The project started in May 2012 and will be carried out in the Chilean [[Andes]] for a period of two years with a budget of over a million euros, with 50% of the budget coming from the [[European Space Agency]]. Other collaborators include [[Starlab]], as the project's coordinator, [[Endesa (Chile)|Endesa Chile]], the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] and the consultancy Future Water, which will provide the remaining 50% of the project's budget.

'''Härliga sommardag"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "Lovely summer's day") was the [[Sweden|Swedish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972]], performed in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] by [[Family Four]].

The song is about a lovely summer's day, with the band describing a beautiful day of summer which inspires people to make ballads and songs.

The song was performed 14th on the night (following [[Yugoslavia]]'s [[Tereza Kesovija]] with "[[Muzika i ti]]" and preceding [[Monaco]]'s [[Peter McLane]] &amp; [[Anne-Marie Godart]] with "[[Comme on s'aime]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 75 points, placing 13th in a field of 18.

It was succeeded as [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Swedish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973 Contest]] by [[Nova (Swedish band)|Nova]] with "[[You are summer - you never tell me no]]".

'''Kara-Tur''' is a [[fantasy world]] created by [[David "Zeb" Cook|David Cook]] which first appeared in the ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' rulebook for the first edition of the ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]] in 1986. Kara-Tur's cultures and peoples are fantasy analogues of medieval China, Korea, Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, Tibet, and other regions of East Asia. In 1987, Kara-Tur was placed on the same fictional world as the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' campaign setting.

==Publication history==

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''===
The fantasy setting known as Kara-Tur was described in the original 1985 ''Oriental Adventures'' book.&lt;ref name="WD74"/&gt; A reviewer for ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' called the long background section of Kara-Tur in the book, a "bonus".&lt;ref name="WD74"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Shepherd  | first =Ashley  | title =Open Box: Dungeon Modules  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | issue = 74  | pages =9–10  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=February 1986  | issn =0265-8712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kara-Tur is described in the "Province Book" from the 1986 ''[[Swords of the Daimyo]]'' module.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schick |first=Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence Schick|title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991|isbn=0-87975-653-5 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1987 ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'' left the eastern half of its continent reserved for the future publication of Kara-Tur.&lt;ref name="Dragon #129"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Rolston| first = Ken| authorlink = Ken Rolston| title = Role-playing Reviews| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #129| pages = 84–86| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jim Bambra]], "While primarily drawing on Japan for inspiration, [Kara-Tur] also contains elements of medieval China and Korea."&lt;ref name="Dragon #134"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Bambra| first = Jim| authorlink = Jim Bambra| title = Role-playing Reviews| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #134| pages = 76–77| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=June 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally intended as a western part of the continent of [[Oerik]], the first description of Kara-Tur, in the ''Oriental Adventures'' rulebook, made no attempt to link it with another D&amp;D game-world.  The first map of Kara-Tur appeared in the adventure module OA1: ''[[Swords of the Daimyo]]'', where the setting was still world-neutral.  In 1987, when [[Tactical Studies Rules|TSR]] published the first ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' boxed set, Kara-Tur was briefly described as the easternmost end of the continent of [[Faerûn]]. In 1988, [[Tactical Studies Rules|TSR]] released a boxed set, ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'', describing the region in greater detail, with two 96-page books and maps.

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition===
In 1989 a printing of ''Trail Maps'' for Kara-Tur appeared.

In 1990 the maps were again included in ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]''. Later that year TSR converted the monsters of Kara-Tur to second edition ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' rules as part of the ''Monstrous Compendium'' series.

After 1990, TSR ceased publishing new material related to Kara-Tur. The setting was, however, occasionally referred to by other TSR products such as ''[[Spelljammer]]'' and ''[[Ravenloft]]''.

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition===
After the release of Third Edition ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', [[Wizards of the Coast]] published a completely new version of ''Oriental Adventures''.  The default world of this new rulebook was ''[[Rokugan]]'', the setting for [[Alderac Entertainment Group|AEG's]] ''[[Legend of the Five Rings]]''.

The setting of Kara-Tur still exists on [[Abeir-Toril]] and is often mentioned in Forgotten Realms supplements. Characters and artifacts from Kara-Tur sometimes show up in Faerûn, but beyond that there is little interaction between the continents. In 2005, AEG dropped the D20 version of Legend of the Five Rings.

=== ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 5th edition ===
The 2015 release of ''Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide,'' a supplement, introduced Kara-Tur to the fifth edition of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. There is a brief description of the land along with references throughout the book to its culture and how certain classes or backgrounds might fit in there.

==Nations==
Ten distinct nations and regions described in the set include:
* Shou Lung: [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]]
* T'u Lung: Historical dissident states based in [[South China]] during eras of political disunity (i.e. [[Kingdom of Nanzhao|Nanzhao]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]], formerly centred in present-day [[Yunnan]] province)
* Wa: Feudal Japan ([[Edo period]])
* Kozakura: Japan&lt;ref name="WD80"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Shepherd  | first =Ashley  | title =Open Box  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | issue = 80  | pages =2–4  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=August 1986  | issn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;/[[Ryukyu Islands]] ([[Muromachi period|Ashikaga period]])
* Northern Wastes: Historical [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history|non-Sinic]] tribal societies of [[Manchuria]] or [[Northeast China]]

* Koryo: [[Korea]]
* The Island Kingdoms: [[History of indonesia#Pre-colonial civilisations|Pre-colonial]] [[Hindu]]-influenced civilizations of [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]].
* The Plain of Horses: Historical [[Mongolia]]. This region is the Kara-Tur portion of the [[List_of_regions_in_Faerûn#H|Hordelands]], also known as the Endless Wastes.  
* The Jungle Lands of Malatra: Pre-colonial civilizations of [[Indochina]] (historical versions of the [[Khmer Empire]] and [[Vietnam]]) as well as the [[Hill tribes#South-East Asia|hill tribe]]s inspired by their real-life Southeast Asian counterparts.

=== Shou Lung ===
The vast human empire of [[Shou Lung]] is undoubtedly the most powerful nation on the face of Abeir-Toril. The empire was started by a simple peasant known as Nung Fu, who was invested with the Emblems of Authority by the semi-legendary Nine Travelers (although it was his great grandson that was the first Emperor of the Li Dynasty). The Empire of Shou Lung has the longest history in Kara-Tur second only to the Empire of Wa. It has had six dynasties so far starting with Li Dynasty (Dynasty of Might), Ho Dynasty (Dynasty of Peace), Hai Dynasty (Dynasty of the Oceans), Kao Dynasty (The High Dynasty), La Dynasty (Wax Dynasty) and the Kuo Dynasty (Dynasty of the Nation). With an immense population, vast territory, and a central government managed by an efficient and generally honest bureaucracy, the Shou could, with a great deal of effort, come to completely dominate the planet. That they do not is due to cultural rather than military or economic factors. The Shou have been expansionists in the past, but the current emperor finds more pleasure in knowledge and culture than military conquest. This tendency has been reinforced by the recent Tuigan Horde invasion of 1359–1360 D.R., which devastated many of the northwestern provinces, decimated the armed forces, and left the upper ranks of the Mandarinate in a leaderless shambles. During this time, large numbers of Shou refugees fled westwards across the Golden Way trade route to the [[Unapproachable East]] in [[Faerûn]] and settled in the Thesk region. The nation is thus still recovering from the upheavals. So, while this nation controls the largest military spelljammer fleet in Realmspace, those vessels are employed in a strictly defensive role, rooting out pirates and acting as a counter to the spelljammer fleets of Wa and the Elven Imperial Fleet.

The official head of the government is the Celestial Emperor, but in practice everyday affairs of state are handled by the Chancellor, who executes the Emperor's decrees, oversees the bureaucracy and controls the information that reaches the emperor's ears. The current Emperor is Kai Tsao Shou Chin. The [[Wu Jen]]s are the Emperor's official court wizards, who advises the Emperor's policies with divinations and deals with magical threats. The government is composed of eight ministries: State, War, Magic, Faith, Sea, Agriculture, Public Works and State Security. It is a meritocratic system; every year the Civil Service Examination holds examinations to test candidates for government jobs. The Shou have always had a strong trading relation with Faerûn. In fact certain regions in Faerûn make a living solely on the imports from Shou Lung and many merchants, settlers, and diplomats have come to Faerûn in search of new opportunities in the West and set up the Shou Expatriate region. The people of Shou Lung frown upon the slave trade, and anybody found guilty of trafficking in slaves is put to death.

The main criminal organization in the country is the Tsui Tong (analog for the [[Triad society|Triad]]), which has a certain degree of freedom to operate within the semi-independent port city of Kai Shan due to the aid and support they gave the Emperor during the Black Cycle, which brought Shou Lung back from the brink of ruin. There are no Imperial troops stationed in Kai Shan, nor are there any magistrates or town guard. The city's reputation is its greatest defense, though the Shou fleet could certainly counter any attempts by outsiders to invade the city, as it is technically still a part of Shou Lung, and surrounded by other Imperial territories. It is rumored that the Tsui have contacts with the Chainmen (though selling Shou citizens to slavers would surely bring the wrath of the Emperor down on the city, if discovered), the Tenth Pit, and even the [[Zhentarim]] of Faerûn.

The Shou practice mainly two forms of religion, "The Path of Enlightenment" (analog for [[Confucianism]] and to an extent, Theravada [[Buddhism]]) and "The Way" (analog for [[Daoism]]). The majority of the people in Shou Lung practice the Path of Enlightenment, in which they worship the Celestial Emperor and the [[List of Forgotten Realms deities#Kara-Tur Pantheon|Nine Travelers]] and a whole host of lesser immortals and spirits who make up what is called the Celestial Bureaucracy. Unlike the people of Faerûn, devotion to a single deity is very rare in Shou Lung. The other Shou religion, which is more popular in the southern provinces, is simply called "The Way" and is more of an ethical philosophy than a true religion characterized by divinities, spirits and a fully realized metaphysics. It focuses on the enlightenment of the self through the practice of certain spiritual exercises rather than the worship of particular gods. Kana and her family were practitioners of the Way{{Or|date=November 2009}}.

Lying between Kara-Tur and the Horse-Plains was a Great Wall of Stone, better known as the Dragonwall{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. According to legend, a wu jen wizard was tasked by the emperor to find a way to keep the Tuigan hordes from raiding Shou Lung's northern provinces. The wu jen stole the Jade Mirror from the sea dragon Pao Hu Jen, whose body was thousands of kilometers long. The wu jen led the dragon on a chase along the border, and at a certain point stopped and held up the Jade Mirror to the dragon's eyes, which instantly turned him to stone. After his petrified body fell to the ground, the emperor had his engineers carve fortifications into it so that it could serve them as a defensive wall.

===T'u Lung===
T'u Lung has been a separate state from Shou Lung since breaking away from its northern neighbor nearly three centuries ago. It used to be the southern part of the Shou Lung Empire. Since the establishment of the Lui Dynasty (the Green Dynasty) and the founding of the T'u Lung Empire, Shou Lung and T'u Lung have officially been at war, although the conflicts have ebbed and flowed, of course, but the provinces along their borders have become deserted and ruined from the endemic warfare. There is currently a truce between the two nations.

Composed of six provinces T'u Lung is everything Shou Lung could become but is not. The provinces are ruled by hereditary nobles who pay as little attention to the T'u Emperor as they can get away with (although the real power rests with Empress Dowager Wai Locunni Eio). Taxes go unpaid, free men are enslaved, and criminals left free. The government is corrupt on all levels, though in some rare districts a local magistrate may be somewhat honest and honorable. Poverty runs rampant throughout the nation. Unless forced to unite by some outside force (in the past this has most often been an invading Shou army) the nobles of T'u Lung fight incessantly among themselves.

Many of the cities and towns are now in ruins, and even those that have not been abandoned have many ruined buildings. On the other hand, the nation's corrupt, ineffective government allows neogi, Chainmen, and pirate raids unheard of access. Only the random presence of powerful wu jen or shamans in some of the smaller villages appear as potential dangers to raiders. The nation has an active slave trade that often captures and sells Shou subjects to the Thayan slavers of Faerûn.

=== Wa ===
[[Jim Bambra]] felt that the island of Wa "draws its inspiration from the Tokugawa [[Shogunate]] of Japan and presents a more centralized and less war-torn period".&lt;ref name="Dragon #134" /&gt;

Emperor Kochi first claimed the island of Wa and started his empire when the Sacred Wand and the Moonlight Arrow, the emblems of the Imperial office, were given to him by the Spirit of Wa. The Empire of Wa was the first imperial state to be established in Kara-Tur, according to Waan tradition. The island nation of Wa has much in common with Kozakura culturally, despite (or perhaps because of) the two nations' traditional rivalry, but was mostly inhabited by non-human races such as the Hengeyokai. The Hengeyokai were humanoid spirit-animals who came in many forms such as rats, foxes, dogs and cats. Like Kozakura, Wa was composed of a series of islands clustered around a large central island, Tsukishima. Over 80% of Wa was mountainous, the other 20% composed the strips of habitable land along the coasts. Wa was particularly cursed by nature, as typhoons and earthquakes were not uncommon, and many of Wa's volcanoes were still active.

Waan government is similar to that of Kozakura as well, as there is an Emperor whose position is largely ceremonial, and the real ruler of the nation is the Shogun, Matasuuri Nagahide. Unlike Kozakura, however, the Shogunate of Wa is strong and vital, and in fact Wa is enjoying the longest period of peace of any nation in Kara-Tur. Peace has led to advancements in education and the arts, as well as a general increase in prosperity. The official religion of the country is a variation of the Shou Path of Enlightenment. A rigid caste-based social system ensures domestic tranquility, the distinct castes are strictly adhered to, travel is monitored by the Shogunate, and religion is regulated.

The nation is rather xenophobic and contact with foreign elements is forbidden. Foreign vessels are only allowed to dock at the port of Akkaido. Those who have adopted foreign customs and ways are oppressed, especially those who follow the recently imported Western deity, [[Chauntea]], the Goddess of Agriculture. In fact, most officials will go out of their way to make life hard for foreigners while they stay in Wa. The nation's prosperity is limited to the nobility and the merchants, as the peasantry staggers under a dizzying array of obligations, rules, and taxes. Ironically, Wa had a good trade relationship with Shou Lung, whom the Waans were once at war with, and anyone from Wa was granted Shou citizenship if they could prove that they had Shou ancestry, since many Shou soldiers remained in Wa and intermarried with the locals after the Omi War. In fact, the famous Grey Blossom mercenaries of Wa were started by Shou Army soldiers who decided to stay in Wa.

Ronin and out of work bushi caused many problems in Wa since the Shogun's administrative reforms reduced the numbers of the nobility and soldiery to more reasonable levels. The Shogun had been considering setting up a colony on the planet Garden in Realmspace for the express purpose of reducing the number of troublemakers in his realm. Like Kozakura, the main criminal organization was the Yakuza.

=== Kozakura ===
[[Jim Bambra]] likened Kozakura to a fantasy version of feudal Japan, stating that it closely resembles "the war-torn period of Japanese history between the Kamakura and Sengoku periods, when rival daimyos engaged in bloody struggles for power".&lt;ref name="Dragon #134"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Bambra| first = Jim| authorlink = Jim Bambra| title = Role-playing Reviews| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #134| pages = 76–77| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=June 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island Empire of Kozakura was founded by Emperor Miki late into the Omi Wars when the land was not yet "discovered" by the Shou and Wa nations. The land of Kozakura was inhabited by the humans and Korobokuru (a Far Eastern analog to the [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Dwarves]]) and full of beautiful mountains, thick forests and sparkling seas. The majority of the inhabitants live on the main island of Shinkoku, but there are nearly a thousand islands surrounding it. Because Korobokkuru living in the Empire were often treated as lower class citizens while the memories of subjugation from the humans during the formation of the Empire was still fresh in the Korobokkuru's memories, many of the Korobokuru lived along the coasts, and in the inaccessible central mountains far from human settlements. Powerful samurai ruled the land, and in theory their power devolved from the Kozakuran Emperor of the Jade Throne. For many years the position of Emperor had been a purely ceremonial office, however, and the real political power rested in the hands of the Shogun, the military commander and dictator of the nation. The nation is currently in the midst of a Byzantine civil war between various feudal factions and has not had much contact with outsiders. The official Kozakuran state religion is known as the faith of the Eight Million Gods (an analog for Japanese [[Shinto]]), which involved worship of a host of animistic nature deities and spirits including a sun goddess and the Emperor of Kozakura himself, who was believed to have descended from a divine ancestry related to the sun goddess. There was also another popular religion called the Way of Enlightenment, which was a variation of the Shou Path of Enlightenment that was brought to Kozakura by Shou missionaries. The Kozakuran variation of this faith's name also serves as an insult to the other rival Shou religion to the Path of Enlightenment, which is known colloquially in Shou Lung as "The Way". The main criminal organization are called the [[Yakuza]].

=== Tabot ===
The Tabot nation was formed during the "Year of Frost" when the Shou Ho Dynasty decreed that the Path of Enlightenment was to be the official and only religion in Shou Lung. Many monks, temples and religious orders of the Way were persecuted in Shou Lung and they fled to the mountains. The temple militias of sohei and monks that fled there formed an alliance against the Shou and founded the nation of Tabot. The Shou attempted invasions well into the early Kai Dynasty but had little success due to the Crystalline Warriors of Ji that protected Tabot. Centuries later, the nobles of Tabot were overthrown by a six-year-old boy called the High Lord of Oceans, and established Tabot's current theocratic government in which the clergy of the Way holds most political power in the mountainous nation.

=== Koryo ===
The Kingdom of Koryo held power over the entire peninsula of Choson. The kingdom had it origins in the Kingdom of Silla. When the King of Silla attempted to launch an attack on their hated enemies the Kozakurans (who had tried to invade the Choson Peninsula in the past), his fleet was destroyed by a ''tsunami'', which allowed one of his generals, Wanang Sun, to overthrow him. Under Sun, he was able to unite all the factions of Choson and establish the united Koryo Kingdom.

=== Horse-Plains ===
The [[barbarian]]s of the Horse-Plain has tried countless times to invade their neighbors, the Shou and T'u Lung and have been successful on a few accounts, but their victories were often short lived. Recently though, Tuigan tribes successfully breached the Dragonwall and devastated many of the northwestern provinces of the Shou Empire. During this invasion, many Shou refugees fled to [[Faerûn]] and settled in the Thesk region of the Unapproachable East. The Horde tribes were eventually driven out and the Shou and T'u have been focusing most of their military prowess towards defending against further invasions.

== Important events ==

=== Omi War ===
During the Hai Dynasty in Shou Lung when Wa pirates raided the Celestial Sea and the Shou coastlines, the Shou Emperor was convinced that the Wa warlords had something to do with it. He demanded that the warlords cease and desist and swear fealty to him. Offended, the Wa Emperor refused and gave no reply to the Shou. Seeing no end to the raids and attacks by the pirates, the Shou Emperor amassed a fleet of 100,000 ships to launch an invasion of Wa. Hearing of the pending invasion, the Wa Emperor enlisted the aid of a counselor named Nobunaga who prepared Wa's defenses and sent the ninja master Fukio to infiltrate Shou Lung.

Shou Lung quickly captured the northern and southern coastlines of Wa but the fortification of central Wa by Nobunaga proved stronger and central Wa avoided the consequences of the Shou invasion. Many captured northern and southern coastal Wa daimyos betrayed Nobunaga after their cities fell and they lent their aid to the Shou generals.

The Shou Emperor, who was aboard the royal flagship, was assassinated by the ninja Fukio who was in disguise. However, Fukio was not able to escape and was killed by the Emperor's Western wu jen Rourke. The Emblems of Authority were recovered by Rourke but he was slain when he returned to the Imperial Palace in Shou Lung. With no heir, many of the most powerful Shou generals returned to Shou Lung and fought for power leaving only a handful to continue the invasion of Wa. The Shou leadership was thrown into despair and this period is known as the Black Cycle. With the greatly reduced number of Shou troops now occupying its territory, Wa was able to take back most of the occupied provinces from the Shou. Even though most Shou troops were driven back, they were never truly defeated and Wa was left in a state of sporadic warfare. Some of the remaining Shou generals continued with guerrilla warfare against the Wa while others offered an armistice to the Wa Emperor and were granted governorship over the territories they controlled. When a new Shou Emperor finally ascended the throne and tried to enlist his former generals back into Shou service, many of them decided to side with the throne of Wa rather than the Shou. Even so, their resistance was futile since the remaining Wa daimyos were divided and suspicious of each other and the years of war had left Wa with no effective central government. Shou Lung soon took control of Wa.

When civil war erupted in Shou Lung between the Shou and the T'u and the northern provinces of Shou were invaded by the Horse Barbarians, the remaining Waan daimyos took advantage of this opportunity and under the united banner of Nitta Shogoro, they were able to finally drive out the occupying Shou troops. Beset on all sides, the Shou conceded ultimate defeat and Wa was declared an independent state. The two countries quickly reached an agreement to open their ports to one another's merchants to allow trade between the two countries and to fill both emperors' treasuries. The Grey Blossom mercenary regiment of the Shou Army that had occupied Wa asked permission to remain in Wa since they had been stationed there for so long that they had made their own lives in that nation, many intermarrying with Waan wives. The Shou and Wa Emperors granted them permission to remain and they became one of the most famous mercenary bands of Wa. But in less than 5 years, the petty Wa warlords turned on each other once more and the Waan government was split into factions and plunged the island into 200 years of civil war before any type of stable government was established. Up to this day, the Waan daimyos remain divided but they provide a unified front against all foreigners.

=== Black Cycle ===
When the Shou Emperor was assassinated during the Omi War and there was no heir to the throne, the leadership of Shou Lung fell into chaos. The six southern provinces (now the Empire of T'u Lung), were marked by repeated invasions from southern barbarian tribes. Only a small number of cities that still had feudal lords in power maintained any semblance of order. The most famous of these feudal families were the Yang and Wai clans, which later played a large role in the Shou and T'u Lung civil war. The western lands also fell under the control of Copper Demons who ruled the land in a brutal fashion. A criminal family from Kai Shan eventually seized control of that city and became semi-independent. This family later supported an adventurer named Wo Mai, who claimed to be a descendent of the Shou Empire's founder, in recovering the Emblems of Authority and was crowned the new Emperor and established the Kao Dynasty. Because of the criminal family's aid to Wo Mai, the city of Kai Shan to this day retains its autonomy and the ruling criminal family grew into what is known today as the Triad or Tsui Tong. Wo Mai and the Seven Heroes and Seven Nonmen soon set forth for the western regions and ended the reign of the Copper Demons. They also defeated the last of the barbarian tribes invading the southern provinces and reestablished Shou control. Also at this time, a secret organization called the Cult of the Black Panther was helping peasants that were displaced by the war between Imperial troops and the invading southern barbarians start new lives independent of barbarian and Shou control alike.

=== Uncountable Wars ===
The civil war between Shou Lung and the six southern provinces of its empire who later formed the breakaway Empire of T'u Lung had its seeds planted when the first Li Dynasty of the Empire was established. During that time, a secret organization known as the Cult of the Black Panther, whose leaders claimed that they were immortals who had aided the Nine Travelers in ruling Kara-Tur when they were still humans, made a claim that they were the rightful successors to the Nine Travelers. Because of their mystic powers, they were held in more fear and reverence in the southern provinces than the Shou Emperor. Led by the great General Wo Chan, Shou troops fought the Cult of the Black Panther in what was later known as the Battle of Infinite Darkness, and managed to destroy the Cult's temple in Durkon. The Shou finally ended the resistance in the southern provinces and established firm political control over the area. The leader of the Cult was never found.

During the Black Cycle, the southern area of Shou Lung (now the Empire of T'u Lung), was marked by repeated invasions from southern barbarian tribes. Only a small number of cities that still had feudal lords in power maintained any semblance of order. The most powerful of these feudal families were the Yang and Wai clans. Also during this time the Cult of the Black Panther reemerged and began helping peasant families that were displaced by the war between the Imperial Army and the invading southern barbarian tribes. Shortly after the Wa declaration of independence from Shou rule, the southern provinces were plagued with screaming spirits that killed many incompetent and corrupt bureaucrats in what is now known as the Nights of Screaming Demons. Later investigations linked this event to the Cult of the Black Panther. Soon, many key military positions in the Shou Army were filled by people from the southern provinces. When the southern barbarians again attempted to invade the Empire, the Shou Army made short work of the invading barbarians. After the last Emperor of the Kao Dynasty, he was succeeded by his cousin who established the La Dynasty. The first Shou emperor of the La Dynasty was a weak ruler whose court was easily infiltrated by the agents of the Cult of the Black Panther who secretly ruled and manipulated the Shou government from within. The Yang and Wai clans soon led a revolt against the corrupt northern bureaucrats and quickly established a power base of their own in the south provinces. At this point the nobles of the south considered themselves a separate force from the bureaucrats of the La Dynasty who governed the northern provinces, but believed that they still belonged to the same Shou nation and they also continued to acknowledge the authority of the Shou emperor, even if his authority was recognized only in name in the southern provinces.

When two concubines of the last Emperor of the La Dynasty gave birth within hours of each other, he refused to name an heir knowing that if he did, his life would be in jeopardy. Years later he died before naming either of his sons as heir. The northern bureaucrats favored Prince Shin Lu while the southern nobles favored Prince Shin Gisen. War broke out between the northern and the southern provinces as the various factions rallied behind their preferred candidate for the Imperial throne. Shin Lu's forces defeated Shin Gisen's troops but were too weak and exhausted to pursue the enemy and eradicated the military strength of the southern nobility. Shin Lu proclaimed himself the Emperor of Shou Lung and established the newborn Kuo Dynasty. Shortly after Shin Ginsen proclaimed himself as the first Emperor of the Lui Dynasty and established the T'u Lung Empire in the six southern provinces that had long been largely autonomous from the rest of the Shou state. To repel the Shou troops from his newborn state, Shin Ginsen appealed to secret societies such as the Black Leopard Cult and granted them amnesty from Imperial persecution along with other religious and political organizations that were considered illegal in Shou Lung as long as they lent their considerable power to repelling the Shou from T'u territory. The T'u proved successful at driving the Shou Army back across the border with the aid of their new allies, and established the independence of their Empire&amp;mdash;but the price was high, for now the throne of T'u Lung never had as strong a grasp over its state as the Shou ruler did over his. For the next 250 years, Shou and T'u waged what are known as the Uncountable Wars, with these conflicts ravaging the territories that lay along the Shou-T'u border.

=== The Great Hunt ===
When Wa was planning to expand its territory, they sent an invasion fleet with 1,000 ships to Kozakura led by Hidegari Iegusa. The Waan fleet was able to capture the southern tip of Shinkoku with little trouble but could not advance further because of Kozakuran fortifications. The borders of the captured territory were raided constantly by Kozakuran troops. Both sides attempted to break the stalemate and Kozakuran troops led by Honda no Motosune launched a naval strike against the Waan ships and for days battles raged on the decks of 300 ships. In the end, Iegusa was killed and his army driven out of Shinoku. During this period, the non-humans in the occupied areas rebelled against their Waan colonizers and established independence. They hunted down all Waan survivors and stragglers and exacted a violent revenge on them. They made it into a sport and this period eventually came to be known as the Great Hunt. When Motosune drove out the remaining Waan fleets, he tried to reestablish control in the southern areas. To his surprise, the people of the area previously occupied by the Waan forces refused to be reincorporated into the Kozakuran Empire and insisted on remaining independent. Motosune massacred the spirit folk inhabitants of these villages and reclaimed control over the southern prefectures of Kozakura, but in so doing the Kozakuran Shogunate earned the enmity of the spirit folk of Kozakura for many centuries.

The '''Late Holocene Rainforest Crisis''' was a loss of [[African rainforest]]s which happened around 600BC, with the [[Rainforest|forests]] being replaced by dryer [[savanna]]. After around 600 years the forests grew back. As causes for the crisis, both [[Climate change|natural climate change]] and human interference have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/did-humans-or-climate-cause-the-great-rainforest-crisis/|title=African rainforests vanished for 600 years, then bounced back—why?|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bostoen|first=Koen|last2=Clist|first2=Bernard|last3=Doumenge|first3=Charles|last4=Grollemund|first4=Rebecca|last5=Hombert|first5=Jean-Marie|last6=Muluwa|first6=Joseph Koni|last7=Maley|first7=Jean|date=2015-06-01|title=Middle to Late Holocene Paleoclimatic Change and the Early Bantu Expansion in the Rain Forests of Western Central Africa|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/681436|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=56|issue=3|pages=354–384|doi=10.1086/681436|issn=0011-3204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maley|first=Jean|last2=Doumenge|first2=Charles|last3=Giresse|first3=Pierre|last4=Mahé|first4=Gil|last5=Philippon|first5=Nathalie|last6=Hubau|first6=Wannes|last7=Lokonda|first7=Michel O.|last8=Tshibamba|first8=John M.|last9=Chepstow-Lusty|first9=Alex|date=2018-01-01|title=Late Holocene forest contraction and fragmentation in central Africa|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/late-holocene-forest-contraction-and-fragmentation-in-central-africa/97E7BBD33C8036A9DB92EE4C0B89905F|journal=Quaternary Research|language=en|volume=89|issue=1|pages=43–59|doi=10.1017/qua.2017.97|issn=0033-5894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liechtenstein Homeland Service''' ({{lang-de|Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst}}, '''LHD''') was a political party in [[Liechtenstein]] that advocated [[corporate statism]] and the abolition of [[Political party|party politics]].&lt;ref name="National Archives" /&gt; 

Established in the autumn of 1933, the party's positions began to radicalize and move toward [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ideas within a few months of existence.&lt;ref name="National Archives" /&gt; By December 1933, this radicalization caused some members (such as co-founder Eugen Schafhauser) to abandon the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schafhauser, Eugen|url=http://www.e-archiv.li/personDetail.aspx?backurl=auto&amp;persID=29671|work=e-archiv.li|publisher=Liechtenstein National Archives|accessdate=22 February 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

LHD merged with the [[Christian-Social People's Party (Liechtenstein)|Christian-Social People's Party]] (VP) in 1936 to form the [[Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein)|Patriotic Union]] (VU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parties in Liechtenstein 1921-1943|url=http://www.fuerstundvolk.li/fuv/fuv.do?site=421174076f221000996d610c1957690b|work=Prince and People: Liechtenstein Civics|publisher=School Office of the Principality of Liechtenstein|accessdate=13 February 2014|language=German|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medal for Outstanding Civic Service''' or ''Medaljen for Borgerdåd'' is the second highest ranked [[Norway|Norwegian]] medal. In spring 2004 the medal ceased to be awarded. The medal was first established by Royal Resolution April 10, 1819 and later altered by Royal Resolution April 13, 1844. It was awarded by the cabinet meeting presided over by the King after a recommendation by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Justice]].

It is divided into two grades: the first class is in gold and the second class is in silver.

Recipients of the Medal for Outstanding Civic Achievement are ranked 2nd in the [[Norwegian order of precedence]], after recipients of the [[War Cross with sword]] and before holders of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=33029&amp;sek=33027&amp;scope=27248 |title=Norwegian Decorations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=5 April 2017 |website=royalcourt.no |publisher=The Royal House of Norway |access-date=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Ne brini"''' ("Don't worry") was the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]], performed in Bosnian and English by [[Mija Martina]].&lt;br&gt;
The song was performed sixth on the night, following [[Malta]]'s [[Lynn Chircop|Lynn]] with "[[To Dream Again]]" and preceding [[Portugal]]'s [[Rita Guerra]] with "[[Deixa-me sonhar (só mais uma vez)|Deixa-me sonhar]]". At the close of voting, it had received 27 points, placing 16th in a field of 26. Mija managed to earn Turkey's maximum, 12 points accumulated into her final score.

The song is sung from the perspective of a woman whose lover has just broken up with her. She reacts to his claims that he never loved her in the first place with derision and tells him not to worry about her.

The song was recorded and released on the official 2003 Eurovision Song Contest album as 'Could It Be', sung in English.

It was succeeded as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bosnian and Herzegovinian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 contest]] by [[Deen (singer)|Deen]] with "[[In The Disco]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29125">{{Banking|banks}}
An '''offshore bank''' is a [[bank]] regulated under international banking license (often called offshore license), which usually prohibits the bank from establishing any business activities in the jurisdiction of establishment. Due to [[Regulatory competition|less regulation]] and transparency, accounts with offshore banks were often used to hide undeclared income. Since the 1980s, jurisdictions that provide financial services to nonresidents on a big scale, can be referred to as '''[[offshore financial centre]]s'''. Since OFCs often also levy little or no tax corporate and/or personal income and offer, they are often referred to as [[tax haven]]s.

With worldwide increasing measures on CFT ([[Terrorism financing|combatting the financing of terrorism]]) and AML ([[Anti Money Laundering|anti-money laundering]]) compliance, the offshore banking sector in most jurisdictions was subject to changing regulations. Since 2000 the [[Financial Action Task Force]] issues the so-called FATF blacklist of "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" (NCCTs), which it perceived to be non-cooperative in the global fight against [[money laundering]] and [[Terrorism financing|terrorist financing]].

An account held in a foreign offshore bank, is often described as an '''offshore account'''. Typically, an individual or company will maintain an offshore account for the [[finance|financial]] and legal advantages it provides, including:

* Greater [[privacy]] (see also [[bank secrecy]], a principle born with the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks|1934 Swiss Banking Act]])
* Little or no [[tax]]ation (i.e., [[tax haven]]s)
* Easy access to [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]] (at least in terms of regulation)
* Protection against local, political, or financial instability.

While the term originates from the [[Channel Islands]] being "offshore" from the [[United Kingdom]], and while most offshore banks are located in [[island nation]]s to this day, the term is used figuratively to refer to any bank used for these advantages, regardless of location. Thus, some banks in landlocked [[Andorra]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[Switzerland]] may be described as "offshore banks".

Offshore banking has often been associated with the [[underground economy]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxjustice.net/2014/01/17/price-offshore-revisited/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organized crime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Crime and Justice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gtSuNX36cpcC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2010-11-15|isbn = 9781139492379|language = en|first = Mangai|last = Natarajan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tax evasion]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/uac/Offshore-Tax-Avoidance-and-IRS-Compliance-Efforts&lt;/ref&gt; and [[money laundering]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Money Laundering|url = https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-5690-2_439|publisher = Springer New York|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9781461456896|pages = 3137–3144|language = en|first = Brigitte|last = Unger|editor-first = Gerben|editor-last = Bruinsma|editor-first2 = David|editor-last2 = Weisburd}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, legally, offshore banking does not prevent assets from being subject to personal [[income tax]] on [[interest]]. Except for certain people who meet fairly complex requirements (such as [[perpetual traveler]]s), the personal income tax laws of many countries (e.g., France, Malaysia, and the United States)&lt;ref&gt;In other countries no difference so long as you are resident and domiciled there (for example, the United Kingdom) {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; make no distinction between interest earned in local banks and that earned abroad. Persons subject to [[Taxation in the United States|US income tax]], for example, are required to declare, on penalty of [[perjury]], any foreign bank [[Deposit account|accounts]]—which may or may not be [[numbered bank account]]s—they may have. Although offshore banks may decide not to report income to other tax authorities and have no legal obligation to do so, as they are protected by [[bank secrecy]], this does not make the non-declaration of the income by the taxpayer or the [[tax evasion|evasion]] of the tax on that income legal. Following the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], there have been many calls to increase regulation on international finance, in particular concerning offshore banks, tax havens, and [[clearing (finance)|clearing houses]] such as [[Clearstream]], based in Luxembourg, which are possible crossroads{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} for major illegal money flows.

==Offshore banking comparison by jurisdictions==
The most popular offshore financial centres are in jurisdictions with a history of political and economic stability. In terms of offshore banking centres and in terms of total deposits, the global market is dominated by [[Switzerland]] and the [[Cayman Islands]]. A letter by the District Attorney of New York, Robert M. Morgenthau, published by ''[[The New York Times]]'', states that the Cayman Islands has US$1.9 trillion on deposit in 281 banks, including 40 of the world’s top 50 banks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/opinion/lweb11morgenthau.html|title=Havens for Tax Evasion|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; although official statistics published by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority suggest the amounts held on deposit are actually around US$1.5 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimoney.com.ky/stats_reg_ent/stats_reg_ent.aspx?id=200#Detailed_Statistics|title=Banking Statistics (Cayman)|publisher=Cayman Islands Monetary Authority|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other [[offshore jurisdictions]] also provide offshore banking to a greater or lesser degree. In particular, [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]], and the [[Isle of Man]] are known for their well regulated banking infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book:Trust law in wealth management and estate planning|Trust Law in Wealth Management and Estate Planning, p.429]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some offshore jurisdictions have steered their financial sectors away from offshore banking, as difficult to properly regulate and liable to give rise to financial scandal.&lt;ref&gt;For example, despite being the largest offshore jurisdiction by some distance in terms of number of incorporated offshore vehicles, the [[British Virgin Islands]] has only ever licensed seven offshore banks. This compares against hundreds in Switzerland, the Cayman Islands, and (third in number of total banking licences) the [[Bahamas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weakened bank secrecy===
Since starting to survey offshore jurisdictions on April 2, 2009, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) at the forefront of a crackdown on tax evasion, will not object to governments using stolen bank data to track down tax evasion in offshore centers, such as in the [[2008 Liechtenstein tax affair]]. The recent sharing of confidential UBS bank details about 285 clients suspected of willful tax evasion by the [[United States Internal Revenue Service]] was ruled a violation of both Swiss law and the country’s constitution by a Swiss federal administrative court. Nevertheless, OECD has removed 18 countries, including Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, from a so-called "grey list" of countries that did not offer sufficient tax transparency, and has re-categorized them as "white list" countries. Countries that do not comply may face sanctions.

A notable exception is [[Panama]], whose canal provides it with a unique type of immunity to international pressure.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Given the enlargement of the canal to accommodate larger shipping, it is unlikely that Panama would succumb in the foreseeable future to international pressure toward transparency.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} A team of journalists took in their hands the task of providing data on Panama offshores with the initiative known as the [[Panama papers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Panama Papers|url=https://panamapapers.icij.org|website=Panama Papers Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of offshore financial centres===
{{Main|List of offshore financial centres}}

==Scope of offshore banking==
Offshore banking constitutes a sizable portion of the international financial system. Experts believe that as much as half the world's capital flows through offshore centers. [[Tax haven]]s have 1.2% of the world's population and hold 26% of the world's wealth, including 31% of the net profits of [[United States]] [[multinational corporation|multinationals]]. An estimated £13-20 trillion is hoarded away in offshore accounts.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;The Guardian (UK), 21 July 2012, "£13tn: Hoard Hidden from Taxman by Global Elite," http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/21/global-elite-tax-offshore-economy&lt;/ref&gt;

Some $3 trillion is in deposits in tax haven banks and the rest is in securities held by [[International business company|international business companies]] (IBCs) and [[Trust law|trusts]]. Among offshore banks, [[Swiss bank]]s hold an estimated 35% of the world's private and institutional funds (or 3 trillion [[Swiss franc]]s), and the [[Cayman Islands]] (1.9 trillion US dollars in deposits) are the fifth largest banking centre globally in terms of deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankintroductions.com/switzerland.html |title=Open a bank account in Switzerland |publisher=BankIntroductions.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent data by the [[Swiss National Bank]] show that the assets held by foreign persons in Swiss bank accounts declined by 28.1% between January 2008 and November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myprivatebanking.com/article/wealth-management-industry-analysis/ |title=Are Private Foreign Assets Fleeing From Switzerland? |publisher=MyPrivateBanking.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banking advantages==
*Offshore banks can sometimes provide access to politically and economically stable jurisdictions. This will be an advantage for residents of areas where there is a risk of political turmoil, who fear their assets may be frozen, seized or disappear (see the ''[[corralito]]'' for example, during the 2001 [[Argentine economic crisis]]). However, it is often argued that developed countries with regulated banking systems offer the same advantages in terms of stability.
*Some offshore banks may operate with a lower cost base and can provide higher [[interest rate]]s than the legal rate in the home country due to lower overheads and a lack of government intervention. Advocates of offshore banking often characterize government regulation as a form of tax on domestic banks, reducing interest rates on deposits. However, this is scarcely true now; most offshore countries offer very similar interest rates than those that are offered back home.
*Offshore finance is one of the few industries, along with [[tourism]], in which geographically remote island countries can competitively engage. It can help developing countries source investment and create growth in their economies, and can help redistribute world finance from the developed to the developing world. But equally, well-resourced and developed countries such as New Zealand offer a safe and well administered background for these financial services.
*Interest is generally paid by offshore banks without tax being deducted. This is an advantage to individuals who do not pay tax on worldwide income, or who do not pay tax until the tax return is agreed, or who feel that they can illegally evade tax by hiding the interest incomes.
*Some offshore banks offer banking [[Customer service|services]] that may not be available from domestic banks such as anonymous bank accounts, higher or lower rate loans based on risk and investment opportunities not available elsewhere.
*Offshore banking is often linked to other structures, such as [[offshore company|offshore companies]], [[offshore trust|trusts]] or [[private foundation|foundations]], which may have specific tax advantages and first security bank solutions incorporated in particular jurisdictions.

==Banking disadvantages==
*Offshore bank accounts are sometimes less financially secure than domestic ones.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} For example, in the banking crisis which swept the world in 2008, some savers lost funds that were not insured by the country in which they were deposited. Those who had deposited with the same banks onshore {{where|date=September 2017}} received all of their money back.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 2009, The Isle of Man authorities were keen to point out that 90% of the claimants were paid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcs.im/dcs/dcs.nsf/220509|title=Isle of Man Depositors' Compensation Scheme|publisher=Dcs.im|date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this only referred to the number of people who had received money from their depositor compensation scheme and not the amount of money refunded. In reality, only 40% of depositor funds had been repaid: 24.8% in September 2009 and 15.2% in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaupthingsingers.co.im|title=Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander (Isle of Man) Limited (In Liquidation) |publisher=Kaupthingsingers.co.im|date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both offshore and onshore banking centres often have depositor compensation schemes. For example: The Isle of Man compensation scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/fsc/investor/dep_comp.xml|title=FSC - Depositors' Compensation Scheme - Financial Supervision Commission|publisher=Gov.im|date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; guarantees £50,000 of net deposits per individual depositor, or £20,000 for most other categories of depositor. Potential depositors should be aware that any deposits over the guaranteed amount are at risk. However, only offshore centres such as the Isle of Man have refused to compensate depositors 100% of their funds following bank collapses. Onshore depositors have been refunded in full, regardless of what the compensation limit of that country has stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7658725.stm|title=Business &amp;#124; Icelandic bank savers bailed out|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-10-08 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, banking offshore is historically riskier than banking onshore.
*Offshore banking has been associated in the past with the [[underground economy]] and [[organized crime]], through [[money laundering]].&lt;ref name='R000007'&gt;{{cite news|first= |last=[[Joseph Stiglitz]]|coauthors= |title=A crisis of confidence - Letting financial markets run wild was risky business indeed. Transparency, oversight and fair competition are needed now|date=2008-10-22|publisher= |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/22/economy-financial-crisis-regulation|work=[[The Guardian]]|pages= |accessdate=2008-11-24 |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], offshore banks and tax havens, along with clearing houses, have been accused of helping various organized crime gangs, [[terrorism|terrorist]] groups, and other state or non-state actors. However, offshore banking is a legitimate financial exercise undertaken by many expatriate and international workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Important things You Must Learn about Offshore Banking|date=2017-05-27|publisher=World News |url= https://article.wn.com/view/2017/05/27/Important_things_You_Must_Learn_about_Offshore_Banking/|pages= |accessdate=2017-09-06 |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offshore jurisdictions are often remote, and therefore costly to visit, so physical access and access to information can be difficult.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This problem has been alleviated to a considerable extent with the advent and realization of [[online banking]] as a practical system.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} 
*Offshore private banking is usually more accessible to those with higher incomes, because of the costs of establishing and maintaining offshore accounts. However, simple savings accounts can be opened by anyone and maintained with scale fees equivalent to their onshore counterparts. The tax burden in developed countries thus falls disproportionately on middle-income groups.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Historically, tax cuts have tended to result in a higher proportion of the tax take being paid by high-income groups, as previously sheltered income is brought back into the mainstream economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/flattax.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112043759/http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/flattax.pdf |date=January 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laffer curve]] demonstrates this tendency.
*The [[Bank Secrecy Act]] requires U.S. Taxpayers to file a Department of the Treasury Form 90-22.1 Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts ({{visible anchor|FBAR}}: Each person or entity (including a bank) subject to the jurisdiction of the United States having an interest in, signature, or other authority over one or more bank, securities, or other financial accounts in a foreign country must file an FBAR if the aggregate value of such accounts at any point in a calendar year exceeds $10,000. (31 CFR 103.24). A recent{{when|date=September 2017}}  District Court case in the 10th Circuit may have significantly expanded the definition of "interest in" and "other Authority".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} 
*Offshore bank accounts are sometimes touted as the solution to every legal, financial, and asset protection strategy, but the benefits are often exaggerated.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==European crackdown==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=February 2013}}
In their efforts to stamp down on cross border interest payments EU governments agreed to the introduction of the Savings Tax Directive in the form of the [[European Union withholding tax]] in July 2005. A complex measure, it forced EU resident savers depositing money in any country other than the one they are resident in to choose between forfeiting tax at the point of payment, or allowing notification by the offshore banks to tax authorities in their country of residence. This tax affects any cross border interest payment to an individual resident in the EU.

Furthermore, the rate of tax deducted at source will rise in 2008 and again in 2011, making disclosure increasingly attractive. Savers' choice of action is complex; tax authorities are not prevented from enquiring into accounts previously held by savers which were not then disclosed.

In 2013, the European Union's Economic and Financial Affairs Council passed new European Union (EU) directives that bankers in EU member states will share their clients' identities and transaction records automatically. This action was also encouraged by other important countries such as Australia and the US. This has been reported by most offshore service providers offering services outside of the European Union.

On 27 May 2015, Switzerland signed an agreement with the EU that will align Swiss bank practices with those of EU countries, and in effect will end the special secrecy that EU-resident clients of Swiss banks had enjoyed in the past. Under the agreement, both Switzerland and EU countries will automatically exchange information on the financial accounts of each other's residents from 2018.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5043_en.htm |title=Fighting tax evasion: EU and Switzerland sign historic tax transparency agreement| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150907131432/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5043_en.htm| archivedate= 7 September 2015 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banking services==
It is possible to obtain the full spectrum of [[financial services]] from offshore banks, including:
*[[Savings accounts]]
*[[Management|Corporate administration]]
*[[Credit (finance)|Credit]]
*[[Deposit account|Deposit taking]]
*[[Foreign exchange market|Foreign exchange]]
*[[Investment management|Fund management]]
*[[Investment management|Investment management and investment custody]]
*[[Debit card|Debit and Credit Cards]]
*[[letter of credit|Letters of credit and trade finance]]
*[[Trustee|Trustee services]]
*[[Wire transfer|Wire-]] and [[Electronic money|electronic funds transfers]]

Not every bank provides each service. Banks tend to polarise between [[retail|retail services]] and [[private banking]] services. Retail services tend to be low-cost and undifferentiated, whereas private banking services tend to bring a personalised suite of services to the client.

===Scale of potential tax revenue===
Assuming even just the lower estimate of £13 trillion on deposit in offshore accounts, if these assets earned an average 3% a year in income for their owners taxable at 30%, then the offshore funds would generate £121 billion in tax revenues,&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; on the assumption that no tax is paid (i.e. no one pays any tax on offshore holdings), and that 100% of those deposits would otherwise have been liable to tax.{{elucidate|date=January 2014}}  Projections are often predicated upon levying tax on the capital sums held in offshore accounts, whereas most national systems of taxation tax income and/or capital gains rather than accrued wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faireconomy.org/wealth_vs_work|title=Tax Wealth Not Work|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership===
According to [[Merrill Lynch]] and [[Capgemini]]'s “World Wealth Report” for 2000, one third of the wealth of the world's “high-net-worth individuals” — nearly $6 trillion out of $17.5 trillion — may now be held offshore. A large portion, £6.3tn, of offshore assets, is owned by only a tiny sliver, 0.001% (around 92,000 super wealthy individuals) of the world's population. In simple terms, this reflects the inconvenience associated with establishing these accounts, not that these accounts are only for the wealthy. Most all individuals can take advantage of these accounts.

==Money laundering==
The IMF has said that between $600 billion and $1.5 trillion of illicit money is laundered annually, equal to 2% to 5% of global economic output. Today, offshore is where most of the world's [[Illegal drug trade|drug money]] is allegedly laundered,{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} estimated at up to $500 billion a year, more than the total income of the world's poorest 20%. Add the proceeds of tax evasion and the figure skyrockets to $1 trillion. Another few hundred billion come from fraud and corruption. "These offshore centers awash in money are the hub of a colossal, underground network of crime, fraud, and corruption" commented [[Lucy Komisar]] quoting these statistics.{{ref label|Komisar|1|a}}

''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' revealed that the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]], specifically the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], had a program to access the [[SWIFT]] transaction database after the [[September 11 attacks]] (see the [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]]) diminishing the value of offshore banking for privacy.

==Regulation of international banks==
In the 21st century, regulation of offshore banking is allegedly increasing, although critics maintain it remains largely insufficient. The quality of the regulation is monitored by supra-national bodies such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). Banks are generally required to maintain capital adequacy in accordance with international standards.  They must report at least quarterly to the regulator on the current state of the business.

Since the late 1990s, especially following September 11, 2001, there have been a number of initiatives to increase the [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] of offshore banking, although critics such as the [[ATTAC|Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens]] (ATTAC) [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) maintain that they have been insufficient. A few examples of these are:
*The tightening of [[anti-money laundering]] regulations in many countries including most popular offshore banking locations means that bankers are required, by good faith, to report suspicion of money laundering to the local [[police]] authority, regardless of [[banking secrecy]] rules. There is more international co-operation between police authorities.
*In the US the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) introduced Qualifying Intermediary requirements, which mean that the names of the recipients of US-source investment income are passed to the IRS.
*Following [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] the US introduced the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which authorizes the US authorities to seize the assets of a bank, where it is believed that the bank holds assets for a suspected criminal. Similar measures have been introduced in some other countries.
*The [[European Union]] has introduced sharing of information between certain jurisdictions, and enforced this in respect of certain controlled centers, such as the UK Offshore Islands, so that tax information is able to be shared in respect of interest.
*The [[Bank Secrecy Act]] requires that Taxpayers file an FBAR for accounts outside of the United States that have balances in excess of $10,000
*[[FATCA]] (the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) became law in 2010 and "targets tax non-compliance by US taxpayers with foreign accounts [and] focuses on reporting by US taxpayers about certain foreign financial accounts and offshore assets [and] foreign financial institutions about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers or foreign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act|url = https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Corporations/Foreign-Account-Tax-Compliance-Act-FATCA|website = www.irs.gov|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]], 2001 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|laureate for economics]] and former [[World Bank Chief Economist]], told to reporter Lucy Komisar, investigating on the [[Clearstream]] scandal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"You ask why, if there's an important role for a regulated banking system, do you allow a non-regulated banking system to continue? It's in the interest of some of the moneyed interests to allow this to occur. It's not an accident; it could have been shut down at any time. If you said the US, the UK, the major [[G7]] banks will not deal with offshore bank centers that don't comply with G7 banks regulations, these banks could not exist. They only exist because they engage in transactions with standard banks."{{ref label|Komisar|1|b}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1970s through the 1990s, it was possible to own your own personal offshore bank; mobster [[Meyer Lansky]] had done this to launder his [[casino]] money. Changes in offshore banking regulation in the 1990s in the form of "[[due diligence]]" (a [[Law|legal construct]]) make offshore bank creation really only possible for medium to large multinational corporations that may be family-owned or -run.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The '''Patriotic Union''' ({{lang-de|Vaterländische Union}}, '''VU''') is a [[Christian democracy|Christian-democratic]] [[List of political parties in Liechtenstein|political party]] in [[Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref name=Nordsieck/&gt; The VU is one of the two [[major party|major]] [[List of political parties in Liechtenstein|political parties in Liechtenstein]], along with the [[national conservatism|national conservative]] [[Progressive Citizens' Party]]. The VU is the more [[liberalism|liberal]] of the two parties, advocating [[constitutional monarchy]] and greater [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political parties of the world |last=Day |first=Alan John |year=2002 |publisher=John Harper |location=London |isbn=978-0-9536278-7-5 |page=302 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pmwYAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Jakob Büchel]] and has eight members in the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]].

==History==
The Patriotic Union was formed by the 1936 merger of the [[Christian-Social People's Party (Liechtenstein)|Christian-Social People's Party]] (VP) with the minor party [[Liechtenstein Homeland Service]] (LHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parties in Liechtenstein 1921-1943|url=http://www.fuerstundvolk.li/fuv/fuv.do?site=421174076f221000996d610c1957690b|work=Prince and People: Liechtenstein Civics|publisher=School Office of the Principality of Liechtenstein|accessdate=13 February 2014|language=German|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the VP was the larger party, following the merger it was members of the LHD who took prominent positions in the leadership of the new party.&lt;ref name="National Archives" /&gt;

After decades of being the second party to the [[Progressive Citizens' Party]] (FBP), the VU became the largest party in the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]] for the first time as a result of the [[Liechtenstein general election, 1970|1970 elections]]. Although it lost the [[Liechtenstein general election, 1974|1974 elections]] to the FBP, it won the [[Liechtenstein general election, 1978|1978 elections]] and retained its Landtag majority until [[Liechtenstein general election, February 1993|February 1993]]. However, early elections in [[Liechtenstein general election, October 1993|October 1993]] saw it regain its majority, which it held until [[Liechtenstein parliamentary election, 2001|2001]]. After winning the [[Liechtenstein general election, 2009|2009 elections]] the party lost the [[Liechtenstein general election, 2013|2013 elections]] to the FBP.

The '''Representative Ensemble of the Bulgarian Armed Forces''' (Bulgarian: Представителски ансамбъл на Българската армия) is a Bulgarian military choir which is subordinated to the [[National Guards Unit of Bulgaria]]. It is currently made up of 23 professional singers.

It was founded in 1944 by [[Dragan Prokopiev]] as the Ensemble of the [[Bulgarian People's Army]].&lt;ref name="Process"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://212.122.187.196:84/Process.aspx?type=Fund&amp;agid=41&amp;flgid=5092437|website=212.122.187.196:84|title=Фонд|accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the choir recruited some the most famous Bulgarian singers such as [[Dimitar Uzunov]] and {{ill|Nikola Nikolov (opera singer)|lt=Nikola Nikolov|bg|Никола Николов (оперен певец)}}.

In 1962, a Pop Music ensemble was founded at the Theatre of the People's Army in Sofia, and was incorporated into the Song and Dance ensemble in 1977.

Since its creation, the ensemble has performed in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa, and has been praised everywhere for the quality of its performance. In the 2000s, the ensemble included two main quartets, Song Male Vocal Quartet and the Ladena Women's Folk Quartet. In 2009, it was renamed to the Representative Ensemble of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref name="bnr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bnr.bg/en/post/100467045/the-representative-ensemble-of-the-armed-forces-celebrates-70th-anniversary|title=The Representative Ensemble of the Armed Forces celebrates 70th anniversary - Music|website=bnr.bg|accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Republic of West Papua''' is a proposed, former, and unrecognized [[State (polity)|state]] consisting of the [[Western New Guinea]] region. The region is claimed by [[Indonesia]] and has been occupied by Indonesia since 1 May 1963 under several names in the following order West Irian, Irian Jaya and Papua. Today the region comprises two Indonesian provinces: [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]].

The proposal is supported by [[Vanuatu]] and the [[Solomon Islands]] with the [[Parliament of Vanuatu]] passing the [[Wantok Blong Yumi Bill]] (Our Close Friends) in 2010 officially declaring that Vanuatu's foreign policy is to support the achievement of the independence of West Papua.&lt;ref name="Radion17"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiery debate over West Papua at UN General Assembly|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/programmes/datelinepacific/audio/201860156/fiery-debate-over-west-papua-at-un-general-assembly|accessdate=7 October 2017|work=Radio New Zealand 2017|date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radionz17-2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia hits back at Melanesian leaders on West Papua|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/340298/indonesia-hits-back-at-melanesian-leaders-on-west-papua|accessdate=7 October 2017|work=Radio New Zealand|date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=Selwyn|title=Vanuatu to seek observer status for West Papua at MSG and PIF leaders summits|url=http://pacific.scoop.co.nz/2010/06/vanuatu-to-seek-observer-status-for-west-papua-at-msg-and-pif-leaders-summits/|accessdate=20 October 2017|work=Pacific Scoop|date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanuatu's Parliament has proposed requesting that West Papua be granted observer status at the [[Melanesian Spearhead Group]] and [[Pacific Island Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/indonesia-vanuatu-vanuatu-parliament-passes-resolution-on-west-papua-independence/|title=Indonesia; Vanuatu: Vanuatu Parliament Passes Resolution on West Papua Independence {{!}} Global Legal Monitor|date=2010-07-21|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|others=Buchanan, Kelly|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/191049/vanuatu-to-seek-un-general-assembly-support-for-icj-opinion-on-indonesia's-papua|title=Vanuatu to seek UN General Assembly support for ICJ opinion on Indonesia's Papua|date=2010-06-21|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pacific.scoop.co.nz/2010/06/vanuatu-to-seek-observer-status-for-west-papua-at-msg-and-pif-leaders-summits/|title=Pacific.scoop.co.nz » Vanuatu to seek observer status for West Papua at MSG and PIF leaders summits|website=pacific.scoop.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The region was formerly a [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] colony part of the [[Dutch East Indies]] and in 1949 was known as [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]]. The Dutch had planned to withdraw by 1970 and began "Papuanization" to prepare for independence.&lt;ref name="Betreyal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saltford|first1=John|title=The United Nations and the Indonesian takeover of West Papua, 1962-1969 : the anatomy of betrayal|date=2003|publisher=Routledge Curzon|location=London ; New York|isbn=0203221877|url=http://www.pedallingforpapua.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Takeover-of-WP-2002.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1961, the Dutch organised elections for the [[New Guinea Council]] a Papuan representative body to advise the Governor.&lt;ref name="Betreyal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaghist"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tanggahma|first1=Leonie|title=A History of the Morning Star Flag of West Papua|url=https://westpapuamedia.info/2012/12/02/a-history-of-the-morning-star-flag-of-west-papua/|accessdate=21 October 2017|work=West Papua Media|date=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council appointed a National Committee to prepare a political manifesto for the future state.&lt;ref name="Betreyal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaghist" /&gt; On 1 December 1961, an inauguration ceremony was held for the [[Morning Star flag]] raised outside the Council building in the presence of the Governor, also the national anthem "[[Hai Tanahku Papua]]", the birds of paradise [[Coat of arms of Netherlands New Guinea|coat of arms]], motto and the name of Papua Barat (West Papua) for the proposed new state.&lt;ref name="Betreyal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaghist" /&gt; The Dutch had accepted the Manifesto except the denomination of the flag recognising it as a territorial flag not a national flag.&lt;ref name="Flaghist" /&gt;

On 1 July 1971, Brigadier General Seth Jafeth Rumkorem, leader of the militant independence movement [[Free Papua Movement]] ({{lang-id|Organisasi Papua Merdeka, (OPM)}}), proclaimed unilaterally Papua Barat or West Papua as an independent democratic republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Papua|url=http://unpo.org/demo/members/7843|website=Unrepresented Nations and People Organization (UNPO)|accessdate=20 October 2017|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Morning Star flag was declared as a national flag.&lt;ref name="Flaghist" /&gt;

On 14 December 1988, [[Thom Wainggai|Dr. Thomas Wainggai]] proclaimed the Republic of West Melanesia using the [[Melanesian]] identity of the West Papuan people as the name.&lt;ref name="King2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Peter|title=West Papua &amp; Indonesia since Suharto: independence, autonomy or chaos?|date=2004|publisher=University of New South Wales Press|location=Sydney|isbn=9780868406763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights in Papua 2010/2011|url=http://www.faithbasednetworkonwestpapua.org/userfiles/files/Human%20Rights%20in%20Papua_Report%202010-2011%20web.pdf|website=Papua land of peace - faith based network on West Papua|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Melanesia flag featured 14 stars with three coloured bars of black, red and white.&lt;ref name="King2004" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2325">'''Shaikh Hussain Jalayir''' (died April or May 1382) was a [[Jalayirids|Jalayirid]] ruler (1374–1382). He was the son of [[Shaikh Awais Jalayir]]. Following the execution of his brother [[Shaikh Hasan Jalayir]], the amirs placed Shaikh Hussain Jalayir on the throne. Almost immediately he had to deal with an invasion by his brother-in-law Shah Mahmud of the [[Muzaffarids of Iran]]. Shah Mahmud, who was the son-in-law of [[Shaikh Awais Jalayir]], advanced a claim on [[Tabriz]] and took the city. Illness, however, forced him to abandon the region. This was followed by an invasion by the leader of the Muzaffarids, Shah Shuja, but despite taking the city, he was also forced to retreat due to a rebellion in [[Qazvin]]. It was only in the summer of 1376 that Shaikh Hussain Jalayir took up residence in Tabriz. In the following spring, he undertook a successful campaign against the [[Black Sheep Turkmen]] under [[Bairam Khwaja]], who had been raiding from the west.

Shaikh Hussain Jalayir's reign was marred by conflict with his surviving brothers; namely, [[Shaikh Ali Jalayir]], [[Sultan Ahmed Jalayir]], and [[Shaikh Bayazid Jalayir]]. Shaikh Hussain Jalayir also lost his popularity among many amirs who disliked his support of the powerful [['Adil Aqa]], the governor of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]]. Shaikh Hussain Jalayir was faced with a series of uprisings, hostility among his brothers, and troubles with his external enemies. When 'Adil Aqa turned on him, Shaikh Hussain Jalayir lost his last powerful supporter. [[Sultan Ahmed Jalayir]] advanced from [[Arbadil]] and occupied Tabriz near the end of April 1382; he ordered Husain's execution. Ahmad would then himself take the throne, but conflict between him and 'Adil Aqa and Bayazid meant that the state fell into a period of disunity.

[[Gibraltar]] uses ''Standard Time'' or [[Central European Time]] ([[UTC+01:00]]) and daylight saving time or [[Central European Summer Time]] ([[UTC+02:00]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/articles/1962-08o.pdf Interpretation and General Cluases Act]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.co.uk/time-zone/europe/european-union/central-european-time/countries.htm Countries using Central European Time] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104001226/http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.co.uk/time-zone/europe/european-union/central-european-time/countries.htm |date=2014-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior to 1982==
Until 1982, Gibraltar used GMT+1 all year round. This put it in neighbouring Spain's time zone for 5 months and in the UK's zone for the 7 months of [[British Summer Time]].  In 1982, Gibraltar changed to use Central European Time all year round, putting it wholly in tune with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyReports/2008/20558-35674-1762008.pdf#page=13 Jersey considers CET]&lt;/ref&gt;

==IANA time zone database==
The [[IANA time zone database]] contains one time zone for Gibraltar in the file [[zone.tab]], named [[Europe/Gibraltar]].

This refers to the area having the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code "GI".

It is part of the so-called Sculptures of [[Osuna]], [[Seville Province]], [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]].]]

The '''Turdetani''' were an ancient [[pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] (the Roman [[Hispania]]), living in the valley of the [[Guadalquivir]] (the river that the Turdetani called by two names: ''Kertis'' and ''Rérkēs''; [[Romans]] would call the river by the name ''Baetis''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |last=Smith |first=William |author-link=William Smith (lexicographer) |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography |title-link=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography |year=1854 |location=Boston |publisher=[[Little, Brown]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what was to become the Roman Province of [[Hispania Baetica]] (modern [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]]). [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Strabo |author-link=Strabo |title=Geography |title-link=Geography (Strabo) |others=III, 2, 12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; considers them to have been the successors to the people of [[Tartessos]] and to have spoken a language closely related to the [[Tartessian language]].

==History==
The Turdetani were in constant contact with their [[Greek people|Greek]] and [[Carthaginians|Carthaginian]] neighbors. [[Herodotus]] describes them as enjoying a civilized rule under a king, [[Arganthonios]], who welcomed [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocaean]] colonists in the fifth century BC. The Turdetani are said to have possessed a written legal code and to have employed [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] mercenaries to carry on their wars against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'', 34, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] notes that the Turdetani were the most civilized peoples in Iberia, with the implication that their ordered, urbanized culture was most in accord with Greco-Roman models. After the end of the [[Second Punic War]], the Turdetani rose against their Roman governor in 197 BC. When [[Cato the Elder]] became consul in 195 BC, he was given the command of the whole of [[Hispania]]. Cato first put down the rebellion in the northeast, then marched south and put down the revolt by the Turdetani, "the least warlike of all the Hispanic tribes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Livius|Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'', 34, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Cato was able to return to Rome in 194, leaving two [[praetor]]s in charge of the two provinces.

In [[Plautus]]' comedy ''[[Captivi|The Captives]]'', a reference to the Turdetani (Act i, Scene ii) seems to show that their district in Hispania Baetica had become proverbially famous for the thrushes and small birds supplied for Roman tables. ''[[Turdus]]'' is the genus of the thrushes.

The '''Villar del Arzobispo Formation''' is a [[Mesozoic]] geologic [[Formation (geology)|formation]]. [[Dinosaur]] remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.  Remains of the [[stegosaurid]] ''[[Dacentrurus]]'' were recovered in the Barranco Conejero locality in this formation.&lt;ref name=cobosgasco&gt;Alberto Cobos and Francisco Gascó. (2013) New vertebral remains of the stegosaurian dinosaur Dacentrurus from Riodeva (Teruel, Spain). Geogaceta, 53, 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, other [[stegosaurian]] remains have been discovered in this [[geological formation|formation]], but none have yet been referred to a specific [[genus]].&lt;ref name="dinosaurdistribution"&gt;Weishampel, et al. (2004). "Dinosaur distribution." Pp. 517-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Villar del Arzobispo Formation's age in the area of [[Riodeva]] in [[Spain]] has been dated based on stratigraphic correlations as middle-upper [[Tithonian]], approximately 145-141 million years old, placing it near the [[Jurassic]]-[[Cretaceous]] boundary.&lt;ref name=cobosgasco/&gt;

'''Yamal 601''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|'''Ямал-601'''}}) is a [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]] ordered by [[Gazprom Space Systems]] to [[JSC Information Satellite Systems|ISS Reshetnev]] on the [[Ekspress (satellite bus)|Ekspress-2000]] platform for its [[Yamal (satellite constellation)|Yamal program]].&lt;ref name=rsw-yamal /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal6012 /&gt; The Ekspress-2000 platform is the heavy version, which can weigh up to {{convert|3500|kg|abbr=on}} and generate up to 14&amp;nbsp;kW of power on an unpressurized bus designed for direct GEO injection with 15 years of design life. Its payload will be supplied by [[Thales Alenia Space]] and is composed of 18 [[C band (IEEE)|C band]], 19 [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] and 26 [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]] [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]] for a 36&amp;nbsp;MHz equivalent of 52 transponders.&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal6012 /&gt; It will replace [[Yamal 202]] on 49°E when it reaches its end of service around 2018.&lt;ref name=satbeams-yamal601 /&gt;

==History==
In 2013 [[Gazprom Space Systems|Gazprom]] Board decided on a new plan. It required two new spacecraft: [[Yamal-501]] and Yamal-601.&lt;ref name=gazkom-newprojects /&gt; In January 2014 Gazprom and Thales announced a contract for a new spacecraft, Yamal-601.&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal601 /&gt;&lt;ref name=thales-yamal601pr20140122 /&gt; In 2015 the [[Yamal-401]] history would repeat itself, and the contract of Yamal-601 with Thales was cancelled was assigned to [[JSC Information Satellite Systems|ISS Reshetnev]], but Thales was again allowed to keep the payload supply.&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal6012 /&gt;

'''Żonqor Battery''' ({{lang-mt|Batterija taż-Żonqor}}) is an [[artillery battery]] in [[Marsaskala]], [[Malta]], standing on high ground overlooking Marsaskala Bay. It is a [[polygonal fort]] and was built by the [[British Empire|British]] from 1882 to 1886.

==History==
Żonqor Battery was built by the British between 1882 and 1886 at a cost of £5000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marsaskala|url=http://www.douzelage.org/fileadmin/Documents/2009_Altea/ANNEX_K_Marsaskala.pdf|website=douzelage.org|accessdate=1 January 2015}} p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; (or £6000&lt;ref&gt;Guillaumier, Alfie (2005). ''Bliet u Rħula Maltin''. Volume 2. Klabb Kotba Maltin. p. 971. {{ISBN|99932-39-40-2}}, {{ISBN|99932-39-41-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). It has a pentagonal shape, and it is surrounded by a 6 metre wide ditch. The firing positions and ammunition depots were located below ground level to protect them from enemy fire. Its gun crew and garrison were stationed at the nearby [[Fort Leonardo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marsaskala|url=http://www.douzelage.org/fileadmin/Documents/2009_Altea/ANNEX_K_Marsaskala.pdf|website=douzelage.org|accessdate=1 January 2015}} p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Żonqor Battery 21.jpg|thumb|left|Żonqor Battery with rubble walls]]
Soon after being completed, the battery was found out to be inadequate since the range of its [[RML 7 inch gun]]s did not reach the area of the bay they were supposed to defend. Due to this, new plans were made to defend the bay by Governor [[Lintorn Simmons]], but these were never implemented.

The battery is believed to have been armed with three canons,&lt;ref&gt;Guillaumier, Alfie (2005). ''Bliet u Rħula Maltin''. Volume 2. Klabb Kotba Maltin. p. 971. {{ISBN|99932-39-40-2}}, {{ISBN|99932-39-41-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is said that they may have never been adjusted into place for use.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Charles (2004).  ''The Fortifications of Malta 1530-1945 (Fortress)''. Osprey Publishing. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-1841766935}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The battery's guns were eventually dismantled, and in [[World War II]], the battery was used as a warehouse for ammunition.

==Present day==
The battery is now used for agricultural purposes and it is not open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batterija Taz Zonqor|url=http://www.zonqor.com/marsaskala/batterija-taz-zonqor.html|website=zonqor.com|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
