'''241''' ('''two hundred [and] forty-one''') is the natural number between [[240 (number)|240]] and [[242 (number)|242]]. It is also a [[prime number]].

==In mathematics==
241 is the larger of the [[twin prime]]s (239, 241).  Twin primes are pairs of primes separated by 2. 

241 is a [[regular prime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A007703|title=Sloane's A007703 : Regular primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[lucky prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A031157|title=Sloane's A031157 : Numbers that are both lucky and prime|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 241 = 15 &amp;times; 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 1, it is a [[Proth prime]].

241 is a [[repdigit]] in base 15 (111).

241 is the only known [[Lucas–Wieferich prime]] to (''U'', ''V'') = (3, −1).

==In Chemistry==
[[Americium-241]] is the most common isotope of Americium, used in smoke detectors.

==In popular culture==
* [[Reel Big Fish]] wrote a song entitled "241," where the number is repeated as the only lyric.
* A short form of the phrase "Two for One" describing a discount.

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], ''n''-dimensional '''anti-de Sitter space''' (AdS&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a maximally symmetric [[Lorentzian manifold]] with constant negative [[scalar curvature]]. Anti-de Sitter space and [[de Sitter space]] are named after [[Willem de Sitter]] (1872–1934), professor of astronomy at [[Leiden University]] and director of the [[Leiden Observatory]]. Willem de Sitter and [[Albert Einstein]] worked together closely in [[Leiden]] in the 1920s on the [[spacetime]] structure of the universe.

[[Manifolds]] of [[constant curvature]] are most familiar in the case of two dimensions, where the surface of a [[sphere]] is a surface of constant positive curvature, a flat ([[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]) plane is a surface of constant zero curvature, and a [[hyperbolic plane]] is a surface of constant negative curvature.

Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]] places space and time on equal footing, so that one considers the geometry of a unified spacetime instead of considering space and time separately. The cases of spacetime of constant curvature are de Sitter space (positive), [[Minkowski space]] (zero), and anti-de Sitter space (negative). As such, they are [[exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] of [[Einstein's field equation]]s for an [[lambdavacuum solution|empty universe]] with a positive, zero, or negative [[cosmological constant]], respectively.

Anti-de Sitter space generalises to any number of space dimensions. In higher dimensions, it is best known for its role in the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], which suggests that it is possible to describe a force in quantum mechanics (like [[electromagnetic force|electromagnetism]], the [[weak force]] or the [[strong force]]) in a certain number of dimensions (for example four) with a [[string theory]] where the strings exist in an anti-de Sitter space, with one additional dimension.

==Non-technical explanation==

This non-technical explanation first defines the terms used in the introductory material of this entry.  Then, it briefly sets forth the underlying idea of a general relativity-like spacetime.  Then it discusses how de Sitter space describes a distinct variant of the ordinary spacetime of general relativity (called Minkowski space) related to the cosmological constant, and how anti-de Sitter space differs from de Sitter space.  It also explains that Minkowski space, de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space, as applied to general relativity, can all be thought of as being embedded in a flat five-dimensional spacetime.  Finally, it offers some caveats that describe in general terms how this non-technical explanation fails to capture the full detail of the mathematical concept.

===Technical terms translated===

A maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifold is a spacetime in which no point in space and time can be distinguished in any way from another, and (being Lorentzian) the only way in which a direction (or tangent to a path at a spacetime point) can be distinguished is whether it is spacelike, lightlike or timelike.  The space of special relativity ([[Minkowski space]]) is an example.

A [[Constant curvature|constant scalar curvature]] means a general relativity gravity-like bending of spacetime that has a curvature described by a single number that is the same everywhere in spacetime in the absence of matter or energy.

Negative curvature means curved hyperbolically, like a [[saddle surface]] or the [[Gabriel's Horn]] surface, similar to that of a [[trumpet]] bell.  It might be described as being the "opposite" of the surface of a sphere, which has a positive curvature.

===Spacetime in general relativity===

General relativity is a theory of the nature of time, space and gravity in which gravity is a curvature of space and time that results from the presence of matter or energy. [[Mass-energy equivalence|Energy and mass are equivalent]] (as expressed in the equation ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and space and time can be translated into equivalent units based on the speed of light (''c'' in the ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; equation).

A common analogy involves the way that a dip in a flat sheet of rubber, caused by a heavy object sitting on it, influences the path taken by small objects rolling nearby, causing them to deviate inward from the path they would have followed had the heavy object been absent.   Of course, in general relativity, both the small and large objects mutually influence the curvature of spacetime.

The attractive force of gravity created by matter is due to a negative curvature of spacetime, represented in the rubber sheet analogy by the negatively curved (trumpet-bell-like) dip in the sheet.

A key feature of general relativity is that it describes gravity not as a conventional force like electromagnetism, but as a change in the geometry of spacetime that results from the presence of matter or energy.

The analogy used above describes the curvature of a two-dimensional space caused by gravity in general relativity in a three-dimensional [[Superspace#In general relativity|superspace]] in which the third dimension corresponds to the effect of gravity. A geometrical way of thinking about general relativity describes the effects of the gravity in the real world four-dimensional space geometrically by projecting that space into a five-dimensional superspace with the fifth dimension corresponding to the curvature in spacetime that is produced by gravity and gravity-like effects in general relativity.

As a result, in general relativity, the familiar [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian equation of gravity]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle  F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\ &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. gravitation pull between two objects equals the [[gravitational constant]] times the product of their masses divided by the square of the distance between them) is merely an approximation of the gravity-like effects seen in general relativity.  However this approximation becomes inaccurate in extreme physical situations. For example, in general relativity, objects in motion have a slightly different gravitation effect than objects at rest.

Some of the differences between the familiar Newtonian equation of gravity and the predictions of general relativity flow from the fact that gravity in general relativity bends both time and space, not just space. In normal circumstances, gravity bends time so slightly that the differences between Newtonian gravity and general relativity are detectable only with precise instruments.

===de Sitter space in general relativity===

de Sitter space involves a variation of general relativity in which spacetime is slightly curved in the absence of matter or energy.  This is analogous to the relationship between Euclidean geometry and [[non-Euclidean geometry]].

An intrinsic curvature of spacetime in the absence of matter or energy is modeled by the cosmological constant in general relativity. This corresponds to the vacuum having an energy density and pressure.  This spacetime geometry results in initially parallel timelike geodesics diverging, with spacelike sections having positive curvature.

===Anti-de Sitter space distinguished from de Sitter space===

An anti-de Sitter space in general relativity is similar to a de Sitter space, except with the sign of the curvature changed.  In anti-de Sitter space, in the absence of matter or energy, the curvature of spacelike sections is negative, corresponding to a [[hyperbolic geometry]], and initially parallel timelike geodesics eventually intersect.  This corresponds to a negative cosmological constant (which does not match cosmological observations). Here, empty space itself has negative energy density but positive pressure.

In an anti-de Sitter space, as in a de Sitter space, the inherent spacetime curvature corresponds to the cosmological constant.

===de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space viewed as embedded in five dimensions===

As noted above, the analogy used above describes curvature of a two-dimensional space caused by gravity in general relativity in a three-dimensional embedding space that is flat, like the Minkowski space of special relativity.  Embedding de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces of five flat dimensions allows the properties of the embedded spaces to be determined.  Distances and angles within the embedded space may be directly determined from the simpler properties of the five-dimensional flat space.

While anti-de Sitter space does not correspond to gravity in general relativity with the observed cosmological constant, an anti-de Sitter space is believed to correspond to other forces in quantum mechanics (like electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force).  This is called the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].

===Caveats===

The remainder of this article explains the details of these concepts with a much more rigorous and precise mathematical and physical description. People are ill-suited to visualizing things in five or more dimensions{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, but mathematical equations are not similarly challenged and can represent five-dimensional concepts in a way just as appropriate as the methods that mathematical equations use to describe easier to visualize three and four-dimensional concepts.

There is a particularly important implication of the more precise mathematical description that differs from the analogy-based heuristic description of de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space above.  The mathematical description of anti-de Sitter space generalizes the idea of curvature. In the mathematical description, curvature is a property of a particular point and can be divorced from some invisible surface to which curved points in spacetime meld themselves. So for example, concepts like singularities (the most widely known of which in general relativity is the [[black hole]]) which cannot be expressed completely in a real world geometry, can correspond to particular states of a mathematical equation.

The full mathematical description also captures some subtle distinctions made in general relativity between space-like dimensions and time-like dimensions.

==Definition and properties==
Much as spherical and hyperbolic spaces can be visualized by an [[isometric embedding]] in a flat space of one higher dimension (as the [[sphere]] and [[pseudosphere]] respectively), anti-de Sitter space can be visualized as the Lorentzian analogue of a sphere in a space of one additional dimension. To a physicist the extra dimension is timelike. In this article we adopt the convention that the [[Metric tensor|metric]] in a timelike direction is negative.

[[Image:HyperboloidOfOneSheet.svg|thumb|Image of {{nowrap|(1 + 1)}}-dimensional anti-de Sitter space embedded in flat {{nowrap|(1 + 2)}}-dimensional space. The ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;- and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-axes lie in the plane of rotational symmetry, and the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-axis is normal to that plane. The embedded surface contains closed timelike curves circling the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; axis, though these can be eliminated by "unrolling" the embedding (more precisely, by taking the universal cover).]]
The anti-de Sitter space of signature {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} can then be isometrically embedded in the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{p,q+1}&lt;/math&gt; with coordinates {{Nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''q''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and the [[metric tensor|metric]]
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = \sum_{i=1}^p dx_i^2 - \sum_{j=1}^{q+1} dt_j^2&lt;/math&gt;
as the [[quasi-sphere]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^p x_i^2 - \sum_{j=1}^{q+1} t_j^2 = -\alpha^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero constant with dimensions of length (the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]]). This is a (generalized) sphere in the sense that it is a collection of points for which the "distance" (determined by the quadratic form) from the origin is constant, but visually it is a [[hyperboloid]], as in the image shown.

The metric on anti-de Sitter space is that induced from the [[ambient metric]]. It is [[nondegenerate]] and, in the case of {{nowrap|1=''q'' = 1}} has Lorentzian signature.

When {{nowrap|1=''q'' = 0}}, this construction gives a standard hyperbolic space. The remainder of the discussion applies when {{nowrap|''q'' ≥ 1}}.

===Closed timelike curves and the universal cover===
When {{nowrap|''q'' ≥ 1}}, the embedding above has [[closed timelike curve]]s; for example, the path parameterized by &lt;math&gt;t_1 = \alpha \sin(\tau), t_2 = \alpha \cos(\tau),&lt;/math&gt; and all other coordinates zero, is such a curve. When {{nowrap|''q'' ≥ 2}} these curves are inherent to the geometry (unsurprisingly, as any space with more than one temporal dimension contains closed timelike curves), but when {{nowrap|1=''q'' = 1}}, they can be eliminated by passing to the [[universal covering space]], effectively "unrolling" the embedding. A similar situation occurs with the [[pseudosphere]], which curls around on itself although the hyperbolic plane does not; as a result it contains self-intersecting straight lines (geodesics) while the hyperbolic plane does not. Some authors define anti-de Sitter space as equivalent to the embedded quasi-sphere itself, while others define it as equivalent to the universal cover of the embedding.

===Symmetries===
If the universal cover is not taken, {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} anti-de Sitter space has [[Generalized orthogonal group|{{nowrap|O(''p'', ''q'' + 1)}}]] as its [[isometry group]]. If the universal cover is taken the isometry group is a cover of {{nowrap|O(''p'', ''q'' + 1)}}.  This is most easily understood by defining anti-de Sitter space as a [[symmetric space]], using the [[Homogeneous space|quotient space]] construction, given below.

==Coordinate patches==
A [[coordinate patch]] covering part of the space gives the [[half-space (geometry)|half-space]] coordinatization of anti-de Sitter space. The [[metric tensor]] for this patch is

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\frac{1}{y^2}\left(-dt^2+dy^2+\sum_idx_i^2\right),&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;y&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; giving the half-space. We easily see that this metric is [[conformally equivalent]] to a flat half-space Minkowski spacetime.

The constant time slices of this coordinate patch are [[hyperbolic space]]s in the Poincaré half-space metric. In the limit as &lt;math&gt;y\to 0&lt;/math&gt;, this half-space metric is conformally equivalent to the Minkowski metric &lt;math&gt;ds^2=-dt^2+\sum_idx_i^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the anti-de Sitter space contains a conformal Minkowski space at infinity ("infinity" having y-coordinate zero in this patch).

In  AdS space time is periodic,  and the [[universal cover]] has non-periodic time. The coordinate patch above covers half of a single period of the spacetime.

Because the [[conformal infinity]] of AdS is [[timelike]], specifying the initial data on a spacelike hypersurface would not determine the future evolution uniquely (''i.e.'' deterministically) unless there are [[boundary condition]]s associated with the conformal infinity.

[[Image:AdS A.PNG|thumb|The "half-space" region of anti-de Sitter space and its boundary.]]

Another commonly used coordinate system which covers the entire space is given by the coordinates t, &lt;math&gt;r \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt; and the hyper-[[polar coordinate]]s α, θ and φ.
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \left( k^2r^2 + 1\right)dt^2 + \frac{1}{k^2r^2+1}dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2&lt;/math&gt;

The adjacent image represents the "half-space" region of anti-de Sitter space and its boundary. The interior of the cylinder corresponds to anti-de Sitter spacetime, while its cylindrical boundary corresponds to its conformal boundary. The green shaded region in the interior corresponds to the region of AdS covered by the half-space coordinates and it is bounded by two null, ''aka'' lightlike, geodesic hyperplanes; the green shaded area on the surface corresponds to the region of conformal space covered by Minkowski space.

The green shaded region covers half of the AdS space and half of the conformal spacetime; the left ends of the green discs will touch in the same fashion as the right ends.

==As a homogeneous, symmetric space==
In the same way that the [[2-sphere]]

:&lt;math&gt;S^2=\frac{ \mathrm{O}(3) }{ \mathrm{O}(2) }&lt;/math&gt;

is a quotient of two [[orthogonal group]]s, anti-de Sitter with [[parity (physics)|parity]] (reflectional symmetry) and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] symmetry can be seen as a quotient of two [[generalized orthogonal group]]s

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{AdS}_n=\frac{ \mathrm{O}(2,n-1) }{ \mathrm{O}(1,n-1) } &lt;/math&gt;

whereas AdS without P or C can be seen as the quotient

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \mathrm{Spin}^+(2,n-1) }{ \mathrm{Spin}^+(1,n-1) }&lt;/math&gt;

of [[spin group]]s.

This quotient formulation gives &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AdS}_n&lt;/math&gt; the structure of a [[homogeneous space]]. The [[Lie algebra]] of the generalized orthogonal group &lt;math&gt;o(1,n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by matrices

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{H}=  \begin{pmatrix}
     \begin{matrix}
       0&amp;0\\
       0&amp;0
     \end{matrix}
                       &amp;  \begin{pmatrix}
		             \cdots 0\cdots\\
			    \leftarrow v^t\rightarrow
                          \end{pmatrix}\\
    \begin{pmatrix}	  
       \vdots &amp; \uparrow\\
         0    &amp; v \\
       \vdots &amp; \downarrow
    \end{pmatrix} &amp;  B
  \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a [[skew-symmetric matrix]].  A complementary generator in the Lie algebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}=\mathrm{o}(2,n) &lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathcal{Q}=
 \begin{pmatrix}
     \begin{matrix}
       0&amp;a\\
       -a&amp;0
     \end{matrix}
                       &amp;  \begin{pmatrix}		             
			  \leftarrow w^t\rightarrow \\
			     \cdots 0\cdots\\
                          \end{pmatrix}\\
    \begin{pmatrix}	  
      \uparrow   &amp; \vdots\\
          w      &amp;  0\\
      \downarrow &amp; \vdots 
    \end{pmatrix} &amp; 0
  \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt; 
These two fulfill &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{H}\oplus\mathcal{Q} &lt;/math&gt;. Explicit matrix computation shows that 
&lt;math&gt;[\mathcal{H},\mathcal{Q}]\subseteq\mathcal{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{Q}]\subseteq\mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, anti-de Sitter is a [[reductive homogeneous space]], and a non-Riemannian [[symmetric space]].

==A mathematical definition for anti-de Sitter space and its properties==
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AdS}_n&lt;/math&gt; is an ''n''-dimensional solution for the theory of gravitation with [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] with negative [[cosmological constant]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, (&lt;math&gt;\Lambda &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), i.e. the theory described by the following [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] density:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{16 \pi G_{(n)}}(R-2\Lambda) 
&lt;/math&gt;,
where {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[gravitational constant]] in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional spacetime.
Therefore, it is a solution of the [[Einstein field equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
G_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}=0 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Einstein tensor]] and &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the metric of the spacetime. Introducing the radius &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\Lambda=\frac{-(n-1)(n-2)}{2\alpha^2} 
&lt;/math&gt; this solution can be [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersed]] in a &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; dimensional spacetime with signature &lt;math&gt;(-,-,+,\cdots,+)&lt;/math&gt; by the following constraint:
:&lt;math&gt;
-X_1^2-X_2^2+\sum_{i=3}^{n+1}X_i^2=-\alpha^2
&lt;/math&gt;

===Global coordinates===
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AdS}_n&lt;/math&gt;is parametrized in global coordinates by the parameters &lt;math&gt;(\tau,\rho,\theta,\varphi_1,\cdots,\varphi_{n-3})&lt;/math&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
X_1=\alpha\cosh\rho \cos \tau\\
X_2=\alpha\cosh \rho \sin \tau\\
X_i=\alpha \sinh \rho \,\hat{x}_i \qquad \sum_i \hat{x}_i^2=1
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_i&lt;/math&gt; parametrize a &lt;math&gt;S^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt; sphere. i.e. we have 
&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_1=\sin \theta \sin \varphi _1 \dots \sin\varphi _{n-3}&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_2=\sin \theta \sin \varphi _1 \dots \cos\varphi _{n-3}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_3=\sin \theta \sin \varphi _1 \dots \cos\varphi _{n-2}&lt;/math&gt; etc. The &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AdS}_n&lt;/math&gt; metric in these coordinates is:
:&lt;math&gt;
d s^2=\alpha^2(-\cosh^2 \rho \, d \tau^2 + \, d \rho^2 + \sinh ^2 \rho \, d \Omega_{n-2}^2)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \tau \in [0,2\pi] &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \rho \in \mathbb{R}^+ &lt;/math&gt;. Considering the periodicity of time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and in order to avoid [[closed timelike curve]]s (CTC), one should take the universal cover &lt;math&gt;\tau \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. In the limit &lt;math&gt;\rho \to \infty &lt;/math&gt; one can approach to the boundary of this spacetime usually called &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AdS}_n&lt;/math&gt; conformal boundary.

With the transformations &lt;math&gt;r\equiv\alpha\sinh \rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t\equiv\alpha\tau&lt;/math&gt; we can have the usual &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AdS}_n&lt;/math&gt; metric in global coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;
d s^2=-f(r) \, d t^2+\frac{1}{f(r)} \, d r^2+r^2 \, d \Omega_{n-2}^2
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; f(r)=1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Poincaré coordinates===
By the following parametrization:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
X_1=\frac{\alpha^2}{2r}(1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^4}(\alpha^2+\vec{x}^2-t^2) ) \\
X_2=\frac{r}{\alpha}t \\
X_i=\frac{r}{\alpha}x_i \qquad i\in \{3,\cdots , n\}\\
X_{n+1}= \frac{\alpha^2}{2r}(1-\frac{r^2}{\alpha^4}(\alpha^2-\vec{x}^2+t^2) ) 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
the &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{AdS}_n &lt;/math&gt; metric in the Poincaré coordinates is:
:&lt;math&gt;
d s^2 = - \frac{r^2}{\alpha^2} \, d t^2 + \frac{\alpha^2}{r^2} \, d r^2 + \frac{r^2}{\alpha^2} \, d \vec{x}^2   
&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;0 \leq r&lt;/math&gt;. The codimension 2 surface &lt;math&gt; r=0 &lt;/math&gt; is Poincaré Killing horizon and &lt;math&gt; r\to \infty&lt;/math&gt; approaches to the boundary of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AdS}_n&lt;/math&gt; spacetime, so unlike the global coordinates, the Poincaré coordinates do not cover all &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AdS}_n&lt;/math&gt; [[manifold]]. Using &lt;math&gt;u\equiv\frac{r}{\alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt; this metric can be written in the following way:
:&lt;math&gt;
d s^2=\alpha^2 \left( \frac{\,d u^2}{u^2} + u^2(\,d x_\mu \, d x^\mu) \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; x^\mu=(t,\vec{x}) &lt;/math&gt;. By the transformation &lt;math&gt;z\equiv\frac{1}{u}&lt;/math&gt; also it can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;
d s^2 = \frac{\alpha^2}{z^2}(\,d z^2 + \, d x_\mu \,d x^\mu) 
&lt;/math&gt;

===Geometric properties===
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AdS}_n&lt;/math&gt; metric with radius &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is one of the maximal symmetric ''n''-dimensional spacetimes.  It has the following geometric properties:

[[Riemann curvature tensor]]:
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}=\frac{-1}{\alpha^2}(g_{\mu\alpha}g_{\nu\beta}-g_{\mu \beta}g_{\nu\alpha}) &lt;/math&gt;

[[Ricci curvature]]:
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\mu\nu}=\frac{-(n-1)}{\alpha^2}g_{\mu\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Scalar curvature]]:
:&lt;math&gt; R=\frac{-n(n-1)}{\alpha^2} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Anton Kotzig''' (22 October 1919 – 20 April 1991) was a [[Slovak people|Slovak]]–[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[mathematician]], expert in [[statistics]], [[combinatorics]] and [[graph theory]].

The [[Ringel-Kotzig conjecture]] on [[graceful labeling]] of [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] is named after him and [[Gerhard Ringel]].

== Biography ==
Kotzig was born in [[Kočovce]], a village in Western [[Slovakia]], in 1919. He studied at the secondary grammar school in [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]], and began his undergraduate studies at [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]]. After the closure of [[Czech Republic|Czech]] universities in 1939, he moved to [[Bratislava]], where after the war he earned a [[doctoral degree]] (RNDr.) in [[mathematical statistics]] from [[Comenius University in Bratislava]]. He remained in Bratislava working at the Central Bureau of Social Insurance for Slovakia, as the head of department of mathematical statistics.

Later he published a book on economy planning. From 1951 to 1959, he lectured at Vysoká škola Ekonomická (today [[University of Economics in Bratislava]]), where he served as [[Rector (academia)|rector]] from 1952 to 1958. Thus he spent 20 years in close contact with applications of mathematics.

In 1959, he left the University of Economics to become the head of the newly created Mathematical Institute of the [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]], where he remained until 1964. From 1965 to 1969, he was head of the department of Applied Mathematics on Faculty of Natural Sciences of Comenius University, where he was also dean for one year. He also earned a [[habilitation]] degree (DrSc.) from Charles University in 1961 for a thesis in [[graph theory]] (relation and regular relation of finite graphs).

By 1969, the list of his publications already included over 60 articles and 4 books. Many of his results have become classical, including results about graph relations, 1-factors and [[cubic graph]]s. As they were published only in Slovak,  many of them remained unknown and some of the results were independently rediscovered much later by other mathematicians.  
One of his arguments is generally known as [[Kotzig's Theorem]]. Kotzig established the now well-known Slovak School of Graph Theory. One of his first students was RNDR. Juraj Bosák, DrSc., who was awarded the Czechoslovak State Prize in 1969.

In 1969, Kotzig moved to Canada, and spent a year at the [[University of Calgary]]. He became a researcher at the Centre de recherches mathematiques (CRM) and the [[Université de Montréal|University of Montreal]] in 1970, where he remained until his death. Because of the political situation, he could not travel back to [[Czechoslovakia]], and remained in his adopted country without his books and notes. Although he was separated from his Slovak students, he continued doing mathematics. The result was more than 75 articles, supervision of many masters and doctoral theses, as well as university lecture courses.

His publications covers a wide range of topics in graph theory and combinatorics;; convex polyhedra, [[quasigroup]]s, special decompositions [[Hamiltonian path]]s , [[Latin squares]], decompositions of complete graphs, perfect systems of [[difference sets]], additive sequences of [[permutations]], tournaments and  [[Combinatorial game theory|combinatorial games theory]].

In honor of his 60th birthday, the publication "Theory and Practice of Combinatorics" was published, to which various experts from around the world contributed. Kotzig published many open problems. One of them is the still unresolved Ringel-Kotzig hypothesis. He died on April 20. 1991 in [[Montreal]], leaving his wife Edita, and a son Ľuboš.

In 1999, a commemorative plaque was erected on his birth house in Kočovce on the 80th anniversary of his birth.

In [[geometry]], '''Brahmagupta's theorem''' states that if a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] is [[Orthodiagonal quadrilateral|orthodiagonal]] (that is, has [[perpendicular]] [[diagonals]]), then the perpendicular to a side from the point of intersection of the diagonals always [[Bisection|bisects]] the opposite side.&lt;ref&gt;Michael John Bradley (2006). ''The Birth of Mathematics: Ancient Times to 1300''. Publisher Infobase Publishing. {{ISBN|0816054231}}. Page 70, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the [[List of Indian mathematicians|Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter, H. S. M.]]; Greitzer, S. L.: ''Geometry Revisited''. Washington, DC: Math. Assoc. Amer., p. 59, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, let ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' be four points on a circle such that the lines ''AC'' and ''BD'' are perpendicular. Denote the intersection of ''AC'' and ''BD'' by ''M''. Drop the perpendicular from ''M'' to the line ''BC'', calling the intersection ''E''. Let ''F'' be the intersection of the line ''EM'' and the edge ''AD''. Then, the theorem states that ''F'' is the [[midpoint]] ''AD''.

==Proof==
[[Image:Proof of Brahmagupta's theorem.svg|thumb|Proof of the theorem.]]
We need to prove that ''AF'' = ''FD''. We will prove that both ''AF'' and ''FD'' are in fact equal to ''FM''.

To prove that ''AF'' = ''FM'', first note that the angles ''FAM'' and ''CBM'' are equal, because they are [[inscribed angle]]s that intercept the same arc of the circle. Furthermore, the angles ''CBM'' and ''CME'' are both [[complementary angles|complementary]] to angle ''BCM'' (i.e., they add up to 90°), and are therefore equal. Finally, the angles ''CME'' and ''FMA'' are the same. Hence, ''AFM'' is an [[isosceles triangle]], and thus the sides ''AF'' and ''FM'' are equal.

The proof that ''FD'' = ''FM'' goes similarly: the angles ''FDM'', ''BCM'', ''BME'' and ''DMF'' are all equal, so ''DFM'' is an isosceles triangle, so ''FD'' = ''FM''. It follows that ''AF'' = ''FD'', as the theorem claims.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Cheeger constant''' (also '''Cheeger number''' or '''isoperimetric number''') of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is a numerical measure of whether or not a graph has a "bottleneck". The Cheeger constant as a measure of "bottleneckedness" is of great interest in many areas: for example, constructing well-connected [[Computer networking|networks of computers]], [[Shuffling|card shuffling]]. The graph theoretical notion originated after the [[Cheeger constant|Cheeger isoperimetric constant]] of a [[compact space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]].

The Cheeger constant is named after the [[mathematician]] [[Jeff Cheeger]].

==Definition==
Let {{mvar|G}} be an undirected finite graph with vertex set {{math|''V''(''G'')}} and edge set {{math|''E''(''G'')}}. For a collection of vertices {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''V''(''G'')}}, let {{math|∂''A''}} denote the collection of all edges going from a vertex in {{mvar|A}} to a vertex outside of {{mvar|A}} (sometimes called the ''edge boundary'' of {{mvar|A}}):

:&lt;math&gt;\partial A := \{ (x, y) \in E(G) \ : \ x \in A, y \in V(G) \setminus A \}.&lt;/math&gt;

(Remember that edges are unordered, so the edge {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} is the same as the edge {{math|(''y'', ''x'')}}.) Then the '''Cheeger constant''' of {{mvar|G}}, denoted {{math|''h''(''G'')}}, is defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohar|first1=Bojan|authorlink1=Bojan Mohar|title=Isoperimetric numbers of graphs|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B|date=December 1989|volume=47|issue=3|pages=274–291|doi=10.1016/0095-8956(89)90029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h(G) := \min \left\{\frac{| \partial A |}{| A |} \ : \  A \subseteq V(G), 0 &lt; | A | \leq \tfrac{1}{2} | V(G)| \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Cheeger constant is strictly positive [[if and only if]] {{mvar|G}} is a [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected graph]]. Intuitively, if the Cheeger constant is small but positive, then there exists a "bottleneck", in the sense that there are two "large" sets of vertices with "few" links (edges) between them. The Cheeger constant is "large" if any possible division of the vertex set into two subsets has "many" links between those two subsets.

==Example: computer networking==
[[Image:NetworkTopology-Ring.png|thumb|Ring network layout]]

In applications to theoretical computer science, one wishes to devise network configurations for which the Cheeger constant is high (at least, bounded away from zero) even when {{math|{{!}}''V''(''G''){{!}}}} (the number of computers in the network) is large.

For example, consider a [[ring network]] of {{math|''N'' ≥ 3}} computers, thought of as a graph {{mvar|G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Number the computers {{math|1, 2, ..., ''N''}} clockwise around the ring. Mathematically, the vertex set and the edge set are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V(G_{N}) &amp;= \{ 1, 2, \cdots, N-1, N \} \\
E(G_{N}) &amp;= \{ (1, 2), (2, 3), \cdots, (N - 1, N), (N, 1) \}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Take {{mvar|A}} to be a collection of &lt;math&gt;\left \lfloor \tfrac{N}{2} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; of these computers in a connected chain:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \left \{ 1, 2, \cdots, \left \lfloor \tfrac{N}{2} \right \rfloor \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

So,

:&lt;math&gt;\partial A = \left \{ \left ( \left \lfloor \tfrac{N}{2} \right \rfloor, \left \lfloor \tfrac{N}{2} \right \rfloor + 1 \right ), (N, 1) \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{| \partial A |}{| A |} = \frac{2}{\left \lfloor \tfrac{N}{2} \right \rfloor} \to 0 \mbox{ as } N \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

This example provides an upper bound for the Cheeger constant {{math|''h''(''G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, which also tends to zero as {{math|''N'' → ∞}}. Consequently, we would regard a ring network as highly "bottlenecked" for large {{mvar|N}}, and this is highly undesirable in practical terms. We would only need one of the computers on the ring to fail, and network performance would be greatly reduced. If two non-adjacent computers were to fail, the network would split into two disconnected components.

==Cheeger Inequalities==
The Cheeger constant is especially important in the context of [[expander graphs]] as it is a way to measure the edge expansion of a graph. The so-called [[Expander graph#Cheeger inequalities|Cheeger inequalities]] relate the Eigenvalue gap of a graph with its Cheeger constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3464">In [[formal language theory]], the '''Chomsky&amp;ndash;Schützenberger representation theorem''' is a theorem derived by [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger]] about representing a given [[context-free language]] in terms of two simpler languages. These two simpler languages, namely a [[regular language]] and a [[Dyck language]], are combined by means of an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and a [[Homomorphism#Homomorphisms_and_e-free_homomorphisms_in_formal_language_theory|homomorphism]].

A few notions from formal language theory are in order. A context-free language is ''[[regular language|regular]]'', if can be described by a [[regular expression]], or, equivalently, if it is accepted by a [[deterministic finite automaton|finite automaton]]. A homomorphism is based on a function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; which maps symbols from an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; to words over another alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;; If the domain of this function is extended to words over &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; in the natural way, by letting &lt;math&gt;h(xy)=h(x)h(y)&lt;/math&gt; for all words &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, this yields a ''[[Homomorphism#Homomorphisms_and_e-free_homomorphisms_in_formal_language_theory|homomorphism]]'' &lt;math&gt;h:\Gamma^*\to \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;. A ''matched alphabet'' &lt;math&gt;T \cup \overline T&lt;/math&gt; is an alphabet with two equal-sized sets; it is convenient to think of it as a set of parentheses types, where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; contains the opening parenthesis symbols, whereas the symbols in &lt;math&gt;\overline T&lt;/math&gt; contains the closing parenthesis symbols. For a matched alphabet &lt;math&gt;T \cup \overline T&lt;/math&gt;, the ''[[Dyck language]]'' &lt;math&gt;D_T&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;D_T = \{\,w \in (T \cup \overline T)^* \mid w \text{ is a correctly nested sequence of parentheses} \,\} &lt;/math&gt;
words that are well-nested parentheses over &lt;math&gt;T \cup \overline T&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Chomsky&amp;ndash;Schützenberger theorem'''. A language ''L'' over the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is context-free if and only if there exists
:* a matched alphabet &lt;math&gt;T \cup \overline T&lt;/math&gt;
:* a regular language &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;T \cup \overline T&lt;/math&gt;,
:* and a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;h : (T \cup \overline T)^* \to \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; 
:such that &lt;math&gt;L = h(D_T \cap R)&lt;/math&gt;.

Proofs of this theorem are found in several textbooks, e.g. {{harvtxt|Autebert|Berstel|Boasson|1997}} or {{harvtxt|Davis|Sigal|Weyuker|1994}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3164">In [[differential geometry]] and [[dynamical systems]], a '''closed geodesic''' on a [[Riemannian manifold]] is a [[geodesic]] that returns to its starting point with the same tangent direction. It may be formalized as the projection of a closed orbit of the [[geodesic|geodesic flow]] on the [[tangent space]] of the manifold.

==Definition==
In a [[Riemannian manifold]] (''M'',''g''), a closed geodesic is a curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma:\mathbb R\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; that is a [[geodesic]] for the metric ''g'' and is periodic.

Closed geodesics can be characterized by means of a variational principle. Denoting by &lt;math&gt;\Lambda M&lt;/math&gt; the space of smooth 1-periodic curves on ''M'', closed geodesics of period 1 are precisely the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of the energy function &lt;math&gt;E:\Lambda M\rightarrow\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, defined by

&lt;math&gt;E(\gamma)=\int_0^1 g_{\gamma(t)}(\dot\gamma(t),\dot\gamma(t))\,\mathrm{d}t.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a closed geodesic of period ''p'', the reparametrized curve &lt;math&gt;t\mapsto\gamma(pt)&lt;/math&gt; is a closed geodesic of period 1, and therefore it is a critical point of ''E''. If &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a critical point of ''E'', so are the reparametrized curves &lt;math&gt;\gamma^m&lt;/math&gt;, for each &lt;math&gt;m\in\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\gamma^m(t):=\gamma(mt)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus every closed geodesic on ''M'' gives rise to an infinite sequence of critical points of the energy ''E''.

==Examples==
On the [[unit sphere]] &lt;math&gt;S^n\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; with the standard round Riemannian metric, every [[great circle]] is an example of a closed geodesic. Thus, on the sphere, all geodesics are closed. On a smooth surface topologically equivalent to the sphere, this may not be true, but there are always at least three simple closed geodesics; this is the [[theorem of the three geodesics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4980">In [[mathematics]] the '''differential calculus over commutative algebras''' is a part of [[commutative algebra]] based on the observation that most concepts known from classical differential [[calculus]] can be formulated in purely algebraic terms. Instances of this are:
# The whole topological information of a [[smooth manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is encoded in the algebraic properties of its &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;-[[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] of smooth functions &lt;math&gt;A=C^\infty (M),&lt;/math&gt; as in the [[Banach–Stone theorem]].
# [[Vector bundle]]s over &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; correspond to projective finitely generated [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, via the [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; which associates to a vector bundle its module of sections.
# [[Vector field]]s on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are naturally identified with [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]s of the algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 
# More generally, a [[linear differential operator]] of order k, sending sections of a vector bundle &lt;math&gt;E\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; to sections of another bundle &lt;math&gt;F\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; is seen to be an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;-linear map &lt;math&gt;\Delta: \Gamma (E) \rightarrow \Gamma (F) &lt;/math&gt; between the associated modules, such that for any ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 elements &lt;math&gt;f_0,\ldots, f_k\in A&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;[f_k[f_{k-1}[\cdots[f_0,\Delta]\cdots]]=0&lt;/math&gt;

where the bracket &lt;math&gt;[f,\Delta]:\Gamma(E)\rightarrow \Gamma(F)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the commutator

&lt;math&gt;[f,\Delta](s)=\Delta(f\cdot s)-f\cdot \Delta(s).&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting the set of ''k''th order linear differential operators from an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Diff}_k(P,Q)&lt;/math&gt; we obtain a bi-functor with values in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-modules. Other natural concepts of calculus such as [[jet space]]s, [[differential form]]s are then obtained as [[Representable functor|representing object]]s of the functors &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Diff}_k&lt;/math&gt; and related functors.

Seen from this point of view calculus may in fact be understood as the theory of these functors and their representing objects.

Replacing the real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with any [[commutative ring]], and the algebra &lt;math&gt;C^\infty(M)&lt;/math&gt; with any commutative algebra the above said remains meaningful, hence differential calculus can be developed for arbitrary commutative algebras. Many of these concepts are widely used in [[algebraic geometry]], [[differential geometry]] and [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]]. Moreover, the theory generalizes naturally to the setting of [[supercommutative algebra|graded commutative algebra]], allowing for a natural foundation of calculus on [[supermanifold]]s, [[graded manifold]]s and associated concepts like the [[Berezin integral]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">In [[mathematics]], '''''differential of the first kind''''' is a traditional term used in the theories of [[Riemann surface]]s (more generally, [[complex manifold]]s) and [[algebraic curve]]s (more generally, [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]), for everywhere-regular [[differential form|differential 1-forms]]. Given a complex manifold ''M'', a differential of the first kind ω is therefore the same thing as a 1-form that is everywhere [[holomorphic form|holomorphic]]; on an [[algebraic variety]] ''V'' that is [[non-singular]] it would be a [[global section]] of the [[coherent sheaf]] Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of [[Kähler differential]]s. In either case the definition has its origins in the theory of [[abelian integral]]s.

The dimension of the space of  differentials of the first kind, by means of this identification, is the [[Hodge number]]

:''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt;.

The differentials of the first kind, when integrated along paths, give rise to integrals that generalise the [[elliptic integral]]s to all curves over the [[complex number]]s. They include for example the '''hyperelliptic integrals''' of type

: &lt;math&gt; \int\frac{x^k \, dx}{\sqrt{Q(x)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' is a [[square-free polynomial]] of any given degree&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;4. The allowable power ''k'' has to be determined by analysis of the possible pole at the [[point at infinity]] on the corresponding [[hyperelliptic curve]]. When this is done, one finds that the condition is

:''k'' ≤ ''g'' &amp;minus; 1,

or in other words, ''k'' at most 1 for degree of ''Q'' 5 or 6, at most 2 for degree 7 or 8, and so on (as ''g'' = [(1+ deg ''Q'')/2]).

Quite generally, as this example illustrates, for a [[compact Riemann surface]] or [[algebraic curve]], the Hodge number is the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g''. For the case of [[algebraic surface]]s, this is the quantity known classically as the [[irregularity of a surface|irregularity]] ''q''. It is also, in general, the dimension of the [[Albanese variety]], which takes the place of the [[Jacobian variety]].

==Differentials of the second and third kind==
The traditional terminology also included differentials '''of the second kind''' and '''of the third kind'''. The idea behind this has been supported by modern theories of [[algebraic differential form]]s, both from the side of more [[Hodge theory]], and through the use of morphisms to [[commutative]] [[algebraic group]]s.

The [[Weierstrass zeta function]] was called an ''integral of the second kind'' in [[elliptic function]] theory; it is a [[logarithmic derivative]] of a [[theta function]], and therefore has [[simple pole]]s, with integer residues. The decomposition of a ([[meromorphic]]) elliptic function into pieces of 'three kinds' parallels the representation as (i) a constant, plus (ii) a [[linear combination]] of  translates of the Weierstrass zeta function, plus (iii) a function with arbitrary poles but no residues at them.

The same type of decomposition exists in general, ''mutatis mutandis'', though the terminology is not completely consistent. In the algebraic group ([[generalized Jacobian]]) theory the three kinds are [[abelian varieties]], [[algebraic tori]], and [[affine space]]s, and the decomposition is in terms of a [[composition series]].

On the other hand, a meromorphic abelian differential of the ''second kind'' has traditionally been one with residues at all poles being zero. One of the '''third kind''' is one where all poles are simple. There is a higher-dimensional analogue available, using the [[Poincaré residue]]

The '''''First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC''''' (commonly shortened to '''''First Draft''''') is an [[unfinished creative work|incomplete]] 101-page document written by [[John von Neumann]] and distributed on June 30, 1945 by [[Herman Goldstine]], security officer on the classified [[ENIAC]] project.  It contains the first published description of the logical design of a computer using the stored-program concept, which has controversially come to be known as the [[von Neumann architecture]].

==History==
[[File:Firstdraftofrepo00vonn 0003.jpg|thumb|Title page the ''First Draft'', copy belonging to [[Samuel N. Alexander]], who developed the [[SEAC (computer)| SEAC computer]] based on the report.]]
Von Neumann wrote the report by hand while commuting by train to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] and mailed the handwritten notes back to [[Philadelphia]].  Goldstine had the report typed and duplicated.  While the date on the typed report is June 30, 24 copies of the ''First Draft'' were distributed to persons closely connected with the [[EDVAC]] project five days earlier on June 25.  Interest in the report caused it to be sent all over the world; [[Maurice Vincent Wilkes|Maurice Wilkes]] of [[Cambridge University]] cited his excitement over the report's content as the impetus for his decision to travel to the [[United States]] for the [[Moore School Lectures]] in Summer 1946.

==Synopsis==
Von Neumann describes a detailed design of a "very high speed automatic digital computing system." He divides it into six major subdivisions: a central arithmetic part, CA, a central control part, CC, memory, M, input, I, output, O, and (slow) external memory, R, such as [[punched card]]s, [[paper tape|Teletype tape]], or [[wire recording|magnetic wire]] or [[Magnetic tape|steel tape]].

The CA will perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root. Other mathematical operations, such as logarithms and trigonometric functions are to be done with [[Lookup table|table look up]] and [[interpolation]], possibly [[biquadratic]]. He notes that multiplication and division could be done with logarithm tables, but to keep the tables small enough, interpolation would be needed and this in turn requires multiplication, though perhaps with less precision. 

Numbers are to be represented in [[Binary number|binary notation]]. He estimates 27 binary digits (he did not use the term "[[bit]]," which was coined by [[Claude Shannon]] in 1948) would be sufficient (yielding 8 decimal place accuracy) but rounds up to 30 bit numbers with a sign bit and a bit to distinguish numbers from orders, resulting in 32-bit word he calls a ''minor cycle.'' [[Two’s complement]] arithmetic is to be used, simplifying subtraction. For multiplication and division, he proposes placing the binary point after sign bit, which means all numbers are treated as being between -1 and 1 and therefore computation problems must be scaled accordingly.

===Circuit design===
[[Vacuum tube]]s are to be used rather than [[relay]]s due to tubes’ ability operate in one microsecond vs 10 milliseconds for relays.

Von Neumann suggests (Sec. 5.6) keeping the computer as simple as possible, avoiding any attempt at improving performance by overlapping operations. Arithmetic operations are to be performed one binary digit at a time. He estimates addition of two binary digits as taking one microsecond and that therefore a 30-bit multiplication should take about 30&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; microseconds or about one millisecond, much faster than any computing device available at the time. 

Von Neumann's design is built up using what he call "E elements," which are based on the biological [[neuron]] as model,&lt;ref&gt;Von Neumann credits this model to [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]], [http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/mcp.pdf ''A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity,''] Bull. Math. Biophysics, Vol. 5 (1943), pp. 115–133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Neumann had worked closely with McCulloch and Pitts. See [http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/the-man-who-tried-to-redeem-the-world-with-logic The Man Who Tried to Redeem the World with Logic], Amanda Gefter, Nautilus, Issue 21, February 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but are digital devices which he says can be constructed using one or two vacuum tubes. In modern terms his simplest E element is a two input ‘"and" gate with one input inverted (the inhibit input). E elements with more inputs have an associated threshold and produce an output when the number of positive input signals meets or exceed the threshold, so long as the (only) inhibit line is not pulsed. He states that E elements with more inputs can be constructed from the simplest version, but suggests they be built directly as vacuum tube circuits as fewer tubes will be needed.

More complex function blocks are to be built from these E elements. He shows how to use these E elements to build circuits for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root, as well as two state memory blocks and control circuits. He does not use [[Boolean logic]] terminology. 

Circuits are to be synchronous with a master system clock derived from a [[vacuum tube oscillator]], possibly [[crystal oscillator|crystal controlled]]. His logic diagrams include an arrowhead symbol to denote a unit time delay, as time delays must be accounted for in a synchronous design. He points out that in one microsecond an electric pulse moves 300 meters so that until much higher clock speeds, e.g. 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cycles per second (100 MHz), wire length would not be an issue.

The need for error detection and correction is mentioned but not elaborated.

===Memory design===
A key design concept enunciated, and later named the [[Von Neumann architecture]], is a uniform memory containing both numbers (data) and orders (instructions).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The device requires a considerable memory. While it appeared that various parts of this memory have to perform functions which differ somewhat in their nature and considerably in their purpose, it is nevertheless tempting to treat the entire memory as one organ, and to have its parts even as interchangeable as possible for the various functions enumerated above." (Sec. 2.5)

"The orders which are received by CC come from M, i.e. from the same place where the numerical material is stored." (Sec. 14.0)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Neumann estimates the amount of memory required based on several classes of mathematical problems, including [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s, [[Sorting algorithm|sorting]] and [[Monte Carlo method|probability experiments]]. Of these, partial differential equations in two dimensions plus time will require the most memory, with three dimensions plus time being beyond what can be done using technology that was then available. He concludes that memory will be the largest subdivision of the system and he proposes 8,192 minor cycles (words) of 32-bits as a design goal, with 2,048 minor cycles still being useful. He estimates a few hundred minor cycles will suffice for storing the program.

He proposes two kinds of fast memory, [[Delay line memory|delay line]] and [[Iconoscope]] tube. Each minor cycle is to be addressed as a unit (word addressing, Sec. 12.8).
Instructions are to be executed sequentially, with a special instruction to switch to a different point in memory (i.e. a jump instruction). 

Binary digits in a delay line memory pass through the line and are fed back to the beginning. Accessing data in a delay line imposes a time penalty while waiting for the desired data to come around again. After analyzing these timing issues, he proposes organizing the delay line memory into 256 delay line "organs" (DLAs) each storing 1024 bits, or 32 minor cycles, called a ''major cycle.'' A memory access first selects the DLA (8 bits) and then the minor cycle within the DLA (5 bits), for a total of 13 address bits. 

For the Iconoscope memory, he recognizes that each scan point on the tube face is a capacitor and that a capacitor can store one bit. Very high precision scanning will be needed and the memory will only last a short time, perhaps as little as a second, and therefore will need to be periodically recopied ([[Memory refresh|refreshed]]).

===Orders (instructions)===
In Sec 14.1 von Neumann proposes the format for orders, which he calls a code. Order types include the basic arithmetic operations, moving minor cycles between CA and M (word load and store in modern terms), an order (''s'') that selects one of two numbers based on the sign of the previous operation, input and output and transferring CC to a memory location elsewhere (a jump). He determines the number of bits needed for the different order types, suggests ''immediate orders'' where the following word is the operand and discusses the desirability of leaving spare bits in the order format to allow for more addressable memory in the future, as well as other unspecified purposes. The possibility of storing more than one order in a minor cycle is discussed, with little enthusiasm for that approach. A table of orders is provided, but no discussion of input and output instructions was included in the First Draft.

==Controversy==
The treatment of the preliminary report as a publication (in the legal sense) was the source of bitter acrimony between factions of the [[EDVAC]] design team for two reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Moye | first = William T. | title = ENIAC: The Army-Sponsored Revolution | publisher = [[United States Army Research Laboratory]] | date = January 1996 | url = http://ftp.arl.army.mil/mike/comphist/96summary/index.html | accessdate = 2012-11-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130305070628/http://ftp.arl.army.mil/mike/comphist/96summary/index.html | archivedate = 2013-03-05 | df =  }} &lt;/ref&gt;  First, publication amounted to a public disclosure that prevented the EDVAC from being patented; second, some on the EDVAC design team contended that the stored-program concept had evolved out of meetings at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] predating von Neumann's activity as a consultant there, and that much of the work represented in the ''First Draft'' was no more than a translation of the discussed concepts into the language of formal [[logic]] in which von Neumann was fluent. Hence, failure of von Neumann and Goldstine to list others as authors on the ''First Draft'' led credit to be attributed to von Neumann alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">In applied [[mathematics]] and the [[calculus of variations]], the '''first variation''' of a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] ''J''(''y'') is defined as the linear functional &lt;math&gt; \delta J(y) &lt;/math&gt; mapping the function ''h'' to

:&lt;math&gt;\delta J(y,h) = \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0} \frac{J(y + \varepsilon h)-J(y)}{\varepsilon} = \left.\frac{d}{d\varepsilon} J(y + \varepsilon h)\right|_{\varepsilon = 0},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''y'' and ''h'' are functions, and ''ε'' is a scalar. This is recognizable as the [[Gâteaux derivative]] of the functional.

==Example==

Compute the first variation of

:&lt;math&gt;J(y)=\int_a^b yy' dx.&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition above,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\delta J(y,h)&amp;=\left.\frac{d}{d\varepsilon} J(y + \varepsilon h)\right|_{\varepsilon = 0}\\
&amp;= \left.\frac{d}{d\varepsilon} \int_a^b (y + \varepsilon h)(y^\prime + \varepsilon h^\prime) \ dx\right|_{\varepsilon = 0}\\
&amp;= \left.\frac{d}{d\varepsilon} \int_a^b (yy^\prime + y\varepsilon h^\prime + y^\prime\varepsilon h + \varepsilon^2 hh^\prime) \ dx\right|_{\varepsilon = 0}\\
&amp;= \left.\int_a^b \frac{d}{d\varepsilon} (yy^\prime + y\varepsilon h^\prime + y^\prime\varepsilon h + \varepsilon^2 hh^\prime) \ dx\right|_{\varepsilon = 0}\\
&amp;= \left.\int_a^b (yh^\prime + y^\prime h + 2\varepsilon hh^\prime) \ dx\right|_{\varepsilon = 0}\\
&amp;= \int_a^b (yh^\prime + y^\prime h) \ dx

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9202">'''Fractional wavelet transform''' (FRWT) is a generalization of the classical [[wavelet transform]] (WT). This transform is proposed in order to rectify the limitations of the WT and the [[fractional Fourier transform]] (FRFT). The FRWT inherits the advantages of [[multiresolution analysis]] of the WT and has the capability of signal representations in the fractional domain which is similar to the FRFT.

==Definition==
The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT)&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Ozaktas, Z. Zalevsky, and M. A. Kutay, The Fractional Fourier Transform with Applications in Optics and Signal Processing. Wiley, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;，a generalization of the Fourier transform (FT),
serves a useful and powerful analyzing tool&lt;ref&gt;E. Sejdic, I. Djurovic, and L. Stankovic, "Fractional Fourier transform as a signal processing tool: An overview of recent developments," Signal Process., vol. 91, pp. 1351--1369, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in optics, communications, signal and image processing, etc.
This transform, however, has one major drawback due to using global kernel, i.e., the fractional Fourier representation only provides such FRFT spectral content with no indication about the time localization of the FRFT spectral components.
Therefore, the analysis of non-stationary signals whose FRFT spectral characteristics change with time requires joint signal representations in both time and FRFT domains, rather than just a FRFT-domain representation.

The first modification to the FRFT to allow analysis of aforementioned non-stationary signals came as the short-time FRFT (STFRFT).&lt;ref&gt;L. Stankovic, T. Alieva, and M. J. Bastiaans, "Time-frequency signal analysis based on the windowed fractional Fourier transform,"Signal Process., vol. 83, pp. 2459--2468, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Tao, Y. Lei, and Y. Wang, "Short-time fractional Fourier transform and its applications," IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 58, pp. 2568--2580, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind the STFRFT was segmenting the signal by using a time-localized window, and performing FRFT spectral analysis for each segment.
Since the FRFT was computed for every windowed segment of the signal, the STFRFT was able to provide a true joint signal representation in both time and FRFT domains.
However, the drawback is that the STFRFT has the limitation of a fixed window width which needs to be fixed a priori; this effectively means that it does not provide the requisite good resolution in both time and FRFT domains. In other words, the efficiency of the STFRFT techniques is limited by the fundamental uncertainty principle,&lt;ref&gt;J. Shi, X.-P. Liu, and N.-T. Zhang, "On uncertainty principle for signal concentrations with fractional Fourier transform," Signal Process., vol. 92, pp. 2830--2836, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which implies that narrow windows produce good time resolution but poor spectral resolution, whereas wide windows provide good spectral resolution but poor time resolution. Most of the signals of practical interest are such that they have high spectral components for short durations and low spectral components for long durations.

As a generalization of the wavelet transform, Mendlovic and David&lt;ref&gt;D. Mendlovic, Z. Zalevsky, D. Mas, J. Garcia, and C. Ferreira, "Fractional wavelet transform," Appl. Opt., vol. 36, pp. 4801--4806, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced the fractional wavelet transform (FRWT) as a way to deal with optical signals, which was defined as a cascade of the FRFT and the ordinary wavelet transform (WT), i.e., 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W^{\alpha}(a,b)&amp;=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}{\mathcal K}_\alpha(u,t)f(t)\psi^{\ast}\left(\frac{u-b}{a}\right)dtdu\\
&amp;=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}\left(\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}f(t){\mathcal K}_\alpha(u,t)dt\right)\psi^{\ast}\left(\frac{u-b}{a}\right)du\\
&amp;=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}F_{\alpha}(u)\psi^{\ast}\left(\frac{u-b}{a}\right)du\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the transform kernel &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}_{\alpha}(u,t)&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{K}_{\alpha}(u,t)=
  \begin{cases}
  A_{\alpha}e^{j\frac{u^2+t^2}{2}\cot\alpha-jut\csc\alpha},&amp;\alpha \neq k\pi\\
  \delta(t-u),&amp;\alpha = 2k\pi \\
  \delta(t+u),&amp;\alpha = (2k-1)\pi \\
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_\alpha=\sqrt{{(1-j\cot\alpha)}/{2\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha}(u)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the FRFT of &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;. But it couldn't be regarded as a kind of joint time-FRFT-domain representation since time information is lost in this transform. Moreover, Prasad and Mahato&lt;ref&gt;A. Prasad and A. Mahato, "The fractional wavelet transform on spaces of type S," Integral Transform Spec. Funct., vol. 23, no. 4, pp. 237--249, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed the ordinary WT of a signal in terms of the FRFTs of the signal and mother wavelet, and also called the expression the FRWT. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left(W_{\psi}^{\alpha}f\right)(b,a)&amp;=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}f(t)\psi^{\ast}\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right)dt\\
&amp;=\frac{\csc\alpha}{4\pi^2}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}F(u\sin\alpha)\Psi^{\ast}(au\sin\alpha)e^{j\frac{u^2}{4}(1-a^2)\sin2\alpha-jbu}du\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F(u\sin\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi(u\sin\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; denote the FTs (with their arguments scaled by &lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi(t)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Clearly, this so-called FRWT is identical to the ordinary WT.

Recently, Shi et al. proposed a new definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shi | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = N.-T. | last3 = Liu | first3 = X.-P. | year = 2011| title = A novel fractional wavelet transform and its applications | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/q01np2848m388647/ | journal = Sci.

Sci. | volume = 55 | issue = 6| pages = 1270–1279 | doi=10.1007/s11432-011-4320-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the FRWT by introducing a new structure of the fractional convolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shi | first1 = J. | last2 = Chi | first2 = Y.-G. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = N.-T. | year = 2010 | title = Multichannel sampling and reconstruction of bandlimited signals in fractional Fourier domain | url = | journal = IEEE Signal Process. Lett. | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 909–912 | doi=10.1109/lsp.2010.2071383}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with the FRFT. 
Specifically, the FRWT of any function  &lt;math&gt;f(t)\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is defined as [8]
:&lt;math&gt;
W_{f}^{\alpha}(a,b)=\mathcal{W}^{\alpha}[f(t)](a,b)=\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} f(t)\psi_{\alpha,a,b}^{\ast}(t)\, dt
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\alpha,a,b}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous affine transformation and chirp modulation of the mother wavelet &lt;math&gt;\psi(t)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi_{\alpha,a,b}(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\psi\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right)e^{-j\frac{t^2-b^2}{2}\cot\alpha}
&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;a\in \mathbb{R^+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are scaling and translation parameters, respectively.
Conversely, the inverse FRWT is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi C_{\psi}}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^{+}}W_{f}^{\alpha}(a,b)\psi_{\alpha,a,b}(t)\frac{da}{a^2}db
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant that depends on the wavelet used. The success of the reconstruction depends on this constant called, the admissibility constant, to satisfy the following admissibility condition:
:&lt;math&gt;
C_{\psi}=\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}{\frac{|\Psi(\Omega)|^2}{|\Omega|}}\,d\Omega&lt;\infty
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Psi(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the FT of &lt;math&gt;\psi(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The admissibility condition implies that &lt;math&gt;\Psi(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, which is &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}}\psi(t)dt=0&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, continuous fractional wavelets must oscillate and behave as bandpass filters in the fractional Fourier domain. From this viewpoint, the FRWT of &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of the FRFT-domain representation as
:&lt;math&gt;
W_{f}^{\alpha}(a,b)=\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}{\sqrt{2\pi a}F_{\alpha}(u)\Psi^{\ast}(au\csc\alpha)}\mathcal{K}^{\ast}_{\alpha}(u,b)du
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha}(u)&lt;/math&gt; indicates the FRFT of &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Psi(u\csc\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the FT (with its argument scaled by &lt;math&gt;\csc\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) of &lt;math&gt;\psi(t)&lt;/math&gt;. 
Note that when &lt;math&gt;\alpha={\pi}/{2}&lt;/math&gt;, the FRWT reduces to the classical WT. For more details of this type of the FRWT, see [8] and.&lt;ref&gt;L. Debnath and F. A. Shah, Wavelet Transforms and Their Applications, 2nd Edition, 2015, pp.14-15. URL: https://www.springer.com/cn/book/9780817684174/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12151">In [[functional programming]], a '''generalized algebraic data type''' ('''GADT''', also '''first-class phantom type''',{{sfn|Cheney|Hinze|2003}} '''guarded recursive datatype''',{{sfn|Xi|Chen|Chen|2003}} or '''equality-qualified type'''{{sfn|Sheard|Pasalic|2004}}) is a generalization of [[parametric polymorphism|parametric]] [[algebraic data type]]s.

== Overview ==
In a GADT, the product constructors (called [[data constructor]]s in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) can provide an explicit instantiation of the ADT as the type instantiation of their return value. This allows one to define functions with a more advanced type behaviour. For a data constructor of Haskell 98, the return value has the type instantiation implied by the instantiation of the ADT parameters at the constructor's application.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
-- A parametric ADT that is not a GADT
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)

integers = Cons 12 (Cons 107 Nil)       -- the type of integers is List Int
strings = Cons "boat" (Cons "dock" Nil) -- the type of strings is List String

-- A GADT
data Expr a where
    EBool  :: Bool     -&gt; Expr Bool
    EInt   :: Int      -&gt; Expr Int
    EEqual :: Expr Int -&gt; Expr Int  -&gt; Expr Bool

eval :: Expr a -&gt; a

eval e = case e of
    EBool a    -&gt; a
    EInt a     -&gt; a
    EEqual a b -&gt; (eval a) == (eval b)

expr1 = EEqual (EInt 2) (EInt 3)        -- the type of expr1 is Expr Bool
ret = eval expr1                        -- ret is False
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

They are currently implemented in the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] compiler as a non-standard extension, used by, among others, [[Pugs (programming)|Pugs]] and [[Darcs]]. [[OCaml]] supports GADT natively since version 4.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OCaml 4.00.1|url=https://ocaml.org/releases/4.00.1.html|website=ocaml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHC implementation provides support for existentially quantified type parameters and for local constraints.

== History ==
An early version of generalized algebraic data types were described by {{harvtxt|Augustsson|Petersson|1994}} and based on [[pattern matching (functional programming)|pattern matching]] in [[ALF (theorem prover)|ALF]].

Generalized algebraic data types were introduced independently by {{harvtxt|Cheney|Hinze|2003}} and prior by {{harvtxt|Xi|Chen|Chen|2003}} as extensions to [[ML (programming language)|ML]]'s and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s [[algebraic data type]]s.{{sfn|Cheney|Hinze|2003|p=25}} Both are essentially equivalent to each other. They are similar to the ''[[Algebraic data type|inductive families of data types]]'' (or ''inductive datatypes'') found in [[Coq]]'s [[Calculus of Inductive Constructions]] and other [[dependently typed language]]s, modulo the dependent types and except that the latter have an additional [[positivity restriction]] which is not enforced in GADTs.{{sfn|Cheney|Hinze|2003|pp=25–26}}

{{harvtxt|Sulzmann|Wazny|Stuckey|2006}} introduced ''extended algebraic data types'' which combine GADTs together with the [[existential type|existential data types]] and [[type class]] constraints introduced by {{harvtxt|Perry|1991}}, {{harvtxt|Läufer|Odersky|1994}} and {{harvtxt|Läufer|1996}}.

[[Type inference]] in the absence of any programmer supplied [[type annotation]]s is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]{{sfn|Peyton Jones|Washburn|Weirich|2004|p=7}} and functions defined over GADTs do not admit [[principal type]]s in general.{{sfn|Schrijvers|Peyton Jones|Sulzmann|Vytiniotis|2009|p=1}} [[Type reconstruction]] requires several design trade-offs and is an area of active research ({{harvnb|Peyton Jones|Washburn|Weirich|2004}}; {{harvnb|Peyton Jones|Vytiniotis|Weirich|Washburn|2006}}; {{harvnb|Pottier|Régis-Gianas|2006}}; {{harvnb|Sulzmann|Schrijvers|Stuckey|2006}}; {{harvnb|Simonet|Pottier|2007}}; {{harvnb|Schrijvers|Peyton Jones|Sulzmann|Vytiniotis|2009}}; {{harvnb|Lin|Sheard|2010a}}; {{harvnb|Lin|Sheard|2010b}}; {{harvnb|Vytiniotis|Peyton Jones|Schrijvers|2010}}; {{harvnb|Vytiniotis|Peyton Jones|Schrijvers|Martin Sulzmann|2011}}).

== Applications ==
Applications of GADTs include [[generic programming]], modelling programming languages ([[higher-order abstract syntax]]), maintaining [[invariant (computer science)|invariant]]s in [[data structure]]s, expressing constraints in [[embedded domain-specific language]]s, and modelling objects.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|Washburn|Weirich|2004|p=3}}

=== Higher-order abstract syntax ===
{{further|Higher-order abstract syntax}}
An important application of GADTs is to embed [[higher-order abstract syntax]] in a [[type safe]] fashion. Here is an embedding of the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] with an arbitrary collection of [[base type]]s, [[tuple (computer science)|tuple]]s and a [[fixed point combinator]]:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Lam :: * -&gt; * where
  Lift :: a                     -&gt; Lam a        -- ^ lifted value
  Pair :: Lam a -&gt; Lam b        -&gt; Lam (a, b)   -- ^ product
  Lam  :: (Lam a -&gt; Lam b)      -&gt; Lam (a -&gt; b) -- ^ lambda abstraction
  App  :: Lam (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Lam a -&gt; Lam b        -- ^ function application
  Fix  :: Lam (a -&gt; a)          -&gt; Lam a        -- ^ fixed point
&lt;/source&gt;
And a type safe evaluation function:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
eval :: Lam t -&gt; t
eval (Lift v)   = v
eval (Pair l r) = (eval l, eval r)
eval (Lam f)    = \x -&gt; eval (f (Lift x))
eval (App f x)  = (eval f) (eval x)
eval (Fix f)    = (eval f) (eval (Fix f))
&lt;/source&gt;
The factorial function can now be written as:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
fact = Fix (Lam (\f -&gt; Lam (\y -&gt; Lift (if eval y == 0 then 1 else eval y * (eval f) (eval y - 1)))))
eval(fact)(10)
&lt;/source&gt;
We would have run into problems using regular algebraic data types. Dropping the type parameter would have made the lifted base types existentially quantified, making it impossible to write the evaluator. With a type parameter we would still be restricted to a single base type. Furthermore, ill-formed expressions such as &lt;code&gt;App (Lam (\x -&gt; Lam (\y -&gt; App x y))) (Lift True)&lt;/code&gt; would have been possible to construct, while they are type incorrect using the GADT. A well-formed analogue is &lt;code&gt;App (Lam (\x -&gt; Lam (\y -&gt; App x y))) (Lift (\z -&gt; True))&lt;/code&gt;. This is because the type of &lt;code&gt;x &lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Lam (a -&gt; b)&lt;/code&gt;, inferred from the type of the &lt;code&gt;Lam&lt;/code&gt; data constructor.

The '''Hamming weight''' of a [[string (computer science)|string]] is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol of the [[alphabet]] used. It is thus equivalent to the [[Hamming distance]] from the all-zero string of the same length. For the most typical case, a string of [[bit]]s, this is the number of 1's in the string, or the [[digit sum]] of the [[Binary numeral system|binary representation]] of a given number and the [[Taxicab geometry|''ℓ''₁ norm]] of a bit vector. In this binary case, it is also called the '''population count''',&lt;ref name="Warren_2013"/&gt; '''popcount''', '''sideways sum''',&lt;ref name="Knuth_2009"/&gt; or '''bit summation'''.&lt;ref name="HP-16C_1982"/&gt;

== History and usage ==
The Hamming weight is named after [[Richard Hamming]] although he did not originate the notion.&lt;ref name="Thompson_1983"/&gt; The Hamming weight of binary numbers was already used in 1899 by [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|James W. L. Glaisher]] to give a formula for [[Gould's sequence|the number of odd binomial coefficients]] in a single row of [[Pascal's triangle]].&lt;ref name="Glaisher_1899"/&gt; [[Irving S. Reed]] introduced a concept, equivalent to Hamming weight in the binary case, in 1954.&lt;ref name="Reed_1954"/&gt;

Hamming weight is used in several disciplines including [[information theory]], [[coding theory]], and [[cryptography]]. Examples of applications of the Hamming weight include:
* In modular [[exponentiation by squaring]], the number of modular multiplications required for an exponent ''e'' is log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''e'' + weight(''e''). This is the reason that the public key value ''e'' used in [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] is typically chosen to be a number of low Hamming weight.
* The Hamming weight determines path lengths between nodes in [[Chord (distributed hash table)|Chord distributed hash tables]].&lt;ref name="Stoica_2003"/&gt;
* [[IrisCode]] lookups in biometric databases are typically implemented by calculating the [[Hamming distance]] to each stored record.
* In [[computer chess]] programs using a [[bitboard]] representation, the Hamming weight of a bitboard gives the number of pieces of a given type remaining in the game, or the number of squares of the board controlled by one player's pieces, and is therefore an important contributing term to the value of a position.
* Hamming weight can be used to efficiently compute [[find first set]] using the identity ffs(x) = pop(x ^ (~(-x))). This is useful on platforms such as [[SPARC]] that have hardware Hamming weight instructions but no hardware find first set instruction.&lt;ref name="SPARC_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren_2013"/&gt;
* The Hamming weight operation can be interpreted as a conversion from the [[unary numeral system]] to [[binary number]]s.&lt;ref name="Blaxell_1978"/&gt;
* In implementation of some [[succinct data structure]]s like [[Bit array|bit vectors]] and [[Wavelet_Tree|wavelet trees]].

== Efficient implementation ==
The population count of a [[bit array|bitstring]] is often needed in cryptography and other applications. The [[Hamming distance]] of two words ''A'' and ''B'' can be calculated as the Hamming weight of ''A'' [[xor]] ''B''.&lt;ref name="Warren_2013"/&gt;

The problem of how to implement it efficiently has been widely studied.  Some processors have a single command to calculate it (see [[#Processor support|below]]), and some have parallel operations on bit vectors. For processors lacking those features, the best solutions known are based on adding counts in a tree pattern.  For example, to count the number of 1 bits in the 16-bit binary number a&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0110&amp;nbsp;1100&amp;nbsp;1011&amp;nbsp;1010, these operations can be done:

Here, the operations are as in [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], so {{code|X &gt;&gt; Y}} means to shift X right by Y bits, X &amp; Y means the bitwise AND of X and Y, and + is ordinary addition.  The best algorithms known for this problem are based on the concept illustrated above and are given here:&lt;ref name="Warren_2013"/&gt;

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
//types and constants used in the functions below
//uint64_t is an unsigned 64-bit integer variable type (defined in C99 version of C language)
const uint64_t m1  = 0x5555555555555555; //binary: 0101...
const uint64_t m2  = 0x3333333333333333; //binary: 00110011..
const uint64_t m4  = 0x0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f; //binary:  4 zeros,  4 ones ...
const uint64_t m8  = 0x00ff00ff00ff00ff; //binary:  8 zeros,  8 ones ...
const uint64_t m16 = 0x0000ffff0000ffff; //binary: 16 zeros, 16 ones ...
const uint64_t m32 = 0x00000000ffffffff; //binary: 32 zeros, 32 ones
const uint64_t h01 = 0x0101010101010101; //the sum of 256 to the power of 0,1,2,3...

//This is a naive implementation, shown for comparison,
//and to help in understanding the better functions.
//This algorithm uses 24 arithmetic operations (shift, add, and).
int popcount64a(uint64_t x)
{
    x = (x &amp; m1 ) + ((x &gt;&gt;  1) &amp; m1 ); //put count of each  2 bits into those  2 bits 
    x = (x &amp; m2 ) + ((x &gt;&gt;  2) &amp; m2 ); //put count of each  4 bits into those  4 bits 
    x = (x &amp; m4 ) + ((x &gt;&gt;  4) &amp; m4 ); //put count of each  8 bits into those  8 bits 
    x = (x &amp; m8 ) + ((x &gt;&gt;  8) &amp; m8 ); //put count of each 16 bits into those 16 bits 
    x = (x &amp; m16) + ((x &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; m16); //put count of each 32 bits into those 32 bits 
    x = (x &amp; m32) + ((x &gt;&gt; 32) &amp; m32); //put count of each 64 bits into those 64 bits 
    return x;
}

//This uses fewer arithmetic operations than any other known  
//implementation on machines with slow multiplication.
//This algorithm uses 17 arithmetic operations.
int popcount64b(uint64_t x)
{
    x -= (x &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; m1;             //put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits
    x = (x &amp; m2) + ((x &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; m2); //put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits 
    x = (x + (x &gt;&gt; 4)) &amp; m4;        //put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits 
    x += x &gt;&gt;  8;  //put count of each 16 bits into their lowest 8 bits
    x += x &gt;&gt; 16;  //put count of each 32 bits into their lowest 8 bits
    x += x &gt;&gt; 32;  //put count of each 64 bits into their lowest 8 bits
    return x &amp; 0x7f;
}

//This uses fewer arithmetic operations than any other known  
//implementation on machines with fast multiplication.
//This algorithm uses 12 arithmetic operations, one of which is a multiply.
int popcount64c(uint64_t x)
{
    x -= (x &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; m1;             //put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits
    x = (x &amp; m2) + ((x &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; m2); //put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits 
    x = (x + (x &gt;&gt; 4)) &amp; m4;        //put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits 
    return (x * h01) &gt;&gt; 56;  //returns left 8 bits of x + (x&lt;&lt;8) + (x&lt;&lt;16) + (x&lt;&lt;24) + ... 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above implementations have the best worst-case behavior of any known algorithm.  However, when a value is expected to have few nonzero bits, it may instead be more efficient to use algorithms that count these bits one at a time. As {{harvtxt|Wegner|1960}} described,&lt;ref name="Wegner_1960"/&gt; the [[Bitwise operation|bitwise and]] of ''x'' with ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 differs from ''x'' only in zeroing out the least significant nonzero bit: subtracting 1 changes the rightmost string of 0s to 1s, and changes the rightmost 1 to a 0. If ''x'' originally had ''n'' bits that were 1, then after only ''n'' iterations of this operation, ''x'' will be reduced to zero. The following implementation is based on this principle.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
//This is better when most bits in x are 0
//This is algorithm works the same for all data sizes.
//This algorithm uses 3 arithmetic operations and 1 comparison/branch per "1" bit in x.
int popcount64d(uint64_t x)
{
    int count;
    for (count=0; x; count++)
        x &amp;= x - 1;
    return count;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If we are allowed greater memory usage, we can calculate the Hamming weight faster than the above methods.  With unlimited memory, we could simply create a large lookup table of the Hamming weight of every 64 bit integer.  If we can store a lookup table of the hamming function of every 16 bit integer, we can do the following to compute the Hamming weight of every 32 bit integer.
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
static uint16_t wordbits[65536] = { /* bitcounts of integers 0 through 65535, inclusive */ };
//This algorithm uses 3 arithmetic operations and 2 memory reads.
int popcount32e(uint32_t x)
{
    return wordbits[x &amp; 0xFFFF] + wordbits[x &gt;&gt; 16];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
//Optionally, the wordbits[] table could be filled using this function
int popcount32e_init(void)
{
    uint32_t i;
    uint16_t x;
    int count;
    for (i=0; i &lt;= 0xFFFF; i++)
    {
        x = i;
        for (count=0; x; count++) // borrowed from popcount64d() above
            x &amp;= x - 1;
        wordbits[i] = count;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;


Muła et al. &lt;ref name="Mula_2018"/&gt; have shown that a vectorized version of popcount64b can run faster than dedicated instructions (e.g., popcnt on x64 processors).

== Language support ==

Some C compilers provide intrinsic functions that provide bit counting facilities. For example, [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (since version 3.4 in April 2004) includes a builtin function &lt;code&gt;__builtin_popcount&lt;/code&gt; that will use a processor instruction if available or an efficient library implementation otherwise.&lt;ref name="GCC"/&gt;  [[LLVM|LLVM-GCC]] has included this function since version 1.5 in June 2005.&lt;ref name="LLVM"/&gt;

In [[C++ STL]], the bit-array data structure &lt;code&gt;bitset&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;count()&lt;/code&gt; method that counts the number of bits that are set.

In Java, the growable bit-array data structure {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|BitSet}} has a {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|BitSet|cardinality()}} method that counts the number of bits that are set. In addition, there are {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Integer|bitCount(int)}} and {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Long|bitCount(long)}} functions to count bits in primitive 32-bit and 64-bit integers, respectively. Also, the {{Javadoc:SE|java/math|BigInteger}} arbitrary-precision integer class also has a {{Javadoc:SE|java/math|BigInteger|bitCount()}} method that counts bits.

In [[Common Lisp]], the function logcount, given a non-negative integer, returns the number of 1 bits. (For negative integers it returns the number of 0 bits in 2's complement notation.) In either case the integer can be a BIGNUM.

Starting in [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] 7.4, the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] base package has a &lt;code&gt;popCount&lt;/code&gt; function available on all types that are instances of the &lt;code&gt;Bits&lt;/code&gt; class (available from the &lt;code&gt;Data.Bits&lt;/code&gt; module).&lt;ref name="GHC"/&gt;

[[MySQL]] version of [[SQL]] language provides &lt;code&gt;BIT_COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; as a standard function.&lt;ref name="MySQL_50"/&gt;

[[Fortran 2008]] has the standard, intrinsic, elemental function &lt;code&gt;popcnt&lt;/code&gt; returning the number of nonzero bits within an integer (or integer array).&lt;ref name="Metcalf_2011"/&gt;

Some programmable scientific pocket calculators feature special commands to calculate the number of set bits, e.g. &lt;code&gt;#B&lt;/code&gt; on the [[HP-16C]],&lt;ref name="HP-16C_1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz_Grevelle_2003"/&gt; &lt;code&gt;#BITS&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref name="Martin_McClure_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin_2015"/&gt; &lt;code&gt;BITSUM&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref name="Thörngren_2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thörngren_2017_2"/&gt; or &lt;code&gt;nBITS&lt;/code&gt; on the [[WP 34S]].&lt;ref name="Bonin_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonin_2015"/&gt;

== Processor support ==
*The [[IBM STRETCH]] computer in the 1960s calculated the number of set bits as well as the [[number of leading zeros]] as a by-product of all logical operations.&lt;ref name="Warren_2013"/&gt;
*[[Cray]] supercomputers early on featured a population count [[machine instruction]], rumoured to have been specifically requested by the U.S. government [[National Security Agency]] for [[cryptanalysis]] applications.&lt;ref name="Warren_2013"/&gt;&lt;!-- This ref supports the rumour in general, but does not mention Cray --&gt;
*Some of [[Control Data Corporation]]'s (CDC) [[CDC Cyber|Cyber 70/170]] series machines included a population count instruction; in [[COMPASS#COMPASS for 60-bit machines|COMPASS]], this instruction was coded as &lt;code&gt;CXi&lt;/code&gt;.
*[[SPARC]] stations had a &lt;code&gt;POPC&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;ref name="SPARC_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren_2013"/&gt;
*[[Donald Knuth]]'s model computer [[MMIX]] that is going to replace [[MIX]] in his book [[The Art of Computer Programming]] has an &lt;code&gt;SADD&lt;/code&gt; instruction since 1999. &lt;code&gt;SADD a,b,c&lt;/code&gt; counts all bits that are 1 in b and 0 in c and writes the result to a.
*[[Compaq]]'s [[Alpha 21264A]], released in 1999, was the first Alpha series CPU design that had the count extension (&lt;code&gt;CIX&lt;/code&gt;).
*[[Analog Devices]]' [[Blackfin]] processors feature the &lt;code&gt;ONES&lt;/code&gt; instruction to perform a 32-bit population count.&lt;ref name="AD_2001"/&gt;
*[[AMD]]'s [[AMD K10|Barcelona]] architecture introduced the &lt;code&gt;ABM&lt;/code&gt; (advanced bit manipulation) [[Instruction set|ISA]] introducing the &lt;code&gt;POPCNT&lt;/code&gt; instruction as part of the [[SSE4a]] extensions in 2007.
*[[Intel Core]] processors introduced a &lt;code&gt;POPCNT&lt;/code&gt; instruction with the [[SSE4.2]] [[instruction set]] extension, first available in a [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]]-based [[Core i7]] processor, released in November 2008.
*The [[ARM architecture]] introduced the &lt;code&gt;VCNT&lt;/code&gt; instruction as part of the [[ARM Advanced SIMD|Advanced SIMD]] ([[NEON (instruction set)|NEON]]) extensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8491">[[File:Heilbronn square n=6.svg|thumb|300px|Solution to the Heilbronn triangle problem for six points in the unit square. These points form triangles of four different shapes, with minimum area 1/8, as large as possible for six points in the square. This solution is an [[affine transformation]] of a [[regular hexagon]] but larger numbers of points have solutions that include interior points of the square.]]
In [[discrete geometry]] and [[discrepancy theory]], the '''Heilbronn triangle problem''' is a problem of placing points within a region in the plane, in order to avoid [[triangle]]s of small [[area]]. It is named after [[Hans Heilbronn]], who [[conjecture]]d prior to 1950 that this smallest triangle area is necessarily at most [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of the number of points. Heilbronn's conjecture was proven false, but the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic growth]] rate of the minimum triangle area remains unknown.

==Definition==
The problem may be defined in terms of any [[compact space|compact]] set ''D'' in the plane with nonzero area such as the  [[unit square]] or the [[unit disk]]. If ''S'' is a set of ''n'' points of ''D'', then every three points of ''S'' determine a triangle (possibly a degenerate one, with zero area). Let &amp;Delta;(''S'') denote the minimum of the areas of these triangles, and let &amp;Delta;(''n'') (for an integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3) denote the [[supremum]] of the values of &amp;Delta;(''S'').

The question posed by Heilbronn was to give an expression, or matching asymptotic [[upper and lower bounds]], for &amp;Delta;(''n''). That is, the goal is to find a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'', described by a [[closed-form expression]], and constants ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such that for all ''n'',
:&lt;math&gt;c_1 f(n) \le \Delta(n) \le c_2 f(n)&lt;/math&gt;.
In terms of [[big O notation]], the left inequality may be written as &amp;Delta;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;Omega;(''f''(''n'')), the right inequality may be written as &amp;Delta;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''O''(''f''(''n'')), and both of them together may be written as &amp;Delta;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;Theta;(''f''(''n'')). The shape and area of ''D'' may affect the exact values of &amp;Delta;(''n''), but only by a constant factor, so they are unimportant for its asymptotic growth rate.

==Heilbronn's conjecture and lower bound constructions==
Heilbronn conjectured that
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(n)=O\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
As [[Paul Erdős]] showed, no smaller bound is possible: when ''n'' is a [[prime number]], the set of ''n'' points (''i'',&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;''n'')  on an ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n''  [[integer lattice|integer grid]] have [[No-three-in-line problem|no three collinear points]], and therefore by [[Pick's formula]] each of the triangles they form has area at least 1/2. When this set of grid points is scaled to a unit square, they form a set of points whose smallest triangle area is at least proportional to 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, matching Heilbronn's conjectured upper bound.&lt;ref name="r51"&gt;{{citation

If ''n'' is not prime, then a similar construction using the next prime number larger than ''n'' achieves the same asymptotic lower bound.

{{harvtxt|Komlós|Pintz|Szemerédi|1982}} eventually disproved Heilbronn's conjecture, by finding sets of points whose smallest triangle area grows asymptotically as
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(n)=\Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{n^2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Komlós|first1=J.|author1-link=János Komlós (mathematician)|author2-link=János Pintz|last2=Pintz|first2=J.|last3=Szemerédi|first3=E.|author3-link=Endre Szemerédi|title=A lower bound for Heilbronn's problem|journal=[[Journal of the London Mathematical Society]]|volume=25|issue=1|pages=13–24|year=1982|mr=0645860|doi=10.1112/jlms/s2-25.1.13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upper bounds==
Trivially, either by [[Point set triangulation|triangulating]] the [[convex hull]] of the given point set ''S'' or by choosing consecutive triples of points in the sorted order of their ''x''-coordinates, it is possible to show that every point set contains a small triangle, whose area is at most inversely proportional to&amp;nbsp;''n''. {{harvtxt|Roth|1951}} was the first to prove a nontrivial upper bound on &amp;Delta;(''n''), of the form&lt;ref name="r51"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(n)=O\left(\frac{1}{n\sqrt{\log\log n}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The best bound known to date is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(n)\leq\frac{\exp{\left(c\sqrt{\log n}\right)}}{n^{8/7}},&lt;/math&gt;
for some constant ''c'', proven by {{harvtxt|Komlós|Pintz|Szemerédi|1981}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Komlós|first1=J.|author1-link=János Komlós (mathematician)|author2-link=János Pintz|last2=Pintz|first2=J.|last3=Szemerédi|first3=E.|author3-link=Endre Szemerédi|title=On Heilbronn's triangle problem|journal=[[Journal of the London Mathematical Society]]|volume=24|issue=3|pages=385–396|year=1981|mr=0635870|doi=10.1112/jlms/s2-24.3.385}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Araki is the son of the [[University of Kyoto]] physics professor Gentarō Araki, with whom he studied and with whom in 1954 he published his first physics paper. He earned his diploma under [[Hideki Yukawa]] and in 1960 he attained his doctorate at [[Princeton University]] with thesis advisors [[Rudolf Haag]] and [[Arthur Strong Wightman]] (''Hamiltonian formalism and canonical commutation relations in quantum field theory''). He was since 1966 professor at the University of Kyoto, at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences (RIMS), of which he was also the director.

Araki works on [[axiomatic quantum field theory]] and [[statistical mechanics]] in particular on application of operator algebras ([[von Neumann algebra]]s, [[C*-algebra]]s). He already at the beginning of the 1960s at Princeton made important contributions to the "local quantum physics" of Haag and Kastler and also to the scattering theories of Haag and [[David Ruelle]]. He also supplied important contributions in the mathematical theory of operator algebras, classifying type-III factors of von Neumann algebras.&lt;ref&gt;Araki, E.J.

RIMS, Bd.4, 1968, S.585&lt;/ref&gt; Araki originated the concept of relative entropy of states of Von Neumann algebras. In the 1970s he showed the equivalence in [[quantum thermodynamics]] of, on the one hand, the [[KMS state|KMS (Kubo-Martin-Schwinger) condition]] for the characterization of quantum mechanical states in thermodynamic equilibrium with, on the other hand, the variational principle for quantum mechanical spin systems on lattices.&lt;ref&gt;Araki ''On the equivalence of the KMS condition and the variational principle for quantum lattice systems'', Comm.

Bd.52, 1977, S.103-109&lt;/ref&gt; With Yanase he worked on the foundations of [[quantum mechanic]]s (Wigner-Araki-Yanase Theorem, which describes restrictions that conservation laws impose upon the physical measuring process).&lt;ref&gt;Araki, Yanase ''Measurement of quantum mechanical operators'', Physical Review Vol.120, 1960, p.622, Wigner Zeitschrift für Physik Bd.131, 1952, S.101.&lt;/ref&gt; Stated in more precise terms, they proved that an exact measurement of an operator, which additively replaces the operator with a conserved size, is impossible. However, Yanase did prove that the uncertainty of the measurement can be made arbitrarily small, provided that the measuring apparatus is sufficiently large.&lt;ref&gt;Yanase, M.M.

He was the first president of the [[International Association of Mathematical Physics]]. In 2003 he received with [[Oded Schramm]] and [[Elliott Lieb]] the [[Henri Poincaré Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20299">In [[group theory]], more precisely in [[geometric group theory]], a '''hyperbolic group''', also known as a ''word hyperbolic group'' or ''Gromov hyperbolic group'', is a finitely generated [[group (mathematics)|group]] equipped with a [[word metric]] satisfying certain properties abstracted from classical [[hyperbolic geometry]]. The notion of a hyperbolic group was introduced and developed by {{harvs|last=Gromov|year=1987|author-link=Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|txt=yes}}. The inspiration came from various existing mathematical theories: hyperbolic geometry but also low-dimensional topology (in particular the results of [[Max Dehn]] concerning the [[fundamental group]] of a hyperbolic [[Riemann surface]], and more complex phenomena in [[3-manifold|three-dimensional topology]]), and [[combinatorial group theory]]. In a very influential (over 1000 citations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=919829|publisher=AMS}}&lt;/ref&gt;) paper from 1987, Gromov proposed a wide-ranging research program. Ideas and foundational material in the theory of hyperbolic groups also stem from the work of [[George Mostow]], [[William Thurston]], [[James W. Cannon]], [[Eliyahu Rips]], and many others.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a finitely generated group, and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be its [[Cayley graph]] with respect to some finite set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of generators. The set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is endowed with its [[Distance (graph theory)|graph metric]] (in which edges are of length one and the distance between two vertices is the minimal number of edges in a path connecting them) which turns it into a [[length space]]. The group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is then said to be ''hyperbolic'' if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[δ-hyperbolic space|hyperbolic space]] in the sense of Gromov. Shortly, this means that there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that any triangle in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is  &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-thin, as illustrated in the figure on the right (the space is then said to be &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic).

{{ Annotated image | caption=The δ-thin triangle condition

{{Annotation|205|110|&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{Annotation|0|40|&lt;math&gt;B_\delta([x,y])&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{Annotation|150|40|&lt;math&gt;B_\delta([z,x])&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{Annotation|80|135|&lt;math&gt;B_\delta([y,z])&lt;/math&gt;}}
}}

A priori this definition depends on the choice of a finite generating set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. That this is not the case follows from the two following facts:

*the Cayley graphs respective to two finite generating sets are always [[Quasi-isometry|quasi-isometric]] one to the other;
*any geodesic space which is quasi-isometric to a geodesic Gromov-hyperbolic space is itself Gromov-hyperbolic.

Thus we can legitimately speak of a finitely generated group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; being hyperbolic without referring to a generating set. On the other hand, a space which is quasi-isometric to a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic space is itself &lt;math&gt;\delta'&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic for some &lt;math&gt;\delta' &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; but the latter depends on both the original &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and on the quasi-isometry, thus it does not make sense to speak of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; being &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic.

=== Remarks ===

The Svarc--[[John Milnor|Milnor]] lemma{{sfn|Bowditch|2006|Theorem 3.6}} states that if a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acting [[Group action#Types of actions|properly discontinuously]] and with compact quotient (such an action is often called ''geometric'') on a proper length space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; then it is finitely generated, and any Cayley graph for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is quasi-isometric to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus a group is (finitely generated and) hyperbolic if and only if it has a geometric action on a proper hyperbolic space.

If &lt;math&gt;G' \subset G&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup with finite index (i.e. the set &lt;math&gt;G/G'&lt;/math&gt; is finite) then the inclusion induces a quasi-isometry on the vertices of any (locally finite) Cayley graph of &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; into any (ditto) Cayley graph of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; is hyperbolic if and only if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; itself is. More generally if two groups are [[Commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]] then one is hyperbolic if and only if the other is.

== Examples ==

=== Elementary hyperbolic groups ===

The simplest examples of hyperbolic groups are [[finite groups]] (whose Cayley graphs are of finite diameter hence &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic with &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; equal to this diameter).

Another very simple example is given by infinite cyclic group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; (with the generating set &lt;math&gt;\{ 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; triangles are line segments, hence the Cayley graph is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic). It follows also that any group which is [[Virtually cyclic group|virtually cyclic]] (contains a copy of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; of finite index) is also hyperbolic, for example the [[infinite dihedral group]].

Members in this class of groups are often called ''elementary hyperbolic groups'' (the terminology is adapted from that of actions on the hyperbolic plane).

=== Free groups and groups acting on trees ===

Let &lt;math&gt;S = \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be the [[free group]] with generating set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Then the Cayley graph of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a locally finite [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] and hence a 0-hyperbolic space. Thus &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an hyperbolic group.

More generally we see that any group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; which acts properly discontinuously on a locally finite tree (in this context this means exactly that the stabilizers in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of the vertices are finite) is hyperbolic. Indeed, this follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has an invariant subtree on which it acts with compact quotient, and the Svarc—Milnor lemma. Such groups are in fact virtually free (i.e. contain a finitely generated free subgroup of finite index), which gives another proof of their hyperbolicity.

An interesting example is the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt;G = \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)&lt;/math&gt;: it acts on the tree given by the 1-skeleton of the associated [[Modular group#Tessellation of the hyperbolic plane|tessellation of the hyperbolic plane]] and it has a finite index free subgroup (on two generators) of index 6 (for example the set of matrices in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; which reduce to the identity modulo 2 is such a group). Note an interesting feature of this example: it acts properly discontinuously on a hyperbolic space (the [[hyperbolic plane]]) but the action is not cocompact (and indeed &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane).

=== Fuchsian groups ===

{{main article|Fuchsian group}}

Generalising the example of the modular group a [[Fuchsian group]] is a group admitting a properly discontinuous action on the hyperbolic plane (equivalently, a discrete subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;). The hyperbolic plane is a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic space and hence the Svarc—Milnor lemma tells us that cocompact Fuchsian groups are hyperbolic.

Examples of such are the [[fundamental group]]s of [[Surface (topology)#Closed surfaces|closed surfaces]] of negative [[Euler characteristic]]. Indeed, these surfaces can be obtained as quotients of the hyperbolic plane, as implied by the Poincaré—Koebe [[Uniformisation theorem#Geometric classification of surfaces|Uniformisation theorem]].

Another family of examples of cocompact Fuchsian groups is given by [[Triangle group#The hyperbolic case|triangle groups]]: all but finitely many are hyperbolic.

=== Negative curvature ===

Generalising the example of closed surfaces, the fundamental groups of compact [[Riemannian manifold]]s with strictly negative [[sectional curvature]] are hyperbolic. For example, cocompact [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattices]] in the [[orthogonal]] or [[unitary group|unitary]] group of a form of signature &lt;math&gt;(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; are hyperbolic.

A further generalisation is given by groups admitting a geometric action on a [[CAT(k) space]].&lt;ref&gt;for a proof that this includes the previous examples see https://lamington.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/upper-curvature-bounds-and-catk/&lt;/ref&gt; There exists examples which are not commensurable to any of the previous constructions (for instance groups acting geometrically on hyperbolic [[Building (mathematics)|buildings]]).

=== Small cancellation groups ===

{{main article|Small cancellation theory}}

Groups having presentations which satisfy [[Small cancellation theory|small cancellation]] conditions are hyperbolic. This gives a source of examples which do not have a geometric origin as the ones given above. In fact one of the motivations for the initial development of hyperbolic groups was to give a more geometric interpretation of small cancellation.

=== Random groups ===

{{main article|Random group}}

In some sense, "most" finitely presented groups with large defining relations are hyperbolic. For a quantitative statement of what this means see [[Random group]].

=== Non-examples ===

*The simplest example of a group which is not hyperbolic is the [[free abelian group|free rank 2 abelian group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^2&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, it is quasi-isometric to the [[Euclidean plane]] which is easily seen not to be hyperbolic (for example because of the existence of [[Homothetic transformation|homotheties]]).
* More generally, any group which contains &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^2&lt;/math&gt; as a [[subgroup]] is not hyperbolic.{{sfn|Ghys|de la Harpe|1990|loc=Ch. 8, Th. 37}}{{sfn|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|loc=Chapter 3.Γ, Corollary 3.10.}} In particular, [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattices]] in higher rank [[semisimple Lie group]]s and the [[fundamental group]]s ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;−''K'') of nontrivial [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] complements fall into this category and therefore are not hyperbolic. This is also the case for [[mapping class group]]s of closed hyperbolic surfaces.
* The [[Baumslag–Solitar group]]s ''B''(''m'',''n'') and any group that contains a subgroup isomorphic to some ''B''(''m'',''n'') fail to be hyperbolic (since ''B''(1,1) = &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^2&lt;/math&gt;, this generalizes the previous example).
* A non-uniform lattice in a rank 1 simple Lie group is hyperbolic if and only if the group is [[Isogeny|isogenous]] to &lt;math&gt;SL_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; (equivalently the associated symmetric space is the hyperbolic plane). An example of this is given by [[Hyperbolic link|hyperbolic]] [[knot group]]s. Another is the [[Bianchi group]]s, for example &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\sqrt{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==

=== Algebraic properties ===

*Hyperbolic groups satisfy the [[Tits alternative]]: they are either virtually solvable (this possibility is satisfied only by elementary hyperbolic groups) or they have a subgroup isomorphic to a nonabelian free group.
*Non-elementary hyperbolic groups are not [[Simple group|simple]] in a very strong sense: if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is non-elementary hyperbolic then there exists an infinite subgroup &lt;math&gt;H \triangleleft G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; are both infinite.
*It is not known whether there exists an hyperbolic group which is not [[Residually finite group|residually finite]].

=== Geometric properties ===

*Non-elementary (infinite and not virtually cyclic) hyperbolic groups have always exponential [[Growth rate (group theory)|growth rate]] (this is a consequence of the Tits alternative).
*Hyperbolic groups satisfy a linear [[isoperimetric inequality]].{{sfn|Bowditch|2006|loc=(F4) in paragraph 6.11.2}} In fact this is a characterisation of hyperbolicity.

=== Homological properties ===

*Hyperbolic groups are always [[Presentation of a group|finitely presented]]. In fact one can explicitly construct a complex (the [[Rips complex]]) which is [[Contractible space|contractible]] and on which the group acts geometrically.{{sfn|Ghys|de la Harpe|1990|loc=Chapitre 4}} When the group is torsion-free the action is free, showing that the group has finite [[cohomological dimension]].
*In 2002, I. Mineyev showed that hyperbolic groups are exactly those finitely generated groups for which the comparison map between the [[bounded cohomology]] and [[Group cohomology|ordinary cohomology]] is surjective in all degrees, or equivalently, in degree 2.{{sfn|Mineyev|2002}}

=== Algorithmic properties ===

*Hyperbolic groups have a solvable [[word problem for groups|word problem]]. They are [[biautomatic group|biautomatic]] and [[automatic group|automatic]].{{sfn|Charney|1992}} Indeed, they are [[automatic group|strongly geodesically automatic]], that is, there is an automatic structure on the group, where the language accepted by the word acceptor is the set of all geodesic words.
*It was shown in 2010 that hyperbolic groups have a [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] marked isomorphism problem.{{sfn|Dahmani|Guirardel|2011}} It is notable that this means that the isomorphism problem, orbit problems (in particular the conjugacy problem) and Whitehead's problem are all decidable.
*Cannon and Swenson have shown that hyperbolic groups with a 2-sphere at infinity have a natural [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]].{{sfn|Cannon|Swenson|1998}} This is related to [[Cannon's conjecture]].

== Generalisations ==

=== Relatively hyperbolic groups ===

{{main article|Relatively hyperbolic group}}

[[Relatively hyperbolic group]]s are a class generalising hyperbolic groups. ''Very'' roughly{{sfn|Bowditch|2012}} &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is hyperbolic relative to a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; of subgroups if it admits a (''not necessarily cocompact'') properly discontinuous action on a proper hyperbolic space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which is "nice" on the boundary of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and such that the stabilisers in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of points on the boundary are subgroups in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt;. This is interesting when both &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the action of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are not elementary (in particular &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is infinite: for example every group is hyperbolic relatively to itself via its action on a single point!).

Interesting examples in this class include in particular non-uniform lattices in rank 1 semisimple Lie groups, for example fundamental groups of non-compact hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume. Non-examples are lattices in higher-rank Lie groups and mapping class groups.

=== Acylindrically hyperbolic groups ===

An even more general notion is that of an acylindically hyperbolic group.{{sfn|Osin|2016}} Acylindricity of an action of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on a metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a weakening of proper discontinuity of the action.&lt;ref&gt;In some detail: it asks that for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exist &lt;math&gt;R, N &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for every two points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; which are at least &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; apart there are at most &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; elements &lt;math&gt;g \in G&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;d(x, gx) &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(y, gy) &lt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group is said to be acylindrically hyperbolic if it admits a non-elementary acylindrical action on a (''not necessarily proper'') Gromov-hyperbolic space. This notion includes mapping class groups via their actions on [[curve complex]]es. Lattices in higher-rank Lie groups are (still!) not acylindrically hyperbolic.

=== CAT(0) groups ===

In another direction one can weaken the assumption about curvature in the examples above: a ''CAT(0) group'' is a group admitting a geometric action on a [[CAT(0) space]]. This includes [[Space group|Euclidean crystallographic groups]] and uniform lattices in higher-rank Lie groups.

It is not known whether there exists a hyperbolic group which is not CAT(0).&lt;ref&gt;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1141526/are-all-delta-hyperbolic-groups-cat0&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1265">'''Industrial-grade primes''' (the term is apparently due to [[Henri Cohen (number theorist)|Henri Cohen]]&lt;ref&gt;Chris Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=PRP ''The Prime Glossary: probable prime''] at The [[Prime Pages]].&lt;/ref&gt;) are [[integer]]s for which [[primality]] has not been certified (i.e. rigorously proven), but they have undergone [[probable prime]] tests such as the [[Miller-Rabin primality test]], which has a positive, but negligible, failure rate, or the [[Baillie-PSW primality test]], which no composites are known to pass.

Industrial-grade primes are sometimes used instead of certified primes in [[algorithms]] such as [[RSA encryption]], which require the user to generate large [[prime numbers]].  [[Primality test|Certifying the primality]] of large numbers (over 100 digits for instance) is significantly harder than showing they are industrial-grade primes. The latter can be done almost instantly with a [[failure rate]] so low that it is highly unlikely to ever fail in practice. In other words, the number is believed to be prime with very high, but not absolute, confidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">In [[q-analog]] theory, the '''Jackson integral''' [[series (mathematics)|series]]  in the theory of [[special functions]] that expresses the operation inverse to [[q-differentiation]].

The Jackson integral was introduced by [[Frank Hilton Jackson]]. For methods of numerical evaluation, see {{harvtxt|Exton|1983}}.

== Definition ==
Let ''f''(''x'') be a function of a real variable ''x''. The Jackson integral of ''f'' is defined by the following series expansion:

: &lt;math&gt; \int f(x)\,{\rm d}_q x = (1-q)\,x\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}q^k f(q^k x). &lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if ''g''(''x'') is another function and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;''g'' denotes its ''q''-derivative, we can formally write

: &lt;math&gt; \int f(x)\,D_q g\,{\rm d}_q x = (1-q)\,x\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}q^k f(q^k x)\,D_q g(q^k x) = (1-q)\,x\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}q^k f(q^k x)\tfrac{g(q^{k}x)-g(q^{k+1}x)}{(1-q)q^k x}, &lt;/math&gt; or

: &lt;math&gt; \int f(x)\,{\rm d}_q g(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(q^k x)\cdot(g(q^{k}x)-g(q^{k+1}x)), &lt;/math&gt;

giving a ''q''-analogue of the [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral]].

== Jackson integral as q-antiderivative ==

Just as the ordinary [[antiderivative]] of a [[continuous function]] can be represented by its [[Riemann integral]], it is possible to show that the Jackson integral gives a unique ''q''-antiderivative 
within a certain class of functions, see,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kempf|first1=A|title=Algebraic ''q''-Integration and Fourier Theory on Quantum and Braided Spaces|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=35|issue=12|pages=6802–6837|last2=Majid|first2=Shahn|year=1994|arxiv=hep-th/9402037|bibcode=1994JMP....35.6802K|doi=10.1063/1.530644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theorem ===
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;q&lt;1.&lt;/math&gt;  If &lt;math&gt;|f(x)x^\alpha|&lt;/math&gt; is bounded on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,A)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;0\leq\alpha&lt;1, &lt;/math&gt; then the Jackson integral converges to a function &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[0,A)&lt;/math&gt; which is a ''q''-antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x).&lt;/math&gt; Moreover, &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;F(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; and is a unique antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; in this class of functions.&lt;ref&gt;Kac-Cheung, Theorem 19.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was born in [[Lewisham]] in [[Kent]] on 5 November 1848 the son of the eminent astronomer  [[James Glaisher]] and his wife, [[Cecilia Glaisher|Cecilia Louisa Belville]]. His mother was a noted photographer.&lt;ref name="www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Glaisher.html | title=Glaisher biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] from 1858. He became somewhat of a school celebrity in 1861 when he made two hot-air balloon ascents with his father to study the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk"/&gt;

He won a Campden Exhibition Scholarship allowing him to study at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was [[second wrangler]] in 1871&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|GLSR866JW|James Whitbread Lee Glaisher}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was made a Fellow of the College. Influential in his time on teaching at the [[University of Cambridge]], he is now remembered mostly for work in [[number theory]] that anticipated later interest in the detailed properties of [[modular form]]s. He published widely over other fields of mathematics.

Glaisher was elected FRS in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Glaisher, James Whitbread Lee|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=686|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA686}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the editor-in-chief of ''[[Messenger of Mathematics]]''. He was also the 'tutor' of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (tutor being a non-academic role in Cambridge University).  He was president of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] 1886–1888 and 1901–1903.&lt;ref name="obit_mnras"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hunt1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary Notices: Fellows:- Glaisher, James Whitbread Lee|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=February 1929|volume=89|issue=4|page=300|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/MNRAS/0089//0000307.000.html?high=512695a29c29710|bibcode = 1929MNRAS..89..300.|doi=10.1093/mnras/89.4.300}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[George Biddell Airy]] retired as Astronomer Royal in 1881 it is said that Glaisher was offered the post but declined.&lt;ref name="www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk"/&gt;

He did not marry and lived in a set of rooms at Trinity College. He died there on 7 December 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=[[The Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a keen cyclist but preferred his [[penny-farthing]] to the newer "safety" bicycles. He was President of Cambridge University Cycling Club 1882 to 1885. He was a keen collector of [[Delftware]] and the university indulged him by allowing him a room of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] to house his personal collection.&lt;ref name="www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk"/&gt; He also amassed a collection of some 1,600 valentines, which he bequeathed to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;R. Virag. ''Valentines: Highlights from the Collection at The Fitzwilliam Museum.'' Cambridge: 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
*Honorary doctorate (DSc) from the [[University of Dublin]] in 1892
*Honorary doctorate (DSc) from [[Manchester University]] in 1902
*Winner of the [[London Mathematical Society]]'s [[De Morgan Medal]] in 1908
*Winner of the Royal Society's [[Sylvester Medal]] in 1913

==Publications==

Glaisher published many papers and was editor and contributor to both the ''Messenger of Mathematics'' and the ''Quarterly Journal of Mathematics''.

'''Joachim Cuntz''' (born 28 September 1948 in [[Mannheim]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]], currently a professor at the [[University of Münster]].

== Work ==
Joachim Cuntz has made fundamental contributions to the area of [[C*-algebras]] and to the field of [[noncommutative geometry]] in the sense of [[Alain Connes]]. He initiated the analysis of the structure of simple C*-algebras and introduced new methods and examples, including the [[Cuntz algebra]]s and the [[Cuntz semigroup]]. He was one of the first to apply [[operator K-theory|K-theory]] to noncommutative operator algebras and contributed to the development of that theory. In collaboration with [[Daniel Quillen]], he developed a new approach to [[cyclic cohomology]] and proved the excision property of periodic cyclic theory. In recent years, he has been working mainly on C*-algebras that are related to structures from [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Ralf Meyer |url=http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/u/cuntz/cuntz.html |title=Prof. Dr. Joachim Cuntz |publisher=Ath.uni-muenster.de |date=2012-04-17 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MathGen&gt;{{MathGenealogy|21760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Kaye''' (27 December 1783, [[Hammersmith]] – 18 February 1853, [[Riseholme, Lincolnshire]]) was an English churchman.

==Life==
He was born the only son of Abraham Kaye in Hammersmith, London and educated at the school of Sir [[Charles Burney (scholar)|Charles Burney]] in Hammersmith and then Greenwich. He entered [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] and graduated [[Senior wrangler]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=KY800J|name=Kaye, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 21st Master of [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] from 1814 to 1830,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/people/prevmaster.html Christ's College - People&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026024819/http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/people/prevmaster.html |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University]] in 1814,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/v-c/vicechancellors.html Vice-Chancellor's Office: Cambridge Vice-Chancellors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221013506/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/v-c/vicechancellors.html |date=2008-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bishop of Bristol]] from 1820 to 1827 and [[Bishop of Lincoln]] from 1827 until his death. He reformed the educational requirements for the Anglican clergy and attacked the [[Tractarians]] for betraying the [[English Reformation]].

He was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1811.

He is buried in [[Lincoln Cathedral]] beneath a recumbent effigy by [[Richard Westmacott (the younger)|Richard Westmacott]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1851, Rupert Gunnis&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[recreational mathematics]] a '''juggler sequence''' is an [[integer sequence]] that starts with a positive integer ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with each subsequent term in the sequence defined by the [[recurrence relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{k+1}= \begin{cases}
 \left \lfloor a_k^{\frac{1}{2}} \right \rfloor,  &amp; \mbox{if } a_k \mbox{ is even} \\
 \\
 \left \lfloor a_k^{\frac{3}{2}} \right \rfloor,  &amp; \mbox{if } a_k \mbox{ is odd}.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==Background==
Juggler sequences were publicised by American mathematician and author [[Clifford A. Pickover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pickover |first=Clifford A. |authorlink=Clifford A. Pickover |date=1992 |title=Computers and the Imagination |publisher=St. Martin's Press |chapter=Chapter 40 |isbn=978-0-312-08343-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is derived from the rising and falling nature of the sequences, like balls in the hands of a [[juggler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pickover |first=Clifford A. |authorlink=Clifford A. Pickover |date=2002 |title=The Mathematics of Oz: Mental Gymnastics from Beyond the Edge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Chapter 45: Juggler Numbers |pages=102–106 |isbn=978-0-521-01678-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the juggler sequence starting with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 is

:&lt;math&gt;a_1= \lfloor 3^\frac{3}{2} \rfloor = \lfloor 5.196\dots \rfloor = 5, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_2= \lfloor 5^\frac{3}{2} \rfloor = \lfloor 11.180\dots \rfloor = 11, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_3= \lfloor 11^\frac{3}{2} \rfloor = \lfloor 36.482\dots \rfloor = 36, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_4= \lfloor 36^\frac{1}{2} \rfloor = \lfloor 6 \rfloor = 6, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_5= \lfloor 6^\frac{1}{2} \rfloor = \lfloor 2.449\dots \rfloor = 2, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_6= \lfloor 2^\frac{1}{2} \rfloor = \lfloor 1.414\dots \rfloor = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

If a juggler sequence reaches 1, then all subsequent terms are equal to 1. It is conjectured that all juggler sequences eventually reach 1. This conjecture has been verified for initial terms up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Juggler Sequence |urlname=JugglerSequence}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has not been proved. Juggler sequences therefore present a problem that is similar to the [[Collatz conjecture]], about which [[Paul Erdős]] stated that "mathematics is not yet ready for such problems".

For a given initial term ''n'', one defines ''l''(''n'') to be the number of steps which the juggler sequence starting at ''n'' takes to first reach 1, and ''h''(''n'') to be the maximum value in the juggler sequence starting at ''n''. For small values of ''n'' we have:

Juggler sequences can reach very large values before descending to 1. For example, the juggler sequence starting at ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 37 reaches a maximum value of 24906114455136. Harry J. Smith has determined that the juggler sequence starting at ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 48443 reaches a maximum value at ''a''&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; with 972,463 digits, before reaching 1 at ''a''&lt;sub&gt;157&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027155431/http://geocities.com/hjsmithh/Juggler/Juggle3L.html Letter from Harry J.

[[File:Shifted square tiling.svg|thumb|160px|In this tiling of the plane by congruent squares, the green and violet squares meet edge-to-edge as do the blue and orange squares.]]
In geometry, '''Keller's conjecture''' is the conjecture that in any [[Tessellation|tiling]] of [[Euclidean space]] by identical [[hypercube]]s there are two cubes that meet face to face. For instance, as shown in the illustration, in any tiling of the plane by identical squares, some two squares must meet edge to edge.

This conjecture was introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Keller|first=Ott-Heinrich|authorlink=Ott-Heinrich Keller|year=1930}}, after whom it is named. It was shown to be true in dimensions at most 6 by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Oskar Perron|last=Perron|year1=1940a|year2=1940b}}. However, for higher dimensions it is false, as was shown in dimensions at least 10 by {{harvs|txt|last=Lagarias|author1-link=Jeffrey Lagarias|author2-link=Peter Shor|last2=Shor|year= 1992}} and in dimensions at least 8 by {{harvtxt|Mackey|2002}}. These disproofs used a reformulation of the problem in terms of the [[clique number]] of certain graphs now known as '''Keller graphs'''. Although this graph-theoretic version of the conjecture is now resolved for all dimensions, Keller's original cube-tiling conjecture remains open in dimension 7.

The related [[Hajós's theorem|Minkowski lattice cube-tiling conjecture]] states that, whenever a tiling of space by identical cubes has the additional property that the cube centers form a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]], some cubes must meet face to face. It was proved by [[György Hajós]] in 1942.

{{harvtxt|Szabó|1993}}, {{harvtxt|Shor|2004}}, and {{harvtxt|Zong|2005}} give surveys of work on Keller's conjecture and related problems.

==Definitions==
A family of [[closed set]]s called ''tiles'' forms a [[tessellation]] or tiling of a Euclidean space if their union is the whole space and every two distinct sets in the family have disjoint interiors. A tiling is said to be ''monohedral'' if all of the tiles are congruent to each other. Keller's conjecture concerns monohedral tilings in which all of the tiles are [[hypercube]]s of the same dimension as the space. As {{harvtxt|Szabó|1986}} formulates the problem, a ''cube tiling'' is a tiling by congruent hypercubes in which the tiles are additionally required to all be [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] of each other, without any rotation, or equivalently to have all of their sides parallel to the coordinate axes of the space. Not every tiling by congruent cubes has this property: for instance, three-dimensional space may be tiled by two-dimensional sheets of cubes that are twisted at arbitrary angles with respect to each other. {{harvtxt|Shor|2004}} instead defines a cube tiling to be any tiling of space by congruent hypercubes, and states without proof that the assumption that cubes are axis-parallel can be added without loss of generality.

An ''n''-dimensional hypercube has 2''n'' faces of dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, that are themselves hypercubes; for instance, a square has four edges, and a three-dimensional cube has six square faces. Two tiles in a cube tiling (defined in either of the above ways) meet ''face-to-face'' if there is an (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional hypercube that is a face of both of them. Keller's conjecture is the statement that every cube tiling has at least one pair of tiles that meet face-to-face in this way.

The original version of the conjecture stated by Keller was for a stronger statement, that every cube tiling has a column of cubes all meeting face to face. As with the weaker statement more commonly studied in subsequent research, this is true for dimensions up to six, false for dimensions eight or greater, and remains open for seven dimensions {{harvs|last1=Łysakowska|last2=Przesławski|year1=2008|year2=2011}}

[[File:Academ Periodic tiling by squares of two different sizes.svg|thumb|The [[Pythagorean tiling]] shows that unequal squares can tile the plane without meeting edge-to-edge.]]
It is a necessary part of the conjecture that the cubes in the tiling all be congruent to each other, for if similar but not congruent cubes are allowed then the [[Pythagorean tiling]] would form a trivial counterexample in two dimensions.

==Group-theoretic reformulation==
The disproof of Keller's conjecture, for sufficiently high dimensions, has progressed through a sequence of reductions that transform it from a problem in the geometry of tilings into a problem in [[group theory]], and from there into a problem in [[graph theory]].

{{harvtxt|Hajós|1949}} first reformulated Keller's conjecture in terms of factorizations of [[abelian group]]s. He shows that, if there is a counterexample to the conjecture, then it can be assumed to be a [[periodic tiling]] of cubes with an integer side length and integer vertex positions; thus, in studying the conjecture, it is sufficient to consider tilings of this special form. In this case, the group of integer translations, modulo the translations that preserve the tiling, forms an abelian group, and certain elements of this group correspond to the positions of the tiles. Hajós defines a family of subsets ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of an abelian group to be a ''factorization'' if each element of the group has a unique expression as a sum ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;..., where each ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' belongs to ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. With this definition, Hajós' reformulated conjecture is that, whenever an Abelian group has a factorization in which the first set ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; may be arbitrary but each subsequent set ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; takes the special form {0,&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;2''g''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;3''g''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;(''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}, then at least one of the elements ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' must belong to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[sumset|difference set]] of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with itself).

{{harvtxt|Szabó|1986}} showed that any tiling that forms a counterexample to the conjecture can be assumed to have an even more special form: the cubes have side length a power of two and integer vertex coordinates, and the tiling is periodic with period twice the side length of the cubes in each coordinate direction. Based on this geometric simplification, he also simplified Hajós' group-theoretic formulation, showing that it is sufficient to consider abelian groups that are the direct sums of [[cyclic group]]s of order four, and with each ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

==Keller graphs==
[[File:Keller-labeled Clebsch.svg|thumb|240px|The Keller graph of dimension two, isomorphic to the [[Clebsch graph]].]]
{{harvtxt|Corrádi|Szabó|1990}} reformulated Szabó's result as a condition about the existence of a large [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]] in a certain family of graphs, which subsequently became known as the '''Keller graphs'''. More precisely, the vertices of the Keller graph of dimension ''n'' are the 4&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; elements (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) where each ''m'' is 0, 1, 2, or 3. Two vertices are joined by an edge if they differ in at least two coordinates and differ by exactly two in at least one coordinate. Corrádi and Szabó showed that the [[maximum clique]] in this graph has size at most 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and that if there is a clique of this size then Keller's conjecture is false. Given such a clique, one can form a covering of space by cubes of side two whose centers have coordinates that, when taken modulo four, are vertices of the clique. The condition that any two vertices of the clique have a coordinate that differs by two implies that cubes corresponding to these vertices do not overlap. The condition that the clique has size 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; implies that the cubes within any period of the tiling have the same total volume as the period itself. Together with the fact that they don't overlap, this implies that the cubes placed in this way tile space. However, the condition that any two clique vertices differ in at least two coordinates implies that no two cubes have a face in common.

{{harvs|txt|last=Lagarias|last2=Shor|year= 1992}} disproved Keller's conjecture by [[Clique problem|finding a clique]] of size 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; in the Keller graph of dimension 10. This clique leads to a non-face-to-face tiling in dimension 10, and copies of it can be stacked (offset by half a unit in each coordinate direction) to produce non-face-to-face tilings in any higher dimension. Similarly, {{harvtxt|Mackey|2002}} reduced the dimension in which a counterexample to the conjecture is known by finding a clique of size 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; in the Keller graph of dimension eight.

Finally, {{harvtxt|Debroni|Eblen|Langston|Shor|2011}} showed that  the Keller graph of dimension seven has a maximum clique of size 124&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp; 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Because this is less than 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, the graph-theoretic version of Keller's conjecture is true in seven dimensions. However, the translation from cube tilings to graph theory can change the dimension of the problem, so this result doesn't settle the geometric version of the conjecture in seven dimensions.

The sizes of the maximum cliques in the smaller Keller graphs of dimensions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are, respectively, 2, 5, 12, 28, and 60. The Keller graphs of dimensions 4, 5, and 6 have been included in the set of "DIMACS challenge graphs" frequently used as a [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] for [[Clique problem|clique-finding algorithms]] {{harv|Johnson|Trick|1996}}.

==Related problems==
As {{harvtxt|Szabó|1993}} describes, [[Hermann Minkowski]] was led to a special case of the cube-tiling conjecture from a problem in [[diophantine approximation]]. One consequence of [[Minkowski's theorem]] is that any [[lattice (group)|lattice]] (normalized to have [[determinant]] one) must contain a nonzero point whose [[Chebyshev distance]] to the origin is at most one. The lattices that do not contain a nonzero point with Chebyshev distance strictly less than one are called critical, and the points of a critical lattice form the centers of the cubes in a cube tiling. Minkowski conjectured in 1900 that, whenever a cube tiling has its cubes centered at lattice points in this way, it must contain two cubes that meet face to face. If this is true, then (because of the symmetries of the lattice) each cube in the tiling must be part of a column of cubes, and the cross-sections of these columns form a cube tiling of one smaller dimension. Reasoning in this way, Minkowski showed that (assuming the truth of his conjecture) every critical lattice has a basis that can be expressed as a [[triangular matrix]], with ones on its main diagonal and numbers less than one away from the diagonal. [[György Hajós]] proved Minkowski's conjecture in 1942 using [[Hajós's theorem]] on factorizations of abelian groups, a similar group-theoretic method to the one that he would later apply to Keller's more general conjecture.

Keller's conjecture is a variant of Minkowski's conjecture in which the condition that the cube centers form a lattice is relaxed. A second related conjecture, made by Furtwängler in 1936, instead relaxes the condition that the cubes form a tiling. Furtwängler asked whether a system of cubes centered on lattice points, forming a ''k''-fold covering of space (that is, all but a measure-zero subset of the points in the space must be interior to exactly ''k'' cubes) must necessarily have two cubes meeting face to face. Furtwängler's conjecture is true for two- and three-dimensional space, but Hajós found a four-dimensional counterexample in 1938. {{harvtxt|Robinson|1979}} characterized the combinations of ''k'' and the dimension ''n'' that permit a counterexample. Additionally, combining both Furtwängler's and Keller's conjectures, Robinson showed that ''k''-fold square coverings of the Euclidean plane must include two squares that meet edge to edge. However, for every ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 and every ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 there is a ''k''-fold tiling of ''n''-dimensional space by cubes with no shared faces {{harv|Szabó|1982}}.

Once counterexamples to Keller's conjecture became known, it became of interest to ask for the maximum dimension of a shared face that can be guaranteed to exist in a cube tiling. When the dimension ''n'' is at most six, this maximum dimension is just ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, by Perron's proof of Keller's conjecture for small dimensions, and when ''n'' is at least eight, then this maximum dimension is at most ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2. {{harvtxt|Lagarias|Shor|1994}} showed more strongly that it is at most ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;{{radic|''n''}}/3.

{{harvtxt|Iosevich|Pedersen|1998}} and {{harvtxt|Lagarias|Reeds|Wang|2000}} found close connections between cube tilings and the [[spectral theory]] of [[square-integrable function]]s on the cube.

{{harvtxt|Dutour Sikirić|Itoh|Poyarkov|2007}} use cliques in the Keller graphs that are [[maximal clique|maximal]] but not maximum to study packings of cubes into space that cannot be extended by adding any additional cubes.

In 1975, Ludwig Danzer and independently [[Branko Grünbaum]] and [[G. C. Shephard]] found a tiling of three-dimensional space by [[parallelepiped]]s with 60° and 120° face angles in which no two parallelepipeds share a face; see {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|Shephard|1980}}.

The '''LTPP International Data Analysis Contest''' or the '''LTPP Data Analysis Contest''' is an annual international [[data analysis]] contest held by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and [[Federal Highway Administration]]. As the name suggests, the participants are supposed to use the [[LTPP]] data in their analysis.&lt;ref name="Nehme 2016-09-29"/&gt; The winners of this data analysis contest are announced in the early January during the [[Transportation Research Board]] annual meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.asce.org/transportation-and-development/news/20160122-tanddi-announces-winners-of-long-term-pavement-performance-ltpp-international-data-analysis-contest/|title = T&amp;DI ANNOUNCES WINNERS OF LONG-TERM PAVEMENT PERFORMANCE (LTPP) INTERNATIONAL DATA ANALYSIS CONTEST |publisher = ASCE |access-date = Nov 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.asce.org/transportation-and-development/news/20180118-winners-of-2016-17-ltpp-contest-announced/

==History==
The [[LTPP]] database contains the data of more than 2500 road sections across the [[US]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web ||date = May 26, 2016 |url = https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/long-term-pavement-performance-ltpp-data
 |title = Data.Gov:Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP)|access-date = November 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FHWA]] and [[ASCE]] launched a joint effort to encourage researchers around the world to use the LTPP data. The contest was first introduced in 1998 by the [[Transportation and Development Institute]] (T&amp;DI) of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and the [[LTPP]] of [[FHWA]].&lt;ref name="Nehme 2016-09-29"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.acpa.org/6289-2/|title = FHWA Announces LTPP Data Analysis Contest |publisher = American Concrete Pavement Association |access-date = Nov 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the contest is to encourage consultants, academics and data scientists around the world to use the [[LTPP]] database for generating knowledge about the behaviour of [[Pavement (material)|pavement]]s and roads.

==Categories==
The LTPP data analysis contest has four different categories:&lt;ref name="Nehme 2016-09-29"/&gt;
* Undergraduate Student Category
* Graduate Category

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2268">''Not to be confused with an [[imaginary number]].

A '''mythical number''' is a [[number]] used and accepted as deriving from [[science|scientific]] investigation and/or careful selection, but whose origin is unknown and whose basis is unsubstantiated. An example is the number 48 billion, which has often been accepted as the number of dollars per year of identity theft. This number "has appeared in hundreds of news stories, including a New York Times piece"&lt;ref&gt;Shafer,  [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2006/06/the_ongoing_vitality_of_mythical_numbers.html The (Ongoing) Vitality of Mythical Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that it has been shown repeatedly to be highly inaccurate. The term was coined in 1971 by [[Max Singer]], one of the founders of the [[Hudson Institute]].

The origins of such numbers are akin to those of [[urban legend]]s and may include (among others):
* misinterpretation of examples 
* extrapolation from apparently similar fields
* especially successful [[prank]]s 
* comical results
* guess-estimates by public officials 
* deliberate misinformation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12904">{{redirect-distinguish|Möbius transform|Möbius transformation}}
In [[mathematics]], the classic '''Möbius inversion formula''' was introduced into [[number theory]] on 1832 by [[August Ferdinand Möbius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Möbius|1832|pp=105-123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large generalization of this formula applies to summation over an arbitrary [[Locally finite poset|locally finite partially ordered set]], with Möbius' classical formula applying to the set of the natural numbers ordered by divisibility: see [[incidence algebra]].

==Statement of the formula==
The classic version states that if {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|f}} are [[arithmetic function]]s satisfying

: &lt;math&gt;g(n)=\sum_{d\,\mid \,n}f(d)\quad\text{for every integer }n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=\sum_{d\,\mid\, n}\mu(d)g\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)\quad\text{for every integer }n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|μ}} is the [[Möbius function]] and the sums extend over all positive [[divisor]]s {{mvar|d}} of {{mvar|n}}. In effect, the original {{math|''f''(''n'')}} can be determined given {{math|''g''(''n'')}} by using the inversion formula. The two sequences are said to be '''Möbius transforms''' of each other.

The formula is also correct if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are functions from the positive integers into some [[abelian group]] (viewed as a {{math|ℤ}}-[[module (mathematics)|module]]).

In the language of [[Dirichlet convolution]]s, the first formula may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;g=f*\mathit{1}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∗}} denotes the Dirichlet convolution, and {{math|''1''}} is the [[constant function]] {{math|''1''(''n'') {{=}} 1}}. The second formula is then written as

:&lt;math&gt;f=\mu * g.&lt;/math&gt;

Many specific examples are given in the article on [[multiplicative function]]s.

The theorem follows because {{math|∗}} is (commutative and) associative, and {{math|''1'' ∗ ''μ'' {{=}} ''ε''}}, where {{mvar|ε}} is the identity function for the Dirichlet convolution, taking values {{math|''ε''(1) {{=}} 1}}, {{math|''ε''(''n'') {{=}} 0}} for all {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\mu * g = \mu * (\mathit{1} * f) = (\mu * \mathit{1}) * f = \varepsilon * f = f&lt;/math&gt;.

==Series relations==
Let

:&lt;math&gt;a_n=\sum_{d\mid n} b_d&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;b_n=\sum_{d\mid n} \mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)a_d&lt;/math&gt;

is its transform. The transforms are related by means of series: the [[Lambert series]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n x^n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \frac{x^n}{1-x^n}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Dirichlet series]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {a_n} {n^s} = \zeta(s)\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{b_n}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ζ''(''s'')}} is the [[Riemann zeta function]].

==Repeated transformations==
Given an arithmetic function, one can generate a bi-infinite sequence of other arithmetic functions by repeatedly applying the first summation. 

For example, if one starts with [[Euler's totient function]] {{mvar|φ}}, and repeatedly applies the transformation process, one obtains:

#{{mvar|φ}} the totient function
#{{math|''φ'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''I''}}, where {{math|''I''(''n'') {{=}} ''n''}} is the [[identity function]]
#{{math|''I'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''σ''}}, the [[divisor function]]

If the starting function is the Möbius function itself, the list of functions is:
#{{mvar|μ}}, the Möbius function
#{{math|''μ'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''ε''}} where
#::&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(n) = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \mbox{if }n=1 \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{if }n&gt;1 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
#:is the [[unit function]]
#{{math|''ε'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''1''}}, the [[constant function]]
#{{math|''1'' ∗ ''1'' {{=}} ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} d {{=}} ''τ''}}, where {{math|d {{=}} ''τ''}} is the number of divisors of {{mvar|n}}, (see [[divisor function]]).

Both of these lists of functions extend infinitely in both directions.  The Möbius inversion formula enables these lists to be traversed backwards.

As an example the sequence starting with {{mvar|φ}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;f_n =
  \begin{cases}
   \underbrace{\mu * \ldots * \mu}_{-n \text{ factors}} * \varphi &amp; \text{if } n &lt; 0 \\[8px]
   \varphi &amp; \text{if } n = 0 \\[8px]
   \varphi * \underbrace{\mathit{1}* \ldots * \mathit{1}}_{n \text{ factors}} &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 0
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The generated sequences can perhaps be more easily understood by considering the corresponding [[Dirichlet series]]: each repeated application of the transform corresponds to multiplication by the [[Riemann zeta function]].

==Generalizations==
A related inversion formula more useful in [[combinatorics]] is as follows: suppose {{math|''F''(''x'')}} and {{math|''G''(''x'')}} are [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]s defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[1,∞)}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;G(x) = \sum_{1 \le n \le x}F\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)\quad\mbox{ for all }x\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \sum_{1 \le n \le x}\mu(n)G\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)\quad\mbox{ for all }x\ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the sums extend over all positive integers {{mvar|n}} which are less than or equal to {{mvar|x}}.

This in turn is a special case of a more general form. If {{math|''α''(''n'')}} is an [[arithmetic function]] possessing a [[Dirichlet inverse]] {{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')}}, then if one defines

:&lt;math&gt;G(x) = \sum_{1 \le n \le x}\alpha (n) F\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)\quad\mbox{ for all }x\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \sum_{1 \le n \le x}\alpha^{-1}(n)G\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)\quad\mbox{ for all }x\ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The previous formula arises in the special case of the constant function {{math|''α''(''n'') {{=}} 1}}, whose [[Dirichlet inverse]] is {{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') {{=}} ''μ''(''n'')}}.

A particular application of the first of these extensions arises if we have (complex-valued) functions {{math|''f''(''n'')}} and {{math|''g''(''n'')}} defined on the positive integers, with

:&lt;math&gt;g(n) = \sum_{1 \le m \le n}f\left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{m}\right\rfloor\right)\quad\mbox{ for all } n\ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

By defining {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(⌊''x''⌋)}} and {{math|''G''(''x'') {{=}} ''g''(⌊''x''⌋)}}, we deduce that

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = \sum_{1 \le m \le n}\mu(m)g\left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{m}\right\rfloor\right)\quad\mbox{ for all } n\ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

A simple example of the use of this formula is counting the number of [[reduced fraction]]s {{math|0 &lt; {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} &lt; 1}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are coprime and {{math|''b'' ≤ ''n''}}. If we let {{math|''f''(''n'')}} be this number, then {{math|''g''(''n'')}} is the total number of fractions {{math|0 &lt; {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} &lt; 1}} with {{math|''b'' ≤ ''n''}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are not necessarily coprime.  (This is because every fraction {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} with {{math|gcd(''a'',''b'') {{=}} ''d''}} and {{math|''b'' ≤ ''n''}} can be reduced to the fraction {{math|{{sfrac|''a''/''d''|''b''/''d''}}}} with {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''d''}} ≤ {{sfrac|''n''|''d''}}}}, and vice versa.)  Here it is straightforward to determine {{math|''g''(''n'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''n''(''n'' − 1)|2}}}}, but {{math|''f''(''n'')}} is harder to compute.

Another inversion formula is (where we assume that the series involved are absolutely convergent):

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{f(mx)}{m^s}\quad\mbox{ for all } x\ge 1\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
f(x) = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \mu(m)\frac{g(mx)}{m^s}\quad\mbox{ for all } x\ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

As above, this generalises to the case where {{math|''α''(''n'')}} is an arithmetic function possessing a Dirichlet inverse {{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \alpha(m)\frac{f(mx)}{m^s}\quad\mbox{ for all } x\ge 1\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
f(x) = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \alpha^{-1}(m)\frac{g(mx)}{m^s}\quad\mbox{ for all } x\ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Multiplicative notation==
As Möbius inversion applies to any abelian group, it makes no difference whether the group operation is written as addition or as multiplication. This gives rise to the following notational variant of the inversion formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{if } F(n) = \prod_{d|n} f(d),\mbox{ then } f(n) = \prod_{d|n} F\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)^{\mu(d)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proofs of generalizations==

The first generalization can be proved as follows.  We use Iverson's convention that [condition] is the indicator function of the condition, being 1 if the condition is true and 0 if false.  We use the result that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d|n}\mu(d)=i(n),&lt;/math&gt;
that is, {{math|''1'' ∗ ''μ'' {{=}} ''i''}}.

We have the following:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{1\le n\le x}\mu(n)g\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)
 &amp;= \sum_{1\le n\le x} \mu(n) \sum_{1\le m\le \frac{x}{n}} f\left(\frac{x}{mn}\right)\\
 &amp;= \sum_{1\le n\le x} \mu(n) \sum_{1\le m\le \frac{x}{n}} \sum_{1\le r\le x} [r=mn] f\left(\frac{x}{r}\right)\\
 &amp;= \sum_{1\le r\le x} f\left(\frac{x}{r}\right) \sum_{1\le n\le x} \mu(n) \sum_{1\le m\le \frac{x}{n}} \left[m=\frac{r}{n}\right] \qquad\text{rearranging the summation order}\\
 &amp;= \sum_{1\le r\le x} f\left(\frac{x}{r}\right) \sum_{n|r} \mu(n) \\
 &amp;= \sum_{1\le r\le x} f\left(\frac{x}{r}\right) i(r) \\
 &amp;= f(x) \qquad\text{since }i(r)=0\text{ except when }r=1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The proof in the more general case where {{math|''α''(''n'')}} replaces 1 is essentially identical, as is the second generalisation.

==On posets==
{{See also|Incidence algebra}}For a poset {{mvar|P}}, a set endowed with a partial order relation &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;, define the Möbius function &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; of {{mvar|P}} recursively by 

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(s,s) = 1 \text{ for } s \in P, \qquad \mu(s,u) = - \sum_{s \leq t &lt; u} \mu(s,t), \quad \text{ for } s &lt; u \text{ in } P.&lt;/math&gt;

(Here one assumes the summations are finite.) Then for &lt;math&gt;f,g: P \to K&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|K}} is a field, we have 

:&lt;math&gt;g(t) = \sum_{s \leq t} f(s) \qquad \text{ for all } t \in P&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if 

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \sum_{s \leq t} g(s)\mu(s,t) \qquad \text{ for all }t \in P.&lt;/math&gt;

(See Stanley's ''Enumerative Combinatorics'', Vol 1, Section 3.7.)

==Contributions of Weisner, Hall, and Rota==
{{Quotation|
The statement of the general Möbius inversion formula [for partially ordered sets] was first given independently by [[Louis Weisner|Weisner]] (1935) and [[Philip Hall]] (1936); both authors were motivated by group theory problems. Neither author seems to have been aware of the combinatorial implications of his work and neither developed the theory of Möbius functions. In a fundamental paper on Möbius functions, [[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]] showed the importance of this theory in combinatorial mathematics and gave a deep treatment of it. He noted the relation between such topics as inclusion-exclusion, classical number theoretic Möbius inversion, coloring problems and flows in networks. Since then, under the strong influence of Rota, the theory of Möbius inversion and related topics has become an active area of combinatorics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bender|Goldman|1975|pp=789–803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7807">In [[mathematics]], '''Thurston's classification theorem''' characterizes [[homeomorphism]]s of a [[compact surface|compact orientable surface]].  [[William Thurston]]'s theorem completes the work initiated by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|first=Jakob |last=Nielsen|year=1944}}.

Given a homeomorphism ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''S'', there is a map ''g'' [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopic]] to ''f'' such that at least one of the following holds:
* ''g'' is periodic, i.e. some power of ''g'' is the identity;
* ''g'' preserves some finite union of disjoint simple closed curves on ''S'' (in this case, ''g'' is called ''reducible''); or
* ''g'' is [[pseudo-Anosov map|pseudo-Anosov]].

The case where ''S'' is a [[torus]] (i.e., a surface whose [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] is one) is handled separately (see [[torus bundle]]) and was known before Thurston's work. If the genus of ''S'' is two or greater, then ''S'' is naturally [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]], and the tools of [[Teichmüller space|Teichmüller theory]] become useful.  In what follows, we assume ''S'' has genus at least two, as this is the case Thurston considered. (Note, however, that the cases where ''S'' has [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] or is not [[orientable]] are definitely still of interest.)

The three types in this classification are '''not''' mutually exclusive, though a ''pseudo-Anosov'' homeomorphism is never ''periodic'' or ''reducible''.  A ''reducible'' homeomorphism ''g'' can be further analyzed by cutting the surface along the preserved union of simple closed curves ''Γ''.  Each of the resulting compact surfaces ''with [[manifold|boundary]]'' is acted upon by some power (i.e. [[function composition|iterated composition]]) of ''g'', and the classification can again be applied to this homeomorphism.

==The mapping class group for surfaces of higher genus==
Thurston's classification applies to homeomorphisms of orientable surfaces of genus ≥ 2, but the type of a homeomorphism only depends on its associated element of the [[mapping class group]] ''Mod(S)''.  In fact, the proof of the classification theorem leads to a [[canonical form|canonical]] representative of each mapping class with good geometric properties.  For example:
* When ''g'' is periodic, there is an element of its mapping class that is an [[isometry]] of a [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic structure]] on ''S''.
* When ''g'' is [[pseudo-Anosov]], there is an element of its mapping class that preserves a pair of [[Transversality (mathematics)|transverse]] singular [[foliation]]s of ''S'', stretching the leaves of one (the ''unstable'' foliation) while contracting the leaves of the other (the ''stable'' foliation).

==Mapping tori==
Thurston's original motivation for developing this classification was to find geometric structures on ''mapping tori'' of the type predicted by the [[Geometrization conjecture]].  The [[mapping torus]] ''M&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a homeomorphism ''g'' of a surface ''S'' is the [[3-manifold]] obtained from ''S'' &amp;times; [0,1] by gluing ''S'' &amp;times; {0} to ''S'' &amp;times; {1} using ''g''. The geometric structure of ''M&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is related to the type of ''g'' in the classification as follows:
* If ''g'' is periodic, then ''M&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' has an ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; R structure;
* If ''g'' is [[Reduction (mathematics)|reducible]], then ''M&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' has [[incompressible surface|incompressible]] [[torus|tori]], and should be cut along these tori to yield pieces that each have geometric structures (the [[JSJ decomposition]]);
* If ''g'' is [[pseudo-Anosov map|pseudo-Anosov]], then ''M&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' has a [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] (i.e. ''H''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) structure.

The first two cases are comparatively easy, while the existence of a hyperbolic structure on the mapping torus of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is a deep and difficult theorem (also due to [[William Thurston|Thurston]]).  The hyperbolic 3-manifolds that arise in this way are called ''fibered'' because they are [[surface bundle over the circle|surface bundles over the circle]], and these manifolds are treated separately in the proof of Thurston's [[geometrization conjecture|geometrization theorem]] for [[Haken manifold]]s.  Fibered hyperbolic 3-manifolds have a number of interesting and pathological properties; for example, Cannon and Thurston showed that the surface subgroup of the arising [[Kleinian group]] has [[limit set]] which is a [[space-filling curve|sphere-filling curve]].

==Fixed point classification==
The three types of surface homeomorphisms are also related to the [[dynamical system|dynamics]] of the mapping class group Mod(''S'') on the [[Teichmüller space]] ''T''(''S'').  Thurston introduced a [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of ''T''(''S'') that is homeomorphic to a closed ball, and to which the action of Mod(''S'') extends naturally.  The type of an element ''g'' of the mapping class group in the Thurston classification is related to its fixed points when acting on the compactification of ''T''(''S''):
* If ''g'' is periodic, then there is a fixed point within ''T''(''S''); this point corresponds to a [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic structure]] on ''S'' whose [[isometry group]] contains an element isotopic to ''g'';
* If ''g'' is [[pseudo-Anosov]], then ''g'' has no fixed points in ''T''(''S'') but has a pair of fixed points on the Thurston boundary; these fixed points correspond to the ''stable'' and ''unstable'' foliations of ''S'' preserved by ''g''.
* For some [[Reduction (mathematics)|reducible]] mapping classes ''g'', there is a single fixed point on the Thurston boundary; an example is a [[Dehn twist|multi-twist]] along a [[pants decomposition]] ''Γ''.  In this case the fixed point of ''g'' on the Thurston boundary corresponds to ''Γ''.

This is reminiscent of the classification of [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] [[isometries]] into ''elliptic'', ''parabolic'', and ''hyperbolic'' types (which have fixed point structures similar to the ''periodic'', ''reducible'', and ''pseudo-Anosov'' types listed above).

== Education and career ==

Dunn studied mathematics at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], earning a BA in 1936 and an MA in 1951.&lt;ref name="Author-notes-1959"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1959|title=Notes about authors|jstor=2282548|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=54|issue=287|pages=695–698|doi=10.1080/01621459.1959.10501531}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded a PhD in mathematics in 1956 at UCLA, supervised by Paul G. Hoel.&lt;ref name="News-Annals-1957"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1957|title=News and notices|jstor=2237182|journal=Annals of Mathematical Statistics|volume=28|issue=2|pages=533–545|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177706988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phdtree.org//scholar/dunn-olive-jean/|title=Olive Jean Dunn PhD|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of Dunn's doctoral dissertation was ''Estimation problems for dependent regression''.&lt;ref name="News-Annals-1957" /&gt;

In 1956, she was appointed assistant professor of statistics at [[Iowa State College]].&lt;ref name="Ames Daily Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|title=19 appointed to, 21 resign from ISC faculty|date=2 August 1956|work=Ames Daily Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn returned to UCLA in 1959 as assistant professor of biostatistics and assistant professor of preventive medicine and health, later becoming full professor and serving in that role until her retirement.&lt;ref name="Basic Statistics 4th Ed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Author-notes-1959" /&gt; Dunn served on the editorial boards of several journals.&lt;ref name="Basic Statistics 4th Ed" /&gt;

==Contributions to statistical methods and textbooks==
Some of Dunn's 1958 and 1959 work led to the conjecture of the [[Gaussian correlation inequality]], which was only proved by German mathematician 
[[Thomas Royen]] in 2014 and was only widely recognized as proved in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20170328-statistician-proves-gaussian-correlation-inequality/ |title=A Long-Sought Proof, Found and Almost Lost |date=March 28, 2017 |first=Natalie |last=Wolchover |work=Quanta Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunn's doctoral dissertation work formed the basis for her continuing development of methods for confidence intervals in biostatistics, and the development of a method for correcting for multiple testing.&lt;ref name="Author-notes-1959" /&gt; From the notes to her 1959 publication&lt;ref name="CIs-1959"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunn|first1=Olive Jean|title=Confidence intervals for the means of dependent, normally distributed variables|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=1959|volume=54|issue=287|pages=613–621|jstor=2282541|doi=10.1080/01621459.1959.10501524}}&lt;/ref&gt; on confidence intervals:

"Most of the research for this paper was part of my doctoral dissertation. The idea of writing an article for the research worker who uses statistical methods was suggested to me by one of the non-statisticians on my doctoral committee at the time of my final examination. In working on the various confidence intervals for ''k'' means, I thought of the Bonferroni inequality ones quite early, but since they were so simple I thought they couldn't possibly be of any use. I spent a long time trying to prove that the confidence intervals which would be used in the case of independent variables could also be used or dependent variables. After failing to find a general proof for this, I finally noticed that the simple Bonferroni intervals were nearly as short".

The first edition of her textbook, ''Basic statistics: a primer for the biomedical sciences'', was published in 1977.&lt;ref name="Basic-stats-1st ed" /&gt; Later editions were co-authored with another professor from UCLA, Virginia A. Clark.&lt;ref name="Basic Statistics 4th Ed" /&gt; Dunn and Clark also co-authored ''Applied statistics: an analysis of variance and regression'', which has also had several editions, with Ruth M. Mickey joining the authors.&lt;ref name="Applied-Stats-2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Ruth M. Mickey, Olive Jean Dunn, Virginia A.|title=Applied statistics : analysis of variance and regression|date=2004|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-471-37038-3|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors ==

Dunn became a Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="ASA-fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASA Fellows|url=http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm|website=Amstat – American Statistical Association|publisher=American Statistical Association|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) and the [[American Public Health Association]].&lt;ref name="Basic Statistics 4th Ed" /&gt;

In October 1974, Dunn was honored as the annual UCLA annual Woman of Science, awarded to "an outstanding woman who has made significant contributions in the field of science".&lt;ref name="Valley News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Luncheon adds up to politics|date=13 October 1974|work=Valley News|last1=Kabraker|first1=Audrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was quoting as saying "I am thrilled to death for myself and for biostatistics...There are few medical centers in the country where a woman in biostatistics would be selected for this honor".&lt;ref name="Valley News" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6343">The '''quadratic residuosity problem''' in [[computational number theory]] is to decide, given integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, whether &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quadratic residue]] modulo &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; or not.

The problem was first described by [[Gauss]] in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' in 1801. 
This problem is believed to be [[Computational complexity theory|computationally difficult]].
Several cryptographic methods [[Computational hardness assumption|rely on its hardness]], see [[#Applications|Applications]].

An efficient algorithm for the quadratic residuosity problem immediately implies efficient algorithms for other number theoretic problems, such as deciding whether a composite &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of unknown factorization is the product of 2 or 3 primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Adleman, L. |title=On Distinguishing Prime Numbers from Composite Numbers | book-title=Proceedings of the 21st IEEE Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), Syracuse, N.Y. |year=1980 |pages=387–408 |doi=10.1109/SFCS.1980.28 |issn=0272-5428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precise formulation ==

Given integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''quadratic residue modulo &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;'' if there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;a \equiv b^2 \pmod T&lt;/math&gt;.

Otherwise we say it is a quadratic non-residue.
When &lt;math&gt;T = p&lt;/math&gt; is a prime, it is customary to use the [[Legendre symbol]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = 
\begin{cases}
 1 &amp; \text{ if } a \text{ is a quadratic residue modulo } p \text{ and } a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p}, \\
-1 &amp; \text{ if } a \text{ is a quadratic non-residue modulo } p, \\
 0 &amp; \text{ if } a \equiv 0 \pmod{p}.  
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[Character (mathematics)|multiplicative character]] which means &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{p}\big) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for exactly &lt;math&gt;(p-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; of the values &lt;math&gt;1,\ldots,p-1&lt;/math&gt;, and it is &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; for the remaining.

It is easy to compute using the [[law of quadratic reciprocity]] in a manner akin to the [[Euclidean algorithm]], see [[Legendre symbol]].

Consider now some given &lt;math&gt;N = p_1 p_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; are two, different unknown primes.
A given &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic residue modulo &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic residue modulo both &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Since we don't know &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;, we cannot compute &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{p_1}\big)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{p_2}\big)&lt;/math&gt;. However, it is easy to compute their product.
This is known as the [[Jacobi symbol]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{a}{N}\right) = \left(\frac{a}{p_1}\right)\left(\frac{a}{p_2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be [[Jacobi symbol#Calculating the Jacobi symbol|efficiently computed]] using the [[law of quadratic reciprocity]] for Jacobi symbols.

However, &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big)&lt;/math&gt; can not in all cases tell us whether &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic residue modulo &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; or not!
More precisely, if &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big) = -1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily a quadratic non-residue modulo either &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;, in which case we are done.
But if &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big) = 1&lt;/math&gt; then it is either the case that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic residue modulo both &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;, or a quadratic non-residue modulo both &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;.
We cannot distinguish these cases from knowing just that &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

This leads to the precise formulation of the quadratic residue problem:

'''Problem:'''
Given integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N = p_1 p_2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; are unknown, different primes, and where &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, determine whether &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic residue modulo &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; or not.

== Distribution of residues ==

If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is drawn uniformly at random from integers &lt;math&gt;0,\ldots,N-1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; more often a quadratic residue or a quadratic non-residue modulo &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;?

As mentioned earlier, for exactly half of the choices of &lt;math&gt;a \in \{1,\ldots,p_1-1\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{p_1}\big) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and for the rest we have &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{p_1}\big) = -1&lt;/math&gt;.
By extension, this also holds for half the choices of &lt;math&gt;a \in \{1,\ldots,N-1\} \setminus p_1\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.
Similarly for &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;.
From basic algebra, it follows that this partitions &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^\times&lt;/math&gt; into 4 parts of equal size, depending on the sign of &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{p_1}\big)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{p_2}\big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The allowed &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the quadratic residue problem given as above constitute exactly those two parts corresponding to the cases &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{p_1}\big) = \big(\tfrac{a}{p_2}\big) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\big(\tfrac{a}{p_1}\big) = \big(\tfrac{a}{p_2}\big) = -1&lt;/math&gt;.
Consequently, exactly half of the possible &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are quadratic residues and the remaining are not.

==Applications==

The intractability of the quadratic residuosity problem is the basis for the security of the [[Blum Blum Shub]] [[pseudorandom number generator]] and the [[Goldwasser–Micali cryptosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7276">In mathematics, '''real trees''' (also called '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;-trees''') are a class of [[metric space]]s generalising [[Tree (graph theory)|simplicial trees]]. They arise naturally in many mathematical contexts, in particular [[geometric group theory]] and probability theory. They are also the simplest examples of [[Gromov hyperbolic space]]s.

== Definition and examples ==

=== Formal definition ===

[[File:Y property.png|130px|thumb|A triangle in a real tree]]

A metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree if it is a [[Geodesic#Metric geometry|geodesic]] space where every triangle is a tripod. That is, for every three points &lt;math&gt;x, y, \rho \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a point &lt;math&gt;c = x \wedge y&lt;/math&gt; such that the geodesic segments &lt;math&gt;[\rho,x], [\rho,y]&lt;/math&gt; intersect in the segment &lt;math&gt;[\rho,c]&lt;/math&gt; and also &lt;math&gt;c \in [x,y]&lt;/math&gt;. This definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; being a "zero-hyperbolic space" in the sense of Gromov (all triangles are "zero-thin"). 
Real trees can also be characterised by a topological property. A metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree if for any pair of points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; all (topological) embeddings &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of the segment &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(0) = x, \, \sigma(1) = y&lt;/math&gt; have the same image (which is then a geodesic segment from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Simple examples ===

*If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a graph with the combinatorial metric then it is a real tree if and only if it is a tree (i.e. it has no cycles). Such a tree is often called a simplicial tree. They are characterised by the following topological property: a real tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is simplicial if and only if the set of singular points of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (points whose complement in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has three or more connected components) is discrete in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* The R-tree obtained in the following way is nonsimplicial. Start with the interval [0,2] and glue, for each positive integer n, an interval of length 1/n to the point 1−1/n in the original interval. The set of singular points is discrete, but fails to be closed since 1 is an ordinary point in this R-tree. Gluing an interval to 1 would result in a closed set of singular points at the expense of discreteness.
* The Paris metric makes the plane into a real tree. It is defined as follows: one fixes an origin &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and if two points are on the same ray from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, their distance is defined as the Euclidean distance. Otherwise, their distance is defined to be the sum of the Euclidean distances of these two points to the origin &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally any [[hedgehog space]] is an example of a real tree.

== In mathematical context ==

Real trees often appear, in various situations, as limits of more classical metric spaces.

=== Brownian trees ===

A [[brownian tree]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aldous | first = D. | authorlink = David Aldous | date = 1991 | title = The continuum random tree I | journal = [[Annals of Probability]] | volume = 19 | pages = 1–28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a (non-simplicial) real tree almost surely. Brownian trees arise as limits of various random processes on finite trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aldous | first = D. | authorlink = David Aldous | date = 1991 | title = The continuum random tree III | journal = [[Annals of Probability]] | volume = 21 | pages = 248–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultralimits of metric spaces ===

Any [[ultralimit]] of a sequence of hyperbolic spaces is a real tree. In particular, the [[Ultralimit#Asymptotic cones|asymptotic cone]] of any hyperbolic space is a real tree.

=== Limit of group actions ===

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. For a sequence of based &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-spaces &lt;math&gt;(X_i, *_i, \rho_i)&lt;/math&gt; there is a notion of convergence to a based &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-space &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, x_\infty, \rho_\infty)&lt;/math&gt; due to M. Bestvina and F. Paulin. When the spaces are hyperbolic and the actions are unbounded the limit (if it exists) is a real tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bestvina | first = Mladen | authorlink = Mladen Bestvina | editor-last1 = | editor-first1 = | title = Handbook of Geometric Topology | contribution = &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;-trees in topology, geometry and group theory | pages = 55–91 | year = 2002 | publisher = Elsevier | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8OYxdADnhZoC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example is obtained by taking &lt;math&gt;G = \pi_1(S)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a compact surface, and &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; the universal cover of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with the metric &lt;math&gt;i\rho&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed hyperbolic metric on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;).

This is useful to produce actions of hyperbolic groups on real trees. Such actions are analyzed using the so-called [[Rips machine]]. A case of particular interest is the study of degeneration of groups acting properly discuntinuously on a [[Hyperbolic space|real hyperbolic space]] (this predates Rips', Bestvina's and Paulin's work and is due to J. Morgan and [[Peter Shalen|P. Shalen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

=== Algebraic groups ===

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a field with an [[ultrametric space|ultrametric]] [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation]] then the [[Building (mathematics)|Bruhat–Tits building]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(F)&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree. It is simplicial if and only if the valuations is discrete.

== Generalisations ==

=== &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;-trees ===

If &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a totally ordered abelian group there is a natural notion of a distance with values in &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (classical metric spaces correspond to &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;). There is a notion of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;-tree&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Chiswell | first = Ian

 | location = River Edge, NJ
 | mr = 1851337

 | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recovers simplicial trees (for &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;) and real trees (for &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;). The structure of finitely presented groups acting freely on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; -trees was described.  &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = O. Kharlampovich,  A. Myasnikov, D.  Serbin | title = Actions, length functions and non-archimedean words IJAC 23, No. 2, 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, such a group acts freely on some  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; -tree.

=== Real buildings ===

The axioms for a [[Building (mathematics)|building]] can be generalized to give a definition of a real building. These arise for example as asymptotic cones of higher-rank [[symmetric spaces]] or as Bruhat—Tits buildings of higher-rank groups over valued fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">A '''reference dimension''' is a dimension on an [[engineering drawing]] provided for information only. Reference dimensions are provided for a variety of reasons and are often an accumulation of other dimensions that are defined elsewhere&lt;ref name="orau"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sheaffer | first = M. K. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = G. R. | last3 = Dann | first3 = R. K. | last4 = Russell | first4 = E.

These dimensions may also be used for convenience to identify a single dimension that is specified elsewhere (e.g. on a different drawing sheet).

Reference dimensions are not intended to be used directly to define the geometry of an object. Reference dimensions do not normally govern manufacturing operations (such as machining) in any way and, therefore, do not typically include a dimensional tolerance (though a tolerance may be provided if such information is deemed helpful). Consequently, reference dimensions are also not subject to dimensional inspection under normal circumstances.&lt;ref name="orau"/&gt;

Prior to use of modern Computer-Aided Design ([[Computer-aided design|CAD]]) software, reference dimensions were traditionally indicated on a drawing by the abbreviation "REF" written adjacent to the dimension (typically to the right or underneath the dimension).  However, with the assistance of modern [[CAD software]], the abbreviation "REF" has often been replaced with the use of parentheses around the dimension.&lt;ref name="orau"/&gt;  As an example, a distance of 1500 millimeters might be denoted by "''(1500 mm)''" instead of "''1500 mm REF''."  Although both of these methods of denoting a reference dimension are accepted and still in use today, it is increasingly common to see the use of parentheses instead of the abbreviation "REF" primarily due to widespread use of modern [[CAD software]] that makes use of parentheses as the default denotation method whenever reference dimensions are "automatically" created by the software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35133">'''Stream processing''' is a [[computer programming]] paradigm, equivalent to [[dataflow programming]], [[event stream processing]], and [[reactive programming]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonathanbeard.io/blog/2015/09/19/streaming-and-dataflow.html A SHORT INTRO TO STREAM PROCESSING]&lt;/ref&gt; that allows some applications to more easily exploit a limited form of [[parallel computing|parallel processing]]. Such applications can use multiple computational units, such as the [[floating point unit]] on a [[graphics processing unit]] or [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs),&lt;ref&gt;[http://icims.csl.illinois.edu/~dchen/research/SASP09_FCUDA.pdf FCUDA: Enabling Efficient Compilation of CUDA Kernels onto FPGAs]&lt;/ref&gt; without explicitly managing allocation, synchronization, or communication among those units.

The stream processing paradigm simplifies parallel software and hardware by restricting the parallel computation that can be performed. Given a sequence of data (a ''stream''), a series of operations (''[[compute kernel|kernel functions]]'') is applied to each element in the stream. Kernel functions are usually [[pipeline (computing)|pipelined]], and optimal local on-chip memory reuse is attempted, in order to minimize the loss in bandwidth, accredited to external memory interaction. ''Uniform streaming'', where one kernel function is applied to all elements in the stream, is typical. Since the kernel and stream abstractions expose data dependencies, compiler tools can fully automate and optimize on-chip management tasks. Stream processing hardware can use [[scoreboarding]], for example, to initiate a [[direct memory access]] (DMA) when dependencies become known. The elimination of manual DMA management reduces software complexity, and an associated elimination for hardware cached I/O, reduces the data area expanse that has to be involved with service by specialized computational units such as [[arithmetic logic unit]]s.

During the 1980s stream processing was explored within [[dataflow programming]]. An example is the language [[SISAL]] (Streams and Iteration in a Single Assignment Language).

== Applications ==
Stream processing is essentially a compromise, driven by a data-centric model that works very well for traditional DSP or GPU-type applications (such as image, video and [[digital signal processing]]) but less so for general purpose processing with more randomized data access (such as databases). By sacrificing some flexibility in the model, the implications allow easier, faster and more efficient execution.  Depending on the context, [[central processing unit|processor]] design may be tuned for maximum efficiency or a trade-off for flexibility.

Stream processing is especially suitable for applications that exhibit three application characteristics:{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
* '''Compute Intensity''', the number of arithmetic operations per I/O or global memory reference.  In many signal processing applications today it is well over 50:1 and increasing with algorithmic complexity.
* '''Data Parallelism''' exists in a kernel if the same function is applied to all records of an input stream and a number of records can be processed simultaneously without waiting for results from previous records.
* '''Data Locality''' is a specific type of temporal locality common in signal and media processing applications where data is produced once, read once or twice later in the application, and never read again. Intermediate streams passed between kernels as well as intermediate data within kernel functions can capture this locality directly using the stream processing programming model.

Examples of records within streams include:
* In graphics, each record might be the vertex, normal, and color information for a triangle;
* In image processing, each record might be a single pixel from an image;
* In a video encoder, each record may be 256 pixels forming a macroblock of data; or
* In wireless signal processing, each record could be a sequence of samples received from an antenna.

For each record we can only read from the input, perform operations on it, and write to the output. It is permissible to have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, but never a piece of memory that is both readable and writable. &lt;!-- We could discuss weeks on whatever this can be considered generally true by pointing out the implications of the exact wording. --&gt;

== Comparison to prior parallel paradigms ==
Basic computers started from a sequential execution paradigm. Traditional [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] are [[SISD]] based, which means they conceptually perform only one operation at a time.
As the computing needs of the world evolved, the amount of data to be managed increased very quickly. It was obvious that the sequential programming model could not cope with the increased need for processing power. Various efforts have been spent on finding alternative ways to perform massive amounts of computations but the only solution was to exploit some level of parallel execution.
The result of those efforts was [[SIMD]], a programming paradigm which allowed applying one instruction to multiple instances of (different) data. Most of the time, SIMD was being used in a [[SWAR]] environment. By using more complicated structures, one could also have [[MIMD]] parallelism.

Although those two paradigms were efficient, real-world implementations were plagued with limitations from memory alignment problems to synchronization issues and limited parallelism. Only few SIMD processors survived as stand-alone components; most were embedded in standard CPUs.

Consider a simple program adding up two arrays containing 100 4-component [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] (i.e. 400 numbers in total).

=== Conventional, sequential paradigm ===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100 * 4; i++)
    result[i] = source0[i] + source1[i];
&lt;/source&gt;
This is the sequential paradigm that is most familiar. Variations do exist (such as inner loops, structures and such), but they ultimately boil down to that construct.

===Parallel SIMD paradigm, packed registers (SWAR)===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
for (int el = 0; el &lt; 100; el++) // for each vector
    vector_sum(result[el], source0[el], source1[el]);
&lt;/source&gt;
This is actually oversimplified. It assumes the instruction &lt;code&gt;vector_sum&lt;/code&gt; works. Although this is what happens with [[Intrinsic function|instruction intrinsics]], much information is actually not taken into account here such as the number of vector components and their data format. This is done for clarity.

You can see however, this method reduces the number of decoded instructions from ''numElements * componentsPerElement'' to ''numElements''. The number of jump instructions is also decreased, as the loop is run fewer times. These gains result from the parallel execution of the four mathematical operations.

What happened however is that the packed SIMD register holds a certain amount of data so it's not possible to get more parallelism. The speed up is somewhat limited by the assumption we made of performing four parallel operations (please note this is common for both [[AltiVec]] and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]]).

===Parallel Stream paradigm (SIMD/MIMD)===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
// This is a fictional language for demonstration purposes.
elements = array streamElement([number, number])[100]
kernel = instance streamKernel("@arg0[@iter]")
result = kernel.invoke(elements)
&lt;/source&gt;
In this paradigm, the whole dataset is defined, rather than each component block being defined separately. Describing the set of data is assumed to be in the first two rows. After that, the result is inferred from the sources and kernel. For simplicity, there's a 1:1 mapping between input and output data but this does not need to be. Applied kernels can also be much more complex.

An implementation of this paradigm can "unroll" a loop internally. This allows throughput to scale with chip complexity, easily utilizing hundreds of ALUs.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits:[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4443192 "A Programmable 512 GOPS Stream Processor for Signal, Image, and Video Processing"], Stanford University and Stream Processors, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khailany, Dally, Rixner, Kapasi, Owens and Towles: [http://cva.stanford.edu/publications/2003/khailany_im_scalability.pdf  "Exploring VLSI Scalability of Stream Processors"], Stanford and Rice University.&lt;/ref&gt; The elimination of complex data patterns makes much of this extra power available.

While stream processing is a branch of SIMD/MIMD processing, they must not be confused. Although SIMD implementations can often work in a "streaming" manner, their performance is not comparable: the model envisions a very different usage pattern which allows far greater performance by itself.

It has been noted that when applied on generic processors such as standard CPU, only a 1.5x speedup can be reached.&lt;ref&gt;Gummaraju and Rosenblum, [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/wild04/Paper14.pdf  "Stream processing in General-Purpose Processors"], Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, ad-hoc stream processors easily reach over 10x performance, mainly attributed to the more efficient memory access and higher levels of parallel processing.&lt;ref&gt;Kapasi, Dally, Rixner, Khailany, Owens, Ahn and Mattson, [http://cva.stanford.edu/publications/2003/ieeecomputer_stream.pdf "Programmable Stream Processors"], Universities of Stanford, Rice, California (Davis) and Reservoir Labs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various degrees of flexibility allowed by the model, stream processors usually impose some limitations on the kernel or stream size. For example, consumer hardware often lacks the ability to perform high-precision math, lacks complex indirection chains or presents lower limits on the number of instructions which can be executed.

== Research ==
[[Stanford University]] stream processing projects included the Stanford Real-Time Programmable Shading Project started in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Stanford Real-Time Programmable Shading Project |work= Research group web site |author= Eric Chan |url= http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/shading/ |access-date= March 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A prototype called Imagine was developed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= The Imagine - Image and Signal Processor |work= Group web site |url= http://cva.stanford.edu/projects/imagine/ |access-date= March 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A project called Merrimac ran until about 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Merrimac - Stanford Streaming Supercomputer Project |work= Group web site |url= http://merrimac.stanford.edu/ |deadurl= yes |archivedate= December 18, 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131218194055/http://merrimac.stanford.edu/ |access-date= March 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[AT&amp;T]] also researched stream-enhanced processors as [[graphics processing unit]]s rapidly evolved in both speed and functionality.{{ref|GPUasSTREAM}} Since these early days, dozens of stream processing languages have been developed, as well as specialized hardware.

=== Programming model notes ===
The most immediate challenge in the realm of parallel processing does not lie as much in the type of hardware architecture used, but in how easy it will be to program the system in question in a real-world environment with acceptable performance. Machines like Imagine use a straightforward single-threaded model with automated dependencies, memory allocation and [[Direct memory access|DMA]] scheduling. This in itself is a result of the research at MIT and Stanford in finding an optimal ''layering of tasks'' between programmer, tools and hardware. Programmers beat tools in mapping algorithms to parallel hardware, and tools beat programmers in figuring out smartest memory allocation schemes, etc. Of particular concern are MIMD designs such as [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell]], for which the programmer needs to deal with application partitioning across multiple cores and deal with process synchronization and load balancing. Efficient multi-core programming tools are severely lacking today.

A drawback of SIMD programming was the issue of [[Array-of-Structures (AoS) and Structure-of-Arrays (SoA)]]. Programmers often wanted to build data structures with a 'real' meaning, for example:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 // A particle in a three-dimensional space.
struct particle_t {
    float x, y, z;          // not even an array!
    unsigned byte color[3]; // 8 bit per channel, say we care about RGB only
    float size;
    // ... and many other attributes may follow...
};
&lt;/source&gt;
What happened is that those structures were then assembled in [[Array data structure|arrays]] to keep things nicely organized. This is ''[[array of structures]]'' (AoS).
When the structure is laid out in memory, the compiler will produce interleaved data, in the sense that all the structures will be contiguous but there will be a constant offset between, say, the "size" attribute of a structure instance and the same element of the following instance. The offset depends on the structure definition (and possibly other things not considered here such as compiler's policies).
There are also other problems. For example, the three position variables cannot be SIMD-ized that way, because it's not sure they will be allocated in continuous memory space. To make sure SIMD operations can work on them, they shall be grouped in a 'packed memory location' or at least in an array.
Another problem lies in both "color" and "xyz" to be defined in three-component vector quantities. SIMD processors usually have support for 4-component operations only (with some exceptions however).

These kinds of problems and limitations made SIMD acceleration on standard CPUs quite nasty.
The proposed solution, ''[[structure of arrays]]'' (SoA) follows as:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct particle_t {
    float *x, *y, *z;
    unsigned byte *colorRed, *colorBlue, *colorGreen;
    float *size;
};
&lt;/source&gt;
For readers not experienced with [[C (programming language)|C]], the '*' before each identifier means a pointer. In this case, they will be used to point to the first element of an array, which is to be allocated later. For [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programmers, this is roughly equivalent to "[]".
The drawback here is that the various attributes could be spread in memory. To make sure this does not cause cache misses, we'll have to update all the various "reds", then all the "greens" and "blues".

For stream processors, the usage of structures is encouraged. From an application point of view, all the attributes can be defined with some flexibility.
Taking GPUs as reference, there is a set of attributes (at least 16) available. For each attribute, the application can state the number of components and the format of the components (but only primitive data types are supported for now). The various attributes are then attached to a memory block, possibly defining a ''stride'' between 'consecutive' elements of the same attributes, effectively allowing interleaved data.
When the GPU begins the stream processing, it will ''gather'' all the various attributes in a single set of parameters (usually this looks like a structure or a "magic global variable"), performs the operations and ''scatters'' the results to some memory area for later processing (or retrieving).

More modern stream processing frameworks provide a FIFO like interface to structure data as a literal stream. This abstraction 
provides a means to specify data dependencies implicitly while enabling the runtime/hardware to take full advantage of that 
knowledge for efficient computation. One of the simplest and most efficient stream processing modalities to date for C++, 
is [[RaftLib]]. [[RaftLib]] enables linking independent [[compute kernel]]s together as a data flow graph using C++ stream operators. 
As an example:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
#include &lt;raft&gt;
#include &lt;raftio&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

class hi : public raft::kernel
{
public:
    hi() : raft::kernel()
    {
       output.addPort&lt; std::string &gt;( "0" ); 
    }

    virtual raft::kstatus run()
    {
        output[ "0" ].push( std::string( "Hello World\n" ) );
        return( raft::stop ); 
    }
};

int
main( int argc, char **argv )
{
    /** instantiate print kernel **/
    raft::print&lt; std::string &gt; p;
    /** instantiate hello world kernel **/
    hi hello;
    /** make a map object **/
    raft::map m;
    /** add kernels to map, both hello and p are executed concurrently **/
    m += hello &gt;&gt; p;
    /** execute the map **/
    m.exe();
    return( EXIT_SUCCESS );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Models of computation for stream processing ===
Apart from specifying streaming applications in high-level language. Models of computation (MoCs) also have been widely used such as [[dataflow]] models and process-based models.

=== Generic processor architecture ===
Historically, CPUs began implementing various tiers of memory access optimizations because of the ever-increasing performance when compared to relatively slow growing external memory bandwidth. As this gap widened, big amounts of die area were dedicated to hiding memory latencies. Since fetching information and opcodes to those few ALUs is expensive, very little die area is dedicated to actual mathematical machinery (as a rough estimation, consider it to be less than 10%).

A similar architecture exists on stream processors but thanks to the new programming model, the amount of transistors dedicated to management is actually very little.

Beginning from a whole system point of view, stream processors usually exist in a controlled environment. GPUs do exist on an add-in board (this seems to also apply to [http://cva.stanford.edu/projects/imagine/ Imagine]). CPUs do the dirty job of managing system resources, running applications and such.

The stream processor is usually equipped with a fast, efficient, proprietary memory bus (crossbar switches are now common, multi-buses have been employed in the past). The exact amount of memory lanes is dependent on the market range. As this is written, there are still 64-bit wide interconnections around (entry-level). Most mid-range models use a fast 128-bit crossbar switch matrix (4 or 2 segments), while high-end models deploy huge amounts of memory (actually up to 512&amp;nbsp;MB) with a slightly slower crossbar that is 256 bits wide. By contrast, standard processors from [[Intel Pentium]] to some [[Athlon 64]] have only a single 64-bit wide data bus.

Memory access patterns are much more predictable. While arrays do exist, their dimension is fixed at kernel invocation. The thing which most closely matches a multiple pointer indirection is an ''indirection chain'', which is however guaranteed to finally read or write from a specific memory area (inside a stream).

Because of the SIMD nature of the stream processor's execution units (ALUs clusters), read/write operations are expected to happen in bulk, so memories are optimized for high bandwidth rather than low latency (this is a difference from [[Rambus]] and [[DDR SDRAM]], for example). This also allows for efficient memory bus negotiations.

Most (90%) of a stream processor's work is done on-chip, requiring only 1% of the global data to be stored to memory. This is where knowing the kernel temporaries and dependencies pays.

Internally, a stream processor features some clever communication and management circuits but what's interesting is the ''Stream Register File'' (SRF). This is conceptually a large cache in which stream data is stored to be transferred to external memory in bulks. As a cache-like software-controlled structure to the various [[arithmetic logic unit|ALUs]], the SRF is shared between all the various ALU clusters. The key concept and innovation here done with Stanford's Imagine chip is that the compiler is able to automate and allocate memory in an optimal way, fully transparent to the programmer. The dependencies between kernel functions and data is known through the programming model which enables the compiler to perform flow analysis and optimally pack the SRFs. Commonly, this cache and DMA management can take up the majority of a project's schedule, something the stream processor (or at least Imagine) totally automates. Tests done at Stanford showed that the compiler did an as well or better job at scheduling memory than if you hand tuned the thing with much effort.

There is proof; there can be a lot of clusters because inter-cluster communication is assumed to be rare. Internally however, each cluster can efficiently exploit a much lower amount of ALUs because intra-cluster communication is common and thus needs to be highly efficient.

To keep those ALUs fetched with data, each ALU is equipped with local register files (LRFs), which are basically its usable registers.

This three-tiered data access pattern, makes it easy to keep temporary data away from slow memories, thus making the silicon implementation highly efficient and power-saving.

=== Hardware-in-the-loop issues ===
{{Confusing section|date=January 2008}} &lt;!-- In a revision (as of 07:40, 8 January 2008) an user noted this was considered not relevant. Since those issues are slightly covered in the references, it seems they are. Most of the statements here can be inferred from the references while others are simply involved in using PCIe transactions (so referencing them here doesn't seem a wise idea) - keeping the tag anyway to gain more attention. --&gt;
Although an order of magnitude speedup can be reasonably expected (even from mainstream GPUs when computing in a streaming manner), not all applications benefit from this.
Communication latencies are actually the biggest problem. Although [[PCI Express]] improved this with full-duplex communications, getting a GPU (and possibly a generic stream processor) to work will possibly take long amounts of time. This means it's usually counter-productive to use them for small datasets. Because changing the kernel is a rather expensive operation the stream architecture also incurs penalties for small streams, a behaviour referred to as the ''short stream effect''.

[[Instruction pipeline|Pipelining]] is a very widespread and heavily used practice on stream processors, with GPUs featuring pipelines exceeding 200 stages. The cost for switching settings is dependent on the setting being modified but it is now considered to always be expensive. To avoid those problems at various levels of the pipeline, many techniques have been deployed such as "über shaders" and "texture atlases". Those techniques are game-oriented because of the nature of GPUs, but the concepts are interesting for generic stream processing as well.

* The [[Blitter]] in the Commodore [[Amiga]] is an early (circa 1985) graphics processor capable of combining three source streams of 16 component bit vectors in 256 ways to produce an output stream consisting of 16 component bit vectors. Total input stream bandwidth is up to 42 million bits per second. Output stream bandwidth is up to 28 million bits per second.
* Imagine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cva.stanford.edu/projects/imagine/ Imagine]&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Professor [[Bill Dally|William Dally]] of [[Stanford University]], is a flexible architecture intended to be both fast and energy efficient.

Merrimac intends to use a stream architecture and advanced interconnection networks to provide more performance per unit cost than cluster-based scientific computers built from the same technology.
* The '''Storm-1''' family from [[Stream Processors, Inc]], a commercial spin-off of Stanford's '''Imagine''' project,  was announced during a feature presentation at [[ISSCC]] 2007.  The family contains four members ranging from 30 GOPS to 220 16-bit GOPS (billions of operations per second), all fabricated at [[TSMC]] in a 130 nanometer process.  The devices target the high end of the [[digital signal processor|DSP]] market including [[video conferencing]], [[multifunction printer]]s and digital [[video surveillance]] equipment.
* [[GPU]]s are widespread, consumer-grade stream processors{{ref|GPUasSTREAM}} designed mainly by [[AMD]] and [[Nvidia]]. Various generations to be noted from a stream processing point of view:
** Pre-R2xx/NV2x: no explicit support for stream processing. Kernel operations were hidden in the [[API]] and provided too little flexibility for general use.
** R2xx/NV2x: kernel stream operations became explicitly under the programmer's control but only for vertex processing (fragments were still using old paradigms). No branching support severely hampered flexibility but some types of algorithms could be run (notably, low-precision fluid simulation).
** R3xx/NV4x: flexible branching support although some limitations still exist on the number of operations to be executed and strict recursion depth, as well as array manipulation.
** R8xx: Supports append/consume buffers and atomic operations. This generation is the state of the art.&lt;!-- What does this mean? It means it's a TODO. Remember we should track functionalities here rather than performance improvements. --&gt;
* [[AMD FireStream]] brand name for product line targeting HPC
* [[Nvidia Tesla]] brand name for product line targeting HPC
* The [[Cell processor]] from '''STI''', an alliance of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], [[Toshiba Corporation]], and [[IBM]], is a hardware architecture that can function like a stream processor with appropriate software support.  It consists of a controlling processor, the PPE (Power Processing Element, an IBM [[PowerPC]]) and a set of SIMD coprocessors, called SPEs (Synergistic Processing Elements), each with independent program counters and instruction memory, in effect a [[MIMD]] machine. In the native programming model all DMA and program scheduling is left up to the programmer. The hardware provides a fast ring bus among the processors for local communication. Because the local memory for instructions and data is limited the only programs that can exploit this architecture effectively either require a tiny memory footprint or adhere to a stream programming model.  With a suitable algorithm the performance of the Cell can rival that of pure stream processors, however this nearly always requires a complete redesign of algorithms and software.

In [[economics]] and [[finance]], a '''Taleb distribution''' is the statistical profile of an investment which normally provides a payoff of small positive returns, while carrying a small but significant risk of catastrophic losses. The term was coined by journalist [[Martin Wolf]] and economist [[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]] to describe investments with a "high probability of a modest gain and a low probability of huge losses in any period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/c8941ad4-f503-11dc-a21b-000077b07658 |author=Martin Wolf |date=18 March 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2017 |title=''Why today’s hedge fund industry may not survive''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is named after [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], based on ideas outlined in his book ''[[Fooled by Randomness]]''.

According to Taleb in ''Silent Risk'', the term should be called "payoff" to reflect the importance of the payoff function of the underlying [[probability distribution]], rather than the distribution itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nhAlfIk3QIR1o1dnk5ZmRaaGs/view |author=Nassim Taleb |title=''Silent Risk'' Section 16.1 Payoff Skewness and Lack of Skin-in-the-Game |page=295 |date=2015 |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is meant to refer to an [[investment return]]s profile in which there is a high [[probability]] of a small gain, and a small probability of a very large loss, which more than outweighs the gains. In these situations the [[expected value]] is very much less than zero, but this fact is camouflaged by the appearance of low [[Risk#Definitions of risk|risk]] and steady [[return (finance)|returns]]. It is a combination of [[kurtosis risk]] and [[skewness risk]]: overall returns are dominated by extreme events (kurtosis), which are to the downside (skew).

More detailed and formal discussion of the bets on small probability events is in the academic essay by Taleb, called "Why Did the Crisis of 2008 Happen?" and in the 2004 paper in the ''[[Journal of Behavioral Finance]]'' called "Why Do We Prefer Asymmetric Payoffs?" in which he writes "agents risking other people’s capital would have the incentive to camouflage the properties by showing a steady income. Intuitively, hedge funds are paid on an annual basis while disasters happen every four or five years, for example. The fund manager does not repay his incentive fee."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholas Taleb|first=Nassim|date=2004-03-01|title=Bleed or Blowup?

== Criticism of trading strategies ==
Pursuing a trading strategy with a Taleb distribution yields a high probability of steady returns for a time, but with a [[risk of ruin]] that approaches eventual certainty over time. This is done consciously by some as a risky trading strategy, while some critics argue that it is done either unconsciously by some, unaware of the hazards ("innocent fraud"), or consciously by others, particularly in [[hedge funds]].

=== Risky strategy ===
If done consciously, with one's own capital or openly disclosed to investors, this is a risky strategy, but appeals to some: one will want to exit the trade before the rare event happens. This occurs for instance in a [[speculative bubble]], where one purchases an asset in the expectation that it will likely go up, but may plummet, and hopes to sell the asset before the bubble bursts.

This has also been referred to as "picking up pennies in front of a steamroller".&lt;ref&gt;Taleb, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Innocent fraud" ===
[[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]] has likened [[Security (finance)|securities trading]] to bad driving, as both are characterized by Taleb distributions.&lt;ref&gt;John Kay [http://www.johnkay.com/2003/01/16/a-strategy-for-hedge-funds-and-dangerous-drivers/ "A strategy for hedge funds and dangerous drivers"], [[Financial Times]], 16 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers can make many small gains in time by taking risks such as overtaking on the inside and [[tailgating]], however, they are then at risk of experiencing a very large loss in the form of a serious [[traffic accident]]. Kay has described Taleb Distributions as the basis of the [[carry trade]] and has claimed that along with [[mark-to-market accounting]] and other practices, constitute part of what [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has called "innocent fraud".&lt;ref&gt;John Kay [http://www.johnkay.com/2008/10/15/banks-got-burned-by-their-own-‘innocent-fraud’/ "Banks got burned by their own ‘innocent fraud’"], Financial Times, 15 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral hazard ===
Some critics of the [[hedge fund]] industry claim that the compensation structure generates high fees for [[investment strategy|investment strategies]] that follow a Taleb distribution, creating [[moral hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/03/are-hedge-funds-scam.html Are hedge funds a scam?] ''Naked Capitalism/Financial Times'', March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In such a scenario, the fund can claim high asset management and performance fees until they suddenly "blow up", losing the investor significant sums of money and wiping out all the gains to the investor generated in previous periods; however, the fund manager keeps all fees earned prior to the losses being incurred – and ends up enriching himself in the long run because he does not pay for his losses.

== Risks ==
Taleb distributions pose several fundamental problems, all possibly leading to risk being overlooked:
;presence of extreme adverse events: The very presence or possibility of adverse events may pose a problem per se, which is ignored by only looking at the average case – a decision may be good in expectation (in the aggregate, in the long term), but a single rare event may ruin the investor.
;unobserved events: This is Taleb's central contention, which he calls [[Black swan theory|black swans]] – because extreme events are rare, they have often not been observed yet, and thus are not included in [[scenario analysis]] or [[stress testing]].
;hard-to-compute expectation: A subtler issue is that expectation is very [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] to assumptions about probability: a trade with a $1 gain 99.9% of the time and a $500 loss 0.1% of the time has positive expected value; while if the $500 loss occurs 0.2% of the time it has approximately 0 expected value; and if the $500 loss occurs 0.3% of the time it has negative expected value.  This is exacerbated by the difficulty of estimating the probability of rare events (in this example one would need to observe thousands of trials to estimate the probability with confidence), and by the use of [[financial leverage]]: mistaking a small loss for a small gain and magnifying by leverage yields a hidden large loss.
More formally, while the risks for a ''known'' distribution can be calculated, in practice one does not know the distribution: one is operating under [[uncertainty]], in economics called [[Knightian uncertainty]].

== Mitigants ==
A number of mitigants have been proposed, by Taleb and others.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} These include:
;not exposing oneself to large losses using the [[barbell strategy]]: For instance, only buying [[Option (finance)|options]] (so one can at most lose the premium), not selling them.  Many funds have started offering "tail protection" such as the one advocated by Taleb.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0627/money-guide-11-spitznagel-black-swan-cnbc-protect-tail.html&lt;/ref&gt;   
;performing [[sensitivity analysis]] on assumptions: This does not eliminate the risk, but identifies which assumptions are key to conclusions, and thus meriting close scrutiny.
;[[scenario analysis]] and [[stress test (financial)|stress testing]]: Widely used in industry, they do not include unforeseen events but emphasize various possibilities and what one stands to lose, so one is not blinded by absence of losses thus far.
;using non-probabilistic decision techniques: While most classical [[decision theory]] is based on probabilistic techniques of [[expected value]] or [[expected utility]], alternatives exist which do not require assumptions about the probabilities of various outcomes, and are thus [[Robust decision|robust]]. These include [[minimax]], [[minimax regret]], and [[info-gap decision theory]].
;altering pay structure to reduce moral hazard: For workers in the financial industry whose strategies follow a Taleb distribution, linking success to long-term (not cash) rewards, which can be withdrawn in the event of intervening failure.  For example, paying banks staff in long-term stock options in their bank rather than in cash bonuses.
;adding to asset allocation a strategy with a holy grail distribution of returns: Adding a complementary strategy with a performance pattern that helps reduce the impact of market performance shocks (holy grail distribution)&lt;ref&gt;http://seekingalpha.com/article/2530925-holy-grail-distribution&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">In mathematics, the '''Teichmüller–Tukey lemma''' (sometimes named just '''Tukey's lemma'''), named after [[John Tukey]] and [[Oswald Teichmüller]], is a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] that states that every nonempty collection of [[finite character]] has a [[maximal element]] with respect to [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]]. Over [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]], and therefore to the [[well-ordering theorem]], [[Zorn's lemma]], and the [[Hausdorff maximal principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jech |first=Thomas J.|author-link=Thomas Jech |title=The Axiom of Choice |isbn=978-0-486-46624-8 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |year=2008 |origyear=1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
A family of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is of '''finite character''' provided it has the following properties:
#For each &lt;math&gt;A\in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, every [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; belongs to  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.
#If every finite subset of a given set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; belongs to  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; belongs to  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statement of the lemma==
Let &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; be a set and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(Z)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is of finite character and &lt;math&gt;X\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a maximal &lt;math&gt;Y\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; (according to the inclusion relation) such that &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kunen |first=Kenneth|title=The Foundations of Mathematics |isbn=978-1-904987-14-7 |publisher=[[College Publications]] |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In [[linear algebra]], the lemma may be used to show the existence of a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]]. Consider the collection  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of [[linearly independent]] sets of vectors. This is a collection of [[finite character]] Thus, a maximal set exists, which must then [[span (linear algebra)|span]] ''V'' and be a basis for ''V''.

'''William Burnside''' (2 July 1852 – 21 August 1927) was an English [[mathematician]]. He is known mostly as an early researcher in the theory of [[finite group]]s.

Burnside was born in [[London]], and attended [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St. John's]] and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]]s at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he was the [[Second Wrangler]] in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BNSD871W|name=Burnside, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured at Cambridge for the following ten years, before being appointed professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]]. While this was a little outside the main centres of British mathematical research, Burnside remained a very active researcher, publishing more than 150 papers in his career.

Burnside's early research was in [[applied mathematics]]. This work was of sufficient distinction to merit his election as a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1893, though it is little remembered today. Around the same time as his election his interests turned to the study of [[finite group]]s. This was not a widely studied subject in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the late 19th century, and it took some years for his research in this area to gain widespread recognition.

The central part of Burnside's group theory work was in the area of [[group representation]]s, where he helped to develop some of the foundational theory, complementing, and sometimes competing with, the work of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]], who began his research in the subject during the 1890s. One of Burnside's best known contributions to group theory is his [[Burnside's theorem|''p&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;q&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'' theorem]], which shows that every finite group whose order is divisible by fewer than three distinct primes is [[solvable group|solvable]].

In 1897 Burnside's classic work ''Theory of Groups of Finite Order'' was published.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; The second edition (pub. 1911) was for many decades the standard work in the field. A major difference between the editions was the inclusion of [[character theory]] in the second.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. B. Mathews]](1911) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v88/n2197/pdf/088170a0.pdf Theory of Groups of Finite Order] from [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 88:170,1 (#2197)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnside is also remembered for the formulation of [[Burnside's problem]] that concerns the question of bounding the size of a group if there are fixed bounds both on the order of all of its elements and the number of elements  needed to generate it, and also for [[Burnside's lemma]] (a formula relating the number of [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|orbits]] of a [[permutation group]] acting on a set with the number of fixed points of each of its elements) though the latter had been discovered earlier and independently by Frobenius and [[Augustin Cauchy]].

He received an [[honorary doctorate]] ([[D.Sc.]]) from the [[University of Dublin]] in June 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Friday |date=28 June 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his mathematical work, Burnside was a noted rower. While he was a lecturer at Cambridge, he also coached the rowing crew team. In fact, his obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' took more interest in his athletic career, calling him "one of the best known Cambridge athletes of his day".

He is buried at the [[West Wickham]] Parish Church in South London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Collected Papers of William Burnside: Commentary on Burnside's life and work ; Papers 1883–1899 | author=Burnside, W. | editor1=Neumann, P.M. |editor2=Mann, A.J.S. | editor3=Tompson, J.C. |isbn=9780198505860 |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=1 |page=106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Øystein Ore''' (7 October 1899 – 13 August 1968) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] known for his work in [[ring theory]], [[Galois connection]]s, [[graph theory]], and the [[history of mathematics]].

==Life==
Ore graduated from the [[University of Oslo]] in 1922, with a Cand.Scient. degree in mathematics. In 1924, the University of Oslo awarded him the Ph.D. for a thesis titled ''Zur Theorie der algebraischen Körper'', supervised by [[Thoralf Skolem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=11890|website=Mathematics Genealogy Project|accessdate=9 April 2018|title= Øystein Ore}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ore also studied at [[Göttingen University]], where he learned [[Emmy Noether]]'s new approach to [[abstract algebra]]. He was also a fellow at the [[Mittag-Leffler]] Institute in [[Sweden]], and spent some time at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1925, he was appointed research assistant at the University of Oslo.

[[Yale University]]’s [[James Pierpont (mathematician)|James Pierpont]] went to Europe in 1926 to recruit research mathematicians. In 1927, Yale hired Ore as an assistant professor of mathematics, promoted him to associate professor in 1928, then to full professor in 1929. In 1931, he became a [[Sterling Professor]] (Yale's highest academic rank), a position he held until he retired in 1968.

Ore gave an [[American Mathematical Society]] Colloquium lecture in 1941 and was a [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1936 in Oslo. He was also elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[Oslo Academy of Science]]. He was a founder of the [[Econometric Society]].

Ore visited Norway nearly every summer. During [[World War II]], he was active in the "American Relief for Norway" and "Free Norway" movements. In gratitude for the services rendered to his native country during the war, he was decorated in 1947 with the [[Order of St. Olav]].

In 1930, Ore married Gudrun Lundevall. They had two children. Ore had a passion for painting and sculpture, collected ancient maps, and spoke several languages.

==Work==
Ore is known for his work in [[ring theory]], [[Galois connections]], and most of all, [[graph theory]].

His early work was on [[algebraic number field]]s, how to decompose the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by a [[prime number]] into [[prime ideal]]s. He then worked on [[noncommutative ring]]s, proving his celebrated theorem on embedding a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]] into a [[division ring]]. He then examined [[polynomial ring]]s over [[skew field]]s, and attempted to extend his work on factorisation to non-commutative rings. The [[Ore condition]], which (if true) allows a ring of fractions to be defined, and the [[Ore extension]], a non-commutative analogue of rings of polynomials, are part of this work. In more elementary number theory, [[Ore's harmonic number]]s are the numbers whose divisors have an integer harmonic mean. 

As a teacher, Ore is notable for teaching mathematics to two doctoral students who would make  contributions to science and mathematics, [[Grace Hopper]], who would eventually become a [[United States]] [[rear admiral]] and [[computer scientist]], who was a pioneer in the development of the first [[computer]]s, and [[Marshall Hall, Jr.]], an American mathematician who did important research in [[group theory]] and [[combinatorics]].

In 1930 the ''Collected Works of Richard Dedekind'' were published in three volumes, jointly edited by Ore and [[Emmy Noether]]. He then turned his attention to [[lattice theory]] becoming, together with [[Garrett Birkhoff]], one of the two founders of American expertise in the subject. Ore's early work on lattice theory led him to the study of [[equivalence relation|equivalence]] and [[Closure operator|closure relation]]s, [[Galois connection]]s, and finally to [[graph theory]], which occupied him to the end of his life. He wrote two books on the subject, one on the theory of graphs and another on their applications. Within graph theory, Ore's theorem is one of several results proving that sufficiently [[dense graph]]s contain [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s.

Ore had a lively interest in the [[history of mathematics]], and was an unusually able author of books for laypeople, such as his biographies of [[Cardano]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]].
