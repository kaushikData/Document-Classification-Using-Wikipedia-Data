'''Business cards''' are [[card stock|card]]s bearing business [[information]] about a [[company]] or [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3 Reasons Why Every Freelancer Needs a Business Card |url=https://resourcemoon.com/3-reasons-why-every-freelancer-needs-a-business-card/ |website=Resource Moon |publisher=Resource Moon |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are shared during formal introductions as a convenience and a memory aid. A business card typically includes the giver's name, [[types of companies|company]] or business affiliation (usually with a [[logo]]) and contact information such as [[address (geography)|street address]]es, [[telephone number]](s), [[fax]] number, [[e-mail]] addresses and [[website]]. Before the advent of electronic communication business cards might also include [[Teletypewriter message|telex]] details. Now they may include social media addresses such as [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]] and [[Twitter]]. Traditionally many cards were simple black text on white stock; today a professional business card will sometimes include one or more aspects of striking visual design.

==Construction==
Business cards are printed on some form of [[card stock]], the visual effect, method of printing, cost and other details varying according to cultural or organizational norms and personal preferences. The common weight of a business card varies some by location. Generally, business cards are printed on stock that is 350&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Paper density|density]]), 45&amp;nbsp;kg (100&amp;nbsp;lb) (weight), or 12 pt (thickness).

High quality business cards without full-color photographs are normally printed using [[spot color]]s on sheet-fed [[offset printing]] presses. Some companies have gone so far as to trademark their spot colors (examples are [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] brown, [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' purple, and [[Tide (detergent)|Tide]]'s orange).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} If a business card logo is a single color and the type is another color, the process is considered two-color. More spot colors can be added depending on the needs of the card. With the onset of digital printing, and batch printing, it is now cost effective to print business cards in full color.

To simulate the  effect of printing with engraved plates, a less-expensive process called [[thermographic printing|thermography]] was developed that uses the application of a plastic powder, which adheres to the wet ink. The cards are then passed through a heating unit, which melts the plastic onto the card. Spot UV varnish onto matte laminate can also have a similar effect.

Full color cards, or cards that use many colors, are printed on sheetfed presses as well; however, they use the [[CMYK]] (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) [[four-color printing]] process. Screens of each color overprinted on one another create a wide [[gamut]] of color. The downside to this printing method is that screened colors if examined closely will reveal tiny dots, whereas spot color cards are printed solid in most cases. Spot colors should be used for simple cards with line art or non-black type that is smaller than 5 points.

Some terminology in reference to full-color printing:

*4/0 - Full color front / No print on back
*4/1 - full color front / One color on reverse
*4/4 - full color front / Full color back

These names are pronounced as "four over zero," "four over one," and "four over four".

A business card can also be coated with a [[UV coating|UV glossy coat]] (offset-uv printing). The coat is applied just like another ink using an additional unit on a [[Sheet-fed printing#Sheet-fed litho|sheetfed]] [[Printing press|press]]. That being said, UV coats can also be applied as a spot coating - meaning areas can be coated, and other areas can be left uncoated. This creates additional design potential. UV Coating is not to be confused with coated stock, which has a gloss or semi gloss finish that is applied before printing.

Business cards can also be printed with a digital copier, which uses toner fused onto the surface of the card, however many modern printing firms instead utilise high end "Digital Presses," now distinct from office copiers, which range from light production units such as the Bizhub 5500 from Konica Minolta, to state of the art units such as the latest HP Indigo Digital Presses.

While some of the older office copiers may have had problems running heavy business card stock, the newest digital presses can print on stock as heavy as 407 g/m2 (150# cover stock),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press_kits/2012/HPdrupa12/HP_Indigo_10000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and special substrates such as polypropylene. Available in both sheet-fed and web-fed models, many modern digital presses can emulate Pantone spot colors, print in up to seven colours in one pass, and some even contain embedded spectrophotometers and air-assisted feeding systems.

UV coats, and other coatings such as aqueous coatings are used to speed manufacturing of the cards. Cards that are not dry will "offset", i.e., the ink from the front of one card will mark up back of the next one. UV coatings are generally highly glossy but are more likely to fingerprint, while aqueous coatings are not noticeable but increase the life of the card. It is possible to use a dull aqueous coating on uncoated stock and get some very durable uncoated cards, and using UV coating or plastic lamination can also be applied to thicken thin stocked cards and make them more durable as well.

When cards are designed, they are given [[Bleed (printing)|bleeds]] if color extends to the edge of the finished cut size. (A bleed is the extension of printed lines or colors beyond the line where the paper it is printed on will be cut.) This is to help ensure that the paper will cut without white edges due to very small differences in where the blade cuts the cards, and it is almost impossible to cut the cards properly without. Just being a hair off can result in white lines, and the blade itself will pull the paper while cutting. The image on the paper can also shift from page to page which is called a bounce, which is generally off by a hairline on an offset press, but can be quite large on lower end equipment such as a copier or a duplicator press. Bleeds are typically an extra 3.175 ({{frac|8}}) to 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|4}} in) to all sides of the card.

(US)
* Bleed size:  95.25 × 57.15&amp;nbsp;mm (3.75 × 2.25 in) ({{frac|8}}&amp;nbsp;in bleeds)
* Standard cut size: 89 × 51&amp;nbsp;mm (3.5 × 2 in)

(UK)
* Bleed size:  91 × 61&amp;nbsp;mm (3.58 × 2.40 in)
* Standard cut size: 85 × 55&amp;nbsp;mm (3.35 × 2.17 in)

Fold-over or "tent" cards, and side fold cards are popular as well. Generally these cards will fold to the standard size.

Cards can also be printed with a different language on each side.

==Dimensions==
[[Aspect ratio]]s range from 1.42 to 1.8. There is no standard for the business card dimensions. Sharing dimensions with other cards makes storage easier, for example banking cards (85.60 × 53.98&amp;nbsp;mm) and business cards in Western Europe (85  × 55&amp;nbsp;mm) have almost the same size.

[[File:Meishi-example.svg|right|200px]]
A Japanese business card is called a {{nihongo|'''''meishi'''''|[[wikt:名刺|名刺]]}}. It typically features the company name at the top in the largest print, followed by the job title and then the name of the individual. This information is written in [[Japanese characters]] on one side and often [[Romanization of Japanese|Latin characters]] on the reverse. Other important contact information is usually provided, such as business address, phone number and fax number. Meishi may also contain a [[QR code]] to provide contact details in a machine-readable form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanmarketingnews.com/2007/01/in_previous_art.html |title=Japanese QR codes provide marketers a glimpse of the future |publisher=Japanmarketingnews.com |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has not yet become a widespread practice. According to a 2007 survey, fewer than 3% of Japanese people own a meishi with a QR code printed on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japan.internet.com/research/20070626/1.html 2007 survey results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508235837/http://japan.internet.com/research/20070626/1.html |date=May 8, 2012 }} {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation of one's meishi to another person is more formal and ritualistic than in the [[Western world]]. The card should be held at the top two corners, face up and turned so that it can be read by the person receiving the meishi, who takes it by the bottom two corners using both hands. Placing one's fingers over the name or other information is considered rude. Upon receiving the meishi, one is expected to read the card over, noting the person's name and rank. One should then thank the other person, saying ''"choudai itashimasu"'' ("I accept your name card") or ''"choudai shimasu"'', and then [[Bowing (social)#Bowing in Japan|bow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Japanese Etiquette &amp; Ethics in Business |last=De Mente |first=Boye |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=r6obHAmRKesC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;f=false|isbn = 0844285307 |pages= 24–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When meishi are being exchanged between parties with different [[Social status|status]], such as between the president of a company and someone in middle management, it is proper that the person of lower status extend his or her business card in such a way that it is underneath or below the meishi being extended by the person in a higher position.

Meishi should be kept in a smart leather case where they will not become warm or worn, both of which are considered a sign of disrespect or thoughtlessness. A received meishi should not be written on or placed in a pocket; it is considered proper to file the meishi at the rear of the leather case. If the meishi is being presented at a table, the recipient keeps the meishi on top of the leather case until they leave the table. If several people are involved in the meeting and one receives several meishi, the one with the highest rank is kept on the leather case, and the others beside it, on the table.

The manner in which the recipient treats the presenter's meishi is indicative of how the recipient will treat the presenter. Actions such as folding the card in half, or placing the presenter's meishi in one's back pocket, are regarded as insults.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Other formats==
[[Image:Bcardcd.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Business card size CD]]
Various technological advances made [[Compact Disc]] "business cards" possible, which could hold about 35 to 100 [[megabyte|MB]] of data. These [[Mini CD#Formats|business card CDs]] may be square, round or oblong but are approximately the same size as a conventional business card. CD business cards are designed to fit within the 80&amp;nbsp;mm tray of a computer's CD-ROM drive. They are playable in most tray computer CD drives, but do not work in slot-loading drives. Despite the ability to include dynamic presentations and a great deal of data, these discs were never in common use as business cards, though they are still available.

With [[handheld computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s becoming more ubiquitous, business card data is increasingly exchanged electronically via direct wireless connections (e.g. [[Infrared Data Association|infra-red]], [[Bluetooth]], [[RFID]]), [[SMS]], specialized apps (e.g. [[Bump (application)|Bump]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Bobbie |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12546403 |title=BBC News - Business cards side-lined by digital contact revolution |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via a cloud service (e.g. [[licobo]]). Once again however, these new methods of transmitting business information have yet to completely replace the traditional physical business card.

==Special materials==
Apart from common business cards made of paper/card there are also special business cards made from plastic ([[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]), especially frosted translucent plastic, crystal clear plastic, white or metallic plastic. Other extraordinary materials are metal, rubberized cards, rubber, magnets, poker chips, wooden nickels, and even real wood. For the most part those special material business cards are of standard format, sometimes with rounded corners.

==Business card software==
Business cards can be mass-produced by a printshop or printed at home using business card [[software]]. Such software typically contains design, [[page layout|layout]] tools, and [[Plain text|text]] editing tools for designing one's business cards. Most business card software integrates with other software (like [[mail client]]s or address books) to eliminate the need of entering contact data manually. Cards are usually printed on business card stock or saved in an electronic form and sent to a printshop. Multiple programs are available for users of [[Linux]], [[macOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms.

==Web-to-print==
In addition to business card software, many printing firms now offer a web-to-print service, which allows the customer to choose from a selection of stock design templates, customize online using their own logos and imagery, select quantities, view pricing options and request them for delivery to home or business addresses. Often this process is applied not only to business cards, but also to letterheads, notepads, labels and compliments slips.

==Collecting==
There are several hundred known collectors of business cards, especially antique cards, celebrity cards, or cards made of unusual materials. One of the major business card collectors' clubs is the International Business Card Collectors, IBCC. IBCC members exchange cards with other members, simply for the price of postage.

'''''Commentāriī dē Bellō Gallicō''''' ({{lang-en|Commentaries on the [[Gallic War]]|italic=yes}}), also '''''Bellum Gallicum''''' ({{lang-en|Gallic War|italic=yes}}), is [[Julius Caesar]]'s firsthand account of the [[Gallic Wars]], written as a [[third-person narrative]]. In it Caesar describes the battles and intrigues that took place in the nine years he spent fighting the [[Germanic peoples]] and [[Celtic peoples]] in [[Gaul]] that opposed [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest.

The "Gaul" that Caesar refers to is ambiguous, as the term had various connotations in Roman writing and discourse during Caesar's time. Generally, Gaul included all of the regions that Romans had not conquered or administered or which were primarily inhabited by [[Celts]]; except for the Roman province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] (modern-day [[Provence]] and [[Languedoc-Roussillon]]), which had already been conquered in Caesar's time, therefore encompassing the rest of modern [[France]], [[Belgium]], Western [[Germany]], and parts of [[Switzerland]]. As the [[Roman Republic]] made inroads deeper into Celtic territory and conquered more land, the definition of "Gaul" shifted. Concurrently, "Gaul" was also used in common parlance as a synonym for "uncouth" or "unsophisticated" as Romans saw Celtic peoples as uncivilized compared with Rome.

The work has been a mainstay in [[Latin]] instruction because of its simple, direct prose. It begins with the frequently quoted phrase ''"Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres"'', meaning "Gaul is a whole divided into three parts".&lt;ref&gt;As translated by H.J. Edwards in the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition.&lt;/ref&gt; The full work is split into eight sections, Book&amp;nbsp;1 to Book&amp;nbsp;8, varying in size from approximately 5,000 to 15,000 words. Book 8 was written by [[Aulus Hirtius]], after Caesar's death.&lt;ref name=Peck1898p248&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Peck |editor-first=Harry Thurston |editor-link=Harry Thurston Peck |title=Caesar, Gaius Iulius |encyclopedia=[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]] |date=1963 |orig-year=1898 |page=248 |location=New York |publisher=Cooper Square Publishers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The Latin title, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'', is often retained in English translations of the book, and the title is also translated to ''About the Gallic War'', ''Of the Gallic War'', ''On the Gallic War'', ''The Conquest of Gaul'', and ''The Gallic War''.

==Motivations==
The victories in Gaul won by Caesar had increased the alarm and hostility of his enemies at [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and his aristocratic enemies, the [[Optimates|boni]], were spreading rumors about his intentions once he returned from Gaul.  The boni intended to prosecute Caesar for abuse of his authority upon his return, when he would lay down his imperium.  Such prosecution would not only see Caesar stripped of his wealth and citizenship, but also negate all of the laws he enacted during his term as Consul and his dispositions as pro-consul of Gaul.  To defend himself against these threats, Caesar knew he needed the support of the [[plebeian]]s, particularly the Tribunes of the Plebs, on whom he chiefly relied for help in carrying out his agenda. The ''Commentaries'' were an effort by Caesar to directly communicate with the plebeians – thereby circumventing the usual channels of communication that passed through the Senate – to propagandize his activities as efforts to increase the glory and influence of Rome.  By winning the support of the people, Caesar sought to make himself unassailable from the boni.&lt;ref name=Americana&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Cæsar's Commentaries|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motifs and Peoples in the De Bello Gallico==

=== Leaders of the Gallic Tribes ===
In the Commentarii de Bello Gallico [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] mentions several leaders of the Gallic tribes.  Among these, [[Diviciacus (Aedui)|Diviciacus]] and [[Vercingetorix]] are notable for their contributions to the [[Gaul]]s during war.

==== Diviciacus ====
Book 1 and Book 6 detail the importance of Diviciacus, a leader of the [[Aedui|Haedui]] (Aedui), which lies mainly in the friendly relationship between Caesar and Diviciacus ''[Diviciaci] quod ex Gallis ei maximam fidem [Caesar] habebat'' (I, 18). His brother, [[Dumnorix]] had committed several acts against the Romans because he wanted to become king ''quod eorum adventu potentia eius deminuta et Diviciacus frater in antiquum locum gratiae atque honoris sit restitutus'' and ''summam in spem per Helvetios regni obtinendi venire'' (I, 41); thus Caesar was able to make his alliance with Diviciacus even stronger by sparing Dumnorix from punishment while also forcing Diviciacus to control his own brother. Diviciacus had, in tears, begged Caesar to spare the life of his brother, and Caesar saw an opportunity to not only fix his major problem with Dumnorix, but also to strengthen the relationship between Rome and one of its small allies. Another major action taken by Diviciacus was his imploring of Caesar to take action against the Germans and their leader, [[Ariovistus]]. His fear of Ariovistus and the general outcry from the Gallic people led Caesar to launch a campaign against the Germans, even though they had been considered friends of the Republic.

==== Vercingetorix ====
[[File:Inauguration statue vercingétorix.JPG|left|thumb|Statue of Vercingetorix, erected in 1903 in Clermont-Ferrand, France]]
Vercingetorix, leader of the [[Arverni]], united the Gallic tribes against Caesar during the winter of 53-52 BC. This appears in Book VII, chapters 1-13. Vercingetorix's father, Celtillus, was killed after attempting to seize power amongst the Arverni; for that reason, Vercingetorix was a social outcast and had much to gain from a rebellion. When it was clear that Caesar had defeated the Gallic rebellion, Vercingetorix offered to sacrifice himself, and put himself at the mercy of Caesar, in order to ensure that his kinsmen were spared. After the defeat, Vercingetorix was brought to Rome and imprisoned for six years before being brought out to adorn Caesar's triumph over Gaul and then publicly executed. Today, Vercingetorix is seen in the same light as others who opposed Roman conquest; he is now considered a national hero in France and a model patriot.

=== The Germanic Peoples ===

In De Bello Gallico 6.21-28, Julius Caesar provides his audience with a picture of Germanic lifestyle and culture. He depicts the Germans as primitive hunter gatherers with diets mostly consisting of meat and dairy products who only celebrate earthly gods such as the sun, fire, and the moon (6.21-22). German women reportedly wear small cloaks of deer hides and bathe in the river naked with their fellow men, yet their culture celebrates men who abstain from sex for as long as possible (6.21). Caesar concludes in chapters 25-28 by describing the Germans living in the almost-mythological Hercynian forest full of ox with horns in the middle of their foreheads, elks without joints or ligatures, and uri who kill every man they come across.

However, the distinguishing characteristic of the Germans for Caesar, as described in chapters 23 and 24, is their warring nature, which they believe is a sign of true valour (''hoc proprium virtutis existimant'', 6.23). The Germans have no neighbors, because they have driven everyone out from their surrounding territory (''civitatibus maxima laus est quam latissime circum se vastatis finibus solitudines habere'', 6.23). Their greatest political power resides in the wartime magistrates, who have power over life and death (''vitae necisque habeant potestatem'', 6.23). While Caesar certainly respects the warring instincts of the Germans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polito|first1=Robert|title=Caesar, the Germani, and Rome|journal=Hyperboreus|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=107–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wants his readers to see that their cultures are simply too barbaric, especially when contrasted with the high-class Gallic Druids described at the beginning of chapter six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=Armario|last2=Javier|first2=Francisco|title=El Barbaro: La Gran Innovacion De Julio Cesar|journal=Latomus|date=2002|volume=61|issue=3|pages=577–588}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Caesar writes that robberies committed outside of the state are legalized in hopes of teaching young people discipline and caution, an idea nearly offensive to the judicial practices of the Romans (''ea iuventutis exercendae ac desidiae minuendae causa fieri praedicant'', 6.23). Caesar's generalizations, alongside the writings of Tacitus, form the barbaric identity of the Germans for the ancient world. The name "Germani" is even of Roman origins, showing how the identity of the Germans is tilted by Roman perceptions and prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Peter|editor1-first=Larissa|editor1-last=Bonfante|editor1-link=Larissa Bonfante|title=The Barbarians of Ancient Europe: Realities and Interactions|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=211–232|chapter=The Ancient Germans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Druids  ===
Caesar's account of the Druids and the "superstitions" of the Gallic nations are documented in book six chapters 13, 14 and 16-18 in De Bello Gallico.  In chapter 13 he mentions the importance of Druids in the culture and social structure of Gaul at the time of his conquest. Chapter 14 addresses the education of the Druids and the high social standing that comes with their position. He first comments on the role of sacrificial practices in their daily lives in chapter 16. Caesar highlights the sacrificial practices of the Druids containing innocent people and the large sacrificial ceremony where hundreds of people were burnt alive at one time to protect the whole from famine, plague, and war (DBG 6.16). Chapter 17 and 18 focuses on the divinities the Gauls believed in and Dis, the god which they claim they were descended from. This account of the Druids highlights Caesar's interest in the order and importance of the Druids in Gaul.

Caesar spent a great amount of time in Gaul and is one of the best preserved accounts of the Druids from an author who was in Gaul.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=Jane|date=1999|title=At the End of the World: Druidic and Other Revitalization Movements in Post-Conquest Gaul and Britain|url=|journal=Britannia|volume=30|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Caesar provides what is seemingly a first-hand account, much of his knowledge of the Druids is not from personal experience, but rather the hearsay of others and is regarded as anachronistic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Caesar based some of his account after that of Posidonius, who wrote a clear and well-known account of the Druids in Gaul.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Caesar provides his account of the Druids as a means of sharing his knowledge and educating the Roman people on the foreign conquests.

There is no doubt that the Druids offered sacrifices to their god. However, scholars are still uncertain about what they would offer. Caesar, along with other Roman authors, assert that the Druids would offer human sacrifices on numerous occasions for relief from disease and famine or for a successful war campaign. Caesar provides a detailed account of the manner in which the supposed human sacrifices occurred in chapter 16, claiming that "they have images of immense size, the limbs of which are framed with twisted twigs and filled with living persons.  These being set on fire, those within are encompassed by the flames" (DBG 6.16).

Caesar, however, also observes and mentions a civil Druid culture. In chapter 13, he claims that they select a single leader who ruled until his death, and a successor would be chosen by a vote or through violence. Also, in chapter 13, the famed Roman also mentions that the druids observed "the stars and their movements, the size of the cosmos and the earth, the world of nature, and the powers of deities," signifying to the Roman people that the druids were also versed in astrology, cosmology, and theology. Although Caesar is one of the few primary sources on the druids, many believe that he had used his influence to portray the druids to the Roman people as both barbaric, as they perform human sacrifices, and civilized in order to depict the Druids as a society worth assimilating to Rome (DBG 6.16).

=== Vorenus and Pullo ===
Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo were two centurions in the garrison of [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]], brother of [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], and are mentioned in Book 5.44 of De Bello Gallico. They were bitter rivals who both sought to achieve the greatest honors "and every year used to contend for promotion with the utmost animosity" [''omnibusque annis de locis summis simultatibus contendebant''] (''DBG'' 5.44). Their garrison had come under siege during a rebellion by the tribes of the [[Belgae]] led by [[Ambiorix]]. They showed their prowess during this siege by jumping from the wall and directly into the enemy despite being completely outnumbered. During the fighting, they both find themselves in difficult positions and are forced to save each other, first Vorenus saving Pullo and then Pullo saving Vorenus. Through great bravery they are both able to make it back alive slaying many enemies in the process. They return to the camp showered in praise and honors by their fellow soldiers. The phrase, ''Sic fortuna in contentione et certamine utrumque versavit, ut alter alteri inimicus auxilio salutique esset, neque diiudicari posset, uter utri virtute anteferendus videretur'', is used to emphasize that though they started out in competition, they both showed themselves to be worthy of the highest praise and equal to each other in bravery (''DBG'' 5.44).

Caesar uses this anecdote to illustrate the courage and bravery of his soldiers. Since his forces had already been humiliated and defeated in previous engagements, he needed to report a success story to Rome that would lift the spirits of the people. Furthermore, the tale of unity on the battlefield between two personal rivals is in direct opposition to the disunity of [[Quintus Titurius Sabinus|Sabinus]] and [[Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta|Cotta]], which resulted in the destruction of an entire legion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Robert|date=2004|title=Virtus Consili Expers: An Interpretation of the Centurions' Contest in Caesar, De Bello Gallico 5, 44.|jstor=4477610|journal=Hermes|volume=132|pages=292–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; He relates this particular account to illustrate that despite the losses against Ambiorix and his army Rome is still able to trust in the valor of its soldiers. Thus, Caesar turns a horrifying military blunder into a positive propaganda story.

===Hostages exchanges===
In the first two books of ''De bello Gallico'', there are seven examples of hostage exchanges. First, the Helveti exchange hostages with the [[Sequani]] as a promise that the Sequani will let the Helveti pass and that the Helveti will not cause mischief (1.9 and 1.19).  The [[Helvetii|Helveti]] also give Caesar hostages to ensure that the Helveti keep their promises (1.14).  Then the [[Aedui]] gave hostages to the Sequani, during the Sequani's rise to power (1.31).  In book two, the [[Belgae]] were exchanging hostages to create an alliance against Rome (2.1) and  the [[Remi]] offered Caesar hostages in their surrender (2.3, 2.5).  Later in the book Caesar receives 600 hostages from the Aedui (2.15) and other hostages from most of Gaul (2.35).  This practice of exchanging hostages continues to be used throughout Caesar's campaigns in diplomacy and foreign policy.

Today the term [[hostage]] has a different connotation than it did for the Ancient Romans, which is shown in the examples above.  Where the Romans did take prisoners of war, hostages could also be given or exchanged in times of peace.  The taking of hostages as collateral during political arrangements was a common practice in ancient Rome.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=A. D.|date=1991|title=The Role of Hostages in Roman Diplomacy with Sasanian Persia|url=|journal=Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte|volume=40|pages=366–374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the practice was that important people from each side were given to ensure that both sides kept their word; a type of contract.  Two examples of this is when Caesar demands the children of chieftains (2.5) and accepted the two sons of King Galba (2.13).  However, as seen by Caesar, sometimes it was only a one-way exchange, with Caesar taking hostages but not giving any.

There is evidence though, particularly in Caesar's ''De bello Gallico'', indicating that the practice wasn't always effective. Cities often moved to revolt against Rome, even though hostages were in Roman custody. Occasionally, hostages would be entrusted to a neutral or mediating party during a revolt, such as the time one hundred hostages surrendered by the Senones were placed in the custody of the Aedui who helped negotiate between the revolters and Caesar.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moscovich|first=M.J.|date=December 1979 – January 1980|title=Obsidibus Traditis: Hostages in Caesar's De Bello Gallico|url=|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=75|pages=122–128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources say there isn't much evidence that hostages were even harmed, at least severely, in retribution of the broken agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is commonly noted that Caesar never mentions penalties being dealt to hostages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Taking hostages did benefit Rome in one particular way: since hostages were commonly the sons of political figures and would typically be under Roman watch for a year or more, Romans had ample time to introduce those hostages to the Roman customs in hopes that when they were freed, they would go on to become influential political leaders themselves and favor Rome in subsequent foreign relations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Modern influence==
[[File:Julii Caesaris quae exstant.tif|thumb|C. Iulii Caesaris quae extant, 1678]]

===Educational use===
This book is often lauded for its polished, clear [[Latin]]; in particular, German historian Hans Herzfeld describes the work as "a paradigm of proper reporting and stylistic clarity".&lt;ref&gt;''Caesar''. In {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Herzfeld|de|vertical-align=sup}} (1960): ''Geschichte in Gestalten'' (''History in figures''), vol. 1: ''A-E''. {{Interlanguage link multi|Das Fischer Lexikon|de|vertical-align=sup}} 37, Frankfurt 1963, p. 214. "Hauptquellen [betreffend Caesar]: Caesars eigene, wenn auch leicht tendenziöse Darstellungen des Gallischen und des Bürgerkrieges, die Musterbeispiele sachgemäßer Berichterstattung und stilistischer Klarheit sind" ("''Main sources [regarding Caesar]: Caesar's own, even though slightly tendentious depictions of the Gallic and the Civil Wars, which are paradigms of pertinent information and stylistic clarity''")&lt;/ref&gt;
It is traditionally the first authentic text assigned to students of Latin, as [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' is for students of [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]; they are both autobiographical tales of military adventure told in the third person. It contains many details and employs many stylistic devices to promote Caesar's political interests.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Albrecht, Michael v.: ''Geschichte der römischen Literatur Band 1'' (History of Roman Literature, Volume 1). Munich 1994, 2nd ed., p. 332–334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The books are valuable for the many geographical and historical claims that can be retrieved from the work. Notable chapters describe Gaulish custom (VI, 13), their religion (VI, 17), and a comparison between Gauls and Germanic peoples (VI, 24).

===''Astérix''===
Since Caesar is one of the characters in the ''[[Asterix|Astérix and Obélix]]'' albums, [[René Goscinny]] included [[humour in Asterix|gags]] for French schoolchildren who had the ''Commentarii'' as a textbook, even though Latin was then disappearing from French schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reception of Ancient Greece and Rome in Children's Literature: Heroes and Eagles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJ-XCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA301|date=17 September 2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-29860-6|pages=301–}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is having Caesar talk about himself in the third person as in the book.

Most English editions of Asterix begin with the prelude: "The year is 50 BC. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well not entirely! One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders." In the 36th book of the Asterix series, ''[[Asterix and the Missing Scroll]]'', a fictitious and supposedly censored chapter from Caesar's ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' forms the basis for the story.

===Vorenus and Pullo===
In Book 5, Chapter 44 the ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' notably mentions [[Lucius Vorenus]] and [[Titus Pullo]], two [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[centurion]]s of the [[Legio XI Claudia|11th Legion]].&lt;ref&gt;Prior to its demobilization and subsequent remobilization by [[Augustus]]—see also [[List of Roman legions#Republican and Imperatorial legions|Republican and Imperatorial legions]]. [[Julius Caesar]], ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5#44|5.44]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2005 [[television series]] [[Rome (TV series)|''Rome'']] gives a fictionalized account of Caesar's rise and fall, featuring [[Kevin McKidd]] as the [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|character of Lucius Vorenus]] and [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] as the [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|character of Titus Pullo]] of the [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion]].

===Vincent d'Indy===
During [[World War I]] the French composer [[Vincent d'Indy]] wrote his Third Symphony, which bears the title ''De Bello Gallico''. D'Indy was adapting Caesar's title to the situation of the current struggle in France against the German army, in which he had a son and nephew fighting, and which the music illustrates to some extent.

== Manuscripts and publication history ==
Since the work of [[Karl Nipperdey]] in 1847, the existing manuscripts have been divided into two classes. The first (α) encompasses manuscripts containing only ''De Bello Gallico'' and characterized  by collophons with allusions to late antique ''correctores''. The oldest manuscript in this class is MS. Amsterdam 73, written at [[Fleury Abbey]] in the later ninth century. The second (β) encompasses manuscripts containing all of the related works—not only ''De Bello Gallico'', but ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|De Bello Civili]]'', ''[[De Bello Alexandrino]]'', ''[[De Bello Africo]]'', and ''[[De Bello Hispaniensi]]'', always in that order. The oldest manuscript in this class is MS Paris lat. 3864, written at Corbie in the last quarter of the ninth century. For ''De Bello Gallico'', the readings of α are considered better than β.&lt;ref name=Winterbottom-35&gt;Michael Winterbottom, "Caesar", in ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[editio princeps]]'' was published by [[Giovanni Andrea Bussi]] at Rome in 1469.&lt;ref name=Winterbottom-35/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7537">'''Comparative effectiveness research''' ('''CER''') is the direct comparison of existing [[health care]] interventions to determine which work best for which patients and which pose the greatest benefits and harms. The core question of comparative effectiveness research is which treatment works best, for whom, and under what circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greenfield |first=S |last2=Rich |first2=E |date=2012 |title=Welcome to the Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research |url=http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/cer.11.13 |journal=Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |doi=10.2217/cer.11.13 | pmid=24237290 |name-list-format=vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Medicine]] committee has defined CER as "the generation and synthesis of evidence that compares the benefits and harms of alternative methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition or to improve the delivery of care. The purpose of CER is to assist consumers, clinicians, purchasers, and policy makers to make informed decisions that will improve health care at both the individual and population levels."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12648&amp;page=29 Initial National Priorities for Comparative Effectiveness Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative effectiveness research adopts many of the same approaches and methodologies as [[cost-effectiveness analysis]], including the use of [[incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]]s (ICERs) and [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs). An important component of CER is the concept of pragmatic [[Randomized controlled trial|randomised controlled trials]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/316/7127/285|title=Understanding controlled trials: What are pragmatic trials?|doi=10.1136/bmj.316.7127.285|journal=BMJ|year=1998|volume=316|issue=7127|page=285|author1=Roland, M.|author2=Torgerson, D. J.|pmc=2665488|pmid=9472515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[clinical research]] trials measure the benefit produced by the treatment in routine [[clinical practice]].

==In the United States==
Researchers at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy, in addition to the Congressional Budget Office, have documented a large gap in the quality and outcomes and health services being delivered. [[Unwarranted variation]] in medical treatment, cost, and outcomes suggests a substantial area for improvement and savings in our health care system.  Statistical findings show that "patients in the highest-spending regions of the country receive 60 percent more health services than those in the lowest-spending regions, yet this additional care is not associated with improved outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12648&amp;page=30 Fisher et al., 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;  New models of shared decision making promise to bring greater emphasis to informed patient choice for "preference-sensitive" care, improving quality, safety, and effectiveness of health care by providing both patients and their health care providers with the evidence to assist in informed decision making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12648&amp;page=31 Wennberg et al., 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, $1.1 billion of President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus package]] was earmarked for CER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/health/policy/16health.html | title=U.S. to Compare Medical Treatments | work=The New York Times | date=February 15, 2009 | accessdate=July 16, 2016 | author=Pear, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was initial disagreement regarding whether CER will be used to limit patient health care options,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123423024203966081 | title=Drug Makers Fight Stimulus Provision | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=February 10, 2009 | accessdate=July 16, 2016 | author=Mundy, Alicia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or help lower health care costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0901355?query=current&amp;rss=1&amp; | title=Does Comparative-Effectiveness Research Threaten Personalized Medicine? | vauthors=Garber AM, Tunis SR | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2009 | volume=360 | issue=19 | pages=1925–1927 | doi=10.1056/NEJMp0901355 | pmid=19420360}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately the bill approved by Senate contains measures to utilize CER as a means for increasing quality while reducing rising costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Science Magazine |title= Comparative Effectiveness Research Boosted in Health Care Bill|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencecareers/2010/03/comparative-eff.html|date=March 22, 2010|author=Kotok, Alan| accessdate=July 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cq.com/display.do?docid=3098444&amp;productId=5&amp;binderName=healthbeat-20090417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Initial National Priorities for Comparative Effectiveness Research |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12648|year=2009|isbn=978-0-309-13836-9 |doi=10.17226/12648 |authors=Committee on Comparative Effectiveness Research Prioritization; Board on Health Care Services; Institute of Medicine|publisher=The National Assemblies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups have emerged to provide leadership in the area of Comparative Effectiveness Research. The [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) is a [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]] focused on health care quality. The [[Institute for Clinical and Economic Review]] provides independent evaluation of the clinical effectiveness and comparative value of health care interventions, while also overseeing the [[New England Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council]] (CEPAC), an independent body of physicians and patient representatives that aids patients, physicians and policymakers in the application and use of comparative effectiveness information to improve the quality and value of healthcare in the region.

The [[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]] (PCORI) was established to conduct comparative effectiveness research but the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) prohibits it from using cost per QALY ICER thresholding.  The PPACA states:
:The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute...shall not develop or employ a dollars per quality adjusted life year (or similar measure that discounts the value of a life because of an individual's disability) as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended.

===Comparing key measures utilized in comparative effectiveness research===
The study of comparative effectiveness research (CER) is composed of measures that are useful in determining the value of various treatment options.  While each of these measures provides a useful comparison of one treatment option versus another, they require different inputs into their respective calculations, thus the potential for producing conflicting results.  In part, due to these challenges, there remains a widespread lack of understanding on the potential impact of CER in the U.S., and a reluctance to fully adopt the concept as part of our healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mushlin|author2=Ghomrawi|title=Health care reform and the need for comparative-effectiveness research|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|year=2010|volume=362|issue=3|doi=10.1056/nejmp0912651 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several crucial differences between [[Lojban]] and [[Loglan]], two [[constructed languages]]. The main one is of the sounding of the core words, which, however, have similar phonotactics in both languages. Most grammatical particles also sound differently. Lojban alphabet lacks the letters ''q'', ''w'', ''h'', but has the letter ''x'' and ' ([[apostrophe]]) (the last two absent in Loglan).

==History==
[[James Cooke Brown]] called his language ''[[Loglan]]'', and The Loglan Institute (TLI), the organization that he established, continues to call its language Loglan. [[Lojban|The Logical Language Group]] called their project "Lojban: A Realization of Loglan"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lojban.org/files/history/lojban10.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju'i_lobypli_li'u_4_moi#LOJBAN_-_A_Realization_of_Loglan&lt;/ref&gt; and considers Lojban a version of Loglan.&lt;ref&gt;https://lojban.github.io/cll/1/1/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Loglan is now also a generic term that refers both to Dr. Brown's ''Loglan'', and all languages descended from it.--&gt;Therefore, it is necessary to state that this page uses the term ''Loglan'' specifically to the TLI language, instead of the entire family of languages.

==Lexicon==
The principal difference between Lojban and Loglan is one of lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Loglan Lojban vs Loglan comparison]&lt;/ref&gt; A Washington DC splinter group, which later formed The Logical Language Group, LLG, decided in 1986 to remake the entire vocabulary of Loglan in order to evade Dr. Brown's claim of copyright to the language. After a lengthy battle in court, his claim to copyright was ruled invalid. But by then, the new vocabulary was already cemented as a part of the new language, which was called ''Lojban: A realization of Loglan'' by its supporters.&lt;ref&gt;https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban_timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

The closed set of five-letter words was the first part of the vocabulary to be remade. The words for Lojban were made by the same principles as those for Loglan; that is, candidate forms were chosen according to how many sounds they had in common with their equivalent in some of the most commonly spoken languages on Earth, which was then multiplied by the number of speakers of the languages with which the words had letters in common. The difference with the Lojban remake of the root words was that the weighting was updated to reflect the actual numbers of speakers for the languages. This resulted in word forms that had fewer sounds taken from English, and more sounds taken from Chinese. For instance, the Loglan word ''norma'' is equivalent to the Lojban word ''{{lang|jbo|cnano}}'' (cf. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] 常, [[pinyin]] ''cháng''), both meaning "normal".

Grammatical particles were gradually added to Lojban as the grammatical description of the language was made.&lt;ref&gt;https://mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju%27i_lobypli_li%27u_4_moi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Loglan and Lojban still have essentially the same grammars, and most of what can be said in the [[Lojban#Grammar|short description of the Lojban grammar]] holds true for Loglan as well. Most simple, declarative sentences could be translated word by
word between the two languages; but the grammars differ in the details, and in their formal foundations. The grammar of Lojban is defined mostly in the language definition formalism [[Parsing Expression Grammar]] and [[YACC]], with a few formal "pre-processing" rules.&lt;ref&gt;https://mw.lojban.org/papri/the_Loglan-Lojban_Dispute&lt;/ref&gt; Loglan also has a machine grammar, but it is not definitive; it is based on a relatively small corpus of sentences that has remained unchanged through the decades, which takes precedence in case of a discrepancy.

The baselining of Lojban grammar may give it an advantage compared to Loglan in applying the language to practical uses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.loglan.org/Articles2/future-of-loglan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
There are also many differences in the terminology used in English to talk about the two languages. In his writings, Brown used many terms based on English, Latin and Greek, some of which were already established with a slightly different meaning. On the other hand, the Lojban camp freely borrowed grammatical terms from Lojban itself. For example, what linguists call ''roots'' or ''[[root word]]s'', Loglanists call ''primitives'' or ''prims'', and Lojbanists call ''{{lang|jbo|gismu}}''. The ''lexeme'' of Loglan and ''{{lang|jbo|selma'o}}'' of Lojban have nothing to do with the [[linguistic meaning]] of ''[[lexeme]]''. It is a kind of [[part of speech]], a subdivision of the set of grammatical words, or particles, which loglanists call ''little words'' and lojbanists ''{{lang|jbo|cmavo}}''. Loglan and Lojban have a grammatical construct called ''metaphor'' and ''tanru'', respectively; this is not really a [[metaphor]], but a kind of modifier-modificand relationship, similar to that of a [[noun adjunct]] and noun. A borrowed word in Loglan is simply called a ''borrowing''; but in English discussions of Lojban, the Lojban word ''{{lang|jbo|fu'ivla}}'' is used. This is probably because in Lojban, unlike Loglan, a certain set of CV templates is reserved for borrowed words.

==Phonology==
In the new phonology for Lojban, the consonant ''q'' and the vowel ''w'' were removed, and the consonant ''h'' was replaced by ''x''. The consonant ' ([[apostrophe]]) was added with the value of [h] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], but its distribution is such that it can appear only intervocally, and in discussions of the morphology and phonotactics, it is described not as a proper consonant, but a "voiceless glide". (This phoneme is realized as [θ] by some speakers.) A rigid [[phonotactics|phonotactical]] system was made for Lojban, but Loglan does not seem to have had such a system.

==Features==

Information on what features each of the clients support.

===General features===

For all of these clients, the concept of "HTML support" does not mean that they can process the full range of HTML that a web browser can handle. Almost all email readers limit HTML features, either for security reasons, or because of the nature of the interface. CSS and JavaScript can be especially problematic.

{{reflist|group=Note|refs=
&lt;ref name=recode&gt;It's a frequent problem for people dealing with [[Cyrillic]]/[[Russian language|Russian]] in email messages that the message is not encoded in the encoding declared in its headers and thus can't be read. With such a message (with a wrong declaration of the encoding), it well might be the case that it passed through several incorrect recoding stages while it was being sent and delivered; thus it's not possible to correctly render it and read it if one uses the common type of the interface for choosing the encoding (such as the menu in [[Mozilla Firefox]]). An example of such a complex case of a wrongly declared encoding: a message was entered through a webform in the [[windows-1251]] encoding, but the web interface incorrectly assumed that it was in [[latin-1]]; based on this assumption, it performed the recoding from latin-1 to [[utf-8]]. The result of this operation cannot be correctly decoded through the common encoding-selection interface; it can only be decoded through a two-stage recoding: first from utf-8 to latin-1, then from windows-1251 to utf-8 (assuming that one works in a Unicode environment). After it is decoded, it is desirable to store it in the recoded form instead of the original, in order to be able to read it easily afterwards, and to quote it for replies.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=PINE_spell&gt;Pine supports full integration with [[GNU Aspell]] or other external speller, which is its requirement for spell checking.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=PINE_recode&gt;The recoding engine and interface extensions that would solve the described recoding problems have been developed as a patch for Pine; it is to be found in the package [http://sisyphus.ru/en/srpm/Branch3/pine/get pine-4.58L-alt4.src.rpm]([ftp://ftp.altlinux.org/pub/distributions/ALTLinux/3.0/files/SRPMS/pine-4.58L-alt4.src.rpm ftp]) for [[ALTLinux]] (under the name &lt;code&gt;[http://sisyphus.ru/en/srpm/Branch3/pine/patches/1 pine-4.58L-alt2-0.4.1.diff]&lt;/code&gt;). Its essential feature is to enable to forcibly recode messages, save them in the recoded form, and quote in replies.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=SCRIBE_spell&gt;i.Scribe / InScribe supports full integration with [[GNU Aspell]], which is its requirement for spell checking.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=SCRIBE_jpeg&gt;i.Scribe / InScribe requires [[libjpeg]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=SCRIBE_png&gt;i.Scribe / InScribe requires [[libpng]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=eragenotes&gt;Entourage can link a message to a note.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=TbirdSl8Tr&gt;Thunderbird requires SL8TR extension.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Thunderbird_reply_format&gt;Configurable to start replies at top or bottom, with separate configuration of signature position&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Pegasus_reply_format&gt;Starts replies with cursor at top, but is configurable regarding whether to include a blank space at the top for replies or not; some interleaved-posting users prefer starting the cursor at the top so they can trim the quotes&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Lotus_frag&gt;Fragmented messages are called ''truncated document'' in Lotus Notes.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=MulberryDB&gt;Mulberry is a dedicated IMAP client; If the IMAP server has these abilities, Mulberry can use them.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=MulberryMBox&gt;This is for Mulberry's 'offline browsing' capability, which is turned off by default. In the default configuration no local copy of the mail is created.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Searchfolders&gt;Search Folders are virtual folders that contain views of all email items matching specific search criteria. Search Folders display the results of previously defined search queries.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Keybindings&gt;Editable keybindings is part of GNOME, provided "Editable menu accelerators" is enabled in GNOME's "Menus &amp; Toolbars" control applet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=FragmentedMessages&gt;Fragmented messages make it possible, for example, to send a large audio message as several partial messages, and still have it appear to the recipient as a simple audio message rather than as an encapsulated message containing an audio message. {{IETF RFC|2046}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=GrepMH&gt;Because MH stores each letter in a separate file, it is trivially easy to (externally) search them with grep. This ease is shattered when non-raw encodings are used, such as base64.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=TBEncryptedDB&gt;The Bat! Pro support two methods access to program when database is encrypted: password authorization and token authorization; Voyager support only password authorization and encrypted database is default and only available storage method.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=TBThemes&gt;Thunderbird's interface can be user customized via the use of themes (which can reposition and skin controls)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=MSO&gt;supported since [[Microsoft Office 2007|Office 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=eragebackups&gt;With Entourage 2008, you can use AppleScript and various internal/external scheduling mechanisms to create timed backups of Entourage Data.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=eragedbgrepsearch&gt;With Entourage 2008 and later versions of 2004, you can use the Spotlight data to search what's in the Entourage database via regular expression in the file system in Terminal or via Spotlight's ...interesting...version of "regular expressions".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---Unused notes
&lt;ref name=MSO_enc&gt; when best encryption is used, .pst file cannot be read by a [[hex editor]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Mail_search&gt;with Spotlight macOS v. 10.4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Mail_search2&gt;Search folders is called ''Smart Folders'' in Mail on macOS v. 10.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A [[nominal type system]] means that the language decides whether types are compatible and/or equivalent based on explicit declarations and names.
* A [[structural type system]] means that the language decides whether types are compatible and/or equivalent based on the definition and characteristics of the types.
* ''Type checking'' determines whether and when types are verified. Static checking means that type errors are reported based on a program's text (source code). Dynamic checking means that type errors are reported based on a program's dynamic (run-time) behavior.

'''DISCO – European Dictionary of Skills and Competences''' is a structured [[vocabulary]] for the description of skills and [[Competence (human resources)|competences]] in different contexts such as [[labour market]], [[education]], and training, and the recognition of qualifications. DISCO provides a skills and competences classification that is neither linked to occupations nor to qualifications. Instead it functions as a [[thesaurus]] of skills and competences which is based on existing international standards and classifications and thus represents a terminological basis for the description of skills and competences, occupations as well as personal skill profiles and [[Curriculum vitae|CVs]], job vacancies, and job requirements or for describing [[Curriculum|curricula]], courses, Diploma and Certificate Supplements or learning outcomes in general. Available in ten language versions (CZ, DE, EN, ES, FR, HU, IT, LT, SE, SK), DISCO is meant to support transnational comparability of competences acquired in an educational or work context throughout Europe.

== Development ==
DISCO was developed in two projects funded by the [[Leonardo da Vinci programme]] and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmukk.gv.at/ |title=bm:ukk - Homepage |publisher=Bmukk.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both projects were carried out together with partners from Austria,  Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Spain and Sweden. DISCO I took place between September 2004 and February 2008. DISCO II started in November 2010 and ended in October 2012. During the first DISCO project, the following main results have been achieved:

* a multilingual [[thesaurus]] of skills and competences (CZ, DE, EN, FR, HU, LT, SE)
* a website (www.disco-tools.eu) including:
:- search and translation of single terms
:- multilingual tree-structure view of the thesaurus for experts
:- a tool for the creation/translation of competence profiles, [[Europass]] CV, Mobility Passes
* a trilingual print version of the thesaurus (DE, EN, FR)

The DISCO thesaurus is based on a comprehensive understanding of skills and competences that include professional competences, personal [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[values]], behavioural patterns etc. independent of whether they have been acquired formally, non-formally or informally. It consists of about 10,000 terms (about 7,000 preferred terms and 3,000 synonyms) per language for ten European languages: Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Slovak, Spanish and Swedish. Related terms refer to each other where appropriate. The prototypical DISCO I thesaurus has above all focused on the development of a reasonable structure for each field which could be broadened and enlarged with more terms.
DISCO has been developed in accordance with several already existing European skills/competence classifications and standards such as the following national classifications of project partner countries, and international classifications:
* AMS-Qualifikationsklassifikation (Austria)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.at/bis/ |title=Berufsinformationssystem des AMS |publisher=Ams.at |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kompetenzenkatalog (GE)
* Répertoire Opérationnel des Métiers et des Emplois – ROME (France)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.pole-emploi.fr/espacecandidat/romeligne/RliIndex.do |title=Les fiches métiers |publisher=pole-emploi.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxonomy database of Arbetsförmedlingen (Sweden)
* EURES CV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eures/home.jsp?lang=en&amp;langChanged=true |title=EUROPA - EURES - the European Job Mobility Portal |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Standard Classification of Education]] 1997

== Use ==
Using DISCO to describe learning outcomes is an important focus of the DISCO II follow-up project. Job descriptions, CVs, Certificate Supplements as well as other competence-based learning outcomes descriptions use similar terms to describe competences in the area of labour market or education and training. The least common denominator is a single competence term, the greatest common denominator is a phraseological competence description consisting, from a linguistic point of view, of a verb and an object, and possibly context information or attributive enlargements. In DISCO II, the project partnership used Certificate Supplements and other relevant skills profiles and extracted a list of relevant phraseological competence descriptions for the sectors of [[health care]], [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], [[environmental protection]] and [[Care work|social services]]. The minimal skills and competence phrases collected within DISCO II are applicable in the field of education, but also for describing tasks in job vacancies and similar job requirement documents as well as in qualifications, vocational or occupational profiles. The vocabulary available through DISCO – i.e. based on skills/competences – is used to describe occupational as well as qualifications information. 
Within the ongoing ESCO development – European Skills/Competences, qualifications and Occupations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=852 |title=Contribute to the development of a European multilingual classification of jobs and skills - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; – DISCO is used as one of the sources to enhance the skills/competence pillar.

DISCO is also used in several European projects dealing with mobility and transparency of skills and competences, such as YOMTOOL (Youth on the Move Toolkit) or Skillsbank (an ECVET&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-policy/ecvet_en.htm |title=European Commission - The European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; oriented toolkit targeting career guidance and individual training support).

On national level, DISCO is used at the Hungarian Europass Centre where the English/French/German/Hungarian-language versions are used for the 'Europass CV wizzard' that utilises DISCO as an integrated online glossary for the Europass CV. In Austria, the Software Competence Centre Hagenberg uses DISCO for developing innovative online job placement software.

'''Diplomatic correspondence''' is correspondence between one state and another, usually – though not exclusively – of a formal character. It follows several widely observed customs and style in composition, substance, presentation, and delivery and can generally be categorized into letters and notes.

==Letters==
Letters are correspondence between [[head of state|heads of state]], typically used for the appointment and recall of ambassadors; for the announcement of the [[Demise of the Crown|death of a sovereign]] or an accession to the throne; or for expressions of congratulations or condolence.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt; 

Letters between two monarchs of equal rank will typically begin with the salutation "Sir My Brother" (or "Madame My Sister", in the case of a female monarch) and close with the valediction "Your Good Brother" (or Sister, in the case of a female monarch). In the case where one monarch is of inferior rank to the other (for instance, if the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] were to correspond to the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]]), the inferior monarch will use the salutation "Sire" (or "Madame"), while the superior monarch may refer to the other as "Cousin" instead of "Brother".&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;  If either the sender or the recipient is the head-of-state of a [[republic]], letters may begin with the salutation "My Great and Good Friend" and close with the valediction "Your Good Friend"; beneath the signature line will be inscribed "To Our Great and Good Friend [Name and Title of Recipient]".&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

===Letters of credence===

Ms Quentin Alice Louise Bryce. 28.03.2013 (8597769358).jpg|thumb|right|Estonian ambassador to [[Australia]] Andres Unga presents his letter of credence to Governor-General [[Quentin Bryce]] in 2013.]]

A '''letter of credence''' (''lettres de créance'') is the instrument by which a [[head of state]] appoints ("accredits") ambassadors to foreign countries.&lt;ref name="Foakes"&gt;Joanne Foakes, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kqXFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 The Position of Heads of State and Senior Officials in International Law]'' (Oxford University Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oppenheim371"&gt;[[Lassa Oppenheim]], ''International Law: A Treatise'' (Vol. 1, 2005: ed. Ronald Roxburgh), § 371, p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as '''credentials''', the letter closes with a phrase "asking that credit may be given to all that the ambassador may say in the name of his [[Monarch|sovereign]] or Government."&lt;ref name="Foakes"/&gt; The credentials are presented personally to the receiving country's head of state or viceroy in a formal ceremony. Letters of credence are worded carefully, as the sending or acceptance of a letter implies [[diplomatic recognition]] of the other government.&lt;ref name="Foakes"/&gt; Letters of credence date to the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Chaplais]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pR58WnXzh-wC&amp;pg=PA246 English Diplomatic Practice in the Middle Ages]'' ([[Hambledon and London]], 2003), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letters of recall===

A letter of recall is formal correspondence from one head-of-state notifying a second head-of-state that he or she is recalling his state's ambassador.

===Full powers===
In cases where an envoy is entrusted with unusually extensive tasks that would not be covered by an ordinary permanent legation (such as the negotiation of a special [[treaty]] or convention, or representation at a diplomatic congress), an envoy may be given [[full powers]] (''pleins pouvoirs'') "in [[letters patent]] signed by the head of the State" designing "either limited or unlimited full powers, according to the requirements of the case."&lt;ref name="Oppenheim371"/&gt;

According to ''Satow's Diplomatic Practice'', the bestowal of full powers traces its history to the Roman ''plena potestas''; its purpose &lt;blockquote&gt;was to be able to dispense, as far as possible, with the long delays needed in earlier times for referring problems back to higher authority. Their use at the present day is a formal recognition of the necessity of absolute confidence in the authority and standing of the negotiator.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Note verbale===
{{main|Note verbale}}
A ''note verbale'' is the most formal form of note and is so-named as it originally represented a formal record of information delivered orally. Notes verbale are written in the third person and printed on official letterhead; they are typically [[seal (emblem)|sealed]] with an embosser or, in some cases, a stamp. All notes verbale begin with a formal [[salutation]], typically:&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

{{cquote|The [name of sending state's] Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has the honor to invite their attention to the following matter.}}

Notes verbales will also close with a formal [[valediction]], typically:&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

{{cquote|The Embassy avails itself of this opportunity of assuring the Ministry of its highest consideration}}

Notes verbales composed by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] are written on blue paper.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

===Collective note===
[[File:GreatSealPressImprinting.jpg|thumb|right|Formal correspondence originating from the U.S. State Department is sealed with the [[Great Seal of the United States]], which is embossed on a paper wafer using this 1903 letterpress.]]
A collective note is a letter delivered from multiple states to a single recipient state. It is always written in the [[Illeism|third person]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acquah-Dadzie|first1=Kofi|title=World Dictionary of Foreign Expressions: A Resource for Readers and Writers|date=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=0865164231|pages=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4ddQNrt8e8C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective note has been a rarely used form of diplomatic communication due to the difficulty in obtaining agreements among multiple states to the exact wording of a letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lloyd|title=The Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Diplomacy|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=1137017619|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jvarq4iy5MoC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identic note===
An identic note is a letter delivered from a single state to multiple recipient states. Examples include the identic note sent by [[Thomas Jefferson]] [[Proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with the Pyratical states of Barbary|regarding action against the Barbary Pirates]] and that from the [[United States]] to [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929. In it, the United States called on the other two powers to resolve their differences over the [[Chinese Eastern Railway|Eastern China Railway]] peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murty|first1=Bhagevatula|title=The International Law of Diplomacy: The Diplomatic Instrument and World Public Order|date=1989|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=0792300831|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvoLbSGNBqsC&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bouts de papier===
A ''bout de papier'' (speaking note) may be presented by a visiting official when meeting with an official from another state at the conclusion of the meeting. Prepared in advance, it contains a short summary of the main points addressed by the visiting official during the meeting and, firstly, serves as a memory aid for the visiting official when speaking. It, secondly, removes ambiguity about the subject of the meeting occasioned by verbal miscues by the visiting official. Bouts de papier are always presented without credit or attribution so as to [[Plausible deniability|preserve the confidentiality]] of the meeting in case the document is later disclosed.&lt;ref name="satow"/&gt;

===Démarches and aides-mémoire===
{{main|démarche|aide-mémoire}}
[[File:Aide-Memoire_handed_by_Lord_Hardinge_to_M._Briand.png|thumb|right|A British foreign office internal record of a 1921 aide-mémoire delivered to [[Aristide Briand]].]]
A ''[[démarche]]'' (non-paper) is considered less formal than the already informal bout de papier. Officially described as "a request or intercession with a foreign official" it is a written request that is presented without attribution from the composing state and is, therefore, delivered in-person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Protocol for the Modern Diplomat|date=2013|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|page=30|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/176174.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to a démarche, an ''[[aide-mémoire]]'' is a proposed agreement or negotiating text circulated informally among multiple states for discussion without committing the originating delegation's country to the contents. It has no identified source, title, or attribution and no standing in the relationship involved.

==Protocol==
[[File:Graf_Clemens_Metternich.jpg|thumb|right|Austrian foreign minister [[Klemens von Metternich]] threatened to correspond to the United Kingdom in German if it sent diplomatic correspondence to him in English, instead of French.]]
Standard diplomatic protocol varies from country to country, but generally requires clear yet concise translation between both parties.

===Language===
The earliest forms of diplomatic correspondence were, out of necessity, written in [[Latin]], Latin being a [[Lingua franca|common language]] among states of a linguistically diverse Europe. By the early 1800s French had firmly supplanted Latin as the language of diplomacy; on one occasion, in 1817, the British attempted to correspond with the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Imperial Court]] in English, prompting [[Klemens von Metternich]] to threaten retaliatory correspondence in [[German language|German]]. In modern times, French has largely been replaced by English as a diplomatic lingua franca in correspondence between two states that do not share a common tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Keith|title=The Practice of Diplomacy: Its Evolution, Theory, and Administration|date=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415497647|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection===
States may sometimes reject diplomatic correspondence addressed to them by returning the original copy to the sending state. This is done as a rebuff of the contents of the correspondence and is typically reserved for cases where the receiving state feels the language used by the sending state is rude, or the subject matter represents an inappropriate intercession into the receiving state's internal affairs.&lt;ref name="satow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Ivor|title=Satow's Diplomatic Practice|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199693552|pages=45–66|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fiddler on the Roof''''' is a 1971 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[comedy-drama]] film produced and directed by [[Norman Jewison]]. It is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the 1964 [[Fiddler on the Roof|Broadway musical of the same name]], with music composed by [[Jerry Bock]], lyrics by [[Sheldon Harnick]], and screenplay by [[Joseph Stein]] and  based on stories by [[Sholem Aleichem]]. Starring [[Chaim Topol|Topol]], [[Norma Crane]], [[Leonard Frey]], [[Molly Picon]], and [[Paul Mann]], the film centers on [[Tevye]], the father of five daughters, and his attempts to maintain his [[Jewish]] religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon the family's lives. He must cope both with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters, who wish to marry for love – each one's choice of a husband moves further away from the customs of his faith – and with the edict of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] who evicts the Jews from the town of Anatevka.

Throughout the film, Tevye talks to God and directly to the audience, breaking the [[fourth wall]]. In these monologues, Tevye ponders tradition, the difficulties of being poor, the Jewish community's constant fear of harassment from their non-Jewish neighbors, and important family decisions.

The film was released to critical acclaim and won three [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Scoring Adaptation and Original Song Score]] for arranger-conductor [[John Williams]]. It was nominated for several more, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Topol as Tevye, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Frey, who played Motel Kamzoil the Tailor. Topol and Frey had performed in stage productions of the musical; Topol as Tevye in the London production and Frey in a minor part as Mendel, the rabbi's son, on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/25/obituaries/leonard-frey-actor-dies-at-49-was-in-fiddler-and-other-films.html| title=Leonard Frey, Actor, Dies at 49; Was in 'Fiddler' and Other Films| first=Mel| last=Gussow| date=August 25, 1988| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film's plot largely follows that of [[Fiddler on the Roof|the musical]] from which it is adapted.

===Act 1===
In 1905, Tevye, a poor Jewish [[milkman]] living in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka, a typical [[shtetl]] in the [[Pale of Settlement]] of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], compares the lives of the Jews of Anatevka to a fiddler on the roof (who appears throughout the film in this metaphorical role), using tradition to "scratch out a pleasant, simple tune" without breaking their necks.

In town, Tevye meets Perchik, a radical [[Marxism|Marxist]] from [[Kiev]], who admonishes them for talking but doing nothing about news of Jews being banished from their villages by the tsar. Tevye invites Perchik to stay with his family, offering him room and board in exchange for Perchik tutoring his daughters.

Tevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel, to marry Lazar Wolf, an older, and widowed, wealthy butcher. Tzeitel is in love with her childhood sweetheart, Motel Kamzoil, and begs her father not to make her marry Lazar Wolf. Although he is initially angry, Tevye realizes that Tzeitel loves Motel and yields to his daughter's demands.

In order to convince his wife Golde that Tzeitel should not be married to Lazar Wolf, Tevye claims to have had a nightmare. He says that Golde's deceased grandmother told him Tzeitel is supposed to marry Motel, and that Lazar Wolf's late wife, Fruma-Sarah, threatened to kill Tzeitel if the two are married. Golde concludes that the dream was a message from their ancestors, and Tzeitel and Motel arrange to be married.

Meanwhile, Tevye's second daughter, Hodel, and Perchik begin to fall in love. They argue over the story of [[Leah]] and the place of old religious traditions in a changing world. The two dance together, which is considered forbidden by Orthodox Jewish tradition. Perchik tells Hodel that they just changed an old tradition.

At Tzeitel and Motel's wedding, an argument breaks out after Lazar Wolf presents the newlyweds with gifts. When Tevye tries to speak to Lazar about the Torah, Lazar refuses to listen, arguing that the wedding should have been his all along. Minutes later, another argument breaks out over whether a girl should be able to choose her own husband. Perchik addresses the crowd and says that, since they love each other, it should be left for the couple to decide. He creates further controversy by asking Hodel to dance with him.

The crowd gradually warms to the idea and Tevye and Golde, then Motel and Tzeitel, join in dancing. The wedding proceeds with great joy. Suddenly, the military presence in the town and the constable arrive and begin a [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogrom]], the "demonstration" which he had earlier warned Tevye was coming. The constable stops the attack on the wedding celebration after Perchik is wounded in the scuffle with the tsar's men; however, he allows the men to continue destroying property in the village. Tevye and the immediate family stand still, until Tevye angrily orders them to clean up instead of standing around. Tevye silently asks why God allowed this to happen to them.

===Intermission===
In its original [[theatrical release]], the film was shown with an intermission and [[entr'acte|entr'acte music]].&lt;ref name=afi&gt;{{cite web| title=Fiddler on the Roof (1971)| url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=54251| publisher=AFI Catalog of Feature Films| accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act 2===
Months later, Perchik prepares to leave Anatevka for the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolution]]. He proposes to Hodel, and she accepts. When they tell Tevye, he is furious that they have decided to marry without his permission, but he again relents because they love each other. Tevye tells Golde his reasons for consenting to their daughter's marriage, which leads them to re-evaluate their own arranged marriage. Tevye and Golde ultimately realize that, despite having been paired by a matchmaker, they do love each other.

Weeks later, Perchik is arrested in [[Kiev]] and is [[exile]]d to [[Siberia]]. Hodel decides to join him there. She promises Tevye that she and Perchik will be married under a [[Chuppah|canopy]]. Meanwhile, Tzeitel and Motel become parents, and Motel finally buys the sewing machine for which he has long scrimped and saved.

Tevye's third daughter Chava falls in love with a Russian Orthodox Christian named Fyedka. Tevye tells Chava to be distant friends with Fyedka, because of the difference in their religions. When Chava eventually works up the courage to ask Tevye's permission to marry Fyedka, Tevye tells her that marrying outside the family's faith is against tradition. He forbids her from having any contact with Fyedka or from even mentioning his name. The next morning, Fyedka and Chava elope and are married in a Russian Orthodox church.

Golde learns of the marriage when she meets up with the priest. When a grief-stricken Golde tells Tevye about the marriage, he tells her that Chava is dead to the family and that they shall forget her altogether. Chava asks Tevye to accept her marriage. In a [[soliloquy]], Tevye concludes that he cannot accept Chava [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|marrying a non-Jew]]. He accuses her of abandoning the Jewish faith and [[Disownment|disowns]] her.

One winter day, the Jews of Anatevka are notified that they have three days to leave the village or be forced out by the government. Tevye, his family and friends begin packing up to leave, heading for various parts of [[Europe]], Palestine, and the [[United States]].

Yente, the Matchmaker, plans to emigrate to [[Jerusalem]], and says goodbye to Golde with an embrace before departing. Lazar Wolf plans to emigrate to Chicago, to live with his former brother in law, whom he detests, but "a relative is a relative". Lazar and Tevye share one last embrace before departing.

Tevye receives letters from Hodel mentioning that she is working hard while Perchik stays in the Siberian prison. It is hoped that when Perchik is released, they will join the others in the United States. Chava and her husband Fyedka come to Tevye's house and tell the family that they are leaving for [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], being unable to stay in a place that would force innocent people out. Tevye shows signs of forgiving Chava by murmuring under his breath "And God be with you," silently urging Tzeitel to repeat his words to Chava. Golde calls out to Chava and Fyedka, telling them where they will be living in [[New York City|New York]] with a relative.

The Constable silently watches as the mass evacuation of Anatevka takes place. The community forms their circle at a crossroad one last time before scattering in different directions. Tevye spots the fiddler and motions to him to come along, symbolizing that even though he must leave his town, his traditions will always be with him.

==Production==
The decision to cast Topol, instead of [[Zero Mostel]], as Tevye was a somewhat controversial one, as the role had originated with Mostel and he had made it famous. Years later, Jewison said he felt Mostel's larger-than-life personality, while fine on stage, would cause film audiences to see him as Mostel, rather than the character of Tevye.{{sfn|Bial|2005|pp=78–79}}

[[Principal photography]] was done at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England. Most of the exterior shots were done in [[SFR Yugoslavia]]—specifically in [[Mala Gorica, Sisak-Moslavina County|Mala Gorica]], [[Lekenik]], and [[Zagreb]] within the Yugoslav constituent republic of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]. Though the area was under heavy snow during location scouting in 1969, during the filming the producers had to ship in marble dust to stand in for snow.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=ix}} Three hundred extras conversant in various foreign languages were used, as were flocks of geese and pigs and their handlers.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|pp=ix, 124}} [[Isaac Stern]] performed the [[violin]] solos.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=ix}}

Director Jewison has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as a rabbi (voice only) during Tevye's dream sequence.{{Citation needed|reason=Previous explanation that statement came from "DVD Commentary" not detailed enough nor sufficiently reliable|date=January 2017}}

==Differences from the Broadway musical==
The film follows [[Fiddler on the Roof#Synopsis|the plot of the stage play]] very closely, retaining nearly all of the play's dialogue, although it omits the songs "Now I Have Everything" and "The Rumor (I Just Heard)".&lt;ref name=Huttner&gt;[[Jan Lisa Huttner|Huttner, Jan Lisa]]. [http://www.juf.org/news/blog.aspx?blogmonth=11&amp;blogyear=2011&amp;blogid=13573 "''Fiddler'': Stage versus Screen"], JUF.org, November 14, 2011, accessed September 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=afi/&gt;  Lyrical portions of "Tevye's Dream (tailor Motel Kemzoil)" were omitted to avoid repetition. The film's soundtrack release notably contained some of these omissions, indicating they were removed during filming. These include Golde blessing herself, before going back to sleep.

Changes were also made in the song "Tradition," with the film omitting the dialogue between Reb Nachum the beggar (who, in the film, cannot speak) and Lazar Wolf as well as dialogue spoken by Yente and Avram.  In addition, in the film, two men argue about whether a horse claimed to be six years old was actually twelve, rather than whether the horse was actually a mule. The LP film soundtrack notably retained their names; Yitzhak and Avram, however this was also omitted the film's release. Instead, an on-set,  improvised take of Topol (saying 'he sold him'), rather than the recorded dubbing, was used.

Seven additional scenes were added to the film:
# The Constable gets orders from his superior for a "demonstration" against the Jews (referred to by the superior as "Christ-killers") in Anatevka.
# Perchik is arrested at a workers' rally in Kiev.
# Golde goes to the priest to look for Chava (described by her in the stage production). She is confronted there with Christian images (of historically Jewish individuals) in a juxtaposition with the synagogue montage at the start of the film.
# Motel gets dressed for his upcoming wedding to Tzeitel.
# The rabbi and his students inside the synagogue receive news of the arrival of Motel's new sewing machine.
# The rabbi takes the Torah out of the ark inside the synagogue for the last time. He weeps and chants quietly about having to abandon the synagogue.
# Tevye feeds his animals in the barn for the final time. He tells his lame horse to take care of his leg and to treat his new owner and master well.

The scene with Hodel and Perchik, where he plans to leave to start a revolution, was extended in the film. A new song sung by Perchik was recorded ("Any Day Now"), but was omitted from the final print; however, it was included in the 2004 reissue of the soundtrack. When the film was re-released to theaters in 1979, 32 minutes were cut, including the songs "Far from the Home I Love" and "Anatevka".

In the film, Tevye and Lazar Wolf discuss Wolf's proposed marriage to Tzeitel in Wolf's home, while in the stage version, the two meet in a tavern. The film shows Wolf's home as filled with golden artifacts. Prior to Lazar Wolf entering the scene, Tevye speaks to a female servant, who tells him not to touch anything.

Although a faithful adaptation of the original stage version, ''Fiddler'' scholar [[Jan Lisa Huttner]] has noted several differences between stage and screen.&lt;ref name=Huttner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ff2media.com/secondcitytzivi/2014/09/11/my-kinda-town/ |title=My Kinda Town |date=September 11, 2014 |publisher=Second Avenue Tzivi}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that changes in American culture and politics and developments in Israel led the filmmakers to portray certain characters differently and to offer a different version of Anatevka.&lt;ref name=Huttner/&gt; For example, the Broadway production cast [[Bea Arthur]] as a tall, booming Yente, while the film portrays Yente as tiny and timid. Huttner also notes that the "[[Marc Chagall|Chagall]] color palette" of the original Broadway production was exchanged for a grittier, more realistic depiction of the village of Anatevka.&lt;ref name=Huttner/&gt;

==Release==
===Roadshow presentation===
Because the film follows the stage musical so closely, and the musical did not have an [[overture]], the filmmakers chose to eliminate the customary film overture played before the beginning of most motion pictures shown in a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]]-style presentation. However, there is a [[Solo (music)|solo]] by the Fiddler played over the opening credits (after the conclusion of "Tradition"), there is an [[intermission]] featuring [[entr'acte]] music, and exit music is played at the end after the closing credits.

===Reception===
The film was a success, earning United Artists profits of $6.1 million, plus distribution profits of $8 million.&lt;ref name="tino"&gt;Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an 81% rating based on 37 reviews, with an average of 7.7/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fiddler_on_the_roof | title=''Fiddler on the Roof'' (1971) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flora Svecica''''' ("Flora of Sweden", ed. 1, Stockholm, 1745; ed. 2 Stockholm, 1755) was written by Swedish [[botanist]], [[physician]], [[zoologist]] and [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botanicus.org/title/b12069474 Full download of Flora Svecica]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geekbench'''  is a cross-platform [[Central processing unit|processor]] [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]], with a scoring system that separates single-core and [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]] performance,&lt;ref name="etn-multiprocessing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prakash-mohan-NIT" /&gt; and workloads that simulate real-world scenarios. The current version, Geekbench 4, uses scores that are calculated against a baseline score of 4000, which represents the performance of an [[Intel Core i7]]-6600U @ 2.60&amp;nbsp;GHz.  The software benchmark is available for [[MacOS|macOS]], [[Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]]. Geekbench 4 also measures GPU performance in areas such as image processing and [[computer vision]].

[[Linus Torvalds]], who is the creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, criticized Geekbench versions 3 and earlier for showing partiality for ARM64 devices and being a bad performance measure of [[x86]]-based systems.  He called Geekbench as bad a benchmark as [[Dhrystone]], which he and others have ridiculed for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real World Technologies - Forums - Thread  Charlie re  Apple and ARM|url=http://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=136526&amp;curpostid=136666|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421100127/http://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=136526&amp;curpostid=136666|archivedate=2017-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When version 4.0 of Geekbench was released his comment was, "Looks much better."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=159853&amp;curpostid=159860|title=Real World Technologies - Forums - Thread: Geekbench 4|website=www.realworldtech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Google Directory''' was a [[web directory]] hosted by Google. It was discontinued on July 20, 2011. However, the Google business places and recommended businesses is now commonly referred to as the Google directory.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Information==
The Google Directory was organized into 14 main categories:&lt;ref name="Web"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110120182400/http://directory.google.com/]-Archived version of the Google Directory on the [https://archive.org/web Internet Archive].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Arts
*Business
*Computers
*Games
*Health
*Home
*News
*Recreation
*Reference
*Regional
*Science
*Shopping
*Society
*Sports
There were also two other links on the page: World and Kids and Teens.&lt;ref name="Web" /&gt; The World link offered the directory in other languages.&lt;ref name="World"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110120182553/http://directory.google.com/Top/World]-The World tab&lt;/ref&gt; The Kids and Teens link was a separate web archive for kids and teens.

All of the Google Directory was based on the [[Open Directory Project]].&lt;ref&gt;Google Web Directory Help - Frequently Asked Questions [https://web.archive.org/web/20050205014740/http://www.google.com:80/dirhelp.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Main page===
The main page had links to the 14 main categories, along with the World and Kids and Teens links. There was a big search box on top that allowed users to search the Google Directory. On top of that was the slogan in green letters: "The web organized by topic into categories." On top of that were links to other [[Google]] services.

===Main category pages===
Each main category page had links to sub-main category pages, as well as a search box on top of it. For example, the Games main category would have sub-main categories such as Board Games or Video Games.

===Hierarchy===
Each category took the user to the category page, which would have websites that belong to it, or further subcategories that dealt with more detailed areas of that category. Eventually, the user would get to a page with no more subcategories. Every page had a search box at the top, allowing the user to search that page or the whole directory. Each page might have links to related categories. Some links were redirects to other pages.

===World link===
The World link had the names of languages. If the user clicked on one, they would be taken to a version of the directory in that language. But they had no appearance to the main page.

===Kids and Teens===
As the name states, it had pages for kids and teens. It was completely disconnected from the rest of the directory, so if you clicked it by accident, you would have to press the back button on your web browser.

==Connection with the Open Directory Project==
The Google Directory was completely built upon the Open Directory Project. Google integrated its PageRank system and its search system into it. Everything was green. There were links on the bottom so that the user could contribute to it.

==Trivia==
*If a search result was also in the directory, Google included a link to the respecting category.
*If someone wanted to have a listing in the Google Directory, they would have to be listed in the [[Open Directory Project]].

The '''''Great Soviet Encyclopedia''''' ('''GSE'''; {{lang-ru|Большая советская энциклопедия}}, БСЭ, ''Bolshaya sovetskaya entsiklopediya'') is one of the largest Russian-language [[encyclopedia]]s,&lt;ref&gt;The 3rd edition contains more than 95,000 articles, and nearly 35,000 illustrations and maps. Compare with over 120,000 articles in the Russian [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] (1890–1907) and with 100,000 in the 15th edition of [[Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[USSR|Soviet state]] from 1926 to 1990, and again since 2002 by [[Russia]] (under the name ''Bolshaya Rossiyskaya entsiklopediya'' or ''[[Great Russian Encyclopedia]]''). The GSE claimed to be "the first Marxist-Leninist general-purpose encyclopedia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Great+Soviet+Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The idea of the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' emerged in 1923 on the initiative of [[Otto Schmidt]], a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. In early 1924 Schmidt worked with a group which included [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]], (rector of the [[Institute of Red Professors]]), [[Nikolai Meshcheryakov]] (Head of [[Gosizdat]], the State Publishing House), [[Valery Bryusov]] (poet), [[Veniamin Kagan]] (mathematician) and [[Konstantin Kuzminsky]] to draw up a proposal which was agreed by the in April 1924. Also involved was [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], Commissar of Enlightenment ([[Narkompros]]), who had previously been involved with a proposal by [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and [[Maxim Gorky]] to produce a Workers' Encyclopedia.

==Editions==
There were three editions. The first edition of 65 volumes (65,000 entries, plus a supplementary volume about the [[Soviet Union]]) was published during 1926–1947, the chief editor being [[Otto Schmidt]] (until 1941). The second edition of 50 volumes (100,000 entries, plus a supplementary volume) was published in 1950–1958; chief editors: [[Sergei Vavilov]] (until 1951) and [[Boris Alexeyevich Vvedensky|Boris Vvedensky]] (until 1969); two index volumes to this edition were published in 1960. The third edition of 1969–1978 contains 30 volumes (100,000 entries, plus an index volume issued in 1981). Volume 24 is in two books, one being a full-sized book about the USSR,  all with about 21 million words,&lt;ref&gt;Kister, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; and the chief editor being [[Alexander Prokhorov]] (since 1969). In the third edition, much attention was paid to the philosophical problems of natural sciences, physical and chemical sciences, and mathematical methods in various branches of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prlib.ru/en-us/history/Pages/Item.aspx?itemid=812|title=Beginning of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia issue|date=|month=|year=|work=|publisher=Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library|location=|page=|pages=|at=|accessdate=2013-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725164037/http://www.prlib.ru/en-us/history/Pages/Item.aspx?itemid=812|archive-date=2014-07-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1957 to 1990,  the ''Yearbook of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' was released annually with up-to-date articles about the Soviet Union and all countries of the world.

The first online edition, an exact replica of text and graphics of the third (so-called Red) edition, was published by Rubricon.com in 2000.

==Role and purpose in Soviet society==
The foreword to the first volume of the GSE (2nd ed.) proclaims "The Soviet Union has become the center of the civilized world."&lt;ref name=Benton /&gt; The ''GSE'', along with all other books and other media and communications with the public, was directed toward the "furtherance of the aims of the party and the state."&lt;ref name=Benton&gt;''From extensive discussions with the editors of the second edition of the ''GSE'', editor-in-chief Vvendensky.'' Benton, W. &lt;u&gt;This Is The Challenge&lt;/u&gt;. Associated College Presses. 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The 1949 decree issued for the production of the second edition of the GSE directed:

{{quote|text=The second edition of the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia ''should elucidate widely the world-historical victories of socialism in our country, which have been attained in the U.S.S.R. in the provinces of economics, science, culture, and art. ... With exhaustive completeness it must show the superiority of socialist culture over the culture of the capitalist world. Operating on [[Marxist-Leninist]] theory, the encyclopedia should give a party criticism of contemporary bourgeois tendencies in various provinces of science and technics.&lt;ref name=Benton/&gt;}}

The foreword to the ''GSE'' (3rd ed.) expanded on that mission, paying particular attention to developments in science and technology: [[nuclear engineering]], [[space technology]], [[atomic physics]], [[polymer chemistry]], and [[radio electronics]]; also detailing the history and activities of the [[Bolshevik|Russian revolutionary movement]], the development of the [[labor movement]] worldwide and summarizing Marxist scholarship on [[political economy]], sociology, and political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rubricon.com/about_bse_3.asp |title=Editors Foreword, ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', 3rd Edition |access-date=2010-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130163425/http://www.rubricon.com/about_bse_3.asp |archive-date=2010-01-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of that mission, the GSE (2nd ed.) described as the role of education:

{{quote|text=To develop in children's minds the Communist morality, ideology, and Soviet patriotism; to inspire unshakable love toward the Soviet fatherland, the Communist party, and its leaders; to propagate Bolshevik vigilance; to put an emphasis on internationalist education; to strengthen Bolshevik willpower and character, as well as courage, capacity for resisting adversity and conquering obstacles; to develop self-discipline; and to encourage physical and aesthetic culture.&lt;ref name=Benton/&gt;}}

The third edition of the ''GSE'' subsequently expanded on the role of education:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Education is essential to preparing for life and work. It is the basic means by which people come to know and acquire culture, and it is the foundation of culture's development...The Soviet education rests on the principles of the unity of education and communist upbringing; cooperation among the school, the family, and the society in bringing up young people; and the linkage of education and training to life and the practical experience of building communism. The underlying principles of the Soviet system of public education include a scientific approach to and continual improvement of education on the basis of the latest achievements in science, technology and culture; a humanistic and highly moral orientation in education and upbringing; and co-education of both sexes, secular education which excludes the influence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00054/08700.htm?text=%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5&amp;encid=bse&amp;stpar3=1.1 ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', "Education" ]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on his extensive talks with the editors of the ''GSE'', to whom he was granted unprecedented access, [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]], publisher of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', wrote the following in observation of the ''GSE''{{'}}s chief editor B. A. Vvedensky stating their compliance with the 1949 decree of the Council of Ministers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is just this simple for the Soviet board of editors. They are working under a government directive that orders them to orient their encyclopedia as sharply as a political tract. The encyclopedia was thus planned to provide the intellectual underpinning for the Soviet world offensive in the duel for men's minds. The Soviet government ordered it as a fighting propaganda weapon. And the government attaches such importance to its ''political role'' that its board of editors is chosen by and is responsible only to the high Council of Ministers itself.&lt;ref name=Benton/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Translations ==

===English===
[[File:UBN Great Soviet.JPG|thumb|Complete set of an English-language version of the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'']]
The third edition was translated and published into English in 31 volumes between 1974 and 1983 by [[Macmillan Publishers]]. Each volume was translated separately, requiring use of the [[index (publishing)|index]] found at the front of each volume to locate specific items; knowledge of Russian can be helpful to find the right volume the first time. Not all entries were translated into English; these are indicated in the index. Articles from the English edition are made available online by ''[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]'', [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sources.htm Our Main Sources], Retrieved 17 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek===
The third edition was translated into Greek and published in 34 volumes between 1977 and 1983. All articles that were related to [[Greece]] or Greek history, culture and society were expanded and hundreds of new ones were written especially for the Greek edition. Thus the encyclopedia contains, for example, both the Russian entry on Greece as well as a much larger one prepared by Greek contributors.

Finally, a supplementary volume covering the 1980s was published in 1989. It contains translated and original Greek articles which, sometimes, do not exist in the 34-volume set.

The ''Soviet Encyclopedia'' is a systematic summary of knowledge in social and economic studies and in the applied sciences.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} It became a universal reference work for the Soviet intelligentsia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Publishers' Foreword, ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia: A Translation of the Third Edition''. Volume 1. Macmillan, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the publisher's foreword in the English-language translation of the encyclopedia, the encyclopedia is important for knowledge and understanding of USSR. A major value of the Encyclopedia is its comprehensive information about the Soviet Union and its peoples. Every aspect of Soviet life is systematically presented, including history, economics, science, art, and culture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The ethnic diversity of USSR’s peoples and its languages and cultures are extensively covered. There are biographies of prominent cultural and scientific figures who are not as well known outside of Russia. There are detailed surveys of USSR’s provinces and towns, as well as their geology, geography, flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The encyclopedia’s Chief Editorial Board and Advisory board sought input from the general public. The entry list was sent to universities, scientific institutions, museums, and private specialists in every field. More than 50,000 suggestions were received and many additions were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00009/47800.htm?text=%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%8D%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%8F&amp;encid=bse&amp;stpar3=1.2 Great Soviet Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars believe that the Encyclopedia is a valuable and useful source for Russian history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7VyOANl2qxoC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=Great+soviet+encyclopedia+valuable+reference&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Great%20soviet%20encyclopedia%20valuable%20reference&amp;f=false ''Reference sources in history: an introductory guide''.

==''Great Russian Encyclopedia''==
{{main|Great Russian Encyclopedia}}
Publication of the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' was suspended in 1990 and halted in 1991, but in 2002 it was reinstituted by decree of [[Vladimir Putin]]. In 2003 and 2004 a team of editors overhauled the old encyclopedia by updating facts, removing most examples of overt political bias, and changing its name to the ''Great Russian Encyclopedia''. Many outdated articles are being entirely rewritten. In 2004 the first volume of the newly overhauled ''Great Russian Encyclopedia'' was published. The complete edition of 35 volumes was released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vmdaily.ru/news/sergei-kravec-rossiiskaya-enciklopediya--eto-i-est-mi--1339530563.html | script-title=ru:Сергей Кравец: Российская энциклопедия –  это и есть мы | publisher=Evening Moscow | language=Russian | year=2014 | accessdate=2014-05-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109103700/http://vmdaily.ru/news/sergei-kravec-rossiiskaya-enciklopediya--eto-i-est-mi--1339530563.html | archivedate=2013-11-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication of the ''Great Russian Encyclopedia'' is overseen by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and funded by the [[Government of the Russian Federation]]. The encyclopedia is now found in libraries and schools throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatbook.ru/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103123755/http://greatbook.ru/ |archive-date=2014-01-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the 1980s editions remain in widespread use, particularly as references in scientific and mathematical research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2058">The '''Guggenheim Museum SoHo''' was a branch of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] designed by [[Arata Isozaki]] that was located at the corner of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and Prince Street in Manhattan's [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] neighborhood, New York City. The museum opened in 1992 and closed in 2001 after hosting exhibits that included ''Marc Chagall and the Jewish Theater'', ''Paul Klee at the Guggenheim Museum'', ''Robert Rauschenberg: A Retrospective'', and ''Andy Warhol: The Last Supper'', which served as a key part of the museum's permanent collection. The closing was initially hoped to be temporary, but the museum closed permanently in 2002.&lt;ref name=tmag&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon| first=Deborah| title=Is the Go-Go Guggenheim Going, Going ...|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/museums/NYT-StateofGuggenheim-Magazine-06-30-02.html|accessdate=2013-07-31|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=2002-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial attendance was forecast to be 250,000 visitors a year, but the museum drew between 125,000 and 200,000 its first year, and attendance did not increase in subsequent years. The museum restructured in 1999 to shrink its exhibition space from 27,000 to 20,000 square feet to reduce the museum's operating costs.&lt;ref name=shrink&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel| first=Carol|title=INSIDE ART; Guggenheim Shrinks in SoHo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/05/arts/inside-art-guggenheim-shrinks-in-soho.html|accessdate=2013-07-31|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1999-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter sent to Maharaja Hari Singh on 27 October 1947, the then [[Governor-General of India]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] accepted the accession with a remark, "it is my Government's wish that as soon as law and order have been restored in Jammu and Kashmir and her soil cleared of the invader the question of the State's accession should be settled by a reference to the people." &lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bruce Millar," The Commonwealth and the United Nations "( 1967),[https://books.google.com/books?id=U88OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA26 page 26]&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Mountbatten’s remark and the offer made by the Government of India to conduct a plebiscite or referendum to determine the future status of Kashmir led to a dispute between India and Pakistan regarding the legality of the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Ganguly, "Conflict unending: India-Pakistan tensions since 1947"(2001),[https://books.google.com/books?id=xn_QVYLy6ocC&amp;pg=PA154 page 154]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2702/stories/20100129270204100.htm KASHMIR QUESTIONS by A.G.

Some scholars have questioned the official date of the signing of the accession document by the Maharaja. They maintain that it was signed on 27 October rather than 26 October. However, the fact that the Governor General accepted the accession on 27 October, the day the Indian troops were airlifted to Kashmir, is generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Victoria |last=Schofield |authorlink=Victoria Schofield |title=Kashmir in Conflict |publisher=I.

'''Irving Wallace''' (March 19, 1916 – June 29, 1990) was an American best-selling author and screenwriter. He was known for his heavily researched novels, many with a sexual theme.&lt;ref name=Another&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korda|first1=Michael|title=Another life : a memoir of other people|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0679456597|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wallace was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], to Bessie Liss and Alexander Wallace (an Americanized version of the original family name of Wallechinsky). The family was Jewish&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/34806/celebrities/ jweekly]&lt;/ref&gt; and originally from [[Russia]]. Wallace was named after his maternal grandfather, a bookkeeper and [[Talmud]]ic scholar of [[Narewka]]. Wallace grew up at 6103 Eighteenth Avenue in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=4b0Q7nyDFP8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=6103+18th+Avenue,+Kenosha+%22irving+wallace%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZHmKrqF-oX&amp;sig=6-3kLf5n-ffje7hEyOuW7rjRb7I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiStLiZnPDRAhVG_4MKHdxDAFoQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=6103%2018th%20Avenue%2C%20Kenosha%20%22irving%20wallace%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended Kenosha Central High School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wla.lib.wi.us/readers/WLAC/Notable/Notable2005.htm#Irving Short biography on the WLA website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207194754/http://www.wla.lib.wi.us/readers/WLAC/Notable/Notable2005.htm#Irving |date=2009-02-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the father of [[Olympiads|Olympic]] historian [[David Wallechinsky]] and author [[Amy Wallace]].

==Career==
Wallace began selling stories to magazines when he was a teenager. In [[World War II|the Second World War]] Wallace served in the [[Frank Capra]] unit in Fort Fox along with Theodor Seuss Geisel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pease |first=Donald E.|authorlink=Donald E. Pease |title=Theodor SEUSS Geisel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGsw3bkfhM4C&amp;pg=PA68 |accessdate=April 2014|year=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], [[Google eBook]]|isbn=0199746001|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; – better known as [[Dr. Seuss]] – and continued to write for magazines. He also served in the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] of the [[Army Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html?c=y&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, however, Wallace turned to a more lucrative job as a [[Hollywood]] screenwriter. He collaborated on such films as ''[[The West Point Story (film)|The West Point Story]]'' (1950), ''[[Split Second (1953 film)|Split Second]]'' (1953), ''Meet Me at the Fair'' (1953), and ''[[The Big Circus]]'' (1959). He also contributed three scripts&lt;ref&gt;http://listofepisodes.org/writer/Irving_Wallace{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the western television program ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]''.

After an unsatisfying stint in Hollywood, he devoted himself full-time to writing books. He published his first non-fiction work in 1955, ''The Fabulous Originals'', and his first fiction offering, ''The Sins of Philip Fleming'', in 1959. The latter, ignored by critics, was followed by the enormously successful ''The Chapman Report''. Wallace published 33 books during his lifetime, translated into 31 languages.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}

Irving Wallace was married to Sylvia (née Kahn) Wallace, a former magazine writer and editor. Her first novel, ''The Fountains'', was an American best-seller and published in twelve foreign editions. Her second novel, ''Empress'', was published in 1980. She also helped him to produce, along with their two children, ''[[The Book of Lists#2]]'' and ''The Intimate Sex Lives Of Famous People''. In her autobiography, Amy Wallace wrote that her mother's contributions were not always helpful and the atmosphere not always harmonious.&lt;ref&gt;''Sorcerer's Apprentice'' – Amy Wallace (Frog, 2003), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvia Wallace died October 20, 2006 at the age of 89.

Several of Wallace's books have been made into films. Among his best known books are ''The Chapman Report'' (1960), ''[[The Prize (novel)|The Prize]]'' (1962), ''[[The Word (novel)|The Word]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Fan Club]]'' (1974).

[[Michael Korda]] and [[Peter Schwed]] were the editors for Wallace at [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. In his autobiography ''Another Life'', Korda suggests that Wallace invented a style of novel that is at once a strong story and encyclopedia, with "some sex thrown in to keep the reader's pulse going."&lt;ref name=Another /&gt;

Wallace loved and championed the underdog. He enjoyed writing the stories of outsiders, which interest saw light in ''The Square Pegs: Some Americans Who Dared to Be Different''. With his son, daughter and wife he produced some notable non-fiction works, including three editions each of ''[[The People's Almanac]]'' (with son David) and ''[[The Book of Lists]]'' (with David and Amy and wife Sylvia for the second volume). Many of the odd facts Wallace uncovered he also used in his novels.

Wallace died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on June 29, 1990 at age 74. He was interred at [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17739">[[File:Strang1.jpg|thumb|px255|right| Page one of Strang's "Letter of Appointment."]]

The '''"letter of appointment"''' is a controversial three-page document used by [[James J. Strang]] and his adherents to prove that he was the designated successor to [[Joseph Smith]] as the [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophet]] and [[president of the Church|president]] of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]. It formed part of a four-tiered argument for succession, being that according to various passages in Doctrine and Covenants, a prophet successor had to be A) appointed by Joseph Smith, B) ordained by angels, C) receive revelations as Smith did and D) translate ancient records certified by witnesses. Sent from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] on June 19, 1844, to Strang in [[Burlington, Wisconsin]], this letter was highly influential at gathering support for Strang's claim to succession until his death. Following Strang's murder in 1856, the letter passed through various hands until acquired by [[Yale University]], where it currently forms a part of its [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]].{{efn|The James Jesse Strang Collection in the Beinecke Library is coded WA MSS 447.  A complete description of this collection may be viewed at [http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.strangco Strang Collection].}}

==James J. Strang==
[[Image:James Strang daguerreotype (1856).jpg|left|thumb|150px|1856 [[daguerreotype]] of [[James Strang]], taken on [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]], [[Lake Michigan]], by J. Atkyn, itinerant photographer and later one of Strang's assassins.]]
{{main|James Strang}}
James J. Strang was from [[Scipio, New York]] and received "no education after the age of 15." Having educated himself, he became a lawyer by the age of 22. He was a latecomer to the  [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], converting and being baptized and ordained by Joseph and Hyrum Smith in early 1844, both of whom were [[death of Joseph Smith|murdered by an anti-Mormon mob]] on June 27 of that year. Upon Smith's death, a number of individuals came forward  to lead his church, including Strang. As a recent convert, Strang did not yet possess the name recognition among rank-and-file Mormons{{efn|"Mormon," as used in this article, refers to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement as a whole, and not just to its largest branch, the LDS Church. Its use here is only for convenience, not in any derogatory sense.}} that was enjoyed by [[Brigham Young]] and [[Sidney Rigdon]], two contenders who claimed leadership on the basis of rank - Young as president of the Quorum of the Twelve and Rigdon as sole survivor of the First Presidency. Hence, Strang, as an unknown new convert, faced an uphill battle in his quest to be recognized as the heir to Smith's prophetic mantle.&lt;br /&gt;

Strang also claimed to have received an angelic appointment at the very moment of Smith's death,&lt;ref&gt;Strang (1848), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; and, like Smith, claimed the ability to translate ancient documents on [[Voree plates|metal plates]] into modern English. Strang's position of maintaining the same church structure as Smith, led by a prophet, seer, revelator and translator with the fruits of prophecy - prophetic revelations and translations - continued to win him converts until his assassination twelve years later. His success prompted Brigham Young, who was steadily losing membership maintaining that he should lead as president of the Twelve Apostles and that there would be no successor, to change his position and have himself appointed President of his faction.

==The letter==
Unlike Rigdon and Young, Strang offered physical proof of his prophetic calling. Strang possessed a letter purportedly authored by Smith and mailed one week before his murder, prophesying of his impending demise and naming Strang as his successor. The wording of the letter is somewhat ambiguous. Critics who accept the letter as genuinely from Smith interpreted it as appointing Strang solely to the presidency of the newly created Voree [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]],&lt;ref&gt;Strang's own son, Charles Strang, took this position. See [[Heman Smith|Smith, Heman]], ''History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,'' vol. 3, chapter 2, [http://www.centerplace.org/history/ch/v3ch02.htm pp. 52–53].&lt;/ref&gt; while Strangites insist that it appoints him to Smith's prophetic office and receiver of revelations for the whole church.

===Events as related in "The Diamond"===
In his tract "The Diamond," Strang relates this version of events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This letter was received at Burlington by regular course of mail, coming through the distributing office at Chicago, and bears the Nauvoo postmark of June 19, the day following its date. It arrived at Burlington July 9, and was immediately taken from the office by C. P. Barnes, Esq., a distinguished lawyer at that place, who, in consequence of the rumors of persecution and civil war against the Mormons, and a general anxiety to hear the latest news, immediately carried it to Mr. Strang, with the request to be informed of any news of public interest which it might contain. It therefore became public the same evening.&lt;ref&gt;Strang, James J. ''[https://archive.org/stream/diamondbeingla1893smit#page/n0/mode/2up The Diamond: Being the Law of Prophetic Succession]''. Voree, Wis.: 1848, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emma Smith's testimony corroborates Smith's writing a letter to Strang: "Mrs. [[Emma Smith]] recollects well of her husband receiving a letter from Mr. Strang, and holding a council on the subject, and names [[Hyrum Smith]], [[Willard Richards]] and [[John P. Greene]] as present at that council, and also that a letter was sent to Mr. Strang in answer, but of the import of the answer she was not informed."&lt;ref name="Strang 1848, pg. 4"&gt;Strang (1848), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; She and the entire Smith family were persuaded by it enough to declare their support for Strang.

Next, Strang accused the members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve]] of conspiring together to suppress evidence of his appointment to the prophetic office&amp;ndash;and even the possibility of murder:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Immediately after the martyrdom of Joseph, [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]], [[Willard Richards]] and [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|William W. Phelps]] took a kind of temporary direction of the affairs of the church, instructing the saints to wait patiently the hand of the Lord; assuring them that he had not left them without a shepherd, and that all things would be made known in due season. To every question of the saints, Who is the prophet? replies were made, in substance, that the saints would know in due season, but that nothing could be done until the Twelve got home, because the appointment of a prophet and the directions for salvation of the church from the perils they were in, was contained in sealed packages directed to them. [[Orson Hyde]] and others of the Twelve, who were then in the east, stated in public congregations in New York, Philadelphia and other cities, that Willard Richards had written to them that the appointment of a prophet was left with him, under seal, to be opened on the return of the Twelve. This assertion was so often made that the whole church were daily expecting to hear a new prophet proclaimed. On the 8th day of August, 1844, when Sidney Rigdon endeavored to obtain authority to lead the church, John P. Green, {{sic}} marshal of the city of Nauvoo, told them, "They need not trouble themselves about it, for Joseph had appointed one James J. Strang, who lived up north, to stand in his stead." The sudden death of John P. Green immediately after this declaration (under very extraordinary circumstances) left Willard Richards [the cousin of Brigham Young] and John Taylor sole repositors of all documents on this subject, except this letter.&lt;ref name="Strang 1848, pg. 4"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the return of the Twelve, the alleged promise of the "sealed packages" naming Smith's successor appears to have been dropped.

===Corroboration in Postal Records and Alleged Cover-up===
When Strang's supporters attempted to prove that Smith had mailed the letter using postal records in Nauvoo, they found that the corresponding portion of the Nauvoo postal records were missing. However, the records remained intact in the Chicago and Burlington post offices, showing that the letter was indeed mailed from Smith to Strang.&lt;ref&gt;Strang, James. [http://www.ldsstrangite.com/uploads/2/0/9/4/20947834/prophetic_controversy_1.pdf ''The Prophetic Controversy: A Letter from James J. Strang to Mrs. Corey]''. St. James, Beaver Island: 1854, pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brigham Young quickly denounced the letter as a "wicked forgery,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/utopia/uc09b.html Letter of Brigham Young], 24 January 1846. Original at Beinecke Library, Yale University. Retrieved on 2007-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt; this did not stop two of the apostles in the Quorum of Twelve from supporting Strang,{{efn|[[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William Smith]] and [[John E. Page]], two members of the Quorum of Twelve under Smith, joined Strang briefly but both had left his movement by 1847.}} together with [[William Marks (Latter Day Saints)|William Marks]] (Nauvoo Stake president), members of Smith's family (including his sisters, [[Lucy Mack Smith|mother]] and [[Emma Smith|widow]]) and many others.

==Questions of authenticity==
[[Image:Strang2.jpg|thumb|px255|right| Page three of Strang's "Letter of Appointment," with possible signature of [[Joseph Smith]].]]
Experts agree that the postmark on the letter is genuine.{{efn|The postmark appears on the back side of one of the last page along with Strang's name and address, making the last page effectively the envelope, a common feature of the period.}}&lt;ref name = jensen&gt;Jensen, Robin Scott (2005). [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/591/ ''Gleaning the Harvest: Strangite Missionary Work 1846–50'']. Provo, Utah, BYU Press, p. 6, n. 17. Retrieved on 2007-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Strang's opponents at first challenged falsely that the stamp was the wrong color and subsequently challenged the authenticity of the stamp by pointing to a tiny dot on the postmark, just before the "J" in "June"&amp;ndash;one that they claimed should not have been there. Strang, however, produced several letters mailed from Nauvoo on June 19, all of which had the same flaw in the stamp, thus confirming its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Strang, James J. (1854), [http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Strang,_The_Prophet.htm Delivery of the Letter of 0Appointment. The Prophetic Controversy: A Letter from James Strang to Mrs. Corey], St. James, pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics assert that the outer sheet containing the postmark and address is of different stock (needs citation) than the first two pages, however this is disputed. This theory infers that Strang disposed of the first two pages, retaining the last page with the post mark and composed his own partial letter containing the appointment. Analysis indicates that the handwriting on all three pages is the same. Vague references to Strang's appointment appear throughout the letter. On page one: "The faith which thou hast in the Shepherd, the stone of Israel [Joseph Smith], hath been repaid to thee a thousandfold, and thou shalt be like unto him; but the flock shall find rest with thee, and God shall reveal to thee his will concerning them." Page two continues: "[H]e [Strang] had faith in thee [Smith], the Shepherd and Stone of Israel, and to him shall the gathering of the people be." Page three: "Thy [Strang] duty is made plain . ... [I]f evil befall me [Smith], thou shalt lead the flock to pleasant pastures."

Modern analysts are divided on the authenticity of Smith's signature. The difficulty stems from the fact that Joseph Smith not only had scribes write his letters, but also sign his name for him. Therefore it is difficult to be certain of which signatures and handwriting are actually his, even of known authentic works. Still, some authors have ventured to dispute the signature on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, D. Michael (1994). ''The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power''. Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books, p. 210. See also Eberstadt, Charles, "A Letter That Founded a Kingdom," ''Autograph Collectors' Journal'' (October, 1950): 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jensen/&gt; Given that Smith had scribes sign his name on official documents regularly, even if the signature was penned by someone other than Smith, it would not of itself cast doubt on the letter's authenticity.

In 1956, Donna West Falk obtained photostats of three letters that the Illinois Historical Library assert are definitely Joseph Smith's and presented them with a photostat of the Letter of Appointment to the handwriting firm of Tyrell and Doud for analysis, a firm recognized as authorities in court rooms across the country. The letters studied were: &lt;br /&gt; A) A four page letter addressed to Horace H. Hodgekiss, Esg., dated Nauvoo Oct. 25, 1841 (exhibit A),&lt;br /&gt; B) A four page letter addressed to Smith Tuttle, Esq., dated Nauvoo, Ill. Oct. 9, 1841 (exhibit B),&lt;br /&gt; C) A three page letter addressed to H. R. Hodgekiss, Esq., dated Nauvoo, May 13, 1842 (exhibit C) and&lt;br /&gt; D) The Letter of Appointment addressed to James J. Strang, dated Nauvoo, Ill. June 18, 1844 (exhibit D).&lt;br /&gt; None of the three appear to match, consistent with Smith's use of scribes for official letters.

{{quote|Official Results:

PURPOSE OF EXAMINATION: - You have asked me to determine if possible whether Exhibits A, B, C, and D were written by the same hand.

OPINIONS AND OBSERVATIONS - This case as presented differes from most document cases, since none of the specimens is definitely known to have been written by Joseph Smith. Accordingly, deduction must be made from the evidence at hand in order to fill in the gap of missing information.

EXHIBIT A - It is reasonable to believe that exhibit A could be written by Joseph Smith himself. The writing indicates a person who is interested in getting his thoughts down on paper rather than in the appearance of the writing itself. The post script appears to have been squeezed in as an afterthought and several corrections were made in the text. It is unlikely that these would occur if done by a scrivener for Joseph Smith, but this is somewhat conjecture.

Exhibit B - The body and signature of exhibit B, on the contrary, were written by a different hand than the body and the signature of Exhibit A. The forms of the letters and the skill are fundamentally different. Further, the document is dated less than two months after Exhibit A and it is unlikely that the quality of the hand writing would be better so materially in that short period of time.

The envelope address, however, on Exhibit B appears to be in the same hand as the envelope address on Exhibit B. This evidence would appear to tie together both Exhibit A and B. 

Exhibit C - The body and signature of exhibit C in my opinion, are in a different hand than either exhibit A or exhibit B, as is the envelope address. Beneath the signature Joseph Smith to this document appears the words 'per W. Richards-Clerk,' which would indicate this was the person who filled in and signed the document.

Exhibit D - In as much as exhibit D is in handprinting, where as the other documents in question are not, few conclusions are possible. 

Despite the lack of agreement in the hand writings of exhibit A, B, and C, and possibly D, these documents were not necessarily authored by persons other than Joseph Smith. Exhibit A, B, and C were written on similar types of stationary, incorporating the letter in the envelope in one document. Then, too, all of the documents bear a Nauvoo postmark and would seem to have the appearance of age.

It must also be remembered that the use of scriveners or letter writers was quite common in those early days and undoubtedly Joseph Smith, being in a position of leadership, would have access to the services of such persons. A brief observation of the language used in these four documents indicates that the education and word usage was consistent with the theory that all four documents were authored by one individual.|Official report of Tyrell and Doud—Examiners of Questioned Documents, dated October 8, 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=James J. Strang: Teachings of a Mormon Prophet|last=Shepard|first=William|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)|year=1977|isbn=|location=Burlington, WI|pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

If Emma Smith's recollections on the writing of the letter were accurate, Joseph, Hyrum, Willard Richards and John P. Greene were present and any of them could have written the letter and signed it. The above analysis would cast doubt on Richards as a handwriting match, however, Exhibit C (indicated as scribed by Richards) was written in long hand, while Exhibit D was written in print. Further authentication would require examples of printed hand writing samples from Hyrum Smith, John P. Green and Willard Richards.&lt;br /&gt;

The "letter of appointment" is still accepted and defended by members of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1323">A '''mortuary roll''' (Latin: ''rotulus mortuorum'') was a [[rotulus]], sometimes of prodigious length, at the head of which was entered the notification of the death of a specific religious or group of religious. A special messenger, denominated a ''breviator'', ''gerulus'', ''rollifer'', ''rotularius'', ''tomiger'', or other [[title]], transmitted it from [[monastery]] to monastery, and at each a notation was entered on roll attesting to the receipt of the notice(s) in the roll and the offering of the requisite suffrage(s) for the decedent(s).

Gradually a custom arose in many places of making these entries in verse with complementary amplifications that often occupied many lines. These records, some of which are still extant, memorialize specimens of ornate verse composition. They afford material both for [[palaeography]] and a comparative judgment of the standard of scholarship prevalent in the relevant centers of learning.

The use of mortuary rolls flourished most in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries. That of the Abbess [[Matilda of Caen]], the daughter of [[William the Conqueror|King William the Conqueror of England]], was 72 feet long and 8 or 10 inches wide, but this was exceptional.

'''National Museums Liverpool''', formerly '''National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside''', comprises several museums and art galleries in and around [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. All the museums and galleries in the group have free admission. The museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] and an [[exempt charity]] under English law.&lt;ref&gt;Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

National Museums Liverpool's origins go back to 1851 and the founding of what is now [[World Museum Liverpool|World Museum]]. 

In the 1980s, local politics in Liverpool was under the control of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group of the Labour Party. In 1986, [[Militant in Liverpool|Liverpool's Militant councillors]] discussed closing down the city's museums and selling off their contents, in particular their art collections.&lt;ref&gt;''Local collections should be nationalised to halt sell-offs'' {{cite web |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/comment/local-collections-should-be-nationalised-to-halt-sell-offs-/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415200345/http://theartnewspaper.com/comment/local-collections-should-be-nationalised-to-halt-sell-offs-/ |archivedate=15 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent this from happening the Conservative government nationalised all of Liverpool's museums under the ''Merseyside Museums and Galleries Order 1986'' which created a new national trustee body ''National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside''.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool’s museum:
the first 150 years'', p87. [http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/wml/history/WML_150_years.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne MacLeod, ''Museum Architecture: A New Biography'', p31.&lt;/ref&gt; It changed its name to National Museums Liverpool in 2003.

It holds in trust multi-disciplinary collections of worldwide origin made up of more than one million objects and works of art. The organisation holds courses, lectures, activities and events and provides educational workshops and activities for school children, young people and adults. Its venues are open to the public seven days a week 361 days a year and all exhibitions are free. National Museums Liverpool has charitable status and is England’s only national museums group based entirely outside London. It currently comprises eight different venues, one of which is outside Liverpool itself — the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]], located in [[Port Sunlight]].

'''Natty Dreadlocks''' (synonyms "'''Natty Dread'''", "'''Natty'''", "'''Dready'''" or "'''Dread'''") is a [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] term for a member of the Rastafari community. The image of such a man is often used in [[reggae]] music and elsewhere to represent an idealised [[personification]] of the Rastafari movement as a whole. It combines the term ''natty'' (as in "natural") and a style of [[dreadlocks]] which have formed naturally without cutting, combing or brushing.

Examples of reggae albums/tracks featuring the term
* ''police polizia'' by [[Alborosie]]
* ''[[Natty Dread]]'', a 1974 album by [[Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers]].
* ''[[Natty Dread]]'', a 1997 album by the [[Charlie Hunter]] Quartet, consisting of jazz-funk arrangements of the songs on the [[Bob Marley]] album.
* ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (album)|Guess who's Coming to Dinner]]'', an album by [[Black Uhuru]], where the answer to the rhetorical question is "Natty Dreadlocks"
* "Ride Natty Ride", from [[Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers]]' album, ''[[Survival (Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers album)|Survival]]''.
* "Natty Dread Taking Over", from the debut album ''[[Two Sevens Clash]]'' by [[roots reggae]] band [[Culture (band)|Culture]], in 1976.
* "Jah Jah Ah Natty Dread", track six of [[Lee "Scratch" Perry|Lee Perry]]'s ''[[Return of the Super Ape]]''.
* "Que me Pisen", from [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]]'s 1987 album ''Llegando los Monos''.
* "Under Mi Sensi", a song by [[Barrington Levy]].
* ''I Love Marijuana'', an album by [[Linval Thompson]].
* ''Blame it on the sun'', a 1975 album by roots reggae band [[Inner Circle (reggae band)|Inner Circle]]
* "Natty Dreadlocks 'Pon The Mountain Top", track four of [[Bad Brains]]'s album ''[[Build A Nation]]''.
* "Mix up" on the album Trenchtown Mix Up by [[The Gladiators (band)|The Gladiators]]
* "Natty Dread A Weh She Want" by [[Horace Andy]]
* "Pique Natty Dread" by [[:pt:Planta &amp; Raiz|Planta &amp; Raiz]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">'''OPOS''', full name [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] for Retail POS, a platform specific implementation of [[UnifiedPOS]], is a [[point of sale]] device standard for Microsoft [[Windows]] [[operating systems]] that was initiated by [[Microsoft]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Epson]], and [[Fujitsu| Fujitsu-ICL]] and is managed by the [[Association for Retail Technology Standards]]. The OPOS API was first published in January 1996. The standard uses [[component object model]] and, because of that, all languages that support COM controls (i.e. [[Visual C++]], [[Visual Basic]], and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) can be used to write applications.&lt;ref name=bg&gt;{{cite web|title=OPOS Background|url=http://monroecs.com/oposbackground.htm|publisher=monroecs|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OPOS standard specifies two levels for an OPOS control, the control object which presents an abstract hardware interface to a family of devices such as receipt printer and the service object which handles the interface between the control object and the actual physical device such as a specific model of receipt printer. This division of functionality provides a way for the application development to write to an abstract hardware interface while allowing the application to work with a variety of different hardware. The only requirement is that a hardware vendor supplies an OPOS compatible service object with their particular hardware offering.

Typically a manufacturer of point of sale terminals will provide along with a terminal operating system an OPOS control object package with a software utility that is used to configure OPOS settings. Such a utility will specify the settings for an OPOS control object and indicate the service object to be used with a particular OPOS profile. When the point of sale application starts up, it loads the OPOS control object and the OPOS control object in turn loads the service object specified by the current OPOS profile. The Windows Registry is typically used as the persistent store for device settings. The hardware device manufacturer will normally provide a utility for device specific settings used by the service object.

==Operating systems==
OPOS can be deployed on the following operating systems:&lt;ref name=bg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OPOS Drivers|url=http://www.idinnovations.com/webhelp/index.htm#page=clOPOSDrivers.htm|publisher=idinnovations|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenThesaurus''' is a multilingual [[thesaurus]] project built in open collaboration by volunteers. Its data is freely available as [[open content]].
It is known for its usage in the applications [[OpenOffice.org]], [[LibreOffice]], [[KWord]], [[Lyx]], and [[Apple Dictionary]].

== Contents ==
The database takes words that are associated with at least one meaning. Apart from synonyms, it also contains some taxonomic relations.
There is a [[German language|German]], a [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], a [[Polish language|Polish]], a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], a [[Slovak language|Slovak]], a [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and a [[Greek language|Greek]] version available. The German version has over 280,000 synonyms.

=== Access and editing ===
The data is freely available under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL). The database can be searched online without login through a web frontend on the website. Apart from that the data is also available in formats for use with the [[word processor]]s of the [[office suite]]s [[LibreOffice]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] ([[OpenOffice.org Writer|Writer]]) or as a complete [[database dump]]. With a free account users that are logged in can also add and alter entries. All entries have to be checked at least once before a release is made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-linux.de/news/2003/5565.html Pro-Linux News: OpenThesaurus vor dem ersten Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The cause for the start of the project was the arrival of OpenOffice.org in 2002, which was missing the thesaurus of its parent, StarOffice, due to its licensing. OpenThesaurus filled that gap by importing possible synonyms from a freely available German/English dictionary and refining and updating these in [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] work through the use of a web application.

Since version 2.0.3 OpenOffice.org innately ships with OpenThesaurus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.vfll.de/2007/04/16/open-thesaurus-mitbauen-am-schatzhaus/ Open Thesaurus: Mitbauen am Schatzhaus » blog.frei!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The project has gained a lot of popularity following the arrival of Apple Dictionary in Mac OS X 10.5, which can integrate OpenThesaurus data through a plugin.

The '''''Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine''''' is a pocket textbook aimed at [[medical students]] and [[junior doctors|junior]] [[physician|doctors]], and covers all aspects of clinical medicine. It is published by [[Oxford University Press]], and is available in print format and online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199232178.do Oxford University Press - Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; First published in 1985, it is now in its tenth edition, which was released in July 2017.

==Description==

The ''Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine'', now in its 10th edition (July 2017), is a pocket textbook. It was first written by a group of friends as a collection of notes designed to help new doctors and covers the full breadth of the medical and surgery subjects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warriner|first=David|date=February 2008|title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=336|pages=393|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popularly known in the UK as the "Cheese and Onion" owing to the colour scheme of the cover. It gives advice on clinical management issues, and includes "witty, esoteric asides" linking medicine to other areas, such as classic history and popular culture&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  The OHCM, as it's also called, was banned from various UK medical schools for making medicine “too easy”, but by 2003 had made it onto several reading lists, including Royal Free London, with the comment “everybody owns this!!” &lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2014/01/nine-facts-oxford-handbook-clinical-medicine-ohcm/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paseo del Prado''' is one of the main [[boulevard]]s in [[Madrid]], Spain. The Paseo del Prado is the oldest historical urban in Madrid and was declared [[Bien de Interés Cultural]] (BIC). It runs north-south between the [[Plaza de Cibeles]] and the [[Plaza del Emperador Carlos V]] (also known as Plaza de [[Madrid Atocha railway station|Atocha]]), with the [[Plaza de Cánovas del Castillo]] (the location of the [[Fuente de Neptuno]], and of the Ritz and Palace five-star hotels) lying approximately in the middle. The Paseo del Prado forms the southern end of the city's central axis (which continues to the north of Cibeles as the [[Paseo de Recoletos]], and further north as the [[Paseo de la Castellana]]).

This densely tree-lined, wide and centric avenue is a landmark for the city residents and the location of important cultural and tourist spots in the city, including the so-called ''[[Golden Triangle of Art]]'', which encompasses three museums: the [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]] (with highlights such as [[Diego Velázquez]]'s ''[[Las Meninas]]'' and [[Francisco de Goya]]'s ''[[La maja vestida]]'' and ''[[La maja desnuda]]''), the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]] (housing a collection that spans eight centuries of European painting), and the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia|Reina Sofia Museum]] (where [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' hangs, among a collection of 20th-century art). In the vicinity are located the [[Parque del Buen Retiro]] and the [[Casón del Buen Retiro]] (hosting the 19th-century collection of the Prado Museum), as well as the headquarters of the [[Real Academia Española]] (the Spanish language academy), the [[Bolsa de Madrid]] (the city's stock exchange), and the [[Congreso de los Diputados]] (the national congress).

The Paseo del Prado boulevard includes several monuments and enclosures that are of historical and artistic interest, erected in the eighteenth century for the Hall of Prado urban project.  Numerous ornamental and landscaping grounds were constructed for this project. The highlights of this project include the [[Edificio Villanueva|Villanueva Building]], headquarters of the Prado Museum, the [[Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid|Royal Botanical Gardens]] and the sculptural water fountains of [[Fountain of Neptune (Madrid)|Neptune]], [[Fountain of Cybele (Madrid)|Cibeles]] and [[Fountain of Apollo (Madrid)|Apollo]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==History==
Philadelphia celebrated the 100th anniversary of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] with the [[Centennial Exposition]] in 1876. [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], which contained the art gallery, was intended to outlast the Exposition and house a permanent museum. Following the example of London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]], the new museum was to focus on applied art and science, and provide a school to train craftsmen in drawing, painting, modeling, and designing.&lt;ref name="history 1"/&gt;

The [[Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art]] opened on May 10, 1877. (The school became independent of the museum in 1964 and is now part of the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]). The museum's collection began with objects from the Exposition and gifts from the public impressed with the Exposition's ideals of good design and craftsmanship. European and Japanese fine and decorative art objects and books for the museum's library were among the first donations. The location outside of [[Center City Philadelphia|Center City]], however, was fairly distant from many of the city's inhabitants.&lt;ref name="glasssteelandstone.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/472.php |title=Philadelphia Museum of Art :: Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States |publisher=Glass Steel and Stone |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511205337/http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/472.php |archivedate=2013-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission was charged until 1881, then was dropped until 1962.&lt;ref name="history 2"/&gt;

Starting in 1882, [[Clara Jessup Moore]] donated a remarkable collection of antique furniture, enamels, carved ivory, jewelry, metalwork, glass, ceramics, books, textiles and paintings. The Countess de Brazza's lace collection was acquired in 1894 forming the nucleus of the lace collection. In 1893 Anna H. Wilstach bequeathed a large painting collection, including many American paintings, and an endowment of half a million dollars for additional purchases. Works by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] and [[George Inness]] were purchased within a few years and [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]]'s ''The Annunciation'' was bought in 1899.&lt;ref name="history 2"/&gt;

[[File:Plan for the Fairmount Parkway by Jacques Greber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Fairmount Parkway plan, 1917]]
In the early 1900s, the museum started an education program for the general public, as well as a membership program.&lt;ref name=history1900s&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-225-21.html "About Us: Our Story: 1900-1910"]. ''philamuseum.org''. Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved March 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fiske Kimball]] was the museum director during the rapid growth of the mid- to late-1920s, which included one million visitors in 1928—the new building's first year. The museum enlarged its print collection in 1928 with about 5,000 [[Old Master]] prints and drawings from the gift of Charles M. Lea, including French, German, Italian, and Netherlandish engravings.&lt;ref name=history1920s/&gt; Major exhibitions of the 1930s included works by [[Thomas Eakins|Eakins]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=history1930s&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-228-24.html "About Us: Our Story: 1930-1940"]. ''philamuseum.org''. Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved March 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, the museum's major gifts and acquisitions included the collections of John D. McIlhenny ([[Oriental rug|Oriental carpets]]), [[George Grey Barnard]] (sculpture), and [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (photography).&lt;ref name=history1940s&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-230-26.html "About Us: Our Story: 1940-1950"]. ''philamuseum.org''. Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved March 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern art dominated the growth of the collections in the 1950s, with acquisitions of the Louise and [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Walter Arensberg]] and the [[Albert Eugene Gallatin|A.E. Gallatin]] collections. The gift of Philadelphian [[Grace Kelly]]'s wedding dress is perhaps the best known gift of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="history 0"/&gt;

Extensive renovation of the building lasted from the 1960s through 1976. Major acquisitions included the Carroll S. Tyson, Jr. and Samuel S. White III and Vera White collections, 71 objects from designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s [[Étant donnés]]. In 1976 there were celebrations and special exhibitions for the centennial of the museum and the bicentennial of the nation. During the last three decades major acquisitions have included ''After the Bath'' by [[Edgar Degas]] and ''Fifty Days at Iliam'' by [[Cy Twombly]].&lt;ref name="history 0"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview of the Museum's History |website=philamuseum.org |publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art |url=http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-19.html |accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main building===
[[File:A357, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, Museum of Art and Fairmount Water Works at night, 2009.JPG|thumb|left|Main building at night above [[Fairmount Water Works]]]]
The City Council of Philadelphia funded a competition in 1895 to design a new museum building,&lt;ref name="history 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-224-20.html |title=The Early Decades: 1877–1900 |website=philamuseum.org |publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art |accessdate=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until 1907 that plans were first made to construct it on Fairmount, a rocky hill topped by the [[Fairmount Reservoir|city's main reservoir]]. The Fairmount Parkway (renamed [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]]), a grand boulevard that cut diagonally across the grid of city streets, was designed to terminate at the foot of the hill. But there were conflicting views about whether to erect a single museum building, or a number of buildings to house individual collections. The architectural firms of [[Horace Trumbauer]] and [[Zantzinger, Borie and Medary]] collaborated for more than a decade to resolve these issues. The final design is mostly credited to two architects in Trumbauer's firm: Howell Lewis Shay for the building's plan and [[massing]], and [[Julian Abele]] for the detail work and perspective drawings.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Brownlee, ''Making a Modern Classic: The Architecture of the Philadelphia Museum of Art'' (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1997), pp. 60–61, 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, Abele had become the first African-American student to be graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Department of Architecture, which is presently known as Penn's [[University of Pennsylvania School of Design|School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/21458 |title=Abele, Julian Francis (1881 - 1950) Architect |last=Tatman |first=Sandra L. |website=philadelphiabuildings.org |publisher=The [[Athenaeum of Philadelphia]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abele adapted classical Greek temple columns for the design of the museum entrances, and was responsible for the colors of both the building stone and the figures added to one of the [[pediment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.design.upenn.edu/people/julian-francis-abele-1881-1950 |title=Julian Francis Abele (1881-1950): First African American graduate of the School of Fine Arts |website=design.upenn.edu |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania School of Design]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the main building began in 1919, when Mayor [[Thomas B. Smith]] laid the cornerstone in a Masonic ceremony. Because of shortages caused by World War I and other delays, the new building was not completed until 1928.&lt;ref name="history 0"/&gt; The building was constructed with [[dolomite]] quarried in Minnesota.&lt;ref name="withartphila"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://withart.visitphilly.com/tours/galleries-and-gardens/ |title=Galleries and Gardens: Discover blossoming works of art in Philadelphia's green spaces |publisher=With Art Philadelphia |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wings were intentionally built first, to help assure the continued funding for the completion of the design. Once the building's exterior was completed, twenty second-floor galleries containing English and American art opened to the public on March 26, 1928 though a large amount of interior work was incomplete.&lt;ref name=history1920s/&gt;

The building's eight pediments were intended to be adorned with sculpture groups. The only pediment that has been completed, "Western Civilization" (1933) by [[C. Paul Jennewein]], and colored by [[Léon-Victor Solon|Leon V. Solon]], features his [[polychrome]] sculptures of painted terra-cotta figures, depicting Greek deities and mythological figures.&lt;ref name="nydn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Samuels |first=Tanyanika |title=Bronx street rename for borough's own sculptor Carl Paul Jennewein |newspaper=The New York Daily News |date=June 2, 2011 |page=31 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-street-rename-borough-sculptor-carl-paul-jennewein-article-1.127198 |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture group was awarded the Medal of Honor of the [[Architectural League of New York]].&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/NY/200003401.html |title=New York: C.

The European collections, dating from the medieval era to the present, encompass Italian and Flemish early-Renaissance masterworks; strong representations of later European paintings, including [[French Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]]; sculpture, with a special concentration in the works of [[Auguste Rodin]]; decorative arts; tapestries; furniture; the second-largest collection of arms and armor in the United States; and period rooms and architectural settings ranging from the facade of a medieval church in Burgundy to a superbly decorated English drawing room by [[Robert Adam]].&lt;ref name="collections" /&gt;

The museum's American collections, surveying more than three centuries of painting, sculpture, and decorative arts, are among the finest in the United States, with outstanding strengths in 18th- and 19th-century Philadelphia furniture and silver, [[Pennsylvania German]] art, rural Pennsylvania furniture and ceramics, and the paintings of [[Thomas Eakins]]. The museum houses the most important Eakins collection in the world.&lt;ref name="collections" /&gt;

Modern artwork includes works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Antonio Rotta]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Constantin Brâncuși]], as well as American modernists. The expanding collection of [[contemporary art]] includes major works by [[Agnes Martin]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Jasper Johns]], and [[Sol LeWitt]], among many others.&lt;ref name="collections" /&gt;

The museum houses encyclopedic holdings of costume and textiles, as well as prints, drawings, and photographs that are displayed in rotation for reasons of preservation.&lt;ref name="collections" /&gt;

===The Carl Otto Kretzschmar von Kienbusch Collection===
[[File:1600 Milan Half Armor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Armor, Milan, Italy, c.1600]]
The museum also houses the [[armor]] collection of Carl Otto Kretzschmar von Kienbusch. The Von Kienbusch collection was bequeathed by the celebrated collector to the museum in 1976, the [[wikt:bicentennial|Bicentennial]] Anniversary of the [[American Revolution]]. The Von Kienbusch holdings are comprehensive and include European and Southwest Asian arms and armor spanning several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/press/releases/2004/405.html |title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Information : Press Room : Press Releases : 2004 |publisher=Philamuseum.org |date=2004-09-27 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2000, the museum and the [[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden|State Art Collections]] in [[Dresden]], Germany (''Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden''), announced an agreement for the return of five pieces of armor stolen from Dresden during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/press/releases/2000/189.html |title=PMA press release |publisher=Philamuseum.org |date=1999-12-16 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Von Kienbusch had unsuspectingly purchased the armor, which was part of his 1976 bequest. Von Kienbusch published catalogs of his collection, which eventually led Dresden authorities to bring the matter up with the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3795448 Carl Otto Kretzschmar von Kienbusch and the Collecting of Arms and Armor in America, Donald J.

==Gallery expansion==
[[File:Philadelphia Museum of Art Construction rear.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The west entrance covered during construction in 2008]]
Due to high attendance and overflowing collections, the museum announced in October 2006 that [[Frank Gehry]] would design a building expansion. The {{convert|80000|ft2|adj=on}} gallery will be built entirely underground behind the east entrance stairs and will not alter any of the museum's existing Greek revival facade. The construction is projected to last a decade and cost $500 million. It will increase the museum's available display space by sixty percent and house mostly contemporary sculpture, Asian art, and special exhibitions.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | first=Robin | last=Pogrebin | authorlink=Robin Pogrebin | url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/arts/design/19gehr.html | title=Philadelphia Museum Job Sends Gehry Underground| publisher=New York Times | date=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Master Plan"&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/294-508-397.html PMA web site] "Master Plan", accessed, May 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncertainty was cast on the plans by the 2008 death of [[Anne d'Harnoncourt]], but new director [[Timothy Rub]], who had initiated a $350 million expansion at the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], will be carrying out the plans as scheduled.  In 2010, Gehry attended the groundbreaking for the second phase of the expansion, due to be completed in 2012.  In that phase, a new art handling facility was created on the south side of the building, enabling the museum to reclaim a street level entrance, closed since the mid-1970s, which leads to a 640-foot-long vaulted walkway that extends across the museum and is original to the 1928 building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planphilly.com/eyesonthestreet/2014/07/02/frank-gehry-s-quiet-intervention-at-the-philadelphia-museum-of-art "Frank Gehry's Quiet Intervention at the Philadelphia Museum of Art"], Plan Philly, Accessed May 14, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The north entrance will be reopened to the public as a part of the "core project", which is scheduled for completion in 2020.&lt;ref&gt; Romero, Melissa.

Said Gehry: "When it's done, people coming to this museum will have an experience that's as big as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Bilbao]]. It won't be apparent from the outside, but it will knock their socks off inside."&lt;ref name = "Master Plan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USA T"&gt;{{cite news

In March 2017 the museum announced a $525 million campaign.&lt;ref name=Cascone/&gt; The core project is budgeted at $196 million and will be funded through the campaign.&lt;ref name=Cascone/&gt; The museum also announced that more than 62 percent of the campaign goal has been met, as of March 30, 2017.&lt;ref name=Cascone/&gt;

==In popular culture==

Besides being known for its architecture and collections, the Philadelphia Museum of Art has in recent decades become known due to the role it played in the ''[[Rocky]]'' films{{emdash}}''Rocky'' (1976) and five of its six sequels, ''[[Rocky II|II]]'', ''[[Rocky III|III]]'', ''[[Rocky V|V]]'', ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' and ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]''. Visitors to the museum are often seen mimicking [[Rocky Balboa]]'s (portrayed by [[Sylvester Stallone]]) famous run up the east entrance stairs, informally nicknamed the [[Rocky Steps]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitphilly.com/museums-attractions/philadelphia/the-rocky-statue-and-the-rocky-steps/ The Rocky Statue and the Rocky Steps] visitphilly.com, accessed June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Screen Junkies]] named the museum's stairs the second most famous movie location behind only [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenjunkies.com/movies/movie-lists/10-most-famous-movie-locations/ ''10 Most Famous Movie Locations''] [[Screen Junkies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An {{convert|8.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall bronze statue of the Rocky Balboa character was created in 1980 and placed at the top of the stairs in 1982 for the filming of ''[[Rocky III]]''. After filming was complete, Stallone donated the statue to the city of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Art Commission eventually decided to relocate the statue to the now-defunct [[Wachovia Spectrum#Statues|Spectrum]] sports arena due to controversy over its prominent placement at the top of the museum's front stairs and questions about its artistic merit. The statue was placed briefly on top of the stairs again for the film ''Rocky V'' and then returned to the Spectrum. In 2006, the statue was relocated to a new display area on the north side of the base of the stairs.&lt;ref name=rocky1&gt;{{cite web |last=Avery |first=Ron |url=http://www.ushistory.org/oddities/rocky.htm |title=Philadelphia Oddities - Rocky Statue |publisher=Independence Hall Association |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rocky2&gt;{{cite web |last=Holzman |first=Laura |url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/rocky/ |title=Rocky |publisher=Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia |date=2013 |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum provides the backdrop for concerts and parades because of its location at the end of the Ben Franklin Parkway. The museum's east entrance area played host to the American venue of the international [[Live 8]] concert held on July 2, 2005 with musical artists including [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Linkin Park]] and [[Maroon 5]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050703011106/http://www.live8.us/100.html Live 8 Philadelphia (scroll down)], [[Archive.org]], July 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philadelphia Freedom Concert]], orchestrated and headlined by [[Elton John]], was held two days later on the same outdoor stage from the Live 8 concert&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070624081921/http://www.phillyfreedom.net/concert.htm The Philadelphia Freedom Concert], [[Archive.org]], July 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while a preceding [[Ball (dance party)|ball]] was held inside the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070624081848/http://www.phillyfreedom.net/ball.htm The Philadelphia Freedom Ball], [[Archive.org]], July 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Quid''''' is a [[France|French]] [[encyclopedia]], established in 1963 by [[Dominique Frémy]]. It was published annually between 1963 and 2007, first by [[Plon (publisher)|Plon]] (1963-1974) and later by [[Éditions Robert Laffont]] (1975-2007), and was the most popular encyclopedic reference work in [[France]].

The presentation is very compressed, and [[abbreviations]] are used extensively in [[Telegram style|telegraph style]]. It uses very thin paper to get all the information into one volume. It is published each year in one volume about the size of a large dictionary. The motto of the work is "tout sur tout ... Et tout de suite " (roughly translated as: "All about everything ... and right away"). Examples of the precise information included in ''Quid'' are: a) the use of moustaches among Austrian mailmen is forbidden to avoid them being confused with military officers; b) in 1850 there were 1,400,000 inhabitants in [[Finland]], and c) in the West, a woman spends an average of 100 days of her life in ironing.&lt;ref name="2008-demise"&gt;John Lichfield. "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/frances-favourite-encyclopaedia-falls-victim-to-wikipedia-784420.html]". ''Independent'', 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first edition was published by [[Plon (publisher)|Plon]] in the first quarter of 1963 was sold in 20,000 copies. It was a 632-page illustrations-free paperback. In addition to a brief table of contents, the book included a 10-page index. The author introduced it as a “complete, up-to-date, handy and easy-to-read” book. He announced the book would be published yearly. The next edition was published in the third quarter of 1964: the book was made of a cardboard binding and was a little bit larger (824 pages). The first editions were cosigned by [[Michèle Frémy]], [[Dominique Frémy]]’s wife. The encyclopedia became larger over the years, reaching the size of a large dictionary. Each edition now needs the contribution of around 12,000 specialists.

The 2007 edition of ''Quid'' cost €32; its 2,176 pages contained 2,500,000 items about 650 topics. It sold only about 100,000 copies, compared to more than 400,000 in the 1990s. In February 2008, the 2008 edition was canceled by the publisher, [[Éditions Robert Laffont|Robert Laffont]], which said that print encyclopedias can no longer compete with the free information available on the internet. Frémy, the founder of ''Quid'', said that he would find another publisher and intended to publish a 2009 edition for Christmas 2009.&lt;ref name="2008-demise"/&gt;

==Internet==
For some time, ''Quid'' was available on the Internet. The original site www.quid.fr disappeared around 2010. In addition to the complete current issue, it offered a daily news website, a world atlas with maps and 6,000 lexical entries on the 36,380 French communes with details about their history, geography, tourist attractions and economic life.

[[Image:Hurt Report cover page.png|220px|thumb|Example of a front page of a report]]
A '''report''' or '''account''' is an [[Information technology|informational]] work, such as writing, speech, television or film, made with the intention of relaying information or recounting events in a presentable form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/report|title=Report - definition of report by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report is made with the specific intention of relaying information or recounting certain events in a way that is concise, factual and relevant to the audience at hand. Reports may be conveyed through a written medium, speech, television, or film. In professional spheres, reports are a common and  vital communication tool. Additionally, reports may be official or unofficial, and can be listed publicly or only available privately depending on the specific scenario. The audience for a report can vary dramatically, from an elementary school classroom to a boardroom on [[Wall Street]].

== Usage ==
Reports fill a vast array of informational needs for a spectrum of audiences. They may be used to keep track of information, evaluate a strategy, or make decisions. Written reports are documents which present focused and salient content, generally to a specific audience. A type of an official report would be a police report, which could have legally binding consequences. Other types of reports, such as ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', inform the public about the quality of products available on the market. Reports are used in government, business, education, science, and other fields, often to display the results of an experiment, investigation or inquiry.

== Attributes ==
One of the most common formats for presenting reports is [[IMRAD]]—introduction, methods, results, and discussion. This structure, standard for the genre, mirrors traditional publication of scientific research and summons the ethos and credibility of that discipline. Reports are not required to follow this pattern and may use alternative methods such as the problem-solution format, wherein the author first lists an issue and then details what must be done to fix the problem. Transparency and a focus on quality are keys to writing a useful report. Accuracy is also important. Faulty numbers in a financial report could lead to disastrous consequences.

== Standard Elements ==
Reports use features such as tables, graphics, images, voice, or specialized vocabulary in order to persuade a specific audience to undertake an action or inform the reader of the subject at hand. Some common elements of written reports include headings to indicate topics and help the reader locate relevant information quickly, and visual elements such as charts, tables and figures, which are useful for breaking up large sections of text and making complex issues more accessible. Lengthy written reports will almost always contain a table of contents, appendices, footnotes, and references. A bibliography or list of references will appear at the end of any credible report and citations are often included within the text itself. Complex terms are explained within the body of the report or listed as footnotes in order to make the report easier to follow. A short summary of the report's contents, called an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], may appear in the beginning so that the audience knows what the report will cover. Online reports often contain hyperlinks to internal or external sources as well.

Verbal reports differ from written reports in the minutiae of their format, but they still educate or advocate for a course of action. Quality reports will be well researched and the speaker will list their sources if at all possible.

== Types ==
Some examples of reports are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5106">"'''Shepherd's Guide'''" is the title given to several books, that were published to help [[Shepherd|shepherds]] identify stray herds. The books depict patterns of [[Lamb marking|sheep marking]], in the ear and on the wool, and name their owner with his residence.

One of the earliest ''Shepherd's Guide'' was prepared for parts of [[Cumberland]] by Joseph Walker, in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.longsleddale.co.uk/fullrecs/SMITf.htm|title=Shepherd's Guides - Longsleddale|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosgson's 1849 ''Guide'' was delivered to a list of subscribers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pastpresented.ukart.com/eskdale/sheep/marks.htm | title = SHEEP MARKS AND THE "SHEPHERD'S GUIDE"}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while ''Gate's new shepherd's guide for Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire'', of 1879, has numerous pages of advertisements. While all of those feature a detailed engraving of sheep (repeated with different marks), the books from the late 19th and 20th centuries have a [[Line art|line sketch]]. Some were designed as pocket-books, and others were bigger. The later books are attributed to various farmer associations, and cover a wider perimeter.

The books are useful as a [[genealogical]] and [[local history]] resource, and as [[Collectable|collectibles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Antiques Roadshow]], series 37 episode 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arvanites]] in Greece use the version ''shkla'' to refer to the Greek population,&lt;ref name="Pipa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shuka"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsitsipis, Lukas (1981). ''Language change and language death in Albanian speech communities in Greece: A sociolinguistic study''. (Thesis). University of Wisconsin. pp. 100-101. "The term /evjeni̇́stika/ meaning “polite”, used by the young speaker to refer to Greek, is offered as synonymous to /shkljiri̇́shtika/ one of the various morphological shapes of the Arvanitika word /shkljeri̇́shtë/ which refers to “the Greek language”. Thus, Greek is equated with the more refined, soft, and polite talk. The concept of politeness is occasionally extended from the language to its speakers who are the representatives of the urban culture. In conversations in Kiriaki, I heard the word /shklji̇́ra/ (fem.) referring to a city women who exhibits polite and fancy behavior according to the local view. As I stated in the introduction to this dissertation, most of the occurrences of the term /shkljeri̇́shtë/ are not socially marked, and simply refer to the Greek language. But a few are so marked and these are the ones that reflect the speakers’ attitudes. The term /shkljeri̇́shtë/ is ambiguous. This ambiguity offers a valuable clue to the gradual shift in attitudes. It points to the more prestigious Greek language and culture, and also has a derogatory sense. In my data only the first meaning of the socially marked senses of the word occurs."; pp. 101-102. "The second meaning is offered by Kazazis in his description of the Arvanitika community of Sofikó, in the Peloponnese (1976:48): . . . two older people from Sofiko told me independently that, to the not-so-remote past, it was those who spoke Greek with their fellow-Arvanites who were ridiculed. Even today, if an older inhabitant of Sofiko were to speak predominantly in Greek with his fellow villagers of the same age, he would be called i shkljerishtúarë, literally “Hellenized” but used here as a derogatory term denoting affectation. One of those two informants, a woman, said that, until about 1950, it was a shame for a girl in Sofiko to speak Greek with her peers, for that was considered as “putting on airs.” In Spata, /shkljeri̇́shtë/ is used only to refer to “the Greek language” although speakers are aware of the other meanings of the word."&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbereshe]] in Italy, a substantial part of which originates from the Arvanites, use the words ''shklan'' and ''shklerisht'' which mean "that does not speak [[Arbëreshe language|Arbereshe]]", or "that speaks an incomprehensible language", referring to the [[Romance languages|Latin languages]].&lt;ref name="Shuka"&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09erCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=shkla&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3n5qOyMLJAhUBWz4KHZ5GDq44HhDoAQhIMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=shkla&amp;f=false| author=Gjergji Shuka|title=Tridhjetë Këngë Dhe Legjenda Ballkanike: Studim Mbi Origjinën Historike| page=78|trans-title=Thirty songs and Balkanic legends: Study over the historical origin| year=2015| publisher=Naimi| isbn=9789928109866 | oclc=928752657| quote= translated&lt;br&gt;''Among Albanians of Greece, where our song originates, the word "shkla" is used to identify the Greek neighbors; among the Arbereshe of Italy - who frequently trace their origin to the today's western Greece - the words "shklan" and "shklerisht" mean: "who does not speak Arberisht" or "who speaks an incomprehensible language", referring, of course, to Latin language.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from either from the [[Venetian language|Venetian]] ''schiavone'' meaning the same{{what?|date=July 2018}} &lt;ref name="Pipa"&gt;{{citation| author=[[Arshi Pipa]]| year=1978| isbn=9783878281061| oclc=5281689| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lppAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=shkla&amp;dq=shkla&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwismPSHycLJAhUBUj4KHYpLBus4FBDoAQhCMAg| quote=Since « Shkla- vun » is the albanization of Venetian « Schiavone », it would seem that the setting is Maina.

"North Albanian call Slavs shqé (sg. shqá &lt;shkjá &lt;shklá, from sclavus), whereas to Greco-Albanians shklerisht means ‘in the Greek language.’ Hamp observes that “obviously the meaning is traditionally ‘the neighbouring foreigner,’ as with Welsh, Vlah, etc.”"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era''''' is a [[Chinese astrology]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled by the lead editor [[Gautama Siddha]] and numerous scholars from 714 to 724 AD during the [[Kaiyuan era]] of [[Tang Dynasty]]. The compilation is attributed to the author by 729.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Susan.  [2004] (2004). The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith. British Library Staff. Serindia Publications, Inc.  {{ISBN|1-932476-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its full title is regarded as the '''''Great Tang Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era'''''. It is also referred to as the '''''Kaiyuan Star Observations'''''.&lt;ref name="Deng"&gt;Deng, Yinke.  [2005] (2005).  Chinese Ancient Inventions.  {{ISBN|7-5085-0837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book==
The book is divided into 120 volumes and consisted of about 600,000 words. The compilation of writings was based on many previously written astrological and divination materials, and probably a similar classic known as the ''Yisizhan'', compiled by [[Li Chunfeng]] approximately 645. It incorporated many fragments of other works, including the star catalogues of [[Shi Shen]] and [[Gan De]], and contained a translated version of [[Navagraha]] calendar under the chapter of 104. The astronomical [[Aryabhata's sine table|table]] of [[Trigonometric functions|sines]] by the [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]] and [[Indian astronomy|astronomer]], [[Aryabhata]], were also translated into the ''Kaiyuan Zhanjing''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unclear|date=March 2016}}

The manuscript copies had started to fade away since the [[10th century]], but was over again received a special attention by scholar [[Cheng Mingshan]] in 1616 and was later included in the [[Siku Quanshu]] collections of the [[18th century]].

==History==
Among Moore's post war abstract bronzes, it is a part of the Two Piece Reclining Figure series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/arts/story.asp?id=7431|title=Sculpture is like a journey|work=Detroit Metro Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be read as one figure or two.&lt;ref&gt;''A Garden for Art'', Valerie J. Fletcher, LOC # 97-61991, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I did the first one in two pieces almost without intending to. But after I had done it, then the second one became a conscious idea. I realised what an advantage a separated two- piece composition could have in relating figures to landscape. Knees and breasts are mountains.

Once these two parts become separated you don't expect it to be a naturalistic figure; therefore you can justifiably make it look like a landscape or a rock. If it's a single figure, you can guess what it's going to be like. If it's in two pieces there's a bigger surprise, you have more unexpected views; therefore the special advantage over painting—of having the possibility of many different views—is more fully explored. The front view doesn't enable you to foresee the back view. As you move round it, the two parts overlap or they open up and there's space in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mailchristies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1609508 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021247/http://mailchristies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1609508 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reviews==
[[File:Two-piece-title.JPG|thumb|Gift of [[Joseph Hirshhorn]], 1974 ]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;A work like ''Two Piece Reclining Figure: Points'', from 1969, has the feel that Moore aimed at — but didn't always achieve — of form as primal matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1699248,00.html|title=Making the Most of Henry Moore|date=2 January 2008|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Italic title}}
The '''''Título de Totonicapán''''' (Spanish for "Title of Totonicapán"), sometimes referred to as the '''''Título de los Señores de Totonicapán''''' ("Title of the Lords of Totonicapán") is the name given to a [[K'iche' language]] document written around 1554 in [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Recinos98p167"/&gt; The ''Título de Totonicapán'' is one of the two most important surviving colonial period K'iche' language documents, together with the ''[[Popol Vuh]]''.&lt;ref name="Matthew12p28"&gt;Matthew 2012, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The document contains history and legend of the [[K'iche' people]] from their mythical origins down to the reign of their most powerful king, K'iq'ab.&lt;ref name="Recinos98p167"/&gt;

==History of the document==
In 1834 the K'iche' inhabitants of [[Totonicapán]] asked the departmental governor to persuade Dionisio José Chonay, the curate of [[Sacapulas]], to translate the document into Spanish. The Spanish translation was archived in Totonicapán where it was found by French historian [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] in 1860.&lt;ref name="Recinos98p167"&gt;Recinos 1998, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Brasseur de Bourbourg made a copy of the document and took it with him back to France, where it was passed on to [[Alphonse Pinart]] after the former's death. From Pinart this copy passed into the ownership of Hyacinthe de Charencey who produced a French translation and published both the French and Spanish texts under the title ''Título de los Señores de Totonicapán: Titre généalogique des seigneurs de Totonicapan''.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1998, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morselli Barbieri 2004, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The whereabouts of the original K'iche' document was unknown for many years until it was shown to American anthropologist [[Robert Carmack]] by the K'iche' mayor of Totonicapán in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1998, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morselli Barbieri 2004, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The introductory section of the ''Título'' includes large parts of the ''Theologia Indorum'', written by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Domingo de Vico]] in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2016, pp. 79, 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1953 translation by Delia Goetz she says: "The said manuscript consists of thirty-one quarto pages; but translation of the first pages is omitted because they are on the creation of the world, of Adam, the Earthly Paradise in which Eve was deceived not by a serpent but by Lucifer himself, as and angel of light. It deals with the posterity of Adam, following in every respect the same order as Genesis and the sacred books as far as the captivity in Babylonia. The manuscript assumes that the three great Quiché nations with which it particularly deals are the descendants of the Ten Tribes of the Kingdom of Israel, whom Shalmanser reduced to perpetual captivity and who, finding themselves on the border of Assyria, resolved to emigrate."{{sfn|Chonay and Goetz|p=166&amp;mdash;167}}

Like the ''Popol Vuh'', the ''Título de Totonicapán'' describes how the ancestors of the K'iche' travelled from a mythical location referred to as Seven Caves, Seven Canyons to another place called Tulan Suywa in order to receive their gods. From Tulan Suywa the ancestors traveled west across the sea to the highlands of Guatemala. According to the ''Título'' the ''Pa Tulán, Pa Civán'' (seven caves, seven canyons) was "in the other part of the ocean, where the sun rises". They were the "descendants of Israel, of the same language and the same customs". When they rose from ''Pa Tulán, Pa Civán'' the leader of the three tribes was Balam-Qitzé. The great father ''Naxit'' gave them a present called ''Giron-Gagal''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The "Bundle", symbol of power and majesty, the carefully kept stone which, as related further on, made the peoples fear and respect the Quichés. ''Popul Vuh'' (1950), 205.&lt;/ref&gt; When they arrived at the edge of the sea, "Balam-Quizé touched it with his staff and at once a path opened, which closed up again for thus the great God wished it to be done, because they were sons of Abraham and Jakob".{{sfn|Chonay and Goetz|p=page 170}}

The first part of the ''Título'' describes the travels and conflicts with other groups of the Quichés before they settled in their homelands in the Guatemalan highlands.

At this time their leader, Balam-Qitzé, sent ambassadors to their father and lord Naxit. So "that he will know the state of our affairs; that he will furnish us means so that in the future our enemies shall never defeat us; that they shall never belittle the nobility of our birth; that he will designate honors for us and for all of our descendants;and that, finally, he will send public offices for those who deserve them." Two ambassadors were sent out, one to the East and one to the west. Qocaib set off to the east and accomplished his mission. Qocavib encountered some problem on the shores of the lake of Mexico and returned without doing anything.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to this description, it appears that Qocaib went toward Yucatán, where lord Naxit &amp;mdash;that is Quetzalcoatl&amp;mdash;lived, following the east coast of the peninsula; Qocavib took the route of the Usumacinta as far as the ''Laguna de Terminos'', which the text calls "Lake of Mexico," whence he returned.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chonay and Goetz|p=page 194}} Qocaib was received by Naxit and was awarded various honoraria that legitimized the rule of the lords of the Quichés.

The rest of the ''Título'' is a history of the Quiches before the arrival of the Spanish. This includes a description of how the K'iche' established a defensive border against the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]], which had expanded to include [[Soconusco]] within the [[Aztec]] empire.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 2012, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Título'' is careful to record the genealogy of the lords of the Quichés, who sign the document for the Spanish in 1554, using their Christian names; describing themselves as the descendants of Balam-Qitzé and their ancestors who "came from the other part of the sea, from Civán-Tulán, bordering on Babyonia."

===Comparisons with the ''Popol Vuh''===

In the ''Popol Vuh'', the ancestors of the K'iche' were created in Paxil Cayala (at the place of sunrise) and moved to Tulan Suywa, Seven Caves, Seven Canyons. Later in the ''Popol Vuh'' the two locations are merged into one. In the ''Título de Totonicapán'', the latter version is used, with Paxil Cayala and Tulan Suywa merged into the mythical place of origin. This place is described as the [[Garden of Eden|Earthly Paradise]], called Wuqub' Pek Wuqub' Siwan, Siwan Tulan (Seven Caves, Seven Canyons, Canyon Palace).&lt;ref&gt;Sachse 2008, pp. 124, 130. Christenson pp. 89, 111, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Título'' describes how the first ancestors of the "seven nations" were powerful ''[[nagual|nawal]]s'' (sorcerers) who travelled across the water from Tulan Siwan.&lt;ref&gt;Sachse 2008, pp. 124, 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt; The mention of paradise, a mention of "true Sinai" in the text and the placement of Tulan in the east on the other side of the sea all show the influence of Christian beliefs upon the text.&lt;ref&gt;Sachse 2008, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Tulan is identified in the text as a place of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Sachse 2008, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Título de Totonicapán'' (and also the ''Popol Vuh'') when the first ancestors arrived "from across the sea" they did not eat but rather sustained themselves by inhaling the smell of the tips of their staffs.&lt;ref&gt;Sachse 2008, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Nacxit was one of the titles used for [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin]] [[Quetzalcoatl]], a mythical lord. In the ''Título'', two sons of Balam Quitze were sent to Nacxit to ask for peace; Co Caib went to the place of sunrise and C'o Cavib to the place of sunset; the document specifically equates the latter with Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Sachse 2008, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that in the text C'o Cavib went west to Mexico has been interpreted as an attempt by the K'iche' to connect themselves with the politically and culturally powerful Aztec lords of [[Tenochtitlan]]. Nacxit gave them the Pisom Q'aq'al, the bundle of glory equated with fire and the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Sachse 2008, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Titulo de Totonicapán'' and the Mormon church==

Members of [[Mormonism|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] believe that the historical part of the [[Book of Mormon]] is a true history of peoples led by Lehi and later by Nephi that left the land of Jerusalem and crossed the oceans, several centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ and arrived in "the promised land", the Americas. They believe that the Titulo de Totonicapán and the [[Popul Vuh]] support this origin.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Mormon: A Sacred Ancient Record", Ted E. Brewerton, Talk given at the General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, October, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Archaeology and the Book of Mormon]].

[[File:Ekman Vainamoinen.jpg|thumb|right| [[Robert Wilhelm Ekman|R.W Ekman]]: Väinämöinen]]

'''Väinämöinen''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈʋæinæˌmøinen}}) is a [[deity|demigod]], hero&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siikala|first1=Anna-Leena|title=Itämerensuomalaisten mytologia|publisher=Finnish Literature Society|year=2013|isbn=978-952-222-393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the central character in [[Finland|Finnish]] [[folklore]] and the main character in the [[national epic]] ''[[Kalevala]]''.  His name comes from the Finnish word ''väinä,'' meaning ''stream pool.'' Väinämöinen was described as an old and wise man, and he possessed a potent, magical voice.

==In Finnish mythology==
The first extant mention of Väinämöinen in literature is in a list of [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastian]] gods by [[Mikael Agricola]] in 1551. He and other writers described Väinämöinen as the god of chants, songs and poetry; in many stories Väinämöinen was the central figure at the birth of the world. The Finnish national epic, the ''[[Kalevala]]'', tells of his birth in the course of a [[creation myth|creation story]] in its opening sections.  This myth has elements of creation from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] and from a [[World egg|cosmic egg]], as well as of [[earth diver]] creation.

At first there were only primal waters and Sky.  But Sky also had a daughter named [[Ilmatar]].  One day, seeking a resting place, Ilmatar descended to the waters.  There she swam and floated for 700 years until she noticed a beautiful bird also searching for a resting place.  Ilmatar raised her knee towards the bird so it could land, which it did.  The bird then laid six eggs made of gold and one made of iron.  As the bird [[Avian incubation|incubated]] her eggs Ilmatar's knee grew warmer and warmer.  Eventually she began to be burned by the heat and responded by moving her leg.  This motion dislodged the eggs, which then fell and shattered in the waters.  Land was formed from the lower part of one of the eggshells, while sky formed from the top.  The egg whites turned into the moon and stars, and the yolk became the sun.

Ilmatar continued to float in the waters for several hundred years, admiring the results of these events, but she could not resist an urge to continue creation.  Her footprints became pools for fish, and simply by pointing she created contours in the land.  In this way she made all that is.  Then one day she gave birth to Väinämöinen, the first man, whose father was the sea.  Väinämöinen swam off until he found land, but the land was barren, so he asked the Great Bear in the sky for help. [[Sampsa Pellervoinen|A boy carrying seeds]] was sent down to him, and this boy spread [[flora|plant life]] across the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|2009}} - entry [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t279.e108 "Finnish Creation"] Retrieved 2010-04-30&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighteenth century folk tale collected by [[Cristfried Ganander]], Väinämöinen is said to be son of [[Kalevi (mythology)|Kaleva]] and thus brother of [[Ilmarinen]].

==In the ''Kalevala''==
In the nineteenth century, some folklorists, most notably [[Elias Lönnrot]], the writer of ''Kalevala'', disputed Väinämöinen's mythological background, claiming that he was an ancient hero, or an influential [[shaman]] who lived perhaps in the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book
  | last = Turunen
  | first = Aimo
  | title = Kalevalan sanat ja niiden taustat
  | publisher = Karjalaisen kulttuurin edistämissäätiö
  | year = 1981
  | isbn = 951-9363-24-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stripping Väinämöinen from his direct godlike characteristics, Lönnrot turned Väinämöinen to the son of the primal goddess [[Ilmatar]], whom Lönnrot had invented himself. In this story, it was she who was floating in the sea when a duck laid eggs on her knee.
He possessed the wisdom of the ages from birth, for he was in his mother's womb for seven hundred and thirty years, while she was floating in the sea and while the earth was formed. It is after praying to the sun, the moon, and the great bear (the stars, referring to [[Ursa Major]]) he is able to escape his mother's womb and dive into the sea.

Väinämöinen is presented as the 'eternal [[bard]]', who exerts order over chaos and established the land of [[Kalevi (mythology)|Kaleva]], that so many of the events in ''Kalevala'' revolve around. His search for a wife brings the land of Kaleva into, at first friendly, but later hostile contact with its dark and threatening neighbour in the north, [[Pohjola]]. This conflict culminates in the creation and theft of the [[Sampo]], a magical artifact made by [[Ilmarinen]]; and the subsequent mission to recapture it, and a battle which ends up splintering the Sampo and dispersing its parts around the world to parts unknown.

[[File:Väinämöisen lähto.jpg|thumb|170px|Akseli Gallen-Kallela: ''The Departure of Väinämöinen'']]
Väinämöinen also demonstrated his magical voice by sinking the impetuous [[Joukahainen]] into a bog by singing. Väinämöinen also slays a great [[pike (fish)|pike]] and makes a magical [[kantele]] from its jawbones.

Väinämöinen's end is a [[hubris]]tic one. The 50th and final poem of the ''Kalevala'' tells the story of the maiden Marjatta, who becomes pregnant after eating a berry, giving birth to a baby boy. This child is brought to Väinämöinen to examine and judge. His verdict is that such a strangely born infant needs to be put to death. In reply, the newborn child, mere two weeks old, chides the old sage for his sins and transgressions, such as allowing the maiden [[Aino (mythology)|Aino]], sister of [[Joukahainen]] to drown herself. Following this, the baby is baptized and named king of ''Kalevala''. Defeated, Väinämöinen goes to the shores of the sea, where he sings for himself a boat of copper, with which he sails away from the mortal realms. In his final words, he promises that there shall be a time when he shall return, when his crafts and might shall once again be needed. Thematically, the 50th poem thus echoes the arrival of [[Christianity]] to [[Finland]] and the subsequent fading into history of the old [[paganism|pagan]] beliefs. This is a common theme among epics, for in the tale of [[King Arthur]], Arthur declares a similar promise before departing for [[Avalon]].

In the original 1888 translation of ''Kalevala'' into English by John Martin Crawford, Väinämöinen's name was anglicised as '''Wainamoinen'''.

==In other cultures==
In the [[Estonia]]n national epic [[Kalevipoeg]], a similar hero is called [[Vanemuine (god)|Vanemuine]]. In neighbouring Scandinavia, [[Odin]] shares many attributes with Väinämöinen, such as connections to magic and poetry.

==Popular culture==
The Kalevala has been translated into English and many other languages, in both verse and prose, in complete and abridged forms.  For more details see [[list of Kalevala translations]].

===J. R. R. Tolkien===
Väinämöinen has been identified as a source for [[Gandalf]], the wizard in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire |first=Ellen |last=Snodgrass |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |year=2009 |pages=161–162 |isbn=9781438119069 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&amp;pg=PT171&amp;lpg=PT171&amp;dq=V%C3%A4in%C3%A4m%C3%B6inen+Tolkien&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=giJHKQ28x_&amp;sig=0JmeZjyfnmzh-6BzWtwBlz64Aj0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ztJUUITGJcTbtAbjrYAg&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=V%C3%A4in%C3%A4m%C3%B6inen%20Tolkien&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Tolkienian character with great similarities to Väinämöinen is [[Tom Bombadil]]. Like Väinämöinen, he is one of the most powerful beings in his world, and both are ancient and natural beings in their setting. Both Tom Bombadil and Väinämöinen rely on the power of song and lore. Likewise, [[Treebeard]] and the [[Ent]]s in general have been compared to Väinämöinen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tolkien and the Invention of Myth: A Reader |editor-first=Jane |editor-last=Chance |chapter=J.R.R. Tolkien and the ''Kalevala'': Some Thoughts on the Finnish Origins of Tom Bombadil and Treebeard |first=David Elton |last=Gay |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |year=2004 |isbn=9780813123011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LLxZXqgJdwC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=V%C3%A4in%C3%A4m%C3%B6inen+Tolkien&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q54VKj_phg&amp;sig=3CjjYgkKDJQtPJuuGHWtOv03KmU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ztJUUITGJcTbtAbjrYAg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=V%C3%A4in%C3%A4m%C3%B6inen%20Tolkien&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Akseli Gallen-Kallela===
In art (such as the accompanying picture by [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]]), Väinämöinen is described as an old man with a long white beard, which is also a popular appearance for wizards in [[fantasy literature]].

===Music===
In music, Finnish [[folk metal]] band [[Ensiferum]] wrote a pair of songs based on/about Väinämöinen, called "Old Man" and "Little Dreamer." There is also a direct reference to him in their song "One More Magic Potion", where they have written "Who can shape a kantele from a pike's jaw, like the great One once did?". The band's mascot, who appears on all their albums, also bears a similarity to traditional depictions of Väinämöinen.
Another Finnish metal band named [[Amorphis]] released their tenth album [[The Beginning of Times]] in 2011. It is a concept album based on the myths and stories of Väinämöinen. 
Yet another well-known Finnish metal band, [[Korpiklaani]] has released a song about the death of Väinämöinen, Tuonelan Tuvilla, as well as an English version named "At The Huts of the Underworld".
A song on the album ''Archipelago'' by Scottish [[electronic jazz]] collective [[Hidden Orchestra]] is also named "Vainamoinen".
Philadelphia based Black metal band Nihilistinen Barbaarisuus released a song about Väinämöinen simply called "Väinämöinen" on their second studio album ''The Child Must Die'' in 2015.

===Science fiction and fantasy===
[[Joan D. Vinge]]'s  ''[[The Summer Queen]]'' contains characters named Vanamoinen, Ilmarinen and Kullervo. They are not the characters from the legend though but may have been inspired by them. That book is the sequel to her [[Hugo Award]]-winning novel ''[[The Snow Queen (Vinge novel)|The Snow Queen]]''.

Väinämöinen is also a major character in The Iron Druid Chronicles novel, ''[[Hammered (Hearne novel)|Hammered]]'' by [[Kevin Hearne]].  The series follows the Tempe, Arizona-based 2,100-year-old Irish Druid, [[Atticus O'Sullivan]]. This particular book in the series' main plot point is the ingress of several characters - the Slavic thunder god [[Perun]], O'Sullivan, a [[werewolf]], a [[vampire]], Finnish folk legend Väinämöinen, and [[Taoist]] [[fangshi]] [[Zhang Guolao]] - into Asgard to kill [[Norse mythology|Norse]] thunder god [[Thor]], all for their own varied reasons.

===Comic books===
There is a Finnish comic strip called "Väinämöisen paluu" (The Return of Väinämöinen) by [[Petri Hiltunen]], where Väinämöinen returns from thousand-year exile to modern Finland to comment on the modern lifestyle with humor.

In the storyline "Love her to Death" of the web-comic [[Nukees]], Gav, having died, arrives to an afterlife populated by gods. Among them is Väinämöinen, who, among other things, complains that one only gets women by playing the electric [[kantele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bleuel|first1=Darren|title=Nukees - Friday, March 18, 2005|url=http://www.nukees.com/d/20050318.html|website=Nukees|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Uncle Scrooge]] comic "[[The Quest for Kalevala]]", drawn by [[Don Rosa]], Väinämöinen helps Scrooge and company to reassemble the [[Sampo]] (mythical mill that could produce gold from thin air) and then leaves with it back to Kalevala, but not before giving Scrooge its handle as a souvenir.

In the webcomic "[[Axis Powers Hetalia]]", the character of Finland was given the human name Tino Väinämöinen.

'''William Barclay Squire''' (16 October 1855 – 13 January 1927) was a British musicologist, librarian and librettist.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100526612&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
William Barclay Squire was a devoted music enthusiast. He spent 35 years of his life (1885-1920) working for the [[British Museum]], where he took charge of the collections of the music department and added many antiquarian publications to it. Squire prepared the publishing of the ''Catalogue of Printed Music before 1801'' (edited in 1912) and negotiated the deposit of the Royal Music Collection, for which he prepared the catalogue. He contributed numerous articles to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911]], to the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] and to the [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Dictionary of Music and Musicians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Author:William Barclay Squire]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, Squire acted as a librettist. His main work was the [[libretto]] for ''The Veiled Prophet'', a Romantic Opera in 3 acts composed by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], adapted from the homonymous ballad in [[Thomas Moore|Thomas Moore's]] oriental romance ''[[Lalla-Rookh|Lalla Rookh]]'', published 1890.&lt;ref&gt;https://urresearch.rochester.edu/institutionalPublicationPublicView.action;jsessionid=386750CF2E77AD967B345A05639F1EC2?institutionalItemVersionId=23447&lt;/ref&gt;
