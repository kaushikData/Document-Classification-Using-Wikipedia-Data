Fought in the [[First Battle of Seoul]]. After the U.S. Marines ground down the hill defenses on Seoul's west side and entered Seoul proper on 25 September, the NKPA's 18th Division commander had decided that the battle was lost and began withdrawing his unit, which had been fighting in the Yongdungp'o area south of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/brochures/kw-unoff/unoff.htm The Korean War: The UN Offensive]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Apollo Musagetes Pio-Clementino Inv310.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Apollo Citharoedus in the Vatican]]
'''Apollo Citharoedus''' (Cithara-playing Apollo), also known as '''Apollo Musagetes''' ("Apollo, Leader of the Muses") is a 2nd-century AD colossal marble statue of [[Apollo]] by an unknown Roman artist.  It is a major example of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type.

Apollo is here crowned with laurel and wears the long, flowing robe of the Ionic bard. 
The statue was found with seven statues of the [[Muses]] near [[Tivoli, Italy]], in 1774, in the ruins of [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]]' villa, and is now preserved in the Hall of the Muses, standing along with the seven statues in the Museo Pio-Clementino of the [[Vatican Museums]].

'''"Brandenburger Tor"''' ("The [[Brandenburg Gate]]") was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990]], performed in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] by [[Ketil Stokkan]].

The song is inspired by the collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]], with Stokkan singing about the amazement that many Europeans felt as the Wall came down, and also at the reunification of [[Berlin]], with the titular Brandenburg Gate no longer representing the border between [[West Germany|West]] and [[East Germany]]. As befits the triumphant lyrical theme, the song is performed over an up-tempo beat.

The song was performed ninth on the night, following [[Iceland]]'s [[Stjórnin]] with "[[Eitt lag enn]]" and preceding [[Israel]]'s [[Rita Kleinstein|Rita]] with "[[Shara Barkhovot]]". At the close of voting, it had received 8 points, placing 21st (equal last) in a field of 22.

It was succeeded as [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|Norwegian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991 Contest]] by [[Just 4 Fun (band)|Just 4 Fun]] with "[[Mrs. Thompson (song)|Mrs. Thompson]]".

[[File:Briquetage, iron slag &amp; sherds, Worcester City Art Gallery &amp; Museum, England - DSCF0769.JPG|thumb|alt=brown shards in cases|Briquetage, iron slag &amp; [[sherds]], Worcester City Art Gallery &amp; Museum, England]]
'''Briquetage''' is a coarse [[ceramic]] material used to make evaporation vessels and supporting pillars used in extracting [[salt]] from [[brine]] or [[seawater]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Anthony: ''Salt in Prehistoric Europe.'' Leiden: Sidestone Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-90-8890-201-7}}, pp. 73&amp;nbsp;ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Thick-walled [[salt pan (evaporation)|saltpan]]s were filled with saltwater and heated from below until the water had boiled away and salt was left behind. Often, the bulk of the water would be allowed to evaporate in [[saltern]]s before the concentrated brine was transferred to a smaller briquetage vessel for final reduction. Once only salt was left, the briquetage vessels would have to be broken to remove the valuable commodity for trade.&lt;ref&gt; Lane &amp; Morris (2001) A Millennium of Saltmaking: Prehistoric and Romano-British Salt Production in the Fenland&lt;/ref&gt;

Broken briquetage material is found at multiple sites from the later [[Bronze Age]] in [[Europe]] into the medieval period and [[archaeologist]]s have been able to identify different forms and fabrics of the pottery, allowing trade networks to be identified. Saltworking sites contain large quantities of the orange/red material and in [[Essex]] the mounds of briquetage are known as [[Red hill (salt making)|Red Hills]]. A recent discovery at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in [[Vânători-Neamţ|Lunca]], Neamt County, [[Romania]], indicates that [[Neolithic]] people of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Precucuteni Culture]] were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of Briquetage to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC, making it perhaps the oldest saltworks in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/weller/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430145935/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/weller/ |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Antiquity Vol 79 No 306 December 2005 The earliest salt production in the world: an early Neolithic exploitation in Poiana Slatinei-Lunca, Romania Olivier Weller &amp; Gheorghe Dumitroaia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cimec.ro/arheologie/sarea/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221030521/http://www.cimec.ro/arheologie/sarea/index.html |archivedate=21 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }} Valeriu Cavruc Gheorghe Dumitroaia Vestigii arheologice privind exploatarea sãrii pe teritoriul României în perioada neo-eneoliticã&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre''' is located in [[Harmondsworth]], [[London Borough of Hillingdon]]. Colnbrook, adjacent to [[Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre]] and [[London Heathrow Airport]], houses only males. Colnbrook, which opened in August 2004, is built to Class B prison standards, making it one of the highest security immigration removal centres in the United Kingdom alongside Brook House. Colnbrook has 308 bed spaces.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/immigrationremovalcentres/colnbrook Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905122608/http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/immigrationremovalcentres/colnbrook |date=2008-09-05 }}." [[UK Border Agency]]. Retrieved on 13 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was officially opened by [[Des Browne]], who was then Immigration Minister, in September 2004.

The design of the centre is modelled on a high security, Category B criminal prison with wings running into a central area. Each cell is designed to hold two detainees. There is a toilet built into the cell.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The centre is operated by [[Mitie]] who also operate  [[Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre]] .

Colnbrook detains people who are due for removal from the UK due to inadequate right to enter or to remain in the United Kingdom and this may include foreign-national prisoners who have completed their sentences in UK prisons and who are detained pending removal from the country.

The centre offers detainees a range of activities whilst they are waiting for deportation including a library, multi-faith worship facilities, education provision, gym and sports activities, and a shop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4349">An '''escadrille''' (literal translations: "[[squad]]" or "small [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]]") is a type of military unit, most often found in the [[air force]]s of some [[French language|French]] speaking countries. While the term is frequently translated into English as "squadron", an ''escadrille'' was originally a smaller unit (whereas the French ''escadron'', in the context of aviation is a much larger unit, comparable in status to a [[Squadron (naval)|naval squadron]]). Polish variant of the name of similar unit is '''eskadra'''.

The first air ''escadrilles'' were formed in France before [[World War I]], in 1912.&lt;ref name="Chant"/&gt; They were initially a loosely defined group of aircraft capable of similar tasks, in most cases not more than six aeroplanes in each.&lt;ref name="Aeroplane"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite journal | author = | date=1913-07-03 | title =French manœuvres | journal =The Aeroplane | volume =5 | issue = | page =262 | id = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war the ''escadrille'' became the basic independent unit of aviation within the French armed forces. An escadrille was a homogeneous unit, armed with a single type of aeroplane, with permanent flying and ground personnel attached, motorised transport and tent [[hangar]]s.&lt;ref name="Chant"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book |author1=Christopher Chant |coauthors= |editor1= |others= |title=The illustrated history of the air forces of World War I &amp; World War II|url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1979 |publisher=Galley Press |location= |isbn=978-0-86136-792-4 |oclc= |pages=28–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1915 the ''[[Armee de l'Air]]'' had grown to 119 ''escadrilles'' of 10 aircraft each: 14 of fighters, 50 of bombers and the rest reconnaissance, spotter and communications units.&lt;ref name="Chant"/&gt; While ''escadrilles'' initially operated independently, during the [[Battle of Verdun]] (1916), ''chasseur'' (fighter) ''escadrilles'' were formed into larger formations, for easier coordination.&lt;ref name="Almanac"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book |author1=David F. Burg |author2=L. Edward Purcell |editor1= |others= |title=Almanac of World War I|chapter=29 February 1916 | url= |edition= |series= |volume= |date=2004-03-31 |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location= |isbn= |oclc= |page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], French ''escadrilles'' usually fielded between 10 and 12 aircraft. Hence they were roughly equivalent to a German ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|staffel]]'', Italian ''gruppo'' or Polish ''eskadra'' (10 aircraft in 1939). This was in contrast to air squadrons of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] or [[United States]], which usually had 12&amp;ndash;18 aircraft, divided into two to four [[flight (unit)|flight]]s.

Until 1949, between one and four French ''escadrilles'' formed a ''[[groupe]]''. Since then, however, ''escadrilles'' have been subordinate to ''escadrons''. As such, ''groupes'' and ''escadrons'' are the equivalent of the German language terms ''[[Gruppe (military)|gruppe]]'' and ''[[geschwader]]''; and the English language terms "[[wing (military unit)|wing]]" and "[[group (air force)|group]]" (the definitions of which also vary from one nation to another).

'''Family Radio''', also known by its [[licensee]] name '''Family Stations Inc.''', is a Christian radio network based in [[Alameda, California]], United States, founded by Lloyd Lindquist, Richard H. Palmquist and [[Harold Camping]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truthradio.com/Camping.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Family Radio's music programming consists mainly of early American hymns and avoids other [[genres]] generally, including [[Contemporary Christian Music]] and [[southern gospel]]. 

One of Family Radio's oldest broadcasts was a call-in program called ''Open Forum'' in which Harold Camping, the station's president, responded to callers' questions and comments as they relate to the Bible and he used the platform to promote his various end-time predictions. According to the International Business Times in an article dated 05/24/2011, "Harold Camping has spent approximately $100 million to promote and advertise his May 21 Doomsday prediction." The program was finally cancelled not long after Camping's third failed "rapture-less" prediction and a stroke which he suffered in June 2011. Other programs include ''Family Bible Reading Fellowship'', ''Family Bible Study'', ''Rise and Rejoice'', ''Music to Live By'', ''The Quiet Hours'',  ''Beyond [[Intelligent Design]]'', ''The Christian Home'', and ''Family Radio World Wide''.&lt;ref name="Family Radio broadcast programs"&gt;{{citation|title=Family Radio broadcast programs|url=http://209.10.202.163/english/connect/broadcast/zone_sched/|publisher=Family Stations, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Family Radio relies solely on listener-supported funding and donations, and is unaffiliated with any [[religious denomination]].&lt;ref name="Family Radio General info."&gt;{{citation|title=Family Radio General Information|url=http://www.familyradio.com/english/admin/|publisher=Family Stations, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Outside programming broadcast over the Family Radio network is limited as Camping considers the organized church apostate, and therefore devoid of God's Spirit and under Satan's control.

The listenership of Family Radio understandably declined after the failed 1994 prediction, but before long the organization was growing at a rate much higher than it had previously experienced.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;James, Scott. "Warnings of the End of the World, Broadcast from Oakland."  The Bay Citizen. Published electronically May 19, 2011. http://www.baycitizen.org/columns/scott-james/warnings-end-world-broadcast-oakland/.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Camping sold his construction business and, with the funds, purchased KEAR-FM in San Francisco.  He then grew his broadcast empire so that by 1994 Family Radio comprised forty radio stations nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Press, Associated. "Prohecy on Radio: September It's All over Via His Radio Show, Harold Camping Predicts Judgement Day Is Almost Here." Orlando Sentinel, July 16, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, from 1994 to 2009, it grew at an even faster rate than before; by the time of his second campaign, the organization boasted 216 AM and FM radio stations, along with two television channels.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

With a growing national profile, the financial viability of the non-profit also grew. Financial strength hit a peak in 2007 when Family Radio reported $135 million in assets.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Adelle M. "End May Be Coming for Harold Camping's Family Radio Ministry."  Huffington Post: Religion. Published electronically May 14, 2013. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/14/end-may-be-coming-for-har_n_3274262.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As net assets declined from that point forward, listener contributions steadily increased. In 2008, total contributions were well over $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Cook, "Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax," ed. IRS (Washington DC2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  2009 saw an annual budget of $36.7 million with $117 million in assets and $18.4 million in contributions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;James, "Warnings of the End of the World, Broadcast from Oakland".&lt;/ref&gt; IRS records also indicate that Family Radio employed 348 persons in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, "Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax."&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 assets were down to $110 million while contributions rose to $18.7 million while the station maintained 346 employees.&lt;ref&gt;"Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax," ed. IRS (Washington DC2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 contributions fell to $17.2 million and assets dropped to $87.6 million, while the organization also lost 26 employees.&lt;ref&gt;"Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax," ed. IRS (Washington DC2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of 2011 the organizations assets had dropped to $29.2 million, and the next year was forced to take out a $30 million loan.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Weber, "Harold Camping's Family Radio Suffering Economic Woes,"  The Christian Post, http://global.christianpost.com/news/harold-campings-family-radio-suffering-economic-woes-95808/#vqFwR6HrrgM52LHG.99.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the year before the start of the 2011 campaign, Family Radio had its greatest level of assets. Upon the outset of the second campaign, the organizations assets dropped while contributions simultaneously rose indicating an increased level of spending by the organization, far surpassing the increase in income. Particularly noteworthy is that the average annual salary for a Family Radio employee is only $23,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Politics==
Family Radio does not discuss [[politics]] directly, campaign for political candidates, or endorse candidates or issues. Family Radio attempts to distance itself from political and social issues.

==History==
Family Radio began obtaining [[FM broadcasting]] licenses on commercial frequencies early in FM's history,{{When|date=May 2011}} and by 2006, was  ranked 19th among top broadcast companies in number of radio stations owned.&lt;ref name="News Media"&gt;
{{citation|title=State of the News Media 2006.|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2006/radio-intro/ownership/|publisher=Journalism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, a Family Radio founder, [[Harold Camping]], joined with other individuals of [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed]], Bible Baptist, and Conservative Christian [[Presbyterian]] churches to purchase an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio station in [[San Francisco, California]], [[KEAR (AM)|KEAR]], then at 97.3 [[megahertz|MHz]], to broadcast traditional [[Christian]] [[Gospel]] to the conservative [[Protestant]] community and [[Christian ministry|minister]] to the general public. With the primary purpose of broadcasting [[doctrines]] of Christianity reflective of the teachings of the Holy Bible, Family Radio remained independent, never merging with any particular church organization or church denominations.&lt;ref name="Family Radio's Biography"&gt;{{citation|title=Who or What is Family Radio?|url=http://www.familyradio.com/english/connect/bio/haroldcamping_bio.html|publisher=Family Stations, Inc.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526081054/http://www.familyradio.com/english/connect/bio/haroldcamping_bio.html|archivedate=2008-05-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After months of preparations, Family Radio aired its first broadcast on Wednesday, February 4, 1959.

Through the 1960s, as a [[Christian ministry|ministry]], both [[non-profit organization]] and [[non-commercial]], Family Radio acquired six additional FM stations and seven other [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations under guidelines established by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).&lt;ref name="Multiple Ownership;Radio Broadcast Stations"&gt;{{citation|title=Multiple  Ownership;Radio Broadcast Stations|url=http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/comments/dfcc02_0313.txt|publisher=Small Business Administration|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flagship station for the network of both full-power and low-power translator stations is [[KEAR (AM)|KEAR]]
in San Francisco (now at 610 [[kilohertz|kHz]], since 2005 at 106.9&amp;nbsp;MHz). Due to FCC rules regarding translator stations, the legal primary station for the translators was changed to [[KEBR (FM)|KEAR-FM]] in Sacramento, after the former primary FM station in San Francisco was sold to [[CBS Radio]].&lt;ref name="Infinity Broadcasting, Radio"&gt;{{citation|title=Infinity Broadcasting|url=http://www.cbsradio.com/press_center/releases/pressrelease124011-04-18-2005.html|publisher=CBS RADIO pressroom|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the sale of KEAR-FM to CBS Radio in 2005, broadcasts from San Francisco moved to an [[AM radio]] frequency.&lt;ref name="KEAR Family Radio Network 610 AM"&gt;{{citation|title=Family Stations, KEAR 610 AM
|url=http://radiotime.com/station/s_44534/Family_Radio_Network_610.aspx
|publisher=Radiotime your guide to radio|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many program productions broadcast throughout the Family Radio station network were produced in the [[Oakland, California]] facilities. The production process involved pre-recording two weeks of [[broadcast programming]] on [[reel-to-reel tape]]s distributed to each local Family Radio station for broadcast on the specified date. Free broadcast time was provided by Family Radio to national fundamentalist and [[evangelism|evangelical]] ministries—outside ministries' programs were sent in [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] and reel-to-reel tape formats to respective Family Radio stations for local broadcast. Popular network announcers and the programs they hosted included Jon Arthur (''The Quiet Hours'', ''Big Jon &amp; Sparky'', ''Radio Reading Circle''); Omar Andeel (''The Morning Clock''); Harold Hall (''The Christian Home''); Ken Boone (''Music to Live By''); Bob Swenson (''Transition''); and Jerry Edinger (''Nightwatch''). Each local Family Radio station had local board operators providing world, national, and local news and weather at various intervals throughout the day; regular public service announcements and daily public affairs programming; and local traffic reports via phone call-in during morning and afternoon weekdays. Outside ministry programs included ''[[Focus on the Family]]'', ''Freedom Under Fire'', ''[[Unshackled]]'', ''[[Back to the Bible]]'',
[[Focus on the Family|''Family News in Focus'']], ''Beyond [[Intelligent Design]]'', and "Walk with the King" with [[Robert A. Cook|Dr. Robert A. Cook]]. This last program, known as ''The King's Hour'', still airs today, although now often edited in places deemed incompatible with Camping's odd end-times and "apostate church" doctrinal stands.

By the late 1980s, programming was delivered via satellite, local news was taken off the stations in favor of a various national news from a Christian news source, and all but a few local announcements are produced at their Oakland, California facilities.&lt;ref name="Family Stations fact sheet"&gt;{{citation|title=Family Stations fact sheet|url=http://www.hoovers.com/free|publisher=Hoovers, a D&amp;B Co.|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1990s, Family Radio began gradually dropping outside ministries because of doctrinal changes in the ministry. As board members left the ministry, they were not being replaced. Harold Camping's views as they were changing became the focus of the entire ministry. Up until the late 1980s, Family Radio endorsed local [[church attendance]] but once Camping stated the church age was over, they now claim that Christians should NOT be members or attend church services of any type. Today Family Radio produces 95% of their programming and runs very few outside ministries. Most teaching programs were hosted by Harold Camping himself up until June 2011; after Camping suffered a stroke, his programs were gradually phased out.

Music broadcast by Family Radio in the 1960s and 1970s was typical of religious stations, commercial and non-commercial. Some commercial stations played [[Contemporary Christian Music]] (CCM) for a few hours a week, but in the 1980s, as commercial and some non-commercial Christian stations evolved to Contemporary formats, Family Radio remained with a mainly traditional music format composed of [[choir]] [[hymns]], various Gospel singing groups such as the [[Bill Gaither Trio]], Christian college choirs, instrumental orchestral hymn renditions from conductors such as [[Paul Mickelson]] and [[Ralph Carmichael]], vocalists such as [[George Beverly Shea]], [[Frank Boggs]], [[Doug Oldham]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[John McGill (singer)|John McGill]], [[Dave Boyer]], and others, and softer [[urban contemporary gospel]] songs. From the 1970s onward, Family Radio included a few selected tracks from some lighter contemporary Christian artists such as [[Maranatha]], [[Pam Mark Hall]], [[Nancy Honeytree]], [[Cynthia Clawson]], the [[New Creation Singers]], [[Ken Medema]], [[Michael Card]], [[Steve Green (singer)|Steve Green]] and others. But since the early 2000s, Family Radio has been trying to avoid the Contemporary format, even though this genre is still occasionally heard on its stations.

In the mid- to late 1970s there began a policy of not announcing the names of artists behind the music aired.  Presently there is a daily play list available on the web site for both east coast and west coast broadcasts.

Family Radio's text publications, continue to be based on the text of the authorized [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Stations text Bible|url=http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/frame/|publisher=FamilyStations, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open forum/text, authorized King James|url=http://forms.familyradio.org/dbqf/forum_100207j.html|publisher=FamilyStations, Inc.|author=Harold Camping|accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prerecorded Bible readings broadcast over satellite, shortwave, radio frequencies and the internet are generally based on the Modern King James Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Stations audio Bible|url=http://www.familyradio.com/english/connect/audio_archive/fbrf/|publisher=Family Stations, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to May 2011, Family Radio spent millions of dollars to advertise the now-discredited [[2011 end times prediction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/story/2011/05/21/apocalypse-day.html | work=CBC News | title=Apocalypse Not Yet: 'Rapture Hour' passes quietly | date=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after this supposed "Rapture" failed to happen, A Bible Answer, a Bible teaching ministry who had been tired of the "Rapture",  threatened to buy 66 full-powered radio stations from Family Radio founder Harold Camping in an effort to get him to resign from preaching this doctrine. The threat came with a catch &amp;ndash; they were not to take possession of the stations until October 22, the day after Camping's revised set-date for the end of the world. A Bible Answer's [http://www.abibleanswer.org website] calls for Camping to resign from the Family Radio board, citing "the self-proclaimed expert on the Bible has brought reproach upon Christ, the Bible, and the church," and adds "After taking the money of his supporters, let Harold give up all he has, to show he believes what he is preaching. He does not or else he would sell. It is time to get new leadership at Family Radio."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-info.com/news/family-radio-gets-a-1-million-offer-to-sell-their-66-stations Family Radio gets a $1 million offer to sell their 66 stations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531132023/http://www.radio-info.com/news/family-radio-gets-a-1-million-offer-to-sell-their-66-stations |date=2011-05-31 }} - ''[http://www.radio-info.com Radio-Info.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103161747/http://www.radio-info.com/ |date=2012-01-03 }}'' (released May 30, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abibleanswer.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=142&amp;Itemid=36 Goodbye Harold] - ''[http://www.abibleanswer.org A Bible Answer]'' (released May 23, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2011, the radio industry website Radio-Info.com reported that Family Radio was putting two of its full-powered FM stations up for sale. These stations were: WKDN in [[Camden, New Jersey]] (covering [[Philadelphia]]), and WFSI in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] (covering [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]). The article indicated that the ministry may have sold the stations to pay off "operating deficits accumulated over the last several years".&lt;ref&gt;"Round 3 of the bidding for Family Radio FMs in two markets", News article from Radio-Info.com, {{cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/round-3-of-the-bidding-for-family-radio-fms-in-two-markets |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224105148/http://www.radio-info.com/news/round-3-of-the-bidding-for-family-radio-fms-in-two-markets |archivedate=2011-12-24 |df= }} 3 August 2011; retrieved 8 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  WFSI would be purchased in November 2011 by [[CBS Radio]], which converted the station to a [[Spanish language]] [[dance music]] format under the [[WLZL]] [[call sign]].

In January 2012, Family Radio applied to the FCC to change the license of station WFME in [[Newark, New Jersey]], near [[New York City]], from non-commercial to [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]]. The application quickly prompted conjecture from radio industry monitors that the station would soon be sold. The application was approved in February.&lt;ref name=tri1&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Tom|title=New York scramble?: Is New York-market WFME (94.7) for sale?

The 94.7 signal would be relaunched as [[Country music|country-formatted]] station, [[WNSH]]. Shortly after 94.7's sale to Cumulus, Family Radio would low-powered FM station WDVY in [[Mount Kisco, New York]] from Cumulus, which would soon after adopt Family Radio's programming and the [[WFME-FM]] callsign.  In December 2013, Family Radio's shortwave transmitters in Okeechobee, Florida, were transferred to Radio Miami International.

Harold Camping died from a fall on December 15, 2013, in his home in [[Alameda, California]]. His death was confirmed by an employee of the ministry.

Despite the decrease of stations owned by Family Radio, the ministry continues to recover from the effects of the failed end-times prediction. Tom Evans succeeded Camping as president and general manager. The popularity of smartphones and tablets caused Family Radio to introduce its app for use on such electronics, besides normal computers and listening to broadcasts traditionally aired on its stations. Family Radio redesigned its Web site and introduced it in its new format in June 2014. In July and August of that year, the ministry introduced a few new programs that became part of its program schedule. They include ''Issues and Answers'', an updates-and-concerns program hosted by Tom Evans; and ''The Middle East Report'', a short news program hosted by journalist Brian Bush.

On November 21, 2014, [[the Walt Disney Company]] announced it would sell WQEW in New York City to Family Radio for $12.95 million, part of Disney's decision to end terrestrial distribution of [[Radio Disney]] format. The sale was approved on February 10, 2015, and the station returned on the air on February 27 as the new [[WFME (AM)]], thus giving Family Radio full coverage of the New York City metropolitan area for the first time in two years. Concurrent with the sale, the FCC converted WFME's broadcasting status from commercial to non-commercial.

During 2016, Family Radio moved its corporate offices and main studios from Oakland, where it had been based since the ministry's inception, to the adjacent East Bay city of Alameda, also near [[Oakland International Airport]] and the headquarters of the [[Oakland Raiders]]. 

In September 2018, Family Radio announced would no longer air programs featuring the voice of Harold Camping, and would no longer distribute literature of Camping's teachings. The decision was made as part of an effort to both move away from Camping's theology, and to reintroduce programs from outside ministries into the network's schedule. The changes are scheduled to go into effect on October 8, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.christianpost.com/news/harold-camping-programs-canceled-by-family-radio-says-teachings-not-scriptural-227627/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings and beliefs==
Central to Family Radio's and Camping's teaching is the belief that the Bible is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]] and completely true.  However, he emphasizes, this does not mean that each sentence in the Bible is to be understood only literally. Rather, the meaning of individual Biblical passages needs to be interpreted in the light of two factors.  The first is the context of the Bible as a whole.  The second is its spiritual meaning:  in Camping's words, "the Bible is an earthly story with a Heavenly meaning."  In Camping's latest publication, "We are Almost There!",&lt;ref name=waat&gt;{{citation|title=...Multiple  Ownership  of  Radio  Broadcast  Stations  in  Local  Markets
|url=http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/comments/dfcc02_0313.txt|publisher=Small Business Administration|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; he stated that certain Biblical passages pointed unquestionably to May 21, 2011, as the date of "[[Rapture]]", and pointed to October 21, 2011, as the end of the world.  This event did not occur on 21 May or 21 October. No acknowledgement of false teaching has yet been offered concerning the 21 October event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/24/rapture-october-harold-camping-apocalypse?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ed | last=Pilkington | title=Apocalypse still imminent: Rapture now coming in October | date=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's website became inaccessible early that day, and wasn't reachable until the early morning of May 22.

As a result of spending millions of dollars to promote his "end of the world" theory, many people sold everything they owned and donated it to Family Radio, sometimes even hundreds of thousands of dollars.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The California Attorney General's office has been asked by the Freedom from Religion Foundation to investigate Camping and Family Stations, Inc. for "Fraud and Deceit".&lt;ref&gt;http://ffrf.org/legal/Camping%20Letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time he left the Reformed Church in 1988 to his death, Camping taught doctrines that largely conflict with doctrines of the Reformed Church and traditional Christian teaching. The principles of [[Biblical hermeneutics]] upon which Camping framed his present teachings are:

# The Bible alone is the [[Biblical inspiration|Word of God]].
# Every Biblical passage must be interpreted in the light of the Bible as a whole.
# The Bible normally conveys multiple levels of meaning or significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Principles of Bible Study|url=http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/study/study_contents.html
|author=Harold Camping|publisher=Family Stations, Inc|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Numerology]] cannot be applied to numbers in the Bible when following the Biblical rules—some individuals have attempted to apply the concept to Camping's research.
# That salvation is unmerited and cannot be achieved by good works, prayer, belief or acceptance. It is a pure act of God's grace and that those to be saved were chosen "before the foundation of the world". He added conditions to salvation and teaching relative free will of humanity. However, he admitted that some, though very few, could be saved, while still in the worldly churches, just as there would be those saved inside the nation of Israel, and that leaving the churches is something a believer should do, just as a believer should not lie or cheat. He also gave credit to God for what has been called "common grace", where the unsaved, the yet to be saved and the saved are blessed to do good works, but this is not considered the gift of salvation itself.

The '''Hungarian Manual Alphabet''' (or '''a magyar ujjábécé''' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) is used for [[fingerspelling]] in [[Hungarian Sign Language]]. The most common is the one-handed alphabet near the face, but an adapted [[French Sign Language|LSF]]-style alphabet is sometimes employed.

The '''Ilercavones''' were an [[ancient Iberian]] (Pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]) people of the [[Iberian peninsula]] (the Roman [[Hispania]]). They are believed to have spoken an [[Iberian language]].  
==History==
The name [[Ilercavonia]] to refer to the territory occupied by this Iberian tribe appears in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] texts and documents and it was still mentioned in medieval texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencat.cat/ptop/actuacions/informacio_publica/peu_central_asco/documents/12_01_prospeccio_arqueologica.pdf Memòria de la prospecció arqueològica l/110kv Ascó - SE Tortosa]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern limits of this territory were in [[Serra de la Llena]], the northeastern in [[Coll de Balaguer]], the western in [[Mequinensa]] and the southern in [[Sagunt]].

The Ilercavones were very religious as a people. They did not have temples, but every mountain or hill was considered a sacred place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonasp.cat/ibers_1.pdf Manolo Freixa Bondia, ''Nonasp Antiguo''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706220422/http://www.nonasp.cat/ibers_1.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ilercavones as a nation or tribe were already mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]], who said that they inhabited the lands between river ''Udiva'' (possibly the [[Millars River]]) and further north of the [[Ebro]], and by [[Ptolemy]], who named the [[Cape (geography)|cape]] and the harbor where they lived ''Tenebri'' (possibly [[Orpesa]]). They were mentioned as well as by [[Livy]] in his texts describing the first phase of the Roman invasion of Iberia. 

After the Roman conquest the Ilercavones became [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]], much like the other Iberian tribes in the peninsula. Gradually, they became assimilated into the Roman population, especially after acquiring the [[Latin language]] as their own vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;José María Blázquez Martínez, ''La Romanización,'' Volume 1, Ed. Istmo, 1995, {{ISBN|978-84-7090-057-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological sites==
The most important archaeological sites are in the following places:
*[[Castellet de Banyoles]] in [[Tivissa]]
*[[Coll del Moro]] in [[Gandesa]]
*Below the Castle of La Suda in [[Tortosa]]
*[[Mianes]] in Tortosa
*Below the [[Templar]] castle in [[Miravet]]
*[[La Ferradura]] in [[Ulldecona]]
*[[Moleta del Remei]] in [[Alcanar]]
*[[Puig de la Nau]] in [[Benicarló]]

'''KD ''Jebat''''' is a {{sclass-|Lekiu|frigate|0}} guided missile [[frigate]] currently serving in the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] and one of the major naval assets for [[Malaysia]]. ''Jebat'' serves in the 23rd Frigate Squadron of the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] under Captain Aris Adi Tan Bin Abdullah.

The ship's class, built by [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]] (now [[BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions]]) in [[Glasgow]], [[United Kingdom]], is based on the FS 2000 light frigate design. ''Jebat'' was launched in May 1995 and commissioned in May 1999. ''Jebat'' carries the lower pennant number (F 29) to signify the seniority of this ship, which accommodates the Admiral of the Royal Malaysian Navy. ([[Hang Jebat]] succeeded [[Hang Tuah]] as ''[[Laksamana]]'' (Admiral) of the [[Malacca Sultanate]], while [[Hang Lekiu]] was never made a ''Laksamana''.)

The ship was a huge jump in capability compared to the frigates then operated by the Royal Malaysian Navy,  [[KD Rahmat|F24 KD ''Rahmat'']] and [[KD Hang Tuah|F76 KD ''Hang Tuah'']] (ex-HMS ''Mermaid''). Nevertheless, the delivery and operational status of ''Jebat'' were delayed due to integration of combat systems problems. The purchase of this ship also involved a major Transfer of Technology program as well as an offset program where some portion of the contract value would involve purchases and services contracted to Malaysian companies.

'''Kiss FM''' is a Top40/Hit Radio station from [[Romania]], owned by [[ANT1 Group]] . The station was rebranded from the old Radio Contact, after being purchased by a Belgian radio network. The rebranding came with a number of "on air" personalities, such as [[Șerban Huidu]] and [[Mihai Găinușă]], the new network quickly got to be one of the most popular hit stations in [[Romania]] where it covers the main cities.

Kiss FM Romania also has a branch in [[Chişinău]], the capital of Moldova, that broadcasts a mix between Kiss FM in Bucharest and local radio programmes.

In December 23, 2013 Kiss FM was bought by [[ANT1 Group]] after [[ProSiebenSat.1 Media]] AG sold its operations in Romania.

In January 15, 2014 Șerban Huidu left the radio station. He was replaced as Programs Director by Raluca Opreanu. The station's playlist manager is Andreea Berghea. In September 10, 2014 [[Sergiu Floroaia]] and Andrei Ciobanu joined the radio station as the hosts of the morning show.

The remaining three members of the band – Aleksander Vana (guitar), Kristo Rajasaare (drums) and Kõmmari (bass) – decided to take a time out, rehearse and try new singers. They finally chose Meelis Hainsoo (Hainz), violinist in Eriti Kurva Muusika Ansambel ('Ensemble of Especially Sad Music') and also a friend of their previous singer.

Their second album ''Kuidas tuli pimedus...'' ('How Darkness Came...'), which was released in 2003, includes songs that talk about love, death, depression, etc. Their biggest influences have been [[Joy Division]], [[Nick Cave]], and [[Кино]].

In 2004 they did an album with Estonian [[industrial metal]] band [[No-Big-Silence]] called ''[[Kuidas kuningas kuu peale kippus]]''.
In 2006 they released ''Pulmad ja matused'' ('Weddings and Funerals') and in 2008 ''Ainus, mis jääb, on beat'' ('Only Beat Endures').

On 18 July 2018, Raivo Rätte was killed when he was hit by a car apparently driven by his former wife's new partner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://elu24.postimees.ee/5791912/suri-kosmikute-basskitarrist-raivo-ratte Suri Kosmikute basskitarrist Raivo Rätte] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal investigation is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.postimees.ee/5791980/fotod-raivo-ratte-surmaga-seoses-peeti-kinni-27-aastane-mees Raivo Rätte surmaga seoses peeti kinni 27 aastane mees]{{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media in [[Djibouti]]''' is controlled by the government.

==Telecommunications==
{{main|Telecommunications in Djibouti}}
From [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]], telephone connections are available by satellite to [[Europe]] and the West and by land line to the main cities and towns of the interior. There were 9,500 mainline telephones and 23,000 cellular phones in use throughout the country in 2003.

==Television, radio and Internet==
[[File:Radtdjhd4.png|thumb|right|A news show on [[Radio Television of Djibouti]].]]
All media are government controlled. [[Radio Television of Djibouti|Radio Djibouti]] began broadcasting in the 1940s, during the colonial period in [[French Somaliland]].&lt;ref name="d10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubnov|first=Helena|title=A Grammatical Sketch of Somali|page=10|year=2003|publisher=Rudiger Koppe Verlag|location=Koln}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Djibouti inaugurated a powerful state-owned AM radio transmitting station, built with [[France|French]] and FRG funds. A television service was first introduced in 1967. Both are state run and broadcast in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Afar language|Afar]]. As of 2001, there were 1 AM and 2 FM radio stations and 1 television station. In 1997, there were 77 radios and 37 television sets per 1,000 population. [[Internet]] access was available to about 6,500 subscribers in 2003.

==Print==
Djibouti has one primary weekly newspaper, the government owned [[La Nation de Djibouti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanationdj.com/| title=La Nation de Djibouti }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a circulation of 4,300 in 2000. Each political party is allowed to publish a public journal. There are several opposition-run weeklies and monthlies that operate freely.

==Freedom of speech==
{{main|Freedom of the press in Djibouti}}
The constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press, but the government severely restricts journalism, and international observers say that Djibouti lacks freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/djibouti |title=Djibouti |publisher=RSF |date= |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/djibouti |title=Djibouti &amp;#124; Country report &amp;#124; Freedom of the Press &amp;#124; 2015 |website=Freedomhouse.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grilled game.JPG|thumb|[[Grilling|Grilled]] [[Game (food)|game]]: [[crocodile]], [[kudu]] and [[oryx]], in Windhoek, Namibia]]
[[File:LocationNamibia.svg|thumb|Location of [[Namibia]]]]

'''Namibian cuisine''' is the cuisine of [[Namibia]]. It is influenced by two primary cultural strands:

* Cookery practised by [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] of Namibia such as the [[Himba people|Himba]], [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Bushmen|San]] groups
* Settler cookery introduced during the [[Colonialism|colonial]] period by people of [[German people|German]], [[Afrikaner]] and [[British people|British]] descent.

== Indigenous cookery ==
[[File:Braai.jpg|thumb|[[Lamb chop (meat)|Lamb chop]]s on a [[Braai]]]]
In the precolonial period indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of [[fruit]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[bulb]]s, leaves and other products gathered from [[Wildcrafting|wild plants]] and by the hunting of [[Game (food)|wild game]]. The domestication of cattle in the region about two thousand years ago by [[Khoisan]] groups enabled the use of [[milk]] products and the availability of [[meat]]. However, during the colonial period the seizure of communal land in Namibia helped to discourage traditional [[agriculture]] and reduced the extent of land available to indigenous people.
* Fat Cakes
* [[Oshikundu]]

== Colonial cookery ==
[[Namibia]] was settled by German colonists during the nineteenth century, and German influence on white Namibian cookery remains very strong. One example of German settler cuisine is [[Wiener Schnitzel#Namibia|Wiener schnitzel]].

== Brewing ==
The German [[brewing]] tradition continued in colonial [[German South-West Africa]], with German [[lager]] beers including ''Tafel'' and ''[[Windhoek Lager|Windhoek]]'' lagers still brewed in the country for domestic consumption and export.

'''Nicolae Popa''' (born circa 1965) is a controversial Romanian businessman. In 2006 he was sentenced [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] to 15 years in jail for fraud and embezzlement related to the 2000 collapse of the [[Fondul Naţional de Investiţii]] (FNI) [[ponzi scheme]] with an estimated prejudice of 1.2 million euros spread between some 130,000 investors. This sentence is final; all appeals have been exhausted. Popa has also been sentenced to 12 years in jail for a different affair, [[Fondului Naţional de Acumulare]] (FNA), but this decision may still be appealed. On the run since 2002, Popa was apprehended in December 2009 in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. [[Sorin Ovidiu Vântu]], a high-profile businessman and owner of several newspapers and television stations, declared after Popa's apprehension that he still considers Popa a friend and that the sentences are "a giant manipulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.capital.ro/articol/omul-lui-vantu-de-la-fni-popa-nicolae-prins-la-jakarta-128820.html Omul lui Vântu de la FNI, Popa Nicolae, prins la Jakarta]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/FNI_-_ultimul_act_0_164384182.html FNI – ultimul act]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final televised debate of the [[Romanian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], Popa's arrest was used as political ammunition by the incumbent president [[Traian Băsescu]] against runoff rival [[Mircea Geoană]], after the latter met with Vântu the night before the debate just after news of Popa's apprehension broke out.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/basescu-l-a-intrebat-pe-geoana-despre-intalnirea-de-miercuri-seara-cu-vantu-5152306 Băsescu l-a întrebat pe Geoană despre întâlnirea de miercuri seară cu Vântu]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PANACREAS''' stands for “Integrating chemical approaches to treat [[pancreatic cancer]]: making new leads for a cure” and is being supported through Coordination Theme 1 (Health) of the [[European Community]]’s [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]].

== Summary ==

[[pancreatic ductal carcinoma|Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma]] ([[pancreatic ductal carcinoma|PDAC]]) is one of the most lethal human malignancies and a major health problem. It has been estimated that [[pancreatic ductal carcinoma|PDAC]] causes 34000 deaths per year in the [[European Union|EU]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;Ferlay J, et al. Ann Oncol 2007;18:581&lt;/ref&gt; Despite considerable research efforts in the past decades, conventional treatment approaches, including [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy|radiation]], [[chemotherapy]], and combinations of these, have close to no impact on the course of this aggressive [[neoplasm]]. Therefore, virtually all of the patients diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer|PC]] develop [[metastasis|metastases]] and die&lt;ref&gt;Li D, et al. Lancet 2004; 363:1049&lt;/ref&gt; 
Given this scenario, the search for new [[drug]]s to combat [[pancreatic ductal carcinoma|PDAC]] progression and thus increase patient [[life expectancy]] and quality of life has been given high priority.&lt;ref&gt;Philip PA et al. Consensus Report of the National Cancer Institute Clinical Trials Planning Meeting on Pancreas Cancer Treatment. J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 20;27:5660-5669&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[National Cancer Institute]]’s Gastrointestinal Cancer Steering Committee has recently place major emphasis on the enhancement of "research to identify and validate the relevant targets and molecular pathways in [[pancreatic ductal carcinoma|PDAC]], [[cancer stem cell]]s, and the [[Microenvironment (biology)|microenvironment]]";

== Expected results ==

The work proposed in this program meets the need to reverse-translate the clinical issues encountered in [[pancreatic ductal carcinoma|PDAC]] into tailored researches to overcome such problems. Particularly, resistance to conventional therapeutics and high propensity to metastasize were taken into account when choosing for this project therapeutics that act through novel modes of action, and molecular targets that are emerging as crucially involved in [[metastasis]]. Our consortium will produce numerous new molecules to be tested and validated for their anticancer activity. This represents the conditio sine qua non for the finding of drugs that can be effective against [[pancreatic ductal carcinoma|PDAC]]. The most promising compounds will be evaluated in clinically relevant mouse models of [[pancreatic ductal carcinoma|PDAC]]. Finally strong [[proof of concept|proof-of-concept]] activity of any of these compounds will be a green light for proceeding to an [[Investigational New Drug]]-(IND)-enabling study. In the time frame of this project, we will aim to release one or more molecules that are ready to be tested in [[clinical studies]]. The ultimate goal of these efforts will be to arrest [[pancreatic ductal carcinoma|PDAC]] progression and reduce [[mortality rate|mortality]].

'''''Peaceful War: How the Chinese Dream and the American Destiny Create a Pacific New World Order''''' is a book written by [[Patrick Mendis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClain |first=Buzz |url=http://newsdesk.gmu.edu/2013/10/new-book-suggests-modern-china-models-american-dream/ |title=New Book Suggests Modern China Models the ‘American Dream’|publisher=George Mason University|date=2013-10-18 |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides an epic analysis of the unfolding drama between the clashing forces of the [[Chinese dream]] and the [[American Dream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780761861867 |title=Peaceful War: How the Chinese Dream and the American Destiny Create a New Pacific World Order|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|date=2013-10-06 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreword to the book is written by [[Jack Goldstone]], the Virginia and John Hazel Professor of Public Policy at [[George Mason University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClain |first=Buzz |url=http://fairfaxnews.com/2013/10/gmu-professor-suggests-china-modeling-american-dream/ |title=GMU Professor Suggests China is Modeling the American Dream |publisher=Fairfax News|date=2013-10-18 |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Professor Mendis coined the new term "Pacific Dream" to describe possible outcomes resulting from the interface between the Sino-American policies and initiatives of President [[Barack Obama]] and President [[Xi Jinping]] that resonate with the American Dream and the Chinese dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mendis |first=Patrick |url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1344601/peaceful-war-drives-sino-us-relations |title=Peaceful War Drives Sino-US Relations |publisher=South China Morning Post|date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] officially unveiled President Obama's vision of the "Pacific Dream" to deliver mutual benefits among all stakeholders in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Guy|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/15/kerry-outlines-vision-pacific-dream-asia/?page=all/ |title=Secretary of State John Kerry outlines vision for ‘Pacific Dream’ Asia |publisher=Washington Times |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The themes of Mendis' book are seemingly drawn from ideas expressed during his extensive study and lecture tours in 2012 and 2013 at prestigious universities and institutions in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and elsewhere in Asia and America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.lk/2013/04/20/professor-patrick-mendis-speaks-on-the-chinese-dream-and-american-destiny/ |title=Professor Patrick Mendis Speaks on the ‘Chinese Dream’ and ‘American Destiny’|publisher=Financial Times|date=2013-04-20 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the lectures at the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niis.cass.cn/news/696891.htm |title=中国社会科学院亚太与全球战略研究院 |publisher=Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|date=2013-03-28 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Beijing and the [[Sun Yat-sen University]] in Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gms.sysu.edu.cn/article.asp?articleid=4079 |title=乔治梅森大学Patrick Mendis教授学术讲座 |publisher=Sun Yat-sen University School of Government |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other related publications appeared in the ''[[Yale Journal of International Affairs]]'', the Columbia University's ''[[Journal of International Affairs]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/chinas-buddhist-diplomacy |title=China’s Buddhist Diplomacy: Why Do America and India Entangle with Tiny Sri Lanka? &amp;#124; Journal of International Affairs |publisher=Columbia University|date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Minnesota Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2012/11/chinese-renaissance-man-touched-america-s-heartland |title=Chinese Renaissance Man is Touched by America’s Heartland |publisher=Minnesota Post|date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrick Mendis |url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1189936/what-does-chinese-dream-really-mean |title=What does the 'Chinese dream' really mean? |publisher=South China Morning Post|date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary and Contents==
The book contains a comparative analysis of the distinctive and different philosophies between the [[People's Republic of China]]'s millennia-old [[Confucian]] civilization and the young [[republic]] of the United States and its inspiring founding vision. The author explains that "America and China are two republics — the 'Old and Young.' China is an old and evolved civilization while America is new and created by enlightened men" (in 1776); however, "their approaches are different" in domestic governance and international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_13B/Aug03_1375550040CH.php |title=Sri Lanka: American UNESCO Commissioner Professor Patrick Mendis Honored in Sri Lanka |publisher=Colombo Page|date=2013-08-03 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book review of the author's previous book, ''[[Commercial Providence]],'' the United States' hidden and esoteric traditions as embedded in the symbolism and architectural design of Washington, DC, and the secret destiny of the American empire were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bressman |first=Jacob |url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2010/09/16/fea27.asp |title=America's Secret Mission Unveiled |publisher= Ceylon Daily News |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Peaceful War,'' Mendis also uncovered a number of previously unknown similarities, especially in the esoteric traditions of architectural designs of the [[Forbidden City]] surrounded by [[Tienanmen Square]] in the historic center of [[Beijing]] and the square-shaped original Federal City that encloses the [[Federal Triangle]] in [[Washington, DC]]. The author furthermore contrasts American foreign policy traditions derived from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] and China's adaptation of them. Such examples include Beijing's revision of America's [[Manifest Destiny]] in its policies within the Indian Ocean and its reworking of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] in the Pacific Ocean, the [[South China Sea]], and the [[East China Sea]]. 
   
Within his new book, Mendis explains that similar to the experience of the United States in having its foreign policy traditions spread over the Pacific Ocean and into [[Hawaii]] and the [[Philippines]], the post [[Deng Xiaoping]]’s China has practically been using “Hamiltonian means to Jeffersonian ends” and borrowed the founding idea inspired by the [[American Dream]] as a model for China’s [[peaceful rise]] in the Indo-Pacific region. The so-called [[Chinese dream]], as reinvented by President Xi, seems to continue Deng’s Hamiltonian experiment of the economic liberalization into the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mendis |first=Patrick |url=http://hir.harvard.edu/the-future-of-democracy/birth-of-a-pacific-order?page=0,3 |title=Birth of a Pacific Order &amp;#124; Harvard International Review |publisher=Harvard International Review|date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a possible “[[fiscal cliff]]” in America and a “social cliff” in China, the author revisits the history of [[Sino-American relations]] to explore the prospects for a return to the long-forgotten Beijing-Washington love affair launched in the trade-for-peace era before the [[First Opium War]] in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liu |first=Zhun |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/776413.shtml#.UlBsHtKsiSr |title=Sino-American Dreams Stem from Trade |publisher=Global Times |date=2013-04-21 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his two-month book and lecture tour in the late 2013 in China, Dr. Mendis told a Beijing news reporter 傅立钢 of the ''China Trade News'' that "economic and trade cooperation between China and the US" must now be carried out within "a legal framework" as global commerce has become the "mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fu |first=Ligang |url=http://www.chinatradenews.com.cn/founder/html/2013-11/07/content_42879.htm?div=-1 |title=法律框架下的中美经贸合作成为发展主流  |publisher=China Trade News |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The American Vision of the "Pacific Dream"==
The author envisions that President Obama's Asia pivot strategy and the new [[Silk Road]] plan of President Xi will eventually create a "Pacific Dream" and a [[New world order (politics)|New World Order]] of peace and prosperity for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2013/03/06/how-washingtons-asia-pivot-and-the-tpp-can-benefit-sino-american-relations/ |title=How Washington’s Asia Pivot and the TPP Can Benefit Sino–American Relations |publisher=East Asia Forum |date=2013-03-06 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key question raised in the book is: "Will China ultimately evolve into a democratic nation by rewriting the American Dream in Chinese characters, and how might this transpire?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.amazon.com/Peaceful-War-Chinese-American-Destiny/dp/0761861866/ref=pd_rhf_ee_p_tnr_1 |title=Peaceful War: How the Chinese Dream and the American Destiny Create a New Pacific World Order: Patrick Mendis: 9780761861867: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a strategic partner in the Pacific tasked with accommodating China's [[peaceful rise]], President Obama's Secretary of State Kerry outlined America's vision of the "Pacific Dream" for mutual benefit and a more peaceful world as he reiterated former Secretary [[Hillary Clinton]]'s previous announcement on President Obama's Asia pivot strategy and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Guy|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/15/kerry-outlines-vision-pacific-dream-asia/?page=all/ |title=Secretary of State John Kerry Outlines Vision for ‘Pacific Dream’ Asia |publisher=Washington Times |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the author of ''Peaceful War,'' the idea of the Pacific Dream can be traced back to the [[Louisiana Purchase]] as President Thomas Jefferson wanted to find a "short-cut" to China through the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Jefferson sought to extend his vision of the [[Empire of Liberty]] and the American Dream resonating from his national motto “[[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness]]” to the rest of the world. The democratic experience that evolved over the next two-hundred plus years has its own struggles and weaknesses but the American Dream has always been part of the DNA of the American Republic since its founding, and was revived later in Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s famous [[I Have a Dream]] speech.
 
In response to the author’s question at the Aspen Institute in Washington, his former boss Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] reminds the American public that the United States has historically had its own challenges with women, African-Americans, and Native-Americans, and echoed that China has similar challenges in achieving the Chinese dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tran |first=Guy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyUxgEg-kkk |title=Colin Powell / Patrick Mendis @ Aspen Institute |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author has served as a military professor and an American diplomat in the Clinton and Bush administrations. He is a commissioner of the US National Commission for [[UNESCO]] at the US Department of State — an appointment made by the Obama administration at the recommendation of US Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, and former Vice President Walter Mondale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimball |first=Joe|url=http://www.minnpost.com/political-agenda/2012/07/patrick-mendis-named-us-national-commission-unesco |title=Patrick Mendis Named to US National Commission for UNESCO | publisher=Minnesota Post |date=2012-07-19 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise by Chinese and American leaders==
Colonel [[Lawrence Wilkerson]], former chief of staff to Secretary Colin Powell, writes about the book: "A dazzling analysis, full of history, philosophy, ironic similarities and unusual distinctions, fears and hopes, but mostly dreams—the kind of dreams Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela dreamed. For that reason and more, ''Peaceful War'' is worth reading."

United States Senator [[Thomas Daschle]], former senate majority leader, explains that the book “luminously situated President Obama’s Asia pivot that is often lost in geopolitical writing.”

Former acting CIA Director [[John E. McLaughlin]] states that “No international strategic relationship is more important or more consequential than that between the United States and China—now and as far as we can reasonably see into the future. . . .

China’s leading authority on Sino-American relations Professor Shen Dingli at [[Fudan University]] in Shanghai calls the book a “landmark work” while Dr. Wei Hongxia at the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] in Beijing describes it as a “wise, welcome, and timely” exploration comparing Chinese and American national discourses and the future of their relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780761861867 |title=Peaceful War: How the Chinese Dream and the American Destiny Create a New Pacific World Order|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|date=2013-10-06 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petter Sørlle''' (February 16, 1884 - May 29, 1933) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[whaling]] captain and inventor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://nbl.snl.no/Petter_S%C3%B8rlle
|title =  Petter Sørlle |publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon |author= Bjørn L. Basberg|accessdate= December 15, 2016  
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
Petter Martin Mattias Koch Sørlle was born at Tune (now [[Sarpsborg]]) in  [[Østfold]], Norway. Both his father and grand-father had been sailors. He was engaged in whaling from [[Vestfold]]  and later participated in [[Antarctica]]  whaling  near the [[South Georgia Island]] and [[South Orkney Islands]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://carl.npolar.no/personer/Sorlle%2C%20Petter|title =  Petter Sørlle |publisher =  polarhistorie.no
|accessdate= December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He invented slipways for [[whaler|whaling ship]]s which he [[patent]]ed in 1922. His invention was a device by which the whale could be fully drawn to the ship. The pickup slip was first used in the [[Antarctic Ocean]] by the whaling company  Globus of [[Larvik]]  on-board the ''FLK Lancing'' during the season 1925-26.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.lardex.net/larvikmelsom/skipstekst/1924lancing2.htm |title=  1925 DS/FLK Lancing  |publisher= lardex.net  |accessdate= January  1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sørlle was the first manager of the United Whalers whaling shore station at [[Stromness, South Georgia]]. He carried out surveys  and is commemorated by several place names in [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gov.gs/heritage-2/whaling-stations/

A '''remittance''' is a [[Wire transfer|transfer of money]] by a [[Migrant worker|foreign worker]] to an individual in their home country. Money sent home by migrants competes with [[international aid]] as one of the largest financial inflows to [[developing country|developing countries]]. Workers' remittances are a significant part of international [[Capital (economics)|capital flows]], especially with regard to labour-exporting countries.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Assaf, Ghazi and Al-Malki, Abdullah M., (2014), Modelling the Macroeconomic Determinants of Workers’ Remittances: The Case of Jordan, International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, Vol. 4, issue 3, p. 514-526.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, $436 billion went to developing countries, setting a new record.

==Global extent==
Remittances are playing an increasingly large role in the economies of many countries. They contribute to economic growth and to the livelihoods of those countries.

International remittances have a major impact on the [[Developing country|developing economies]] of the world with the majority of remittances, $441 billion in 2015, going to developing nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This amount is nearly triple the $131 billion of global [[Official development assistance|Official Development Assistance]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/understanding-importance-remittances|title=Understanding the Importance of Remittances|date=2004-10-01|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many developing nations, remittances received make up a significant portion of their economies often receiving over 10% of their [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in remittances each year.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some countries, such as [[Tajikistan]], receive over half of their national GDP in remittances.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Note: The countries mentioned below are the largest 15 recipient countries of remittances ''only'' for the year 2013. World Bank data is used for all countries and years.

As a share of GDP, the top recipients of remittances in 2013 were [[Timor-Leste]] (16.6%), [[Tajikistan]] (42.1%), [[Kyrgyzstan]] (31.5%), [[Nepal]] (28.8%), [[Moldova]] (24.9%), [[Lesotho]] (24.4%), [[Samoa]] (23.8%), [[Haiti]] (21.1%), [[Armenia]] (21.0%), [[The Gambia]] (19.8%), [[Liberia]] (18.5%), [[Lebanon]] (17.0%), [[Honduras]] (16.9%), [[El Salvador]] (16.4%), [[Kosovo]] (16.1%), [[Jamaica]] (15.0%) and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (8.82%, which is 1.540 billion $ for 2017 on 31 December 2017 conversion rate between € and US$).&lt;ref name="Remittances Data World Bank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bosnia and Herzegovina remittance in 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indikator.ba/Vijest.aspx?p=1&amp;id=19709&amp;naslov=Doznake+iz+inostranstva+pro%C5%A1le+godine+2%2c51+mlrd+KM|title=Doznake iz inostranstva prošle godine 2,51 mlrd KM|work=Indikator.ba|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By region==
The US has been the leading source of remittances globally in every year since 1983. [[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Switzerland]] have been the next largest senders of remittances since 2007.&lt;ref name="Remittances Data World Bank"/&gt;

===Asia===
A majority of the remittances have been directed to Asian countries like [[India]] (approx. 62.7 billion USD in 2016), [[China]] (approx. 61.0 billion USD in 2016), the [[Philippines]] (approx. 29.9 billion USD in 2016), [[Pakistan]] (19.8 billion USD in 2016) and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 5 remittance-receiving countries for 2016|url=http://blog.transfermate.com/top-5-remittance-receiving-countries-2016/|website=TransferMate Blog|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the remittances happen by the conventional channel of agents, like [[Western Union]], [[Ria Money Transfer]], [[MoneyGram]], [[UAE Exchange]], and similar. However, with the increasing relevance and reach of the Internet, online and [[Mobile payment|mobile phone money transfers]] have grown significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIGRATION AND REMITTANCES 2016|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/992371492706371662/MigrationandDevelopmentBrief27.pdf|website=worldbank.org|ref=MIGRATION AND REMITTANCES 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{main|Remittances to India}}
Remittances to India are money transfers from non-resident Indians (NRIs) employed outside the country to family, friends or relatives residing in India. India is the world's leading receiver of remittances, claiming more than 12% of the world's remittances in 2015.
Remittances to India stood at US$68.91 billion in 2015, accounting for over 4% of the country's GDP.

====Jordan====
The flow of remittances to Jordan experienced rapid growth during the 1970s and 1980s when Jordan started exporting skilled labour to the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]]. These remittances represent an important source of funding for many developing countries, including Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Assaf, G. (2012), Workers' Remittances in Jordan, LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank data on remittances, with about 3 billion USD in 2010 Jordan ranked at 10th place among all developing countries. Jordan ranked among the top 20 recipients of remittances for the preceding decade. In addition, the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) statistics in 2010 indicate that Jordan was the third biggest recipient of remittances among Arab countries after Egypt and Lebanon. The host countries that have absorbed most of the Jordanian expatriates are Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where the available data indicate that about 90% of Jordanian migrants are working in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Assaf, G. and Al-Malki, A., (2014), Modelling the Macroeconomic Determinants of Workers’ Remittances: The Case of Jordan, International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, Vol. 4, issue 3, p. 514-526.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
[[Image:M Lhuillier Shop.jpg|thumb|A common shop for remittance in [[Angeles City]], [[Philippines]].]]
According to a [[World Bank]] Study,&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1110315015165/MigrationAndDevelopmentBrief13.pdf World Bank - Migration and Development Brief 13]&lt;/ref&gt; the Philippines is the second largest recipient for remittances in Asia. It was estimated in 1994 that migrants sent over US$2.6 billion back to the Philippines through formal banking systems. With the addition of money sent through private finance companies and return migrants, the 1994 total was closer to US$6 billion annually.&lt;ref name="Pratt 40"&gt;{{cite book|title=Working Feminism|last=Pratt|first=Geraldine|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total is estimated to have grown by 7.8 per cent annually to reach US$21.3 billion in 2010. Remittances are a reliable source of revenue for the Philippines, accounting for 8.9 per cent of the country's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang |last2=Yeoh |last3=Rahman|title=Asian Women as Transnational Domestic Workers|pages=21–53|edition=Maruja|chapter=Caring for the World: Filipino Domestic Workers Gone Global|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estrada administration in 2000 declared it "The Year of Overseas Filipino Worker in the Recognition of the Determination and Supreme Self-Sacrifice of Overseas Filipino Workers." This declaration connects monetary remittances of overseas workers as the top foreign-exchange earnings in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Pratt 40"/&gt;

===Latin America and the Caribbean===
In [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], remittances play an important role in the economy of the region, totaling over 66.5 billion USD in 2007, with about 75% originating in the United States. This total represents more than the sum of [[Foreign direct investment]] and official [[development aid]] combined. In seven Latin American and Caribbean countries, remittances even account for more than 10% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and exceed the dollar flows of the largest export product in almost every country in the region.&lt;ref name=iadb/&gt;

Percentages ranged from 2% in [[Mexico]], to 18% in [[El Salvador]], 21% in [[Honduras]], and up to 30% in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-07-09-mexico_N.htm |title=With USA in a recession, rural Mexico feels the pain |work=USA Today |accessdate=October 12, 2009 |first=Chris |last=Hawley |date=July 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter American Development Bank's Multilateral Investment Fund (IDB-MIF) has been the leading agency on regional remittance research.&lt;ref name=iadb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/mif/remittances|title=IADB.org - Page not found (HTTP 404)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico received remittance inflows of almost US$24 billion in 2007, 95% of which originated in the US.

=== North America ===

==== United States ====
{{Main|Remittances from the United States}}
A 2004 study found that over 60% of the 16.5 million Latin American-born adults who resided in the United States at the time of the survey regularly sent money home. The remittances sent by these 10 million immigrants were transmitted via more than 100 million individual transactions per year and amounted to an estimated $30 billion during 2004. Each transaction averaged about $150–$250, and, because these migrants tended to send smaller amounts more frequently than others, their remittances had a higher percentage of costs due to transfer fees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;E. Carrasco &amp; J. Ro (2007). "[http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/contents/part4-II.shtml Remittances and Development]" (ebook). University of Iowa Center for International Finance and Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrants sent approximately 10% of their household incomes; these remittances made up a corresponding 50–80% of the household incomes for the recipients. Significant amounts of remittances were sent from 37 U.S. states, but six states were identified as the "traditional sending" states: New York (which led the group with 81% of its immigrants making regular remittances), California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey. The high growth rate of remittances to Mexico (not the total amount) is unlikely to continue. In fact, according to the Mexican central bank, remittances grew just 0.6 during the first six months of 2007, as compared to 23% during the same period in 2006. Experts attribute the slowdown to a contraction in the U.S. construction industry, tighter border controls, and a crackdown in the U.S. on illegal immigration.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;

Remittance culture in the United States has contributed to the formation of "micro-geographies", tightly knit networks that integrate U.S. communities with communities throughout Latin America, such as migrants from [[Oaxaca]], Mexico, who have settled in [[Venice Beach, California]]. Oaxacans not only send money back to their communities, but they also travel back and forth extensively.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;

As of recently, remittances from the United States to [[Latin America]] have been on the decline. While there were USD 69.2 billion worth of remittances sent in 2008, that figure has fallen to $58.9 billion for 2011. This trend is a result of many factors including the [[global recession]], more economic opportunity in Latin American countries, and rising fees charged by [[Coyote (smuggler)|coyotes]] to smuggle immigrants across the border.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohaforum.org/2011/08/04/one-way-ticket-or-circular-flow-changing-stream-of-remittances-to-latin-america/index.html|title=One-way Ticket or Circular Flow: Changing Stream of Remittances to Latin America|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern of migration has changed from a circular flow, in which immigrants work in the United States for a few years before returning to their families in their home countries, to a one-way stream whereby migrants find themselves stuck in the United States. As a result, the new wave of migrants are both less likely to leave and more likely to stay in the United States for longer periods of time. Overall, this trend has contributed to falling levels of remittances sent to Latin American countries from the United States.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"/&gt;

===Africa===
Remittances to Africa play an important role to national economies. However, little data exists as many rely on informal channels to send money home. Immigrants from Africa today number approximately 20 to 30 million adults, who send around $40 billion USD annually to their families and local communities back home. For the region as a whole, this represents 50 percent more than net official development assistance (ODA) from all sources, and, for most countries, the amount also exceeds foreign direct investment (FDI). In several fragile states, remittances are estimated to exceed 50 percent of GDP.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1b&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mfw4a.org/remittances/remittances.html |title= Remittances |publisher= |accessdate= 16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most African countries restrict the payment of remittances to banks, which in turn, typically enter into exclusive arrangements with large money transfer companies, like Western Union or Money Gram, to operate on their behalf. This results in limited competition and limited access for consumers, which allows these [[Money Transfer Operators]] (MTOs) to charge the highest fees for remittances in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/18/global-remittance-industry-choking-billions-developing-world|title=Global remittance industry choking billions out of developing world|last=Anderson|first=Mark|date=2014-08-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a number of new players aiming to disrupt this established MTO model, such as Xoom and Willstream, which leverage increasing mobile phone penetration in the region and provide different rate structures to Diaspora customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/digital-first-startups-are-challenging-legacy-remittance-firms-2015-8/|title=THE DIGITAL REMITTANCE REPORT: The new platforms disrupting a $600 billion industry|website=Business Insider France|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unctad.org/meetings/en/Presentation/dtl_ict4d2014_MobileRemittance_p3_en.pdf|title=International Remittances through Branchless Banking|last=|first=|date=|website=UN Conference on Trade and Development|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a World Bank study,&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt; Nigeria is by far the top remittance recipient in [[Africa]], accounting for $10 billion in 2010, a slight increase over the previous year ($9.6 billion). Other top recipients include Sudan ($3.2 billion), [[Kenya]] ($1.8 billion), [[Senegal]] ($1.2 billion), [[South Africa]] ($1.0 billion), [[Uganda]] ($0.8 billion), [[Lesotho]] ($0.5 billion), [[Ethiopia]] ($387 million), [[Mali]] ($385 million), and [[Togo]] ($302 million). As a share of Gross Domestic Product, the top recipients in 2009 were: [[Lesotho]] (25%), Togo (10%), [[Cape Verde]] (9%), [[Guinea-Bissau]] (9%), Senegal (9%), [[Gambia]] (8%), [[Liberia]] (6%), [[Sudan]] (6%), [[Nigeria]] (6%), and Kenya (5%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1c&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.monitor.co.ug/Business/Commodities/-/688610/1050294/-/bv3xln/-/index.html |title=Sub-Saharan Africa posts growth in remittances |publisher= |accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nigeria====
A major source of foreign-exchange earnings for Nigeria are remittances sent home by Nigerians living abroad.&lt;ref name="tribune.com.ng"&gt;[http://www.tribune.com.ng/business/tribune-business/item/15469-remittances-from-diaspora-nigerians-as-lubricant-for-the-economy/15469-remittances-from-diaspora-nigerians-as-lubricant-for-the-economy "Remittances from diaspora Nigerians as lubricant for the economy", ''[[Nigerian Tribune]]'', 8 September 2014.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317150032/http://www.tribune.com.ng/business/tribune-business/item/15469-remittances-from-diaspora-nigerians-as-lubricant-for-the-economy/15469-remittances-from-diaspora-nigerians-as-lubricant-for-the-economy |date=17 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 17.5 million Nigerians lived in foreign countries, with the UK and the USA having more than 2 million Nigerians each.&lt;ref name="tribune.com.ng"/&gt;

According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], Nigeria witnessed a dramatic increase in [[remittances]] sent home from overseas Nigerians, going from USD 2.3 billion in 2004 to 17.9 billion in 2007, representing 6.7% of GDP. In 2016, remittances reached a new record of $35 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201612210454.html|title=Nigeria: Diaspora Remittance Hits U.S.$35 Billion in 2016|last=Agabi|first=Chris|date=2016-12-21|work=Daily Trust (Abuja)|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States accounts for the largest portion of official remittances, followed by the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Spain and France. On the African continent, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Libya and South Africa are important source countries of remittance flows to Nigeria, while China is the biggest remittance-sending country in Asia.

An August 2016 [[Central Bank of Nigeria|Nigerian Central Bank]] (NCB) decision to suspend the operations of all MTOs in the country, except those of Western Union, MoneyGram and Rio,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2016/CCD/Beware%20of%20Unregistered%20IMTO%20doc%20final.pdf|title=Beware of Unregistered Money Transfer Operators|last=|first=|date=|website=Central Bank of Nigeria|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was met with a strong backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/03/africa/nigeria-money-transfer-restriction/index.html|title=Nigeria clamps down on money transfers|last=CNN|first=Jacopo Prisco and Heather Long|website=CNN|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued that the decision was not appropriately justified, while also standing in contrast to the NCB’s previous move to ban all exclusivity agreements with Western Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/worldremit-calls-urgent-restoration-money-transfers-nigeria-1573909|title=WorldRemit calls for urgent restoration of money transfers to Nigeria|last=Allison|first=Ian|date=2016-08-02|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was considered to disproportionally strengthen the dominant position of Western Union, MoneyGram and Rio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1022443/sudans-caine-prize-winner-wants-nigeria-egypt-and-south-africa-to-supports-the-arts-in-africa/|title=We need African countries to support our literature, says 2017’s Caine prize winner|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure, however, the Central Bank reversed the decision and granted new licenses to a number of competing MTOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/771382/nigerias-central-bank-is-backtracking-on-plans-to-ban-operators-disrupting-remittances/|title=Nigeria’s Central Bank is backtracking on plans to ban operators disrupting remittances|last=Kazeem|first=Yomi|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somalia====
Somali expatriates often send remittances to their relatives in [[Greater Somalia]] through [[Dahabshiil]] and other Somali-owned money transfer companies. In order to ensure that these funds go to their intended recipients rather than [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] and other militant groups, the governments of the United States, Australia, and a number of other Western countries tightened their banking requirements or stopped processing altogether the remittances.&lt;ref name="Eaprmiathsfsmh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellison and Paulsen Reintroduce Money Remittances Improvement Act To Help Somali Families Send Money Home|url=http://ellison.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ellison-and-paulsen-reintroduce-money-remittances-improvement-act-to|publisher=House Office of Keith Ellison|accessdate=18 April 2015|date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/westpac-to-stop-somali-money-transfers-on-march-31/story-fngnvlxu-1227281376048  |title=Westpac to stop Somali money transfers on March 31 |author=Armitage, Laura|date=30 March 2015|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address the concerns, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Money Remittances Improvement Act of 2014]].&lt;ref name="Eaprmiathsfsmh"/&gt;

In April 2015, the [[Cabinet of Somalia|Federal Cabinet of Somalia]] also officially launched the Special Task Force on Remittances (STFR). The multi-agency initiative is mandated with facilitating the [[Federal Government of Somalia]]'s new national policy pertaining to the money transfer industry. Its main priority is centered on establishing a comprehensive strategy and a consultative implementation plan for the formalization of the local financial sector. Additionally, the STFR is tasked with helping to foster a business environment and financial infrastructure conducive to growth. It is also empowered to coordinate and speed up the endorsement of financial governance instruments and transparency associated legislation, such as the laws on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT). In accordance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s recommendations, the STFR is in turn slated to oversee the Somali federal government's campaign to ratify various international treaties. The Task Forces' membership is scheduled to be announced shortly, and will be drawn from government institutions, the remittance industry, banks and other key private sector stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Gsgestfor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somali Government Establishes Special Task Force on Remittances|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=12668|accessdate=18 April 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Overview===
Remittances are not a new phenomenon in the world, being a normal concomitant to migration which has always been a part of human history. Several European countries, for example [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and [[Ireland]] were heavily dependent on remittances received from their emigrants during the 19th and 20th centuries. In the case of Spain, remittances amounted to the 21% of all of its current account income in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Remesas.org, [http://remesas.org/files/WP4_invenci_n_codesarrollo_ST.pdf/ Emigrantes construyendo escuelas: La primera política oficial de codesarrollo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404184045/http://www.remesas.org/files/WP4_invenci_n_codesarrollo_ST.pdf |date=2016-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
All of those countries created policies on remittances developed after significant research efforts in the field. For instance, Italy was the first country in the world to enact a law to protect remittances in 1901&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://remesas.org/files/La_primera_Ley_de_Remesas.pdf |format=PDF|title=La primera Ley de remesas de la historia|website=remesas.org|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spain was the first country to sign an international treaty (with Argentina in 1960) to lower the cost of the remittances received.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Since 2000, remittances have increased sharply worldwide, having almost tripled to $529 billion in 2012. In 2012, migrants from India and China alone sent more than $130 billion to their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=tageswoche.ch|url=http://www.tageswoche.ch/+besxb|title=The incredicle rise of migrants' remittances}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the [[G8]] [[30th G8 summit|met at the Sea Island Summit]] and decided to take action to lower the costs for migrant workers who send money back to their friends and families in their country of origin. In light of this, various G8 government developmental organizations, such as the [[UK government]]'s [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) and USAID began to look into ways in which the cost of remitting money could be lowered.

In September 2008, the World Bank established the first international database of remittance prices. The Remittance Prices Worldwide Database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org|title=Remittance Prices Worldwide - MAKING MARKETS MORE TRANSPARENT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides data on sending and receiving remittances for over 200 "country corridors" worldwide. The "corridors" examined include remittance flows from 32 major sending countries to 89 receiving countries, which account for more than 60% of total remittances to developing countries.&lt;ref name="go.worldbank.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.worldbank.org/316JULD1Z0|title=Payment Systems &amp; Remittances|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting publication of the Remittance Prices Worldwide Database serves four major purposes: benchmarking improvements, allowing comparisons across countries, supporting consumers’ choices, and putting pressure on service providers to improve their services.&lt;ref name="go.worldbank.org2"/&gt;

At the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 summit]] in [[L'Aquila]], [[Italy]], G8 heads of government and states endorsed the objective of reducing the cost of remittance services by five percentage points in five years. To drive down costs, the World Bank has begun certifying regional and national databases that use a consistent methodology to compare the cost of sending remittances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/National-Databases National and Regional Databases Certified by the World Bank] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723110502/http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/National-Databases |date=2012-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[G20]] [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit|2011 Summit]] in [[Cannes]], [[Bill Gates]] stated that, "If the transaction costs on remittances worldwide were cut from where they are today at around 10% to an average of 5%…it would unlock $15bn a year in poor countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Policy/G20-Report|title=G20 Report|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920221048/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Policy/G20-Report|archivedate=2014-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of low-cost online services such as [[Azimo]] have emerged with the objective of lowering the cost of money transfers to developing and emerging economies.

== Dynamics ==
===Emergencies===
During disasters or emergencies, remittances can be a vital source of income for people whose other forms of livelihood may have been destroyed by conflict or natural disaster. According to the [[Overseas Development Institute]], this is being increasingly recognized as important by aid actors who are considering better ways of supporting people in emergency responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/hpg/remittances.html|title=Remittances during crises: implication for humanitarian response|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refugees and other displaced populations also often remit to family members left behind in conflict areas.&lt;ref name="vargas2018"&gt;{{cite journal|authors= Vargas-Silva, C.|year=2018 |title=Remittances Sent To and From the Forcibly Displaced | journal = The Journal of Development Studies | volume=53|pages=1835-1848 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2016.1234040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential security concerns ===
The recent internationally coordinated effort to stifle possible sources of money laundering and/or [[terrorist financing]] has increased the cost of sending remittances, directly increasing costs to the companies facilitating the sending, and indirectly increasing the costs to the person remitting. As in some corridors a sizable amount of remittances is sent through informal channels (family connections, traveling friends, local money lenders, etc.). According to the World Bank,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/migration-and-remittances|title=Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; some countries do not report remittances data.

Moreover, when data is available, the methodologies used by countries for remittance data compilation are not publicly available. A 2010 world survey of central banks found significant differences in the quality of remittance data collection across countries: some central banks only used remittances data reported from commercial banks, neglecting to account for remittance flows via money transfer operators and post offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Irving, Mohapatra, Ratha|title=Migrant Remittance Flows: Findings from a Global Survey of Central Banks|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/29647167/Migrant-Remittance-Flows-Findings-from-a-Global-Survey-of-Central-Banks|work=World Bank Working Paper No.194|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remittances can be difficult to track and potentially sensitive to money laundering (AML) and terror financing (CTF) concerns. Since [[9/11]] many governments and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have taken steps to address [[informal value transfer system]]s. This is done through nations' [[Financial Intelligence Unit]]s (FIUs). The principle legislative initiatives in this area are the [[USA PATRIOT Act, Title III]] in the United States and, in the EU, through a series of EU Money Laundering Directives.  Though no serious terror risk should be associated with migrants sending money to their families, misuse of the financial system remains a serious government concern.

=== Economic benefits for developing countries ===
The extent to which remittances produce benefits for developing countries is contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Haas|first=Hein|date=2012-06-01|title=The Migration and Development Pendulum: A Critical View on Research and Policy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2012.00755.x/abstract|journal=International Migration|language=en|volume=50|issue=3|pages=8–25|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2435.2012.00755.x|issn=1468-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Bank economists contend that remittance receivers' higher propensity to own a bank account means that remittances can promote access to financial services for the sender and recipient, claimed to be an essential aspect of leveraging remittances to promote economic development.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org" /&gt; Meanwhile, critical migration scholars have expressed concern about the ability of remittances to address the structural causes of economic underdevelopment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wise|first=Wise|last2=Covarrubias|first2=Humberto Márquez|date=2009-12-01|title=Understanding the Relationship between Migration and Development: Toward a New Theoretical Approach|url=http://berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/social-analysis/53/3/sa530305.xml|journal=Social Analysis|language=en-US|volume=53|issue=3|doi=10.3167/sa.2009.530305|issn=1558-5727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abreu|first=Alexandre|date=2012-04-01|title=The New Economics of Labor Migration: Beware of Neoclassicals Bearing Gifts|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12143-010-9077-2|journal=Forum for Social Economics|volume=41|issue=1|pages=46–67|doi=10.1007/s12143-010-9077-2|issn=0736-0932}}&lt;/ref&gt; and see an increasing policy emphasis on finance as symptomatic of a paradigmatic shift towards a 'self-help development' that burdens the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rankin|first=Katharine N.|date=2001-01-01|title=Governing development: neoliberalism, microcredit, and rational economic woman|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03085140020019070|journal=Economy and Society|volume=30|issue=1|pages=18–37|doi=10.1080/03085140020019070|issn=0308-5147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remittances are generally thought to be [[Procyclical and countercyclical|counter-cyclical]]. The stability of remittance flows amidst financial crises and economic downturns make them a reliable source of foreign exchange earnings for developing countries.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt; As migrant remittances are sent cumulatively over the years and not only by new migrants, remittances are able to be persistent over time. This is particularly true of remittances sent by [[circular migration|circular migrants]], migrant workers who move back and forth between their home and host countries in a temporary and repetitive manner. At the state level, countries with diversified migration destinations are likely to have more sustainable remittance flows.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;

From a macroeconomic perspective, there is no conclusive relationship between remittances and GDP growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barajas|first=Adolfo|last2=Chami|first2=Ralph|last3=Fullenkamp|first3=Connel|last4=Montiel|first4=Peter|date=2009|title=Do Workers' Remittances Promote Economic Growth?|url=|journal=IMF Working Paper Series|publisher=IMF|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While remittances can boost aggregate demand and thereby spur economic activity, other research indicates that remittances may also have adverse macroeconomic impacts by increasing income inequality and reducing labour supply among recipient countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2010/wp1007.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, ''Do Remittances Boost Economic Development? Evidence From Mexican States'', October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] have developed international standards for remittance services.&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/paymentsystems|title=Payment Systems &amp; Remittances|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scandinavian Weekend Radio''' ('''SWR''') is a [[shortwave]] and [[medium wave]] radio station in [[Virrat]], [[Finland]], established in 2000. It broadcasts for 24 hours on the first Saturday of every month and on Christmas Day. It is the only shortwave and medium wave radio station in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rakkaus radioon sai perustamaan oman aseman | url=http://lotta.yle.fi/rswebtre.nsf/sivut/paivanjuttu?opendocument&amp;pageid=Content104152FC76F | work= | publisher=[[YLE]] | date=2009-03-06 | accessdate=2009-04-04 | language=Finnish}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The station is run by volunteers of which many are [[amateur radio operator]]s, [[DXing|DXers]] and former [[pirate radio]] operators.&lt;ref name="frcf"/&gt; Funding comes from membership fees of the voluntary association and PR product sales. Even though SWR is a commercial station, there are just a few advertisers.&lt;ref name="frcf"/&gt;

'''''Stone, Time, Touch''''' is a 2007 documentary made by [[Gariné Torossian]] about the relationship of three Armenian women from the diaspora with the land of [[Armenia]]. The young woman (played by Kamee Abrahamian) is visiting Armenia for the first time. The older woman, [[Arsinée Khanjian]] has a more conflicted and analytical perspective of her identity and her relationship with the fledgling democracy, one of the former Soviet Union republics. She has been to landlocked Armenia many times and comments on photos taken by French photographer Marc Baguelin. The third trajectory is more subtle and is represented by [[Gariné Torossian]] herself, whose face is super imposed from time to time in this stylistically-layered documentary.

== Awards ==
''Stone, Time, Touch'' has been awarded the prize for "Best Creative Documentary" at the 23rd [[Warsaw Film Festival]] (Warsaw, Poland).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39012">[[File:Antarctica, territorial claims including Brazil.svg|thumb|Map of territorial claims in Antarctica, including [[Marie Byrd Land]] which is unclaimed|330x330px]]

Seven sovereign states maintain a [[land claim|territorial claim]] on eight territories in [[Antarctica]]. These countries have tended to place their Antarctic scientific observation and study facilities within their respective claimed territories. A number of such facilities are located nowhere near their country's sector, however. Many nations such as Russia and the US have no claim anywhere in Antarctica, yet have large research facilities within the sectors of foreign countries.

==History==
===Spanish claims===
According to Argentina and Chile, the [[Spanish Empire]] had claims on Antarctica. The ''capitulación'' (governorship) granted to the conquistador [[Pedro Sánchez de la Hoz]] explicitly included all lands south of the [[Strait of Magellan|Straits of Magellan]] ([[Terra Australis]], and [[Tierra del Fuego]] and by extension the entire continent of Antarctica). This grant established, according to Argentina and Chile, that an ''[[Acquisition of sovereignty|animus occupandi]]'' existed on the part of Spain in Antarctica. Spain's sovereignty claim over parts of Antarctica was, according to Chile and Argentina, internationally recognized with the ''[[Inter caetera]]'' bull of 1493 and the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] of 1494. Argentina and Chile treat these treaties as legal international treaties mediated by the Catholic Church that was at that time a recognized arbiter in such matters.&lt;ref name=Prieto2004/&gt; Each country currently has claim a sector of the Antarctic continent that is more or less directly south of its national antarctic-facing lands.

===British claims===
[[File:Leo Amery 1917.jpg|thumb|As [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Leopold Amery]] aimed to assert British sovereignty over the entire continent of Antarctica.]]

The United Kingdom reasserted sovereignty over the [[Falkland Islands]] in the far [[South Atlantic]] in 1833 and maintained a continuous presence there. In 1908, the British government extended its territorial claim by declaring sovereignty over "[[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], the [[South Orkneys]], the [[South Shetlands]], and the [[South Sandwich Islands|(South) Sandwich Islands]], and [[Graham Land|Graham's Land]], situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and on the Antarctic continent to the south of the [[50th parallel south|50th parallel of south latitude]], and lying between the [[20th meridian west|20th]] and the [[80th meridian west|80th degrees of west longitude]]".&lt;ref name="IntLaw"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cIFAZPBKKuwC&amp;pg=PA652 ''International law for Antarctica'', p. 652], Francesco Francioni and Tullio Scovazzi, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; All these territories were administered as [[Falkland Islands Dependencies]] from [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] by the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]]. The motivation for this declaration lay in the need to regulate and tax the [[whaling|whaling industry]] effectively. Commercial operators would hunt whales in areas outside the official boundaries of the [[Falkland Islands]] and its dependencies, and there was a need to close this loophole.

In 1917, the wording of the claim was modified, so as to unambiguously include all the territory in the sector stretching to the [[South Pole]] (thus encompassing all the present British Antarctic Territory). The new claim covered "all islands and territories whatsoever between the 20th degree of west longitude and the [[50th meridian west|50th degree of west longitude]] which are situated south of the 50th parallel of south latitude; and all islands and territories whatsoever between the 50th degree of west longitude and the 80th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the [[58th parallel south|58th parallel of south latitude]]".&lt;ref name="IntLaw"/&gt;

It was the ambition of [[Leopold Amery]], then [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]], that Britain incorporate the entire continent into the [[British Empire|Empire]]. In a memorandum to the governors-general for [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], he wrote that 'with the exception of Chile and Argentina and some barren islands belonging to France... it is desirable that the whole of the Antarctic should ultimately be included in the British Empire.' The first step was taken on 30 July 1923, when the British government passed an [[Order in Council]] under the British Settlements Act 1887, defining the new borders for the [[Ross Dependency]]—"that part of His Majesty's Dominions in the Antarctic Seas, which comprises all the islands and territories between the 160th degree of East Longitude and the 150th degree of West Longitude which are situated south of the 60th degree of South Latitude shall be named the Ross Dependency." The Order in Council then went on to appoint the Governor-General and [[Commander-in Chief]] of [[New Zealand]] as the Governor of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/imperial/1923/0974/latest/DLM1195.html Order in Council Under the British Settlements Act, 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict c 54), Providing for the Government of the Ross Dependency.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the [[United Kingdom]] claimed [[Enderby Land]]. In 1933, a British imperial order transferred territory south of [[60th parallel south|60° S]] and between [[meridian (geography)|meridians]] [[160th meridian east|160° E]] and [[45th meridian east|45° E]] to Australia as the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica and international law: a collection of inter-state and national documents, Volume 2. pp. 143. Author: W. M. Bush. Editor: Oceana Publications, 1982. {{ISBN|0-379-20321-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-379-20321-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite Legislation AU | Cth | act | C2004C00416 | Australian Antarctic Territory Acceptance Act 1933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the passing of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, the government of the [[United Kingdom]] relinquished all control over the government of [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. This however had no bearing on the obligations of the governors-general of both countries in their capacity as Governors of the Antarctic territories.

===Other European claims===
[[File:Atlas pittoresque pl 169.jpg|thumb|right|Discovery by [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] of [[Adélie Land]] in 1840. This served as a basis for the French claim to this region in 1924.]]
Meanwhile, alarmed by these unilateral declarations, the French government laid claim to a strip of the continent in 1924. The basis for their claim to [[Adélie Land]] depended on the discovery of the coastline in 1840 by the French explorer [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]], who named it after his wife, Adèle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= From Venus to Antarctica: The Life of Dumont D'Urville |last= Dunmore |first= John |year= 2007 |publisher= Exisle Publ. |location= Auckland |isbn= 9780908988716 |page= 209 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British eventually decided to recognize this claim, and the border between [[Adélie Land]] and the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] was fixed definitively in 1938.&lt;ref name= mawson&gt;{{cite web |title= A Brief History of Mawson |publisher = Australian Government - Australian Arctic Division |url = http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=7041 |accessdate = 2008-07-16| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080727085111/http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=7041 | archivedate= 27 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments also concerned Norwegian whaling interests, which wished to avoid British taxation of [[Whaling|whaling stations]] in the Antarctic and felt concerns that they would be commercially excluded from the continent. The whale-ship owner [[Lars Christensen]] financed several expeditions to the Antarctic with the view to claiming land for Norway and to establishing stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges.&lt;ref name=k52&gt;{{cite book|title= Norge i Antarktis|editor-last= Kyvik|editor-first= Helga |location= Oslo|publisher= Schibsted Forlag|year= 2008|isbn= 82-516-2589-0|page= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first expedition, led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad, landed on [[Peter I Island]] in 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. On 6 March 1931 a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian [[sovereignty]]&lt;ref name=k52 /&gt; and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lov om Bouvet-øya, Peter I's øy og Dronning Maud Land m.m.

This was in line with Norwegian claims in the [[Arctic]] and hence to avoid compromising Norway's position with regard to the former [[Soviet Union]] and present-day [[Russia]]. In the 2015 [https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meld.-st.-32-20142015/id2415997/ Meld. St. No. 32 (2014-2015) 'Norske interesser og politikk i Antarktis' (White Paper No. 32 on Norwegian Interests and Policy in the Antarctica)] the Foreign Ministry confirmed that while Norway rejected the sector method of delimiting claims it was not intended create a difference in interpretation of the Norwegian claim in Antarctica; White Paper No. 19 (1939) had stated that the purpose of the annexation was to annex 'land which is currently ''terra nullius'' and that only Norwegians have researched and mapped'.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1929 expedition led by [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]] and [[Finn Lützow-Holm]] named the continental landmass near the island as [[Queen Maud Land]] after the Norwegian queen [[Maud of Wales]].&lt;ref name=npi&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.npolar.no/no/antarktis/dronning-maud-land.html |publisher= [[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |accessdate= 10 May 2011 |language= Norwegian |title= Dronning Maud Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory was explored further during the ''Norvegia'' expedition of 1930–31.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.snl.no/Dronning_Maud_Land |work= [[Store norske leksikon]] |accessdate= 9 May 2011 |first= Tore |last= Gjeldsvik |title= Dronning Maud Land |language= Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations with the British government in 1938 resulted in setting the western border of Queen Maud Land at 20°W.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

On 14 January 1939, five days before the German arrival, Norway annexed Queen Maud Land&lt;ref name=npi/&gt; after a royal decree announced that the land bordering the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies]] in the west and the [[Australian Antarctic Territory| Australian Antarctic Dependency]] in the east was to be brought under Norwegian sovereignty.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; The primary aim of the annexation was to secure the Norwegian whaling industry's access to the region.&lt;ref name=npi/&gt;&lt;ref name=npo1&gt;{{cite web |title= Forutsetninger for Antarktistraktaten |url= http://www.polarhistorie.no/artikler/2009/Antarktistraktaten |work= Norsk Polarhistorie |accessdate= 15 May 2011 |language= Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 Norway and the United Kingdom agreed to limit Queen Maud Land to from 20°W to 45°E, and to incorporate the Bruce Coast and [[Coats Land]] into Norwegian territory.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

===South American involvement===
[[File:Omond House - Laurie Island.jpg|thumb|[[Orcadas Base|Omond House]] was built in 1904 by the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]] as the first permanent base in Antarctica. It was later sold to Argentina.]]

Upon independence in the early 19th century South American nations based their boundaries upon the ''[[uti possidetis iuris]]'' principle. This meant there was no land without a sovereign. Chile and Argentina applied this to Antarctica citing the ''[[Inter caetera]]'' bull of 1493 and the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] of 1494. Argentina and Chile treat these treaties as legal [[international law|international treaties]] mediated by the [[Catholic Church]] that was in that time a recognized arbiter in these matters.&lt;ref name=Prieto2004&gt;{{cite journal |last=Prieto Larrain |first=M. Cristina |date=2004 |title=El Tratado Antártico, vehículo de paz en un campo minado |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-23762004000100008 |journal=[[Revista Universum]] |publisher=[[University of Talca]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=138–147 |doi= |language=Spanish |access-date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This encroachment of foreign powers was a matter of immense disquiet to the nearby South American countries, [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]. Taking advantage of a European continent plunged into turmoil with the onset of the [[Second World War]], Chile's president, [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] declared the establishment of a [[Chilean Antarctic Territory]] in areas already claimed by Britain.

Argentina has a long history in the area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La Antártica Chilena |url= |language=Spanish |page=173 |author=Oscar Pinochet de la Barra |publisher=Andrés Bello |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 the Argentine government began a permanent occupation in one of the Antarctic islands with the purchase of a meteorological station on [[Laurie Island]] established in 1903 by Dr [[William Speirs Bruce|William S. Bruce]]'s [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]]. Bruce offered to transfer the station and instruments for the sum of 5.000 [[peso]]s, on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission.&lt;ref name=RREE&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucema.edu.ar/ceieg/arg-rree/7/7-107.htm | title=Historia General de las Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Argentina | accessdate=July 6, 2012 | author1=Escude, Carlos |author2=Cisneros, Andres |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; British officer William Haggard also sent a note to the Argentine Foreign Minister, [[José Terry]], ratifying the terms of Bruce proposition.&lt;ref name=RREE/&gt;

In 1906, Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on [[South Orkney Islands]], the [[Orcadas Base]]. However, Haggard responded by reminding Argentina that the [[South Orkneys]] were British. The British position was that Argentine personnel was granted permission only for the period of one year. The Argentine government entered into negotiations with the British in 1913 over the possible transfer of the island. Although these talks were unsuccessful, Argentina attempted to unilaterally establish their sovereignty with the erection of markers, national flags and other symbols.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_T7JZveHkAC|title=At the Ends of the Earth: A History of the Polar Regions|author=Kieran Mulvaney|year=2001|publisher=Island Press|pages=124-130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, with British attention elsewhere, Argentina declared the establishment of [[Argentine Antarctica]] in 1943, claiming territory in the continent itself, and not just islands, and it overlapped with British ( [[20th meridian west|20°W]] to [[80th meridian west|80°W]]) and the earlier Chilean ([[53rd meridian west|53°W]] to [[90th meridian west|90°W]]) claims.

In response to this and earlier German explorations, the British [[Admiralty]] and [[Colonial Office]] launched [[Operation Tabarin]] in 1943 to reassert British territorial claims against [[Argentinian]] and Chilean incursion and establish a permanent British presence in the [[Antarctic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/our_history/stations_and_refuges/index.php|title=About - British Antarctic Survey|website=www.antarctica.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was also motivated by concerns within the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] about the direction of United States post-war activity in the region.

A suitable cover story was the need to deny use of the area to the enemy. The ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' was known to use remote islands as rendezvous points and as shelters for commerce raiders, [[U-boat]]s and supply ships. Also, in 1941, there existed a fear that Japan might attempt to seize the [[Falkland Islands]], either as a base or to hand them over to Argentina, thus gaining political advantage for the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and denying their use to Britain.

In 1943, British personnel from [[HMS Carnarvon Castle|HMS ''Carnarvon Castle'']]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/pictures/catalogue/hmscc1943/ HMS Carnarvon Castle 1943]&lt;/ref&gt; removed Argentine flags from [[Deception Island]]. The expedition was led by Lieutenant [[James William Slessor Marr|James Marr]] and left the [[Falkland Islands]] in two ships, [[RRS William Scoresby|HMS ''William Scoresby'']] (a minesweeping trawler) and ''Fitzroy'', on Saturday January 29, 1944.

Bases were established during February near the abandoned [[Norway|Norwegian]] whaling station on [[Deception Island]], where the [[Union Flag]] was hoisted in place of Argentine flags, and at [[Port Lockroy]] (on February 11) on the coast of [[Graham Land]]. A further base was founded at [[Hope Bay]] on February 13, 1945, after a failed attempt to unload stores on February 7, 1944. Symbols of British sovereignty, including [[post office]]s, signposts and [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]]s were also constructed and [[postage stamp]]s were issued.

[[Operation Tabarin]] provoked Chile to organise its [[First Chilean Antarctic Expedition]] in 1947–48, where the Chilean president [[Gabriel González Videla]] personally inaugurated one of its bases.&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica and the Arctic: the complete encyclopedia, Volume 1, by David McGonigal, Lynn Woodworth, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the end of the war in 1945, the British bases were handed over to civilian members of the newly created [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] (subsequently the [[British Antarctic Survey]]) the first such national scientific body to be established in Antarctica.

===Postwar developments===
[[File:Swedish Antarctic Expedition Hope Bay.jpg|thumb|right|Hut built at [[Hope Bay]] in 1903. It was there that the only instance of shots fired in anger on the Continent occurred in 1952.]]
Friction between Britain and the [[Latin America]]n states continued into the postwar period. [[Royal Navy]] warships were dispatched in 1948 to prevent naval incursions. The only instance of shots fired in anger on Antarctica occurred in 1952 at [[Hope Bay]], when staff at British Base "D" (established 1945) came up against the Argentine team at [[Esperanza Base]] (est. 1952), who fired a machine gun over the heads of a [[British Antarctic Survey]] team unloading supplies from the ''John Biscoe''. The Argentines later extended a [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] apology, saying that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Argentine military commander on the ground had exceeded his authority.

The [[United States]] became politically interested in the Antarctic continent before and during WWII. The [[United States Antarctic Service Expedition]], from 1939-1941, was sponsored by the government with additional support from donations and gifts by private citizens, corporations and institutions. The objective of the Expedition, outlined by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], was to establish two bases: East Base, in the vicinity of [[Charcot Island]], and West Base, in the vicinity of [[Edward VII Peninsula|King Edward VII Land]]. After operating successfully for two years, but with international tensions on the rise, it was considered wise to evacuate the two bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bertrand | first=Kenneth J. | title=Americans in Antarctica 1775-1948 |year=1971 |publisher=American Geographical Society |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, immediately after the war, American interest was rekindled with an explicitly geopolitical motive. [[Operation Highjump]], from 1946-1947 was organised by [[Rear admiral (United_States)#Rear_admiral|Rear Admiral]] [[Richard E. Byrd]] Jr. and included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and multiple aircraft. The primary mission of Operation Highjump was to establish the [[Antarctic]] research base [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]] IV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearns|first=David A.|title=Where Hell Freezes Over: A Story of Amazing Bravery and Survival|year=2005|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=0-312-34205-5|pages=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuMUEkB53zwC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-05-31|chapter=Operation Highjump: Task Force 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of training personnel and testing equipment in frigid conditions and amplifying existing stores of knowledge of [[Hydrography|hydrographic]], geographic, [[Geology|geological]], [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] propagation conditions in the area. The mission was also aimed at consolidating and extending United States sovereignty over the largest practicable area of the [[Antarctic]] continent, although this was publicly denied as a goal even before the expedition ended.

===Towards an international treaty===
[[Image:Igylogo.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[International Geophysical Year]] was pivotal in establishing a cooperative international framework in Antarctica, and led on to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] in 1959.]]
Meanwhile, in an attempt at ending the impasse, Britain submitted an application to the [[International Court of Justice]] in 1955 to adjudicate between the territorial claims of Britain, Argentina, and Chile. This proposal failed, as both Latin American countries rejected submitting to an international arbitration procedure.&lt;ref name="Dodds"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWPEnDQfJzsC|title=The Antarctic: A Very Short Introduction|author=Klaus Dodds|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations towards the establishment of an international condominium over the continent first began in 1948, involving the 8 claimant countries: Britain, Australia, New Zealand, U.S.A., France, Norway, Chile and Argentina. This attempt was aimed at excluding the [[Soviet Union]] from the affairs of the continent and rapidly fell apart when the USSR declared an interest in the region, refused to recognize any claims of sovereignty and reserved the right to make its own claims in 1950.&lt;ref name="Dodds"/&gt;

An important impetus toward the formation of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] in 1959 was the [[International Geophysical Year]], 1957-1958. This year of international scientific cooperation triggered an 18-month period of intense Antarctic science. More than 70 existing national scientific organisations then formed IGY committees, and participated in the cooperative effort. The British established [[Halley Research Station]] in 1956 by an expedition from the [[Royal Society]]. Sir [[Vivian Fuchs]] headed the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], which completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica in 1958. In Japan, the [[Japan Coast Guard|Japan Maritime Safety Agency]] offered [[ice breaker]] [[Sōya (icebreaker)|Sōya]] as the South Pole observation ship and [[Showa Station (Antarctica)|Showa Station]] was built as the first Japanese observation base on Antarctica.

France contributed with [[Dumont d'Urville Station]] and [[Adélie Land#Research stations|Charcot Station]] in [[Adélie Land]]. The ship ''Commandant Charcot'' of the [[French Navy]] spent nine months of 1949/50 at the coast of Adelie Land, performing [[Ionosphere|ionospheric]] soundings.&lt;ref&gt;M. Barré, K. Rawer: "Quelques résultats d’observations ionosphériques effectuées près de la Terre Adélie". ''Journal of Atmospheric and Terrestrial Physics'' volume 1, issue 5–6 (1951), pp. 311–314.&lt;/ref&gt; The US erected the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] as the first permanent structure directly over the South Pole in January 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/south-poles-first-building-blown-up-after-53-years|title=South Pole's first building blown up after 53 years|publisher=OurAmazingPlanet.com|date=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, to prevent the possibility of military conflict in the region, the United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and 9 other countries with significant interests negotiated and signed the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] in 1959. The treaty entered into force in 1961 and sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, and banned [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]]. The treaty was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/index_e.htm|title=ATS - Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty|website=www.ats.aq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antarctic territorial claims==
[[Image:Antarctica territorial claims.png|thumb|Territorial claims in Antarctica]]
Seven [[sovereign states]] had made eight [[land claim|territorial claims]] to land in Antarctica south of the [[60th parallel south|60° S]] parallel before 1961. These claims have been recognized only between the countries making claims in the area. All claim areas are sectors, with the exception of [[Peter I Island]]. None of these claims have an indigenous population. The [[South Orkney Islands]] fall within the territory claimed by Argentina and the United Kingdom, and the [[South Shetland Islands]] fall within the areas claimed by Argentina, Chile, and the United Kingdom. The UK, France, Australia, New Zealand and Norway all recognize each other's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rogan-Finnemore |first=Michelle |year=2005 |contribution = What Bioprospecting Means for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean |editor-last = Von Tigerstrom |editor-first = Barbara |title=International Law Issues in the South Pacific |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |pages=204 |isbn=0-7546-4419-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these claims overlap. Prior to 1962, British Antarctic Territory was a dependency of the [[Falkland Islands]] and also included [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. The Antarctic areas became a separate [[British overseas territory|overseas territory]] following the ratification of the Antarctic Treaty. South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands remained a dependency of the Falkland Islands until 1985 when they too became a separate overseas territory.

There has been speculation about possible future claims{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. The [[United States]] and [[Russia]] (as [[Succession of states|successor state]] of the [[Soviet Union]]) maintain they have reserved the right to make claims and there have also been speculations on [[Brazil]] making [[Brazilian Antarctica|a claim]] bounded by [[53rd meridian west|53° W]] and [[28th meridian west|28° W]],&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;The international politics of Antarctica.

[[Peru]] made a reservation of its territory rights under [[:es:Teoría_de_la_defrontación|the principle of Antarctic defrontation]] and influence on its climate, ecology and marine biology, adducing, in addition, geological continuity and historical links.&lt;ref&gt;La Antártida.

==Antarctic Treaty==
{{main|Antarctic Treaty System}}
The Antarctic Treaty and related agreements regulate [[international relations]] with respect to Antarctica, [[Earth]]'s only [[continent]] without a native human population. The treaty has now been signed by 48 countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, and the now-defunct [[Soviet Union]]. The treaty set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and banned [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]]. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The Soviet Union and the United States both filed reservations against the restriction on new claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/acda/treaties/arctic1.htm |title=The Antarctic Treaty |publisher=US Arms control and disarmament agency |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States and [[Russia]] assert their right to make claims in the future if they so choose. [[Brazil]] maintains the [[Comandante Ferraz Brazilian Antarctic Base|Comandante Ferraz]] (the Brazilian Antarctic Base) and has proposed a theory to delimiting territories using meridians, which would give it and other countries a claim. In general, territorial claims below the [[60th parallel south|60° S]] parallel have only been recognised among those countries making claims in the area. However, although claims are often indicated on maps of Antarctica, this does not signify ''de jure'' recognition.

All claim areas, except [[Peter I Island]], are [[Circular sector|sectors]], the borders of which are defined by degrees of [[longitude]]. In terms of [[latitude]], the northern border of all sectors is the 60° S parallel which does not cut through any piece of land, continent or island, and is also the northern limit of the Antarctic Treaty. The southern border of all sectors collapses in one point, the [[South Pole]]. Only the Norwegian sector is an exception: the original claim of 1930 did not specify a northern or a southern limit, so that its territory is only defined by eastern and western limits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;However, the Norwegian government has stated in 2003 that the northern extent of the Norwegian territory conforms to general practice by extending {{convert|12|nmi|km|0}} from the shore.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Antarctic Treaty states that contracting to the treaty:
* is not a renunciation of any previous territorial claim.
* does not affect the basis of claims made as a result of activities of the signatory nation within Antarctica.
* does not affect the rights of a State under [[customary international law]] to recognise (or refuse to recognise) any other territorial claim.

What the treaty does affect is ''new claims'':
* No activities occurring after 1961 can be the basis of a territorial claim.
* No new claim can be made.
* No claim can be enlarged.

'''USA-80''', also known as '''GPS IIA-4''', '''GPS II-13''' and '''GPS SVN-28''', was an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which formed part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the fourth of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-80 was launched at 03:20:00 UTC on 10 April 1992, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D208, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-80 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 1992, USA-80 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|19979|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20384|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.94 minutes, and 55.1 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had PRN 28, and operated in slot 2 of plane C of the GPS constellation. The satellite had a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}. It had a design life of 7.5 years;&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; however, it was retired early, on 15 August 1997. It was replaced by [[USA-117]].
