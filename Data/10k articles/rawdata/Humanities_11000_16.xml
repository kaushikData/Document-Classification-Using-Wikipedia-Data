Michels earned her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in Latin from [[Bryn Mawr College]], where she was also a member of the faculty from 1934 until 1975.&lt;ref name="College1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryn Mawr College|title=Bryn Mawr College Calendar: Graduate Courses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jDbAAAAMAAJ|year=1964|publisher=The College}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her retirement she frequently taught courses at [[Duke University]] as well as at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]].

She spent time in Rome as a Fellow of the [[American Academy in Rome|American Academy]] in the company of [[Lily Ross Taylor]]. Michels was [[List of Presidents of the American Philological Association|president of the American Philological Association]] for 1971-72.&lt;ref name="Association1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Philological Association|title=Directory of Members - American Philological Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MgdZAAAAMAAJ|year=1972|publisher=Scholars Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her career, Roman religion was the focus of her research. It led to her landmark book, still consulted by scholars as a work of authority, ''The Calendar of the Roman Republic'' (Princeton, 1967).&lt;ref name="Michels1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Agnes Kirsopp Michels|title=The Calendar of the Roman Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDYqAAAAYAAJ|date=1 January 1978|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-20226-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michels was married to physicist Walter Christian Michels (1906-1975).&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/annualreportsofp09bryn/annualreportsofp09bryn_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]].

{{nihongo|'''Akanbe'''|あかんべえ|Akanbee}}, also spelled {{nihongo|'''Akkanbee'''|あっかんべー, アッカンベー}}, is a Japanese facial gesture indicating sarcasm but also used as a [[taunt]]. It consists of someone pulling down one's lower [[eyelid]] to expose the red underside towards someone, often accompanied by the person sticking their tongue out. It is considered an immature taunting gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Akihiko Yonekawa. ''Beyond Polite Japanese''. Tokyo:[[Kodansha International]], 2001. Print, p. 133. https://books.google.com/books?id=MCDAP7wOOswC&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of the term was first mentioned by early 20th century author [[Katai Tayama]], in his 1909 story {{nihongo|''[[Inaka Kyōshi]]''|田舎教師||"Rural Teacher"}}, as a gesture used by the male students in the story. In the story, it gives the etymology as a corruption of {{nihongo|''akai me''|赤い目||"red eye"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gakuto.co.jp/hieigo/lesson01/007.html |title=Lesson 7 ボディ・ランゲージ Gestures |publisher=Gakko Tosho |year=2003 |accessdate=May 23, 2010

==Mon œil==
In [[France]], the gesture of pulling down one's lower eyelid and saying ''mon œil'', or "my eye", is an expression of disdainful, dismissive disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/monoeil.htm Mon œil!]&lt;br/&gt; The French expression mon œil ! is used to express either incredulous/ironic disbelief, like the English expressions "my foot!" or "yeah, right!", or an almost indignant refusal, as in "no way!" or "ain't gonna happen!"&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement "my eye" is also an archaic term of disbelief in English, though without the physical gesture. One may respond to an incredible claim of "That was an accident" with "Accident, my eye!".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordwizard.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?t=18295 Word Wizard: My eye! / My foot!]&lt;br/&gt;

The oldest part of the town lies on top of [[Jabal Arbi]] Mountains while the newer parts lie in the [[Wadi al-Taym]] valley and is referred to as Izza. Neighboring towns include [[Rafid]], [[Kamed]], [[Khirbet-Rouha]], and [[Mdouckha]]. The town is located about 80&amp;nbsp;km from Beirut and 40&amp;nbsp;km from Damascus, Syria. From Al-Bireh, [[Jabal -Al-Sheikh]] ([[Mount Hermon]]) can be seen with its majestic snow-capped peak.

==Economy==
[[File:Bireh 3.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Elkadri]] family ruins]]
More than 60% of the town’s population have emigrated to [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]]. Residents of the town have left to the US as early as the 18th Century and have aggregated in cities like [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. Many others emigrated to [[São Paulo]], Brazil; [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina; [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]] and [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada.

The economy of the town relies on agriculture which thrived on the water springs commonly found in Al-Bireh.  The town is known for growing [[olives]], [[almonds]], [[fruits]] and vegetables and a variety of crops.  However, the severe emigration has reduced the agriculture activities over the past three decades.

[[File:Bireh 5.jpg|thumb|250px|Agriculture thrives in the water rich mountains]]

six main families inhabit the town, namely the Elkadri, Jeha (جحا), Jumaa, Zeineddine, Abdallah, Salem and Omar families. Other families also live in the village, however increased emigration has completely dispersed some families and no members are currently residents.

==Notable residents==

Al-Bireh is the birthplace of multiple intellectuals, politicians and religious figures.  The late [[Nazim Elkadri]] (MP, minister and prime minister of Lebanon) was born in Al-Bireh.  The [[Mufti]] of [[Beqaa Governorate|Bekaa]], Sheikh [[Raouf Elkadri]] was also born in Al-Bireh.  [[Nassouh Elkadri]] (an anti French occupation revolutionary leader) was from Al-Bireh.

==History==
[[File:Bireh 4.jpg|thumb|250px|Mount [[Hermon]] or [[Alsheikh]] as seen from Al-Bireh]]
The mountain chain upon which Al-Bireh is located is rich with history.  Caves dating back to [[pre-historic]] times can be found all over the mountain.  Ruins of other more modern civilizations are still very visible.  The locals usually come across artifacts dating back to [[Phoenicia]]n, Byzantine, [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Canaan]]ite eras.  Many artifacts and archaeological pieces were illegally excavated out of the caves and burial grounds during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and the [[Israeli occupation]], however it is hoped that one day, area will be declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], thus protecting one of the most important areas of human cultural heritage on [[Earth]].

The town was occupied first by PLO forces in the late 1970s, then by Israeli forces in the early 1980s. Before Israel's invasion, the town suffered from Israeli warplane attacks. In one incident, several houses were bombed, killing and injuring scores of civilians {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.  Israel did not provide explanation as to why these were bombed.

==Archaeology==
A [[Heavy Neolithic]] archaeological site of the [[Qaraoun culture]] was discovered by [[Auguste Bergy]] along a south to west track that lead from the road to a small spring. Bergy originally suggested it was a ''"[[Chellean]] factory site"'' before the Heavy Neolithic was defined by [[Henri Fleisch]]. [[Lorraine Copeland]] agreed that it was probably a factory, noting several prepared flakes and a large [[Neolithic]] pick. The material is now held in the archives of the [[Saint Joseph University]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. Copeland|author2=P. Wescombe|title=Inventory of Stone-Age Sites in Lebanon: North, South and East-Central Lebanon, p. 26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhPRQwAACAAJ|accessdate=29 August 2011|year=1966|publisher=Impr. Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Al-Bireh was the site where the French/Lebanese movie Le Cerf-Volant (The Kite) (Tayyara min waraq) was filmed.

In January 2009 a street in town was named after president [[Hugo Chávez]], after Venezuela expelled an Israeli ambassador due [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict|IDF attack in Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terra.com.co/actualidad/articulo/html/acu17822-calle-hugo-chavez-en-libano-por-solidaridad-con-gaza.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Lebanese Parliamentary elections of June 2009, Ziad Nazem Elkadri, son of the late Nazim Elkadri, won his seat running with the Future Movement in the March 14 coalition list.  Ziad is the second MP to be elected from the village, the first being his father.

'''Androna''', also known as '''al-Andarin''' is a [[Byzantine]] site spread over a vast area at the edges of the semi-desert, about 25 kilometers beyond the more well-known Byzantine site of [[Qasr Ibn Wardan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=http://www.syriaphotoguide.com/home/al-andarin-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86/| title=al-Andarin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Androna was built as a defense line against nomadic skirmishes in the [[Syrian Desert]]. The fortified city contains many churches, palaces and baths;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/ANDS-byzantine.html| title=Androna, Syria – The Byzantine Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was famous for its vineyards and high-quality wine in which it was mentioned by [[Amr ibn Kulthum]] in his ode.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=http://www.english.globalarabnetwork.com/200908312467/Culture/al-andareen-a-gate-into-syrian-culture-art-and-archaeology.html| title=Al-Andareen – A gate into Syrian culture, art and archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The following is the opening verse of his ode:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|
{{lang|ar|rtl=yes|أَلاَ هُبِّي بِصَحْنِكِ فَاصْبَحِيْنَـا وَلاَ تُبْقِي خُمُـوْرَ الأَنْدَرِيْنَـا}}

Ha girl! Up with the bowl! Give us our dawn draught
And do not spare the wines of al-Andarina}}

==Syria Civil War==

During the Syria Civil War, ISIS captured this archaeological sites on 18 January 2018 from HTS and was captured by the [[Syrian army]] on 6 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=https://southfront.org/isis-captures-over-30-villages-from-hayat-tahrir-al-sham-in-northern-hama-and-southern-aleppo-map/| title=ISIS CAPTURES OVER 30 VILLAGES FROM HAY’AT TAHRIR AL-SHAM IN NORTHERN HAMA AND SOUTHERN ALEPPO (MAP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8555">[[Image:Apollo11Disck.png|thumb|The silicon disc with goodwill messages left on the Moon by Apollo 11 astronauts]]
The '''Apollo 11 goodwill messages''' are statements from leaders of 73 countries around the world on a disc about the size of a [[Half dollar (United States coin)|50-cent piece]] made of [[silicon]] that was left on the [[Moon]] by the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts.

The disc also carried names of the leadership of the [[United States Congress|Congress]], the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for legislation related to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), and NASA's top management, including past administrators and deputy administrators.

At the top of the disc is the inscription: "Goodwill messages from around the world brought to the Moon by the astronauts of Apollo 11." Around the rim is the statement: "From Planet Earth -- July 1969". The disc was manufactured by [[Sprague Electric]] Company of [[North Adams, Massachusetts]]. NASA head [[Thomas O. Paine]] proposed the idea to the U.S. State Department, and corresponded with world leaders to solicit their messages. These were enshrined by being photographed and reduced to 1/200 scale [[microform|ultra microfiche]] silicon etching. The disc rests in an aluminum case on the Moon's [[Sea of Tranquility]].&lt;ref name=69-83F&gt;{{cite web| title=Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages| url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap11-35ann/goodwill/Apollo_11_material.pdf| publisher=[[NASA]]| accessdate=30 June 2012| date=July 13, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Like Me''''', first published in [[1960 in literature|1961]], is a nonfiction book by [[White people|white]] journalist [[John Howard Griffin]] recounting his journey in the [[Deep South]] of the United States, at a time when [[African-Americans]] lived under [[Racial_segregation#United_States|racial segregation]]. Griffin was a native of [[Dallas, Texas]], who had his skin temporarily darkened to pass as a black man. He traveled for six weeks throughout the [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] states of [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to explore life from the other side of the [[color line (civil rights issue)|color line]]. ''[[Sepia (magazine)|Sepia Magazine]]'' financed the project in exchange for the right to print the account first as a series of articles.

Griffin kept a journal of his experiences; the 188-page diary was the genesis of the book. When he started his project in 1959, race relations in America were particularly strained. The title of the book is taken from the last line of the [[Langston Hughes]] poem "Dream Variations".

In 1964, a film version of ''[[Black Like Me (film)|Black Like Me]],'' starring [[James Whitmore]], was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Black Like Me (1964) James Whitmore Stars in Book's Adaptation|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|date=May 21, 1964|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0CE5DD1F3AE13ABC4951DFB366838F679EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generation later, Robert Bonazzi published a biographical book about Griffin, these events, and his life: ''Man in the Mirror: John Howard Griffin and the Story of Black Like Me'' (1997).

==Account of the trip==
In late 1959, John Howard Griffin went to a friend's house in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].  Once there, under the care of a dermatologist, Griffin underwent a regimen of large oral doses of the anti-[[vitiligo]] drug [[methoxsalen]], and spending up to fifteen hours daily under an ultraviolet lamp.&lt;ref name="snopes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/griffin.asp|title=Death of John Howard Griffin : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=18 October 2015|work=Snopes}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he could pass as an African American, Griffin began a six-week journey in the South. Don Rutledge traveled with him, documenting the experience with photos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanleyleary.com/blacklikeme/ "Black Like Me"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606064457/http://www.stanleyleary.com/blacklikeme/ |date=June 6, 2015 }}, Stanley Leary&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his trip, Griffin abided by the rule that he would not change his name or alter his identity; if asked who he was or what he was doing, he would tell the truth.&lt;ref&gt;"I decided not to change my name or identity. ... If asked who I was or what I was doing, I would answer truthfully." (page 4) ''Black Like Me'', Signet &amp; New American Library, a division of Penguin Group publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, he decided to talk as little as possible&lt;ref&gt;"I had made it a rule to talk as little as possible at first." (page 23)&lt;/ref&gt; to ease his transition into the social milieu of southern U.S. blacks. He became accustomed everywhere to the "hate stare" received from whites.

After he disguised himself, many people who knew Griffin as a white man did not recognize him. Sterling Williams, a black shoeshine man in the [[French Quarter]] whom Griffin regarded as a casual friend, did not recognize him. Because Griffin wanted assistance in entering into the black community, he decided to tell Sterling about his identity and project. He first hinted that he wore the same unusual shoes as somebody else,&lt;ref&gt;He looked up without a hint of recognition. ... He had shined them many times and I felt he should certainly recognize them.(page 26)&lt;/ref&gt; but Sterling still did not recognize him until Griffin told him.

In New Orleans, a black counterman at a small restaurant chatted with Griffin about the difficulties of finding a place to go to the bathroom, as facilities were segregated and blacks were prohibited from many. He turned a question about a Catholic church into a joke about "spending much of your time praying for a place to piss".

On a bus trip, Griffin began to give his seat to a white woman, but disapproving looks from black passengers stopped him. He thought he had a momentary breakthrough with the woman, but she insulted him and began talking with other white passengers about how impudent the blacks were becoming.

==Reaction==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
After his book was published, Griffin received many letters of support. He said they helped him understand the experience.&lt;ref&gt;"There were six thousand letters to date and only nine of them abusive." (page 184)&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin became a national celebrity for a time. In a 1975 essay included in later editions of the book, he recounted encountering hostility and threats to him and his family in his hometown of [[Mansfield, Texas]]. He moved to Mexico for a number of years for safety.&lt;ref name=bbc20091025&gt;{{citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8318628.stm | title = Exposing the colour of prejudice | author = Kevin Connolly | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP20070317&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/16/AR2007031602173.html | title = John Howard Griffin Took Race All the Way to the Finish | author = Jonathan Yardley | date = March 17, 2007 | publisher = [[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precedent==
Journalist [[Ray Sprigle]] had undertaken a similar project more than a decade earlier. In 1948, Sprigle disguised himself as a black man and travelled in the [[Deep South]] with [[John Wesley Dobbs]], a guide from the [[NAACP]]. Sprigle wrote a series of articles under the title, "I Was a Negro in the South for 30 Days," which was published in many newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sprigle's secret journey | journal = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | author = Bill Steigerwald|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sprigle/Sprigleintroduction.asp|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The articles formed the basis of Sprigle's 1949 book ''[[In the Land of Jim Crow]]''.

'''Community Greens''', sometimes referred to as ''backyard commons'', ''urban [[Common lands|common]]s'', or [[pocket neighborhood]]s, are shared open green spaces on the inside of city blocks, created either when residents merge backyard space or reclaim underutilized urban land such as vacant lots and [[Alley|alleyway]]s. These shared spaces are communally used and managed only by the residents whose homes abut them. They are not a public park, a private backyard, or a community garden; however, they can function as all three.

==Community Greens==
Community Greens is an organization concerned with the development of shared green spaces in residential neighborhoods in American cities. These green spaces are community greens.  The Community Greens movement believes that such an approach presents the best opportunity to add usable green space to American cities, by converting under utilized backyards and dysfunctional alleys into functional and beautiful shared green spaces that are owned, managed, and enjoyed by the people who live around them.

This has led communities in numerous American cities, including Boston, Sacramento, Baltimore, New York, and San Francisco, taking down their backyard fences, to create backyard commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618112110/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |archivedate=2009-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community Greens are multi-functional spaces for gardening, recreation, and leisure which are designed to provide social, economic, and environmental benefits to urban residents. The creation of  backyard commons can lead to an increased interaction with neighbors throughout the planning and implementation process, which may result in a stronger overall sense of community. Other possible social benefits that are claimed include decreased crime, from having more eyes on the street, and safe places where children can play and adults relax. Community Greens, like other types of urban green spaces, can significantly improve the ecological functioning of urban habitats. Vegetation and permeable pavement can slow storm water runoff and increase groundwater, which in turn can reduce pollutant flowing into nearby bodies of water during a storm. Urban environments are often significantly warmer than outlying suburbs, mostly due to the prevalence of  heat retentive concrete surfaces. City trees can mitigate this effect through shading, etc..&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, AH, and Romm, JJ. (Feb/Mar97 ) “Painting the town white-and green.”''MIT's Technology Review''. 100(2):52-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The taking down  of backyards fences transforms fragmented habitats to connected corridors for urban wildlife. Furthermore because city dwellers recognize value in green space, often simply from an aesthetic standpoint, and this may be reflected through increased property values.&lt;ref&gt;Been, V. "The Effect of Community Gardens on Neighboring Property Values." June 18, 2007; Crompton, J.L.

==The beginnings in Maryland==
* Community Greens was founded as an offshoot of Ashoka, by Ashoka founder [[Bill Drayton]] in 2001.
* Spearheaded a state wide legislature in [[Maryland]], which changed the City Charter which allows the city to lease and gate alleys to homeowners.
* Started the Alley Gating and Alley Greening pilot project in [[Baltimore]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Alley greening [http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/Divisions/AlleyGatingGreeningProgram.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local ordinance passed in the City of Baltimore in 2007.
* As of 2009, there are 3 completely gated and greened alleys in Baltimore and over 70 applications from interested neighborhoods.

===Baltimore: The pilot project===
In 2002, a group of residents from the [[Patterson Park]] neighborhood approached the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (CDC) looking for a way to improve the dirty, crime-ridden alley that ran behind their homes. Simultaneously, Community Greens also approached the Patterson Park CDC looking for an alley they could use as a pilot project in Baltimore, and these two groups were put into contact. The Luzerne-Glover block was granted a temporary permit from the city to gate their alleyway, despite the fact that it was not yet legal to gate a right-of-way. Community Greens, the Patterson Park CDC, the Patterson Park Neighborhood Association and the Luzurne‐Glover block group turned to University of Maryland law professor Barbara Bezdek, who enlisted the help of her law students, who researched existing laws and current uses of Baltimore alleyways.

[[File:Luzerne and Chandlers Yard Before.jpg|thumb|alt=Luzerne alleyway before gating and greening|The Luzerne-Glover Block alley before gating and greening]]

Looking for a permanent solution, these groups aligned themselves with the Mayor's Department of Neighborhoods and took their case to Annapolis. Maryland Delegate [[Peter A. Hammen]] sponsored House Bill 1533 to amend the Baltimore City Charter, allowing the City to close alleyways and lease them to interested parties. The Luzerne-Glover group testified before the Environmental Committee of the state legislature and House Bill 1533 passed in 2004. Community Greens then worked with law firm [[Hogan &amp; Hartson]], in collaboration with Barbara Bezdek, to draft a city alley gating and leasing ordinance, which was then submitted to the City of Baltimore.

In April 2007, the [[Baltimore City Council]] under the leadership of newly elected Mayor [[Shelia Dixon]], passed the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance, enabling Baltimore residents to legally gate and green the alleys behind their homes, contingent on a requirement that 80% of the homeowners on the alley submit consent forms and 100% of property owners to approve projects that impede traffic flow. Projects requiring 100% consent include removal of existing concrete and installation of permeable pavement and large tree plantings; beautification and smaller greening projects that do not impede traffic only require 80% approval.

Interested communities need approval from several Baltimore City Departments, including Solid Waste, Transportation, Fire, and Police to ensure that proposed alley projects meet the necessary infrastructural conditions. Once initial approval is received, residents submit an application to the Department of Public Works, which includes the necessary consent forms from homeowners and a signed affidavit stating that attempts were made to obtain approval from all homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525041536/http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |archivedate=2009-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luzerne Glover neighborhood now has their green alleyway, and is the first community in Baltimore to use the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225084428/http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, seven Baltimore communities have successfully completed this process and have created eight useful Community Greens from the underutilized alleyways in their backyards.

==Other existing greens==

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090628111701/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/montgomerypark/Montgomery%20Park.htm Montgomery Park - Boston, Massachusetts]===
'''Montgomery Park''' is a third of an acre common space shared by 85 households in Boston's South End neighborhood. From the time the neighborhood was first developed in the 1860s through the 1970s, the park was separated from the residents' backyards by an alley and fence. In more recent years, residents began to connect the park to their individual yards by replacing the alley separating their private backyards from the park with a narrower brick walkway and tearing down backyard fences. Additionally, residents have moved garbage collection to the front street and convinced utility companies to bury service lines. Residents now enjoy greater access to the shared Community Green, and use it for gardening and recreation.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090625143531/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/stoneycreek/stoneycreek.htm Stoney Creek Apartments - Livermore, California]===
'''Stoney Creek Apartments''' were constructed in 1992 to address a lack of affordable housing in [[Livermore, California]]. Ten residential buildings share five courtyards, accessible from a small alleyway. Homes have front and back patios in addition to the shared courtyards, and neighbors have the opportunity to enjoy this shared outdoor space and experience a heightened sense of community. The inward-facing position of these patios allows parents to keep a watchful eye on children playing in the courtyard.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124249/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/chandlersyard/chandlersyard.htm Chandlers Yard - Baltimore, Maryland]===
Located in the Federal Hill neighborhood of downtown Baltimore and hidden behind eleven narrow rowhouses, '''Chandler's Yard''' is a tree-shaded courtyard that was carved out of the backyards of the surrounding homes by developer Bill Struever who wanted to make living on the block more attractive to potential buyers. Struever convinced some of the property owners in this block to give up part of their backyards for this shared courtyard and pay a small construction fee. The result is a beautiful shared space for these residents, who enjoy a heightened sense of security and increased property values.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090218163042/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/villagehomes/villagehomes.htm Village Homes - Davis, California]===
The '''Village Homes''' development is situated on a sixty-acre parcel in suburban Davis, California. While home lots are smaller than the average for Davis, clusters of eight homes share common green spaces accessible from private backyards. In addition to these courtyards, Village Homes residents share two large parks, two vineyards, and numerous small orchards and community gardens. Gardens are irrigated by naturally-flowing creeks, which also serve as natural filters that eliminate the need for an expensive storm-water sewer system. Residents enjoy environmental and aesthetic benefits from their shared spaces, and the increased sense of community is evident; Village Homes residents on average know 40 neighbors, compared to an average of 17 acquaintances reported in a nearby traditional suburban development.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090630004718/http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/jacksonheights/jacksonheights.htm Jackson Heights - Queens, New York]===
For nearly nine decades, the historic neighborhood of '''Jackson Heights''' in Queens has maintained its fourteen block-long shared interior courtyards, and is considered to be the first "garden apartments" constructed in the United States. These spaces have helped to sustain the blocks' distinctive appeal since their development in the early decades of the last century. Over the years, Jackson Heights residents fought to hold on to their gardens and green spaces in the midst of a city where high property values create an intense pressure to develop any available open space.  The preservation of these shared spaces has increased both community pride and residential property values; if these inner courtyards had been developed, Jackson Heights property values would have dropped by one-third. In 1993, Jackson Heights was officially declared a historic district by the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission, furthering sense of place for this community.

===[http://www.communitygreens.org/st-francis-square St. Francis Square - San Francisco, California]===
A cooperative apartment community, '''St. Francis Square''' consists of 299 apartments wrapped around three shared, open spaces. These community greens are full of gardens, basketball courts, playgrounds, and quiet places to relax.  St. Francis Square was established as a limited equity co-operative apartment, although it converted to market rate ownership in 2004.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124254/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/hopecommunity/hope.htm The Hope Community - Minneapolis, MN]===
Fifteen years ago, this community was situated in an area of Minneapolis plagued by urban flight and crime. Instrumental to the rehabilitation and renovation of this neighborhood is a local community development corporation, [http://www.hope-community.org/ Hope Community, Inc]. In the late 1980s, residents were selling their properties for one dollar because they had lost all value; this is when the Hope Community began purchasing houses in the hopes of developing affordable rental units clustered together on a single block. Today, nine rehabilitated houses abut community areas, a playground, and gardens. Property values are steadily increasing and the community itself is stabilizing. By following principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and creating defensible space, '''the Hope Community''' has created a sense of shared ownership and community in a troubled urban area.

==Green alleys==
Something similar has taken place in various cities in North America, involving the [[greening]] of [[back lane]]s or [[alley]]s. This includes [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name=chicago /&gt; [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/docs/pmp/greenalleyhandbook_chicago.pdf "The Chicago Green Alley Handbook"] on the City of Seattle website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpl.org/green-alleys "Green Alleys"] on the [[Trust for Public Land]] website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ddot.dc.gov/publication/ddot-green-alley-project-fact-sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montréal]], Canada, who have started to reclaim their alleys from garbage and crime by [[greening]] the service lanes, or back ways, that run behind some houses.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;[http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects+and+Planning/Environment/Green+Alley+Projects "Green Alley Projects"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104000808/http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects%2Band%2BPlanning/Environment/Green%2BAlley%2BProjects |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the District of Columbia Department of Transportation website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about "About Us"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104095801/http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the ''Integrated Alleys'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Chicago]]''', [[Illinois]] has about {{convert|1900|mi|km}} of alleyways.&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;[http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/street/svcs/green_alleys.html "Service: Green Alleys"] on the City of Chicago website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Chicago Department of Transportation]] started converting conventional alleys which were paved with [[asphalt]] into so called Green Alleys. This program, called the Green Alley Program, is supposed to enable easier water runoff, as the alleyways in [[Chicago]] are not connected to the sewer system. With this program, the water will be able to seep through semi-permeable [[concrete]] or [[asphalt]] in which a colony of fungi and bacteria will establish itself. The bacteria will help breakup oils before the water is absorbed into the ground. The lighter color of the pavement will also reflect more light, making the area next to the alley cooler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140103190427/http://www.screamtobegreen.com/2007/11/chicago-alleys-to-go-green/ "Chicago Alleys to Go Green"] on the ''Scream to be Green'' website&lt;/ref&gt; The greening of such alleys or laneways can also involve the planting of native plants to further absorb rain water and moderate temperature.

'''''Erinnerungskultur''''' (from German), or '''Culture of Remembrance''', is the interaction of an individual or a [[society]] with their past and [[history]].

== Definition ==

In the strictest sense, Remembrance Culture is all the behavioral configurations and socially approved or acquired [[manners]] of a society or group used to keep parts of the past in their consciousness and thus deliberately make it present. The central theme is not the display of historical and objective knowledge but primarily collective and subjective perceptions of historical connections to the past from a current perspective. One can distinguish between private and public Remembrance Culture as well as their respective regular and event-based elements. The striking thing about a Culture of Remembrance is the fact that collective perceptions shape subjective ones. Social conflicts, relationships and problems influence a Remembrance Culture. In a pronounced Culture of Remembrance, less emphasized elements are likely to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Arnd Krüger: Die sieben Arten in Vergessenheit zu geraten. In: Arnd Krüger, Bernd Wedemeyer-Kolwe (Hrsg.): Vergessen, Verdrängt, Abgelehnt. Zur Geschichte der Ausgrenzung im Sport. (= Schriftenreihe des Niedersächsischen Instituts für Sportgeschichte Hoya. Band 21). LIT-Verlag, Münster 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-643-10338-3}}, S. 4–16; die ursprüngliche Theorie (ohne Sport) beruht auf Paul Connerton: Seven Types of Forgetting. Memory Studies. 1, 2008, S. 59–71&lt;/ref&gt; Family albums, [[Genealogy|genealogical research]] or anniversaries with personal or familial significance are examples of private or subjective forms of Remembrance Culture. Works from a Remembrance Culture can officially be designated as [[Cultural artifact|cultural artefacts]] or cultural monuments if there is a long-standing [[public interest]].

== Expression and forms ==

Particularly within the public Culture of Remembrance, expressions can be found in a variety of initiatives and approaches, for example the [[Archive|archiving of information]], its [[scientific]] renovation and finally public [[documentation]] and other media presentation. Apart from these forms which are more linked to the event itself, other crucial forms of Remembrance Culture are [[Memorial|memorial sites]], commemoration days and [[monuments]]. Certain events, like for example the [[Historikerstreit|Historians Dispute]] provide a rather constant discussion platform for it in the short term but there are many intense social discussions surrounding it from different topic areas. They very quickly touch on political interests and for that reason they are also subjected to a potential instrumentalisation through current affairs. Thereby, questions concerning the Culture of Remembrance, thus the perception of it is closely linked with questions regarding authorizing claims to power and that of creating a [[national identity]]. In many cases, this leads to the government ritualization of the Culture of Remembrance and determines a number of [[taboos]] in society. The politicization of Erinerungskultur is above all noticeable in [[regime]] changes, in which the previous understanding of past events is altered under new leadership. An obvious example is the way in which we approach monuments, which commemorate heroes from past regimes in the past. They however are not honoured in the same way following a change in regime.

== Examples  ==
In Germany, Austria and in many other countries, the Culture of Remembrance is essentially a synonym for remembering the [[Holocaust]] and the sacrifices made during [[National Socialism]].

However, a central aspect of the Culture of Remembrance is not only the German experience, but also [[genocides]] that have occurred or are still occurring in other countries - especially when this also still affects disadvantaged minorities. Examples of such genocide are Namibia (the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|Herero and Nama genocide]]), Armenia and Turkey ([[Armenian Genocide|the Armenian Genocide]]) and Rwanda ([[Rwandan genocide|the Rwandian Genocide]]). There are also examples such as [[Apartheid in South Africa]], the [[Reign of Terror]] of the Red Khmer in Cambodia, the acts of [[Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, [[Chairman Mao|Chairman Mao's regime]] in China or the war crimes committed by the Japanese army in eastern Asia during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. They are still of huge significance with their predominantly strong, ritualized ways of remembrance. Nevertheless, they are in many respects not properly reviewed.

== International cooperation in the field of Erinnerungskultur ==

In Europe, the French-German collaboration regarding remembrance can serve as a template for relations between other countries, such as those between Germany and Poland. These two countries have to come to terms with their shared painful past in order to strengthen current relations. Among other things there is a multifaceted dialogue: there have been many events throughout European history which allow for a comparison of different remembrance cultures.

== Conservation, restoration and reconstruction ==

A recent example of reconstruction can be found at the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]]. Anastylosis is the right term to be used here, as the correct positions of many surviving stones from the old construction were calculated, and these were visibly preserved in the new construction.

A lyricist from Dresden, Durs Grünbein, denotes this attempt of reconstruction with a critical distance by using the title Chimäre Dresden (chimera of Dresden): other cities had also a tragic downfall, however, none of them cultivated the memory of the time before the destruction with so much painful nostalgia, none of them lived so much through the identikit of their former cosmopolitan silhouette. Similar conflicts arose i.e. during the reconstruction of Heidelberger Schloss (which remains undone).

== Current discussion ==
In 2011, during the event "Memorial Mania" &lt;ref&gt;am 9./10. Dezember 2011 in Berlin ([http://www.hkw.de/de/programm/2011/andere2011/veranstaltungen_53180/veranstaltungsdetail_67251.php deutsche Vorankündigung durch das Haus der Kulturen der Welt] und [http://www.americanacademy.de/home/program/past/blog/2011/12/09/memorial_mania/989/detail/ englische Vorankündigung durch die American Academy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305184119/http://www.americanacademy.de/home/program/past/blog/2011/12/09/memorial_mania/989/detail |date=2016-03-05 }})&lt;/ref&gt; there was  discussion in 2011 about suitable dates for the construction of monuments and the risk of instrumentalizing them for political purposes. The US expert for monuments, James Young, who had introduced the concept of "Counter-Memorial" to characterize the monumental aesthetics of Holocaust memorials, placed the New York [[National September 11 Memorial and Museum|Mahnmal an Ground Zero]] in this tradition. There was a talk about the appropriate moments for the construction of the monuments and the danger of the exploitation of the monuments for social enforcement. 

Other prominent and current conflicts about the culture of remembrance are i.e. the reconstruction of [[Berlin City Palace]] in the place of the [[Palace of the Republic, Berlin|Palace of the Republic]], [[Dresdner Frauenkirche]] that was restored via [[anastylosis]], and the expansion of Prora (that was planned to be a KdF-Seebad, but was however extended to Stalinist barracks) in Rügen to luxury real estate.

== Role in the foundation of national identity ==
Culture of remembrance, a historical sorrow, was only of minor importance in the conflict of the Berliner "Holocaust Monument". According to Jan-Holger Kirsch, its proper significance consists in "redefining of ‘the national identity’ in the unified Germany". The monument is considered to be a prominent exhibit of the Berliner Republic, in which the acknowledgements of nation and historical guilt are not seen as contradiction anymore. Thereby, the holocaust can be used as a form of identity politics through which especially Jews are excluded once more.

== Critique of Erinnerungskultur ==

=== Loss of Authenticity Through 'Sacrilisation' ===
The historian [[Erik Franzen|K. Erik Franzen]] comments in an article about [[Dachau]], that the topography of the site has maintained a strong religious focus through the construction of different religious memorials that encourage the guiding principle of Christian reconciliation. "The "authenticity" of the site has virtually disintegrated as part of its contact with the past- if there was even such a thing as an authentic site to begin with."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fr-online.de/architektur/kz-gedenkstaette-dachau-auf-dem-weg-der-erinnerung,1473352,2777216.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suggestive Museumisation ("Suggestive Musealisierung") ===
In her autobiography, ''{{ill|Weiter leben. Eine Jugend|de}}'', the literary scholar and holocaust survivor [[Ruth Klüger]] has contested whether Dachau, amongst other examples, is suitable for use as an educational facility and museum. She writes that Dachau is so clean and orderly that it almost feels inviting, as if it were evoking the memory of a former holiday camp rather than of a tortured existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ruth Klüger|Title=weiter leben: Eine Jugend |Publisher=Wallstein Verlag|Year=2012|ISBN=9783835321519|Date=  2012|language=German|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=buNFPoxnvHgC|AccessDate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conversation about the growing memorialisation of memory, she expressed the view that "Pathos and Kitsch" would shift the view of reality and would not do justice to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Helmut Zeller Dachau|Periodical=sueddeutsche.de|Title=Versöhnungskirche Dachau: Das Leben als Zufall |ISSN=0174-4917|language=German|URL=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/dachau/versoehnungskirche-dachau-das-leben-als-zufall-1.2509923|AccessDate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aleida Assmann comments that for Klüger, "museumised places of remembrance" have become "Deckerinnerungen" ("screen memories").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Aleida Assmann|Title=Erinnerungsräume: Formen und Wandlungen des kulturellen Gedächtnisses |Publisher=C.H.Beck|Year=2009|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;333|ISBN=9783406585326|Date=  2009|language=German|URL={{Google books|lvMEixh8F1QC|plainurl=y}}|AccessDate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distorted language ===
[[Sigrid Jacobeit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Dr. Sigrid  Jacobeit — Institut für Europäische Ethnologie|trans-title=|periodical=www.euroethno.hu-berlin.de|publisher=|url=https://www.euroethno.hu-berlin.de/de/institut/personen/jacobeit|format=|accessdate=2016-05-15|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the distorted language of commemoration.
{{Zitat|"The language of commemoration is ritualised, selective, variegated, standardised, and tends to explicitly transport a particular society to the relevant image of history". The past becomes decontextualised, uncoupled from political, societal and cultural concepts, and there is even an attempt "to master the past and to render it harmless for future generations". "Nie wieder!" ("Never again!") is in this case viewed as a cautionary and illusory solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sigrid Jacobeit: KZ-Gedenkstätten als nationale Erinnerungsorte.Zwischen Ritualisierung und Musealisierung.

=== Templates ===
[[Jan Assmann]] sees it as a "threatening sign" that the culture of remembrance is sometimes reduced to a template, whereby only that which fits the template is seen as valid, and that which doesn't is rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann: ''Das kulturelle Gedächtnis.

'''Dereivka''' ({{lang-uk|Деріївка}}, {{lang-ru|Дериевка}}) is an [[archaeological site]] located in the village of the same name in [[Kirovohrad Oblast]], [[Ukraine]], on the right bank of the [[Dneiper River|Dneiper]]. The site dates to ca. 4500&amp;mdash;3500 BC and is associated with the [[Sredny Stog culture]].
 
This site is known primarily as a probable site of early horse domestication due to a high percentage of horse bones found at the site. A horse burial with bit wear and cheek pieces was long considered evidence for horseback-riding at an early date, but in 1997 radiocarbon dates showed that the burial was intrusive, the horse having died circa 700-200 BC, thereby re-opening the question of when horseback-riding was invented.&lt;ref&gt;Drews, Early Riders, page15&lt;/ref&gt;

Of interest is some apparently equivocal evidence for ''fenced'' houses. Two cemeteries are associated, one from the earlier (neolithic) [[Dnieper-Donets culture]] and one from the aforementioned Sredny Stog culture, of the Copper Age. The habitation site included three dwellings and six hearths, each containing hundreds of animal bones. Of all the bones, approximately 75% came from horses, possibly exploited by the inhabitants only as food staple.

As a part of the Sredny Stog complex, it is considered to be very early [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], and probably, [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]], within the traditional context of the [[Kurgan]] hypothesis of [[Marija Gimbutas]], though Sredny Stog is itself pre-kurgan as to burial rite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16855">'''Dialectology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|διάλεκτος}}, ''dialektos'', "talk, dialect"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the scientific study of linguistic [[dialect]], a sub-field of [[sociolinguistics]]. It studies variations in [[language]] based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Dialectology treats such topics as divergence of two local dialects from a common ancestor and synchronic variation.

Dialectologists are ultimately concerned with grammatical, lexical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas. Thus they usually deal not only with populations that have lived in certain areas for generations, but also with migrant groups that bring their languages to new areas (see [[language contact]]).

Commonly studied concepts in dialectology include the problem of [[mutual intelligibility]] in defining languages and dialects; situations of [[diglossia]], where two dialects are used for different functions; [[Dialect continuum|dialect continua]] including a number of partially mutually intelligible dialects; and [[Pluricentric language|pluricentrism]], where what is essentially a single genetic language exists as two or more standard varieties.

[[Hans Kurath]] and [[William Labov]] are among the most prominent researchers in this field.

==History==
In London, there were comments on the different dialects recorded in 12th century sources, and a large number of dialect glossaries (focussing on vocabulary) were published in the 19th century.&lt;ref name = "Petyt 37"&gt;Petyt (1980), p.37&lt;/ref&gt;  Philologists would also study dialects, as they preserved earlier forms of words.&lt;ref name = "Petyt 37"/&gt;

The first comparative dialect study in Germany was ''The Dialects of Bavaria'' by [[Johann Andreas Schmeller]], which included a linguistic atlas.&lt;ref&gt;Petyt, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1876, [[Georg Wenker]] sent postal questionnaires out over Northern Germany. These postal questionnaires contained a list of sentences written in Standard German. These sentences were then transcribed into the local dialect, reflecting dialectal differences. Many studies proceeded from this, and over the next century dialect studies were carried out all over the world.  [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] produced the six-volume ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'' in 1905.
 
Traditional studies in Dialectology were generally aimed at producing dialect maps, whereby imaginary lines were drawn over a map to indicate different dialect areas. The move away from traditional methods of language study however caused linguists to become more concerned with social factors. Dialectologists therefore began to study social, as well as regional variation. The ''Linguistic Atlas of the United States'' (1930s) was amongst the first dialect studies to take social factors into account.

Under the leadership of [[Harold Orton]], the [[University of Leeds]] became a centre for the study of English dialect, and set up an Institute of Dialect and Folk Life Studies.  In the 1950s, the university undertook the [[Survey of English Dialects]], which covered all of [[England]], some bordering areas of Wales and the [[Isle of Man]].  In addition, the University undertook more than 100 dialect monographs before the death of Harold Orton in 1975.&lt;ref name = Frees&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frees |first1=Craig |date=1991 |title=The Historiography of Dialectology |url=http://collections.mun.ca/PDFs/lorelang/LoreandLanguageVol10No021991.pdf#page=3 |journal=Lore and Language |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=67-74 |access-date=11 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute closed in 1983 to accommodate budget cuts for the University, but its dialectological studies are now part of a special collection, the Leeds Archive of Vernacular Culture, in the University's Brotherton Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Collection: Leeds Archive of Vernacular Culture, (Survey of English Dialects, and the Institute of Dialect and Folk Life Studies)|url=https://explore.library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/409248/leeds_archive_of_vernacular_culture_survey_of_en|access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
This shift in interest consequently saw the birth of [[Sociolinguistics]], which is a mixture of dialectology and [[social sciences]].  However, Graham Shorrocks has argued that there was always a sociological element to dialectology, and that many of the conclusions of sociolinguists (e.g. the relationships with gender, class and age) can be found in earlier work by traditional dialectologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shorrocks|first=Graham|title=A Grammar of the Dialect of the Bolton Area. Pt. 1: Introduction; phonology|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Frankfurt am Main|year=1998|series=Bamberger Beiträge zur englischen Sprachwissenschaft; Bd. 41|isbn=3-631-33066-9|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of data collection==
Dialect researchers typically use predominantly interview questionnaires to gather data on the dialect they are researching. These are not to be confused with what is called [https://www.academia.edu/18162995/The_Written_Questionnaire_in_Social_Dialectology_History_Theory_Practice_Dec._2015_ written questionnaires], which have had some applications in dialectology as well and which, recently, have had a comeback in linguistics more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Stefan. 2015. The Written Questionnaire in Social Dialectology. Amsterdam: Benjamins, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main types of questionnaires; direct and indirect.

Researchers using for their face-to-face interviews the direct method will present the subject with a set of questions that demand a specific answer and are designed to gather either lexical or phonological information. For example, the linguist may ask the subject the name for various items, or ask him or her to repeat certain words.

Indirect questionnaires are typically more open-ended and take longer to complete than direct questionnaires. A researcher using this method will sit down with a subject and begin a conversation on a specific topic. For example, he may question the subject about farm work, food and cooking, or some other subject, and gather lexical and phonological information from the information provided by the subject. The researcher may also begin a sentence, but allow the subject to finish it for him, or ask a question that does not demand a specific answer, such as "What are the most common plants and trees around here?"&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, J.K., and Trudgill, Peter. 1998. ''Dialectology''. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mutual intelligibility ==
{{Main|Mutual intelligibility}}

Some have attempted to distinguish dialects from languages by saying that dialects of the same language are understandable to each other. The untenable nature of blunt application of this criterion is demonstrated by the case of [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] cited below. While native speakers of the two may enjoy mutual understanding ranging from limited to considerable depending on the topic of discussion and speakers' experience with linguistic variety, few people would want to classify Italian and Spanish as dialects of the same language in any sense other than historical. Spanish and Italian are similar and to varying extents mutually comprehensible, but [[phonology]], [[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and [[lexicon]] are sufficiently distinct that the two cannot be considered dialects of the same language (but of the common ancestor [[Latin]]).

== Diglossia ==
{{Main|Diglossia}}

Another problem occurs in the case of diglossia, used to describe a situation in which, in a given society, there are two closely related languages, one of high prestige, which is generally used by the government and in formal texts, and one of low prestige, which is usually the spoken [[vernacular]] tongue. An example of this is [[Sanskrit]], which was considered the proper way to speak in [[northern India]], but only accessible by the upper class, and [[Prakrit]] which was the common (and informal or [[vernacular]]) speech at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Charles A.|date=1959-01-01|title=Diglossia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1959.11659702|journal=WORD|volume=15|issue=2|pages=325–340|doi=10.1080/00437956.1959.11659702|issn=0043-7956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varying degrees of diglossia are still common in many societies around the world.

== Dialect continuum ==
{{Main|Dialect continuum}}

[[File:Dialect continua in Europe.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Major dialect continua in Europe in the mid-20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chambers |first1=J.K. |last2=Trudgill |first2=Peter |title=Dialectology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=2nd |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59646-6 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A dialect continuum is a network of dialects in which geographically adjacent dialects are mutually comprehensible, but with comprehensibility steadily decreasing as distance between the dialects increases. An example is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-[[German language|German]] dialect continuum, a vast network of dialects with two recognized literary standards. Although mutual intelligibility between standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and standard [[German language|German]] is very limited, a chain of dialects connects them. Due to several centuries of influence by standard languages (especially in Northern [[Germany]], where even today the original dialects struggle to survive) there are now many breaks in intelligibility between geographically adjacent dialects along the continuum, but in the past these breaks were virtually nonexistent.

The Romance languages&amp;mdash;[[Galician language|Galician]]/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Sicily|Sicilian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Occitan]]/[[Provençal (dialect)|Provençal]], [[French language|French]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Romansh language|Romansh]], [[Friulan]], other [[Italy|Italian]], French, and Ibero-Romance dialects, and others&amp;mdash;form another well-known continuum, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.

In both areas—the Germanic linguistic continuum, the Romance linguistic continuum—the relational notion of the term dialect is often vastly misunderstood, and today gives rise to considerable difficulties in implementation of European Union directives regarding support of minority languages. Perhaps this is no more evident than in Italy, where still today some of the population use their local language (''dialetto'' 'dialect') as the primary means of communication at home and, to varying lesser extent, the workplace. Difficulties arise due to terminological confusion. The languages conventionally referred to as [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]] are Romance sister languages of Italian, not variants of Italian, which are commonly and properly called ''italiano regionale'' ('regional Italian'). The label Italian dialect as conventionally used is more geopolitical in aptness of meaning rather than linguistic: Bolognese and Neapolitan, for example, are termed Italian dialects, yet resemble each other less than do Italian and Spanish. Misunderstandings ensue if "Italian dialect" is taken to mean 'dialect of Italian' rather than 'minority language spoken on Italian soil', i.e. part of the network of the Romance linguistic continuum. The indigenous Romance language of Venice, for example, is cognate with Italian, but quite distinct from the national language in [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[lexicon]], and in no way a derivative or a variety of the national language. [[Venetian language|Venetian]] can be said to be an ''Italian dialect'' both geographically and typologically, but it is not a ''dialect of Italian''.

== Pluricentrism ==
{{Main|Pluricentric language}}
A pluricentric language is a single genetic language that has two or more [[standard language|standard]] forms. An example is [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which encompasses two standard varieties, [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]]. Another example is Norwegian, with [[Bokmål]] having developed closely with Danish and Swedish, and [[Nynorsk]] as a partly reconstructed language based on old dialects. Both are recognized as official languages in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858282330|title=Pluricentric languages : differing norms in different nations|others=Clyne, Michael G., 1939-2010.|isbn=3110128551|location=Berlin|oclc=858282330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sense, the set of dialects can be understood as being part of a single [[diasystem]], an abstraction that each dialect is part of.  In [[generative phonology]], the differences can be acquired through rules.  An example can be taken with [[Occitan]] (a cover term for a set of related varieties of Southern France) where 'cavaL' (from late Latin caballus, horse) is the diasystemic form for the following realizations
* Languedocien dialect: ''caval'' {{IPA|[kaβal]}} (L &gt; {{IPA|[l]}}, sometimes velar, used concurrently with French borrowed forms ''chival'' or ''chivau'');
* Limousin dialect: ''chavau'' {{IPA|[tʃavau]}} (ca &gt; cha and -L &gt; -u);
* Provençal dialect: ''cavau'' {{IPA|[kavau]}} (-L &gt; -u, used concurrently with French borrowed forms ''chival'' or ''chivau'');
* Gascon dialect: ''cavath'' {{IPA|[kawat]}} (final -L &gt; {{IPA|[t]}}, sometimes palatalized, and used concurrently with French borrowed forms ''chibau'')
*Auvergnat and Vivaro-alpine dialects: ''chaval'' {{IPA|[tʃaval]}} (same treatment of ''ca'' cluster as in Limousin dialect)

This conceptual approach may be used in practical situations. For instance when such a diasystem is identified, it can be used construct a [[diaphoneme|diaphonemic]] orthography that emphasizes the commonalities between the varieties. Such a goal may or may not fit with sociopolitical preferences.

== The abstand and ausbau languages framework ==
{{Main|abstand and ausbau languages}}

One analytical paradigm developed by linguists is known as the ''abstand and ausbau languages'' framework. It has proved popular among linguists in Continental Europe, but is not so well known in English-speaking countries, especially among people who are not trained linguists. Although only one of many possible paradigms, it has the advantage of being constructed by trained linguists for the particular purpose of analyzing and categorizing varieties of speech, and has the additional merit of replacing such [[loaded words]] as "language" and "dialect" with the [[German language|German]] terms of [[ausbau language]] and [[abstand language]], words that are not (yet) loaded with political, cultural, or emotional connotations.

[[File:Four-tone hand diagram.png|thumb|An old illustration of the four tone classes, in their traditional representation on a hand. In modern use, the diacritics all face the character, as in the table above.]]
The '''four tones''' of [[Chinese poetry]] and [[Varieties of Chinese|dialectology]] ({{zh|t=四聲|s=四声|p=sìshēng}}) are four traditional [[tone (linguistics)|tone classes]]&lt;ref&gt;A "tone class" is a lexical division of words based on tone. It may not have a direct correspondence with [[tone (linguistics)|phonemic tone]]. The three tones of open syllables in Middle Chinese contrast with undifferentiated tone in checked syllables, and words are classified according to these four possibilities.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words. They play an important role in [[Chinese poetry]] and in comparative studies of tonal development in the modern [[varieties of Chinese]], both in traditional Chinese and in Western [[linguistics]]. They correspond to the [[historical Chinese phonology|phonology]] of [[Middle Chinese]], and are named ''even'' or ''level'' ({{lang|zh|平}} ''píng''), ''rising'' ({{lang|zh|上}} ''shǎng''), ''departing'' (or ''going''; {{lang|zh|去}} ''qù''), and ''entering'' or ''[[checked tone|checked]]'' ({{lang|zh|入}} ''rù'').&lt;ref name=Baxter&gt;{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology |authors=Baxter, William H. |year=1992 |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin, New York |isbn=3-11-012324-X |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The last three are collectively referred to as ''oblique'' {{lang|zh|仄}} (''zè''), an important concept in poetic [[tone pattern]]s.) Due to historic splits and mergers, none of the modern varieties of Chinese have the exact four tones of Middle Chinese, but they are noted in rhyming dictionaries.

According to the usual modern analysis, [[Early Middle Chinese]] had three [[phonemic]] tones in most syllables, but no tonal distinctions in checked syllables ending in the [[stop consonant]]s /p/, /t/, /k/.  In most circumstances, every syllable had its own tone; hence a multisyllabic word typically had a tone assigned to each syllable. (In modern varieties, the situation is sometimes more complicated. Although each syllable typically still has its own ''underlying'' tone in most dialects, some syllables in the speech of some varieties may have their tone modified into other tones or neutralized entirely, by a process known as [[tone sandhi]].)

Traditional Chinese [[Varieties of Chinese|dialectology]] reckons syllables ending in a stop consonant as possessing a fourth tone, known technically as a ''[[checked tone]]''.  This tone is known in traditional Chinese linguistics as the ''entering'' ({{lang|zh|入}} ''rù'') tone, a term commonly used in English as well.  The other three tones were termed the ''level'' (or ''even'') tone ({{lang|zh|平}} ''píng''), the ''rising'' ({{lang|zh|上}} ''shǎng'') tone, and the ''departing'' (or ''going'') tone ({{lang|zh|去}} ''qù'').&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt;  The practice of setting up the entering tone as a separate class reflects the fact that the actual pitch contour of checked syllables was quite distinct from the pitch contour of any of the sonorant-final syllables.  Indeed, implicit in the organisation of the classical [[rime table]]s is a different, but structurally equally valid, phonemic analysis, which takes all four tones as phonemic and demotes the difference between stop finals {{IPA|[p t k]}} and nasal finals {{IPA|[m n ŋ]}} to [[allophonic]], with stops occurring in entering syllables and nasals elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions of phonetic systems |author=Chao, Yuen-Ren |year=1934 |journal=Bulletin of the Institute for History and Philology (Academia Sinica) |volume=4 |pages=363–397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of modern [[historical linguistics]], there is often value in treating the "entering tone" as a tone regardless of its phonemic status, because syllables possessing this "tone" typically develop differently from syllables possessing any of the other three "tones".  For clarity, these four "tones" are often referred to as ''tone classes'', with each word belonging to one of the four tone classes.  This reflects the fact that the lexical division of words into tone classes is based on tone, but not all tone classes necessarily have a distinct phonemic tone associated with them.

The four Early Middle Chinese (EMC) tones are nearly always presented in the order  ''level'' ({{lang|zh|平}} ''píng''), ''rising'' ({{lang|zh|上}} ''shǎng''), ''departing'' ({{lang|zh|去}} ''qù''), ''entering'' ({{lang|zh|入}} ''rù''), and correspondingly numbered 1 2 3 4 in modern discussions.  In [[Late Middle Chinese]] (LMC), each of the EMC tone classes split in two, depending on the nature of the initial consonant of the syllable in question.  Discussions of LMC and the various modern varieties will often number these split tone classes from 1 through 8, keeping the same ordering as before.  For example, LMC/modern tone classes 1 and 2 derive from EMC tone class 1; LMC/modern tone classes 3 and 4 derive from EMC tone class 2; etc.  The odd-numbered tone classes 1 3 5 7 are termed ''dark'' ({{lang|zh|陰}} ''yīn''), whereas the even-numbered tone classes 2 4 6 8 are termed ''light'' ({{lang|zh|陽}} ''yáng''). Hence, for example, LMC/modern tone class 5 is known in Chinese as the ''yīn qù'' ("dark departing") tone, indicating that it is the ''yīn'' variant of the EMC ''qù'' tone (EMC tone 3).  In order to clarify the relationship between the EMC and LMC tone classes, some authors notate the LMC tone classes as 1a 1b 2a 2b 3a 3b 4a 4b in place of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, where ''a'' and ''b'' correspond directly to Chinese ''yīn'' and ''yáng'', respectively.

==Names==
In Middle Chinese, each of the [[tone name]]s carries the tone it identifies: {{lang|zh|平}} level ꜁''{{IPA|biajŋ}}'', {{lang|zh|上}} rising ꜃''{{IPA|dʑɨaŋ}}'', {{lang|zh|去}} departing ''{{IPA|kʰɨə}}''꜄, and {{lang|zh|入}} entering ''{{IPA|ȵip}}''꜇.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin G. Pulleyblank|Pulleyblank]]'s reconstructions&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some modern Chinese varieties, this is no longer true. This loss of correspondence is most notable in the case of the entering tone, syllables checked in a stop consonant {{IPA|[p̚]}}, {{IPA|[t̚]}}, or {{IPA|[k̚]}} in Middle Chinese, which has been lost from most dialects of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and redistributed among the other tones. 

In modern Chinese varieties, tones that derive from the four Middle Chinese tone classes may be split into two registers, ''dark'' ({{lang|zh|陰}} ''yīn'') and ''light'' ({{lang|zh|陽}} ''yáng'') depending on whether the Middle Chinese [[syllable onset|onset]] was voiceless or voiced, respectively. When all four tone-classes split, eight tones result: ''dark level'' ({{lang|zh|陰平}}), ''light level'' ({{lang|zh|陽平}}), ''dark rising'' ({{lang|zh|陰上}}), ''light rising'' ({{lang|zh|陽上}}), ''dark departing'' ({{lang|zh|陰去}}), ''light departing'' ({{lang|zh|陽去}}), ''dark entering'' ({{lang|zh|陰入}}), and ''light entering'' ({{lang|zh|陽入}}). Sometimes these have been termed ''upper'' and ''lower'' registers respectively, but that may be a misnomer, as in some dialects the dark registers may have the lower tone, and the light register the higher tone. 

Chinese dictionaries mark the tones with diacritical marks at the four corners of a character:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|zh|꜀平}} level, {{lang|zh|꜂上}} rising, {{lang|zh|去꜄}} departing, and {{lang|zh|入꜆}} entering. When ''yin'' and ''yang'' tones are distinguished, these are the diacritics for the ''yin'' (dark) tones; the ''yang'' (light) tones are indicated by underscoring the diacritic: {{lang|zh|꜁平}} light level, {{lang|zh|꜃上}} light rising, {{lang|zh|去꜅}} light departing, {{lang|zh|入꜇}} light entering. These diacritics are also sometimes used when the phonetic tone is unknown, as in the reconstructions of Middle Chinese at the beginning of this section. However, in this article, the circled numbers ①②③④⑤⑥⑦⑧ will be used, as in the table below, with the odd numbers ①③⑤⑦ indicating either 'dark' tones or tones that have not split, and even numbers ②④⑥⑧ indicating 'light' tones. Thus, level tones are numbered ①②, the rising tones ③④, the departing tones ⑤⑥, and the entering (checked) tones ⑦⑧. 

In [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (incl. [[Cantonese]]) the dark entering tone further splits into ''high'' ({{lang|zh|高陰入}}) and ''low'' ({{lang|zh|低陰入}}) registers, depending on the length of the [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]], for a total of nine tone-classes. Some dialects have a complex tone splittings, and the terms ''dark'' and ''light'' are insufficient to cover the possibilities. 

The number of tone-classes is based on Chinese tradition, and is as much [[register (phonology)|register]] as it is actual tone. The entering 'tones', for example, are distinct only because they are checked by a final stop consonant, not because they have a tone contour that contrasts with non-entering tones. In dialects such as [[Shanghainese]], tone classes are numbered even if they are not phonemically distinct.

==Origin==
{{see also|Tonogenesis}}
The tonal aspect of Chinese dialects that is so important today is believed by some linguists to have been absent from [[Old Chinese]], but rather came about in Early [[Middle Chinese]] after the loss of various [[Syllable#Medial_and_final|finals]].&lt;ref name="Sagart"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sagart|first1=Laurent|title=The origin of Chinese tones|work=Proceedings of the Symposium/Cross-Linguistic Studies of Tonal Phenomena/Tonogenesis, Typology and Related Topics|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/96904/filename/TOKYO_tone_published.pdf|publisher=Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, another popular view maintains that "[[Old Chinese]]" near the time 1000BC already had tones, though Proto-Chinese might not have tones.) The four tones of Middle Chinese, {{lang|zh|平}} ''píng'' "level", {{lang|zh|上}} ''shǎng'' "rising", {{lang|zh|去}} ''qù'' "departing", and {{lang|zh|入}} ''rù'' "entering", all evolved from different final losses from Old Chinese. The {{lang|zh|上}}, or "rising" tone, arose from the loss of [[glottal stops]] at the end of words. Support for this can be seen in Buddhist transcriptions of the Han period, where the "rising" tone was often used to note Sanskrit short vowels. This kind of evolution of the missing glottal stop into a rising tone is similar to what happened in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], another tonal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Tsu-Lin|last1=Mei|title=Tones and Prosody in Middle Chinese and The Origin of The Rising Tone|jstor=2718766|publisher=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=30|year=1970|pages=86–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|zh|去}}, or "departing" tone, arose from the loss of [-s] at the end of words. When we look at Chinese loanwords into neighboring East Asian languages, we find support for this theory. For example, in Korean, the word for "comb", ''pis'', is a loan of the Chinese word ''bì'' {{lang|zh|篦}}, which means that when the word "comb" was borrowed into Korean, there was still an [-s] sound at the end of the word that later disappeared from Chinese and gave rise to a departing {{lang|zh|去}} tone. The {{lang|zh|入}}, or "entering" tone consisted of words ending in voiceless stops, [-p], [-t], and [-k]. Finally, the {{lang|zh|平}}, or "level" tone, arose from the lack of sound at the ends of words, where there was neither [-s], a glottal stop, nor [-p], [-t], or [-k].&lt;ref name="Sagart"/&gt;

==Distribution in modern Chinese==
Sample dialects and their realization of tone are given below. 

Different authors typically have different opinions as to the shapes of Chinese tones. Tones typically have a slight purely-phonetic drop at the end in citation form. It is therefore likely that a tone with a drop of one unit (54, say, or 21) is not distinct from a level tone (a 55 or 22); on the other hand, what one author hears as a significant drop (53 or 31) may be perceived by another as a smaller drop so it is often ambiguous whether a transcription like 54 or 21 is a level or contour tone. Similarly, a slight drop before a rise, such as a 214, may be from the speaker approaching the target tone and so may also not be distinctive (from 14).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Chen, 2000.

The satirical use of such a format may date back to the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]]; the group of cognate terms appears to belong to the 20th century.

==History==

In an essay entitled “L’art du grommelot” (Le Figaro, April 20, 2006), French scholar Claude Duneton suggests the word (not the technique) – in its French form, ''grommelot'' – has its origins in the ''commedia dell’arte''-derived Italian theatre of the early part of the sixteenth century. Duneton studied briefly with Léon Chancerel (1886–1965), who was a major figure in this branch of theatre. Chancerel in fact uses the word in his book, ''Le théâtre et la jeunesse'' (Paris: Bourrellier 1946:47). Others, such as theatre scholar John Rudlin in ''Commedia dell'arte: An Actor's Handbook'' (London: Routledge 1994:60), suggest this origin as well.

While the historical origin of the term is unclear, it has been particularly popularized by the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-winning Italian [[playwright]] [[Dario Fo]]. His 1969 show ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' ("''Comic Mystery Play''") was a satirical touring performance involving sketches based on mediaeval sources, told in Fo's own grammelots constructed from archaic [[Po Valley]] dialects and [[phoneme]]s from modern languages (he has coined separate Italian, French and American grammelots). In his Nobel lecture, Fo referred to the 16th-century Italian playwright [[Angelo Beolco|Ruzzante]]'s invention of a similar language based on Italian dialects, Latin, Spanish, German and onomatopoeic sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/fo-lecture.html|title=Dario Fo - Nobel Lecture: Against Jesters Who Defame and Insult|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable modern Italian exponent is the [[Milan]] actor/writer [[Gianni Ferrario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammelot.com/eng_eng/ Grammelot.com], Gianni Ferrario&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voice actor]] [[Carlo Bonomi]], also from Milan, used grammelot to voice [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]]'s cartoon [[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]] and many years later, outside of Italy, [[Otmar Gutmann]]'s [[Pingu]]. Mainstream [[comedian|comics]] have also used Grammelot-like language: for instance, [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]]. The Canadian [[circus]] and entertainment troupe [[Cirque du Soleil]] uses in its routines similar forms of language; journalists often term them "Cirquish",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/arts/theater-cirque-du-soleil-aiming-too-high.html Cirque Du Soleil: Aiming Too High?], Polly Shulman, Teatroenmiami.com&lt;/ref&gt; but Cirque du Soleil's own staff use the word "Grommelot".&lt;ref&gt;Section 2, question 13: http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/fr/jobs/casting/faq.aspx{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in 1904, at the call of noted freedom fighter, educationist and theosophist [[Annie Besant]] by a group of Delhi [[theosophists]], led by Lala Jugal Kishore, in Chhipiwara, [[Old Delhi]]. [[Intermediate school]] was added in 1924 and the Indraprastha College for Women, came into being, with Leonora Gmeiner (from Kapunda, [[South Australia]]) as its first principal.&lt;ref&gt;''Delhi, the emperor's city: rediscovering Chandni Chowk and its environs'', by Vijay Goel.

Soon the [[University of Delhi]], which itself was founded in 1922, recognised it as a constituent college. Degree courses were introduced in 1930s and in 1938, the University recognised I.P. College as a degree college. After its existence in Chhipiwara during its early years, the college moved to Chandrawali Bhawan, [[Civil Lines]]. It moved again to Alipur House at Alipur Road (now Sham Nath Road), the former office of the commander-in-chief in 1938, near [[Kashmiri Gate (Delhi)|Kashmiri Gate]], where it is today. The building has become a heritage property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.delhilive.com/indraprastha-college-for-women |title=Indraprastha College for Women |access-date=7 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610161313/http://www.delhilive.com/indraprastha-college-for-women |archive-date=10 June 2008 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Kalavati Gupta Hostel (named after a former principal) was established.{{fact|date=June 2018}} It houses 200 students.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

On 3 July 1984, Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the college were held&lt;ref&gt;''Women in India &amp; Japan: A Comparison'', by Ramesh Madan. Published by Manak Publications, 2004. {{ISBN|81-7827-099-4}}. ''Page 123''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a hostel to accommodate 200 students was added on the {{convert|1.53|acre|m2|adj=on}} college premises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/06/03/stories/2009060360870300.htm I P College gets a second hostel], ''[[The Hindu]]'', 3 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CICLing''' (International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing; before 2017 known under the name International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics) is an annual [[Meeting|conference]] on [[computational linguistics]] (CL) and [[natural language processing]] (NLP).  The first CICLing conference was held in 2000 in [[Mexico City]]. The conference is attended by one to two hundred of NLP and CL researchers and students every year. As of 2017, it is ranked within top 20 sources (conferences and journals) on computational linguistics by [[Google Scholar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=eng_computationallinguistics Google Scholar computational linguistics category]&lt;/ref&gt; Past CICLing conferences have been held in Mexico, Korea, Israel, Romania, Japan, India, Greece, Nepal, Egypt, Turkey, and Hungary; the 2018 event will be held in Vietnam.

== Overview ==
CICLing is a series of annual international conferences devoted to [[computational linguistics]] (CL), [[natural language processing]] (NLP), [[human language technologies]] (HLT), natural-language [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI), as well as [[speech processing]] and [[speech recognition]] (SR).

Their topics of interest include, but are not limited to: [[text processing]], [[computational morphology]], [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]], [[stemming]], [[syntactic analysis]], [[parsing]] and [[shallow parsing]], [[chunking (computational linguistics)|chunking]], recognizing [[textual entailment]], [[ambiguity resolution]], [[Semantic analysis (machine learning)|semantic analysis]], [[pragmatics]], [[lexicon]], [[lexical resources]], [[dictionary|dictionaries]] and [[machine-readable dictionary|machine-readable dictionaries]] (MRD), [[grammar]], [[anaphora resolution]], [[word sense disambiguation]] (WSD), [[machine translation]] (MT), [[information retrieval]] (IR), [[information extraction]] (IE), [[document handling]], [[document classification]] and [[text classification]], [[text summarization]], [[text mining]] (TM), [[opinion mining]], [[sentiment analysis]], [[plagiarism detection]], and [[spell checking]] ([[spell checking|spelling]]).

CICLing series was founded in 2000 by [[Alexander Gelbukh]].&lt;ref name="CICLing2000" /&gt;
The acronym "CICLing" refers to "'''C'''onference on '''I'''ntelligent text processing and '''C'''omputational '''Ling'''uistics", the name used before 2017.&lt;ref name="CICLing2000" /&gt;

Almost all CICLing events have been endorsed by the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]].

Unlike some other conferences on computational linguistics and natural language processing, such as those run by the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]], CICLing does not release its main proceedings as [[Open Access]], publishing them instead with [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]; however, most of its complementary proceedings, published as special issues of journals, are released as Open Access; in addition, Springer allows the authors to make their papers available via their own webpages.

'''James Samuel Thomas''' (April 8, 1919 – October 10, 2010&lt;ref&gt;The Times and Democrat, 2010-10-15. [http://www.thetandd.com/news/local/article_006f53da-d7d6-11df-9521-001cc4c03286.html "A Pioneer, a Visionary": United Methodist Bishop Thomas leaves extraordinary legacy]. Retrieved 2010-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] [[bishop]] in [[The Methodist Church (USA)|The Methodist Church]] (now The [[United Methodist Church]]). When elected in 1964, he was one of the youngest Methodist bishops.  Gerald Kennedy was age 40 when he was elected in the mid-1940s.

His first appointment as Bishop was in [[Iowa]], where he served from 1964 to 1976, becoming the first black bishop of the North Central Jurisdiction of The Methodist Church.  He last served as the [[Resident Bishop]] of the [[East Ohio Conference]] of The [[United Methodist Church]] from 1976 until 1988, retiring in 1988.

In 2002, the [[Iowa General Assembly|Iowa Senate]] passed a resolution honoring Bishop Thomas.  In its citation, the Senate extended 
:"its thanks and congratulations to Bishop James S. Thomas and his family for their service to The United Methodist Church and to the State of Iowa, and acknowledges the work of Bishop James S. Thomas for the advancement of [[civil rights]] in Iowa and in the  nation."
The resolution was presented to Bishop Thomas on his birthday in the same year.&lt;ref name="iowasenate"&gt;[http://www.legis.state.ia.us/GA/79GA/Legislation/SR/00100/SR00136/Current.html Iowa Senate Resolution S.R. 136 of 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6363">'''Kalbelia''' or '''Kabeliya''' is one of the most sensuous dance forms of [[Rajasthan]], performed by a tribe of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianfolkdances.com/kalbelia-folk-dances-of-rajasthan.html |title=Kalbelia Folk Dances of Rajasthan }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are famous for their dance which is an integral part of their culture. Both men and women in the tribe participate in this activity to celebrate joyful occasionally

==Kalbelia tribe==
[[File:Rajasthan folk dance.jpg|thumb|A Rajasthani folk dance, Kalbelia]]
The Kalbelias were known for their frequent movement from one place to another in ancient times. Their traditional occupation is catching snakes and trading [[snake venom]]. Hence, the dance movements and the costumes of their community bear a resemblance to that of the serpents. They are also known as Sapera, Jogira or yogi. They trace their ancestry from Kanlipar, the 12th disciple of Guru [[Gorakshanath|Gorakhnath]]. The largest number of the  population of Kalbelias is in [[Pali district]], then [[Ajmer]], [[Chittorgarh]] and [[Udaipur district]]. They live a [[nomadic]] life and belong to the [[scheduled tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=People of India Vol. XXXVIII|author1=Kumar Suresh Singh |author2=B. K. Lavania |author3=D. K. Samanta |author4=S. K. Mandal |author5=N. N. Vyas |author6=Anthropological Survey of India |article=Suthar|pages=1012|publisher=Popular Prakashan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Snake Charmers: The Jogi Nath Kalbelias of Rajastan|author=Miriam Robertson|pages=323|publisher=Illustrated Book Publishers|year=1998|ISBN=81-85683-29-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Kalbelia men carried cobras in [[Arundo|cane]] baskets from door to door in villages while their women sang and danced and begged for alms. They revere the [[cobra]] and advocate non-killing of the reptile. In the villages, if a snake inadvertently entered a home, then a Kalbelia would be summoned to catch the serpent and to take it away without killing it. Kalbelias have traditionally been a fringe group in society living in spaces outside the village where they reside in makeshift camps called ''deras''. The Kalbelias move their ''deras'' from one place to another in a circuitous route repeated over time. Over the generations, the Kalbelias acquired a unique understanding of the local flora and fauna, and are aware of [[herbal remedies]] for various diseases which is an alternative source of income for them.

Since the enactment of the [[Wildlife Act of 1972]], the Kalbelias have been pushed out of their traditional profession of 
snake handling. Today, performing arts are a major source of income for them and these have received widespread recognition within and outside India. However, performance opportunities are sporadic and since the whole community is not involved in it on a regular basis, many members of the community work in the fields, or graze cattle to sustain themselves.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

==Kalbeliya Dance==
The Kalbelia dance, performed to celebrate any joyful moment in the community, is an integral part of Kalbelia culture. Their dances and songs are a matter of pride and a marker of identity for the Kalbelias and they represent the creative adaptation of this community of snake charmers to changing socioeconomic conditions and their own role in rural [[Rajasthani people|Rajasthani]] society.

The dancers are women in flowing black skirts who dance and swirl, replicating the movements of a serpent. The upper body cloth is called ''Angrakhi'' and a piece of cloth worn on head known as ''Odhani'' similarly the lower body cloth is called ''Lengha''. All these cloths are mixed in red and black hues and embroidered in such a way that when these dancers perform these clothes represent a combination of colours soothing to eyes as well as to the atmosphere.

The male participants take care of the musical part of the dance. They use the different instruments such as the [[pungi]], a woodwind instrument traditionally played to capture snakes, the [[daf|dufli]], [[pungi|been]], the [[khanjari]] - a percussion instrument, [[morsing|morchang]], ''khuralio'' and the [[dholak]] to create the rhythm on which the dancers perform. The dancers are tattooed in traditional designs and wear jewelry and garments richly embroidered with small mirrors and silver thread. As the performance progresses, the rhythm becomes faster and faster and so does the dance.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00340&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalbelia songs are based on stories taken from folklore and mythology and special dances are performed during [[Holi]]. The Kalbelia have a reputation for composing lyrics spontaneously and improvising songs during performances. These songs and dances are part of an oral tradition that is handed down generations and for which there are neither texts nor training manuals. In 2010, the Kalbelia folk songs and dances of [[Rajasthan]] were declared a part of its [[Intangible Heritage List]] by the [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

'''Language acquisition by deaf children''' parallels the development of any children acquiring spoken language as long as there is full access to language from birth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Despite limited access to spoken language, communication and language exposure are fundamental to deaf infants' general cognitive development and their engagement with their surroundings. While a growing number of deaf children in the developed world receive hearing aids and/or cochlear implants to support spoken language acquisition&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradham|first1=Tamala|last2=Jones|first2=Julibeth|title=Cochlear implant candidacy in the United States: Prevalence in children 12 months to 6 years of age|journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology|date=July 2008|volume=72|issue=7|pages=1023–1028|doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2008.03.005|pmid=18433884|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587608001274|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; there are Deaf communities around the world that use signed languages.

== Early stages (birth to 12 months) ==
The general stages of [[language acquisition]] are the same whether the language is spoken or signed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sign language : An international handbook|last=Pfau|first=Roland|last2=Steinbach|first2=Markus|last3=Woll|first3=Bencie|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|others=|year=2012|isbn=9783110204216|location=Berlin|pages=647|oclc=812574063}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are certain unique features of sign language acquisition due to the visual/manual [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]] and these differences can help to distinguish between universal aspects of language acquisition and aspects that may be affected by early experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The very earliest linguistic tasks facing newborns are perceptual.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Babies need to determine what basic linguistic elements are used in their native language to create words (their [[Phonetics|phonetic]] inventory).

== Methods ==
=== Pedagogy ===

Language acquisition strategies for signing deaf children are different than those appropriate for hearing children, or for deaf children who successfully use hearing aids and/or cochlear implants. For parents with deaf children who do not use amplification (hearing aids or cochlear implants), [[joint attention]] (an important component to language development) can be problematic. Hearing children can watch their environment and listen to an adult comment on it. However, children who do not hear have to switch their visual attention back and forth between stimuli. 

Strategies for nonverbal communication include using facial expressions and body language to show emotion and reinforce the child's attention to their caregiver. To attract and direct a deaf child's attention, caregivers can break his line of gaze using hand and body movements, touch, and pointing to allow language input. In order to make language salient,{{clarify|reason=salient language?|date=February 2018}} parents should use short, simple sentences so that the child's attention doesn’t have to be divided for too long. Finally, to reduce the need for divided attention, a caregiver can position themselves and objects within the child's visual field so that language and the object can be seen at the same time.

=== Speech and oral methods ===

For deaf children who use listening and spoken language as their primary mode of communication, their families will often participate in [[Auditory-verbal therapy]], a means of enhancing the innate language and listening skills of deaf children. Most children who receive appropriate amplification before the age of 18 months and receive appropriate auditory-verbal instruction will follow language-learning trajectories of their peers who have typical hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Niparko |first1=John |author1link=John Niparko |last2=Tobey |first2=Emily |last3=Thal |first3=Donna |title=Spoken Language Development in Children Following Cochlear Implantation |journal=JAMA |date=April 21, 2010 |volume=303 |issue=15 |pages=1498–1506 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.451|pmid=20407059 |pmc=3073449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signing and manual methods ===

==== ASL (American sign language) ====

[[ASL]] employs signs made by moving one's hands along with one's facial expressions and body language. Some studies indicate that if a deaf child learns sign language, he or she will be less likely to learn spoken languages because they will lose motivation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} However, Humphries insists that there is no evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Tom|last2=Kushalnagar|first2=Poorna|last3=Mathur|first3=Gaurav|last4=Napoli|first4=Donna Jo|last5=Padden|first5=Carol|last6=Rathmann|first6=Christian|last7=Smith|first7=Scott R.|date=2012-01-01|title=Language acquisition for deaf children: Reducing the harms of zero tolerance to the use of alternative approaches|journal=Harm Reduction Journal|volume=9|pages=16|doi=10.1186/1477-7517-9-16|issn=1477-7517|pmc=3384464|pmid=22472091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manually coded English ====

[[Manually coded English]] is any one of a number of different representations of the English language that uses manual signs to encode English words visually. Although MCE uses signs, it is not a language like ASL; it is an [[encoding]] of English that uses hand gestures to make English visible in a visual mode. Most types of MCE use signs borrowed or adapted from American Sign Language, but use English sentence order and grammatical construction.

Numerous systems of manually encoded English have been proposed and used with greater or lesser success. 
Methods such as [[Signed English]], [[Signing Exact English]],&lt;ref name="Kong-2008"&gt;Kong, W. W., &amp; Ranganath, S. (2008). Signing exact english (see): Modeling and recognition. Pattern Recognition, 41(5), 1638-1652.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistics of Visual English]], and others use signs borrowed from ASL along with various grammatical marker signs, to indicate whole words, or meaning-bearing [[morphemes]] like ''-ed'' or ''-ing''.

Because MCE systems are encodings of English which follow English word order and sentence structure, it's possible to sign MCE and speak English at the same time.  This is a technique that is used in order to teach deaf children the structure of the English language not only through the sound and lip-reading patterns of spoken English, but also through manual patterns of signed English. Because of the close connection between the two, it is easier for hearing people to learn MCE than ASL.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==== Cued speech ====

[[Cued Speech]] is a hybrid, oral/manual system of communication used by some deaf or hard-of-hearing people. It is a technique that uses handshapes near the mouth ("cues") to represent phonemes that can be challenging for some deaf or hard-of-hearing people to distinguish from one another through speechreading ("lipreading") alone. It is designed to help receptive communicators to observe and fully understand the speaker.

Cued speech is not a signed language, and it does not have any signs in common with ASL. It is a kind of augmented speechreading, making speechreading much more accurate and accessible to deaf people. The handshapes by themselves have no meaning; they only have meaning as a cue in combination with a mouth shape, so that the mouth shape 'two lips together' plus one handshape might mean an 'M' sound, the same shape with a different cue might represent a 'B' sound, and with a third cue might represent a 'P' sound.

Some research shows a link between lack of phonological awareness and reading disorders, and indicate that teaching cued speech may be an aid to phonological awareness and literacy.&lt;ref name=Ostrander-1998&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |dead-url=yes |title=The Relationship Between Phonological Coding And Reading Achievement In Deaf Children: Is Cued Speech A Special Case? |first1=Carolyn |last1=Ostrander |date=1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113162758/web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fingerspelling ====

Another manual encoding system used by the deaf and which has been around for more than two centuries is [[fingerspelling]]. Fingerspelling is a system that encodes letters and not words or morphemes, so is not a manual encoding of English, but rather an encoding of the alphabet. As such, it is a method of spelling out words one letter at a time using 26 different handshapes. In the United States and many other countries, the letters are indicated on one hand&lt;ref&gt;Carmel, Simon (1982). ''International hand alphabet charts.'' [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)]]; 2nd edition. (June 1982). {{ISBN|0-9600886-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and go back to the deaf school of the [[Abbe de l'Epee]] in Paris.  Since fingerspelling is connected to the alphabet and not to entire words, it can be used to spell out words in any language that uses the same alphabet; so it is not tied to any one language in particular, and to that extent, it is analogous to other letter-encodings, such as [[Morse code]], or [[Semaphore]].  The [[Rochester Method]] relies heavily on fingerspelling, but it is slow and has mostly fallen out of favor.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Hybrid methods ===

Hybrid methods use a mixture of aural/oral methods as well as some visible indicators such as hand shapes in order to communicate in the standard spoken language by making parts of it visible to those with hearing loss.{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

=== Literacy ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

==== Reading ====

According to Goldin-Meadow, reading requires two essential abilities: familiarity with a language and understanding the mapping between that language and the written word. However, reading is possible if deaf children learn ASL. Once they have acquired ASL, deaf children learn how to map between sign language and print so that they can learn English. Several techniques are used to help bridge the gap between ASL and spoken language or the "translation process" such as sandwiching and chaining.

Sandwiching consists of alternating between saying the word and signing it. Chaining consists of finger spelling a word, pointing to the spoken language version of the word and using pictorial support. Although chaining is not widely used, it creates an understanding between the visual spelling of a word and the sign language spelling of the word. This helps the child become bilingual in both ASL and spoken language.

The deaf child's social context is crucial for nurturing his or her capacity to read. Research shows that deaf children born to deaf parents are usually better readers than deaf children born to hearing parents.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is because deaf parents provide a strong social and emotional network and may immediately have access to the necessary resources for their child. Deaf parents already anticipate the needs of their child, having been through the same experience, as opposed to a hearing parent.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Cochlear implants==
A [[cochlear implant]] is placed surgically inside the cochlea, which is the part of the inner ear that converts sound to neural signals. There is much debate regarding the linguistic conditions under which deaf children acquire spoken language via cochlear implantation. Some studies have concluded that long-term use of sign language impedes the development of spoken language and reading ability in deaf and hard of hearing children, and that using sign language is not at all advantageous, and can be detrimental to language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geers|first=A.

===Ethics and language acquisition===

Cochlear implants have been the subject of a heated debate between those that believe deaf children should receive the implants and those that do not. Members of the Deaf Community believe this is an important ethical problem. They strongly advocate that sign language is their first or native language just as any other spoken language is for a hearing person. They do not see deafness as a deficiency in any way, but rather a normal human trait amongst a variety of different ones. One issue on the ethical perspective of implantation is the possible side effects that may present themselves after surgery (the body may physically reject the implant; for some reason, there may not be any benefit, or very little gained; the internal component may need to be replaced causing the need for another surgery), even in some cases lessening listening capabilities, losing residual hearing or hearing sounds differently. While the surgery presents one positive solution, these side effects are not often taken into account but are significant and need to be afforded more attention. However, complications from cochlear implant surgery is a rare event, with some centers showing less than a three percent failure rate.{{cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/239926.php|title=Cochlear Implant Failure Rate Generally Low}}

== Relationship between language acquisition and other domains of development ==

=== Cognitive development ===
Early exposure to language facilitates language acquisition, regardless of whether or not that exposure is native or non-native, as well as many other domains of development, such as cognitive development, including executive functioning skills. Executive functioning skills are extremely important, as these are the skills that guide learning and behavior&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Matthew L.|last2=Eigsti|first2=Inge-Marie|last3=Bortfeld|first3=Heather|last4=Lillo-Martin|first4=Diane|date=2016-09-13|title=Auditory Deprivation Does Not Impair Executive Function, But Language Deprivation Might: Evidence From a Parent-Report Measure in Deaf Native Signing Children|url=https://academic.oup.com/jdsde/article/22/1/9/2744719|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=9–21|doi=10.1093/deafed/enw054|pmid=27624307|pmc=5189172|issn=1081-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These skills include self-regulation, inhibition, emotional control, working memory, and planning and organization, which contribute to overall social, emotional and academic development for children. Early access to a language, such as sign language, from birth supports the development of these cognitive skills and abilities in Deaf and hard of hearing children, and supports their development in this area&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-12-01|title=Age constraints on first versus second language acquisition: Evidence for linguistic plasticity and epigenesis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X03001378|journal=Brain and Language|language=en|volume=87|issue=3|pages=369–384|doi=10.1016/S0093-934X(03)00137-8|issn=0093-934X|last1=Mayberry|first1=Rachel I.|last2=Lock|first2=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, late exposure to language and delayed language acquisition can inhibit or delay the cognitive development of deaf and hard of hearing children, and impact these skills. This late exposure to language, or lack thereof, can be defined as language deprivation (see [[Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children]]). This experience is the result of a lack of exposure to natural human language, whether that be spoken or signed language, during the critical language period&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. Approximately 90% of Deaf children are born to hearing parents, and 95% of those Deaf children experience language deprivation to some degree&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. Language Deprivation has been found to impair deaf children’s cognitive development, specifically their executive functioning skills, and working memory, causing deficits in critical executive functioning skills and overall cognitive development.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Chloë|last2=Jones|first2=Anna|last3=Denmark|first3=Tanya|last4=Mason|first4=Kathryn|last5=Atkinson|first5=Joanna|last6=Botting|first6=Nicola|last7=Morgan|first7=Gary|date=2015|title=Deaf children's non-verbal working memory is impacted by their language experience|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=6|pages=527|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00527|pmid=25999875|pmc=4419661|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is not deafness that causes these deficits, but late language acquisition that influences the cognitive development and abilities of deaf people.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Social-emotional development ===
&lt;p&gt;Having an acquired language means an individual has had full access to at least one spoken or signed language.Typically, if a person has had this full access to language and has been able to acquire it, then being able to enter into a realm of social and emotional becomes plausible. Being able to communicate using is critical for those still developing their social skills&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/140.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAZ4wggGaBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGLMIIBhwIBADCCAYAGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMFh5pQJvI5m7dR_GxAgEQgIIBUQWnPtWmmWaPBeEiz0cUJNT8WZgv874iQ6cl-7oN1u8Ktoi4ri0FwtVMhiNbIFiEu7aR1pI_jcWOV6ZYOY55gnxEP0sk3npoEW_faTEwZtE3Gjsc9rHx5OWwUf6rjKwY7eZ4CeyyfNus6W-WQm93NtINR4pEV8GRPV3A3h2yfj0x-ifP4_PSjXOJ6Z_f-YOgP2wGMSZMeC-DqQ8msacRllYRbbF0sVeDJjg-Owxo-r2DdGtEc3UTPRAEftiOi1Psp-bpIcF-tlfyUtXOnUkOKH6YiIh2ba9Sly2SSmfCYal2oUZsVCpZ-qE67_3uUN5CrPmso9eCCCDKJqol9LvkU_9P_Lqib3R8sAErjQoetJk70-HfjrgDKd4idBF3NvrgTI1y6udZw187mJin7tRM4OJSMmF85OqfvBACkU179KmsMSX48QVP51b5GszvMPSOUX8|title=Parental Involvement in Deaf Children's Education Programs as a Predictor of Child's Language, Early Reading, and Social- Emotional Development|last=Calderon|first=Rosemary|date=2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also evidence to suggest that language acquisition can play a critical role in developing [[Theory of mind|Theory of Mind]], or developing the understanding of false beliefs in language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schick|first=Brenda|last2=de Villiers|first2=Peter|last3=de Villiers|first3=Jill|last4=Hoffmeister|first4=Robert|date=2007-03|title=Language and Theory of Mind: A Study of Deaf Children|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=78|issue=2|pages=376–396|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01004.x|pmid=17381779|issn=0009-3920|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.8685}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For children who have been deprived of this access or have not yet fully acquired a language, social development can be hindered, which in turn can affect one’s emotional development as well.&lt;/p&gt;The lack of socialization can significantly impact a child’s emotional well-being. A child’s first experience with social communication typically begins at home, but deaf and hard of hearing children in particular who are born to hearing parents tend to struggle with this interaction, due to the fact that they are a “minority in their own family"&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ME5q-42NojgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=social+emotional+development+%22deaf+children%22,+Moores,+2001#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20emotional%20development%20%22deaf%20children%22,%20Moores,%202001&amp;f=false|title=Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education|last=NEWSOM|first=CAROL|last2=Newsom|first2=Professor of Old Testament Carol A.|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195149975|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Parents who have a Deaf child typically do not know a signed language, the logistical problem can become how to give that child a full language. If deaf and hard of hearing children are not developing their social skills at home, by the time they enter school, they can be behind in this development. All of this can lead to struggles with proper emotional development. It can be hard on a child who was not given a language early to try and express their emotions appropriately. The problem is not with the deaf child, but instead, not giving a deaf or hard of hearing child the necessary language access from birth that other children receive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ME5q-42NojgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=emotional+deaf+children+#v=onepage&amp;q=emotional%20deaf%20children&amp;f=false|title=Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education|last=NEWSOM|first=CAROL|last2=Newsom|first2=Professor of Old Testament Carol A.|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195149975|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are theories to suggest that language acquisition is a predictor of how a child can develop Theory of Mind and without a full language, this skill becomes null. Theory of Mind can be an indicator of social and cognitive development. Without language acquisition, Deaf children can become behind in Theory of Mind and the skills that coincide, which can lead to further social and emotional delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schick|first=Brenda|last2=de Villiers|first2=Peter|last3=de Villiers|first3=Jill|last4=Hoffmeister|first4=Robert|date=2007-03|title=Language and Theory of Mind: A Study of Deaf Children|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=78|issue=2|pages=376–396|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01004.x|pmid=17381779|issn=0009-3920|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.8685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic development ===
Second language acquisition is also highly affected by early language exposure&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kroll et al.|date=2015|title=Bilingualism, Mind, and Brain|url=|journal=Annual Review of Linguistics|volume=1|pages=377–394|via=Annual Reviews|pmid=28642932|pmc=5478196|doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-124937}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More exposure in an accessible language leads to better performance in the second language upon entering school&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Providing deaf and hard of hearing children with the most language exposure possible from birth promotes both first and second language acquisition. This means giving students the opportunity to develop language at home and in social environments early on supports the child's language acquisition in American Sign Language as well as printed English&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;. There is extensive research regarding the correlation between proficiency in ASL and proficiency in English literacy skills&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=Jim|date=2006|title=The Relationship between American Sign Language Proficiency and English Academic Development: A Review of the Research|url=|journal=Research Gate|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{Verify source|date=May 2018}}. Deaf students with higher ASL proficiency tend to have higher English reading and writing scores&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;. There is also research to support that the development of a second language also improves proficiency in the student's first language&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to Hrastinski &amp; [[Ronnie Wilbur|Wilbur]] (2016), American Sign Language proficiency is the single most contributing factor to Deaf student’s academic achievement, particularly in reading literacy and math.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/env072.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAaMwggGfBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGQMIIBjAIBADCCAYUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMS3camrsCwizIKhRSAgEQgIIBVpFuCm23QV_wHVAF3qVgbdg62eoEq1JZsJzomxbO32RncjGo5NWdeLlsU9FuynA2gSKh0AmiGnxZbZZTlHY_7pXQ-hiftLjL9eDTOfd3ZjUbfJmfcS15UDVJ1MTCiBrZukQfXeLsILvWEB4vfub0AoAbauMv9_DJI_g_gwToj0mPihM_xeoxSZ8-ol7ZoHV8nHQ_2B88eVr-zbdCzQvcPSfuAFVi-6a1o_G0R1AFAXIdoCpkobHaTGZNZpWS2LYyjZu6ROohCwka4zTyQm3bZUH4cavd5Eex0uGq67odjR3Q3wWsUB2KnmIfYC0ZBBRhBZl0UDp7glaYAeXhKXQVAm4HsR5VdFOAVUCKF-c9zY_wLIX07ANiGjyQJRBbDYl8gs0Bau5w4oD77V_WYsbZZcbJedA2IjGAVtcZUmBJioWxxHKSeEbIZAdBpwfmLGUkgl-GTlbmUw|title=Academic Achievement of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Students in an ASL/English Bilingual Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:President Barack Obama with David Letterman 09-21-09.jpg|thumb|Late-night talk shows often feature guest interviews. Here, [[Barack Obama]] is interviewed by [[David Letterman]].]]

A '''late-night talk show''' is a genre of [[talk show]] popular in the United States, where the format originated. It is generally structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The [[Late night television|late-night]] talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by [[Johnny Carson]] with ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on [[NBC]]. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a [[house band]] which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during [[Television advertisement|commercial breaks]] and occasionally will back up a guest artist.

Late-night talk shows are a popular format in the United States, but are not as prominent in other parts of the world. Shows that loosely resemble the format air in other countries, but generally air weekly as opposed to the nightly airings of those in the United States. They also generally air in time slots considered to be [[prime time]] in the United States.

== History ==

=== United States ===
{{main|List of late-night American network TV programs}}

==== 1940s–1960s ====
Late-night talk shows had their genesis in early variety shows, a format that migrated to television from radio, where it had been the dominant form of light entertainment during most of the [[old-time radio]] era. ''[[The Pepsodent Show]]'', which opened each weekly episode with host [[Bob Hope]]'s rapid-fire, topical and often political [[observational comedy]], was a particularly important predecessor to the late-night format.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/bob-hope-film/9661/ This Is Bob Hope…]" ''[[American Masters]]'' (November 13, 2017). Retrieved November 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early television variety shows included ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (originally known as ''Toast of the Town''), which aired on [[CBS]] Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971 and was hosted by [[Ed Sullivan]], and ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' with [[Milton Berle]], which aired on NBC from 1948 to 1956. These shows aired once a week in evening time slots that would come to be known as [[prime time]].

The first show to air in a late night time slot itself, ''[[Broadway Open House]]'', aired on NBC in 1950 and ended a year later after host [[Jerry Lester]] left the show, infuriated at being upstaged by his sidekick [[Dagmar (American actress)|Virginia "Dagmar" Lewis]]. (As it was, there were also not yet enough television sets in the United States to make television broadcasting in late-night viable; Lester himself was a last-minute replacement host for up-and-coming 26-year-old comic [[Don Hornsby]], who caught polio and died less than a week before the show began.)

The first version of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]'', debuted in 1954 on [[NBC]]. The show created many modern talk show staples including an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, comedy bits, and musical performances. By this point, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] had lifted a freeze on new television stations, which allowed new stations to pop up across the country, and television adoption soon grew exponentially. As a result, unlike ''Broadway Open House'', ''Tonight'' proved to be a resounding success.

The success of the show led Allen to get another show, entitled ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', which would compete with ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on Sunday nights. Meanwhile, hosting duties of ''The Tonight Show'' were split between Allen and [[Ernie Kovacs]]; Kovacs had defected to NBC from his own late-night show on the then-crumbling [[DuMont Television Network]]. Both Allen and Kovacs departed from ''Tonight'' in 1957 in order to focus on Allen's Sunday night show. After the two left, the format changed similar to that of ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' and was renamed ''Tonight! America After Dark'' and was hosted first by [[Jack Lescoulie]] and then by Al Collins while interviews were performed by [[Hy Gardner]], and a [[house band]] led by [[Lou Stein]]. The show was not popular leading to many NBC affiliates dropping the show. The show returned to the original format that year and was renamed ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]'', with [[Jack Paar]] assuming hosting duties.

The even greater success of the show during Paar's hosting resulted in many NBC affiliates re-airing the show. He was noted for his conversational style, relatively highbrow interview guests, feuds with other media personalities (his feuds with print journalists Ed Sullivan and [[Walter Winchell]] marked a power shift from print to television; Winchell's career never recovered from the damage), and mercurial personality; Paar famously quit the show in 1960 in a dispute over a censored joke but was allowed to come back a month later. Paar permanently left the show in 1962, citing the reason that he could not handle the work load of ''The Tonight Show'' (at the time, the show ran 105 minutes a day, five days a week), and he moved to his own weekly prime-time show, which would run until 1965.

After Paar's departure, hosting duties were filled by [[Groucho Marx]], [[Mort Sahl]] and many others. Johnny Carson took over as host of ''The Tonight Show'' in 1962 and the show was renamed ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Carson streamlined the format of the show, focusing more on entertainment personalities, tweaking the monologue to include more shorter jokes, and emphasizing sketch comedy. [[Ed McMahon]] served as Carson's announcer while from 1962 to 1966 the band was led by [[Skitch Henderson]], who hired, among others, [[Doc Severinsen]]. When Henderson left, Milton DeLugg took over. Severinsen took over in 1967, and served as bandleader with the [[The Tonight Show Band|NBC Orchestra]]. The show originated from [[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]] in New York City but, as part of Carson's shifting the show toward a more entertainment-oriented program, moved to [[Burbank, California]] in 1972.

NBC's two other rivals during the early television era, [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], did not attempt any major forays into late-night television until the 1960s. ABC's first effort at late-night TV was hosted by [[Les Crane]], which pioneered the controversial [[tabloid talk show]] format that would not become popular until two decades later. Crane's show lasted only six months. Shorter still was ''[[The Las Vegas Show]]'', a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]-based late-night show hosted by [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill Dana]] that was the only offering of the [[United Network]] that ever made it to air (because that network only had a handful of affiliates, it also syndicated to CBS, ABC and independent stations); it, along with the network, only lasted five weeks in summer 1967. Steve Allen himself returned to late-night in syndication twice in this time frame, first with a show that ran from 1962 to 1964 and then with a series that ran from 1968 to 1971. ABC added the ''[[Joey Bishop]]'' Show to its late night lineup in 1967, employing a talk show format, in an attempt to rival the Tonight Show, which lasted until 1969. CBS went without late-night TV until 1969, when it acquired ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' from syndication; Griffin returned to syndication in 1972, and CBS would not air any further late-night talk shows until 1989, instead opting for reruns, lifestyle programs and imported Canadian dramas in the time slot. By the 1960s, NBC had already cornered the market for late-night television viewing and would go on to dominate the ratings for several decades.

==== 1970s–1980s ====
A [[Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act|nationwide prohibition]] on [[tobacco advertising]] that took effect in 1971 prompted NBC to extend its broadcast day by an additional hour with programming it hoped would recuperate some of that lost revenue.&lt;ref name="Tom Snyder on Later, 1994"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmyB934SsDI Tom Snyder on ''Later'', 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, NBC launched two new programs: a concert series ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' that aired Friday nights, and a low-cost talk show, ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]'' hosted by [[Tom Snyder]], that aired Mondays through Thursdays. Both shows aired immediately following Carson's ''Tonight Show'' at 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]. ''Tomorrow'' was different from ''The Tonight Show''. For instance, the show featured no studio audience, while Snyder would conduct one-on-one interviews (Snyder's guest list was often more eclectic and would sometimes include the intellectuals that Carson had long since abandoned) with a cigarette in hand.  Carson's new contract in 1980 allowed him to cut the length of his show from 90 minutes to 60 minutes, and for a short time, ''Tomorrow'' was moved to an earlier timeslot. NBC felt that Snyder's more conversational style would not bring in enough viewership in the earlier time slot, forcibly changed the show's format to resemble Carson's, and added gossip reporter [[Rona Barrett]] as a co-host. The two did not get along and had an acrimonious relationship on and off the air. The agreement gave Carson's production company ownership of the timeslot following ''Tonight'', which, a year later, Carson Productions and NBC used to create ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. When NBC offered Snyder the time slot after Letterman, he refused it, having always been resentful of the forced change in format, and ''[[NBC News Overnight]]'', a newscast, took the slot instead.

During his tenure as host of ''The Tonight Show'', Carson became known as ''The King of Late Night''. While numerous hosts ([[Merv Griffin]] and [[Dick Cavett]] being the best-known) attempted to compete with Carson, none was ever successful in drawing more viewers than Carson did on ''Tonight'', not even ABC's short-lived revival of Paar's show in 1973 using the name ''Jack Paar Tonite''.  Much like Paar, Carson became tired of fulfilling the workload of 525 minutes a week, so as local newscasts expanded, ''The Tonight Show'' was shortened to 90 minutes and again to 60 minutes in 1980 with 15 weeks of vacation a year.  Because of a lack of competition, Carson was free to take time off (Carson, by 1980, was only hosting three new shows a week) and invite guest hosts to host the show on a weekly basis, and for weeks at a time when Carson was on vacation including [[Joey Bishop]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Letterman]], [[Bob Newhart]], [[Don Rickles]], [[David Brenner]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].

In his final years, Carson produced new shows only three nights a week with guest hosts and "Best of Carson" reruns the other two nights. From 1983 to 1986, Rivers and Brenner served as Carson's permanent guest hosts. Many in 1986, including top executives at NBC, thought it was possible that Johnny Carson would retire after reaching his 25th anniversary on October 1, 1987, as it was such a logical cut-off point. In the spring of 1986, a confidential memo between top NBC executives listing about ten possible replacements in the event of Carson's retirement the next year was leaked. When Rivers saw it, she was shocked to see that she was nowhere on the list despite the fact that she had been ''The Tonight Show'''s permanent guest host since 1983. In 1986, Joan Rivers joined the brand new [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, where she would host her own late night talk show, ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'' which competed directly against ''The Tonight Show''. [[Clint Holmes]] served as Rivers' announcer while [[Mark Hudson (musician)|Mark Hudson]] served as bandleader. Carson was incensed that Rivers did not consult him beforehand and never spoke to Rivers again.

Brenner also left ''Tonight'' in 1986, although he did so amicably, to launch a syndicated 30 minute late night talk show called ''[[Nightlife (talk show)|Nightlife]]'' which was cancelled after one season.

[[Garry Shandling]], who had been a frequent guest host in the early 80's, served as permanent guest host, alternating with [[Jay Leno]], from 1986 to 1987 when he left to focus on his cable show leaving Leno to be Carson's sole guest host.

Carson did not retire in 1987, instead continuing as host until 1992 with Leno as sole permanent guest host. Rivers was fired from ''The Late Show'' in 1987 after abysmal ratings and a battle with network executives, leading to her being replaced by [[Arsenio Hall]]. Hall performed extremely well in the 18–49 demographic, however Fox had already greenlit ''[[The Wilton North Report]]'' to replace ''The Late Show'', leading to Hall hosting his own late night talk show in syndication after ''The Late Show'' was cancelled in 1988. ''The Late Show'' continued with many unknown hosts until its cancellation. Hall's syndicated show, ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', began in syndication in 1988, becoming more popular among younger viewers than Carson. The last network attempt at a Carson competitor, CBS's ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]'', lasted less than sixteen months, debuting in 1989 and being cancelled in 1990. ABC opted not to compete against Carson with a late night talk show, instead counterprogramming with a successful [[news magazine]] entitled ''[[Nightline]]'' beginning in 1980.

==== 1992–2009 ====
Carson retired as host of ''The Tonight Show'' in 1992 following his 30th anniversary as host. This garnered major media attention and speculation on who would replace Carson. The two candidates were [[David Letterman]] (host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' since 1982) and [[Jay Leno]] (Carson's regular guest host since 1987). Leno was eventually chosen, leading to Letterman leaving the network to launch a directly competitive late-night talk show, the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on CBS in 1993. ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' debuted in 1992. Letterman was replaced by newcomer [[Conan O'Brien]] as host of ''Late Night''. Arsenio Hall's show lost numerous affiliates after Letterman's debut and his show was canceled one year later. Fox returned to late night television in September 1993 with ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]'' hosted by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alumnus [[Chevy Chase]]. However, due to sagging ratings, disastrous reviews and Chase's embitterment at not being allowed to do the show the way he wanted to host it, the show was cancelled the following month. Even MTV entered the late night contest when it debuted ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], which ran until 1995. Letterman initially won the late night ratings battle but fell behind Leno in 1995; Leno generally remained in first place until first leaving ''Tonight'' in 2009. To combat NBC's ''Late Night'', David Letterman created ''[[The Late Late Show (U.S.)|The Late Late Show]]'' to follow Letterman at 12:37; the first host was former host of ''The Tomorrow Show'' Tom Snyder, who hosted the show using the same format he had used on ''Tomorrow'' until his departure in 1999. ''The Late Late Show's'' second host, [[Craig Kilborn]], followed a more conventional (albeit low-budget) late-night format; had previously served as host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', a late night satirical news program on [[Comedy Central]], and upon Kilborn's departure, Jon Stewart replaced him on that show. Perhaps one of the most unusual late night hosts to come out of this boom was basketball player and later entrepreneur [[Magic Johnson]], whose syndicated ''[[The Magic Hour (talk show)|The Magic Hour]]'' was a major flop and effectively ended any future efforts at a syndicated late-night talk show at that point in time.

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] finally re-entered the late night comedy fray in 1997 by installing ''[[Politically Incorrect]] with [[Bill Maher]]'' (which had aired on [[Comedy Central]] from 1993 to 1996) into its lineup after ''Nightline''. Unlike traditional late-night talk shows, ''Politically Incorrect'' was a half-hour in length and (following a brief host monologue) featured a panel of four guests debating topical issues while Maher moderated in a comedic fashion.

Many late-night talk shows went off the air in the days following the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001, while many of their networks aired round-the-clock news coverage. Letterman was the first to return on September 17, addressing the situation in an opening monologue. The show was not presented in its normal jovial manner, and featured [[Dan Rather]], [[Regis Philbin]], and a musical performance from [[Tori Amos]]. ''Politically Incorrect'' also resumed on September 17 and [[Politically Incorrect#Controversy and cancellation|immediately drew controversy]] due to remarks Maher and a guest ([[Dinesh D'Souza]]) made concerning the "coward" label given to the terrorists by [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]]. ''The Tonight Show'' returned the following night, featuring [[John McCain]] and a performance from [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]].

''Politically Incorrect'' was canceled due to low ratings in the summer of 2002, after which Maher joined [[HBO]] and began hosting the similarly formatted weekly series ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]]''. ABC then tapped Comedy Central personality [[Jimmy Kimmel]] to host his own late night talk show (in a more traditional format) and named it ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. From its beginning in 2003 until early 2013, the show aired behind ''[[Nightline]]'' in ABC's nightly lineup. In early 2013, ABC promoted ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' to the 11:35pm slot, while ''Nightline'' was relegated to 12:35am.

[[Jake Sasseville]] entered the late night arena after a self-syndication campaign got him clearance on several ABC affiliates by local general managers in 2008. ''[[The Edge with Jake Sasseville]]'' aired after ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' in markets reaching a total of 35 million homes, despite the network's concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nolan|first=Clancy|title=Late-Night Hustler|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/43864/|publisher=New York Magazine|date=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show went off the air in 2010. Another syndicated show that earned significant clearance in the late 2000s was ''[[Comics Unleashed]]'', a panel comedy show that lasted only one season but ran in reruns for several years afterward.

[[Scotland|Scottish]] native [[Craig Ferguson]] succeeded Kilborn as host of ''The Late Late Show'' in 2005, renaming it ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''. [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] entered the late night scene in 2009 when it debuted ''[[Lopez Tonight]]'', hosted by comedian [[George Lopez]]. On September 27, 2004, the 50th anniversary of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''{{'}}s debut, NBC announced that Jay Leno would be succeeded by [[Conan O'Brien]], in 2009. Leno explained that he did not want to see a repeat of the hard feelings and controversy that occurred when he was given the show over [[David Letterman]] following Carson's retirement in 1992.&lt;ref name="Conan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6115643/|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|title=Leno promises smooth transition to O'Brien|date=September 28, 2004|accessdate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conan2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/27/leno.obrien/|publisher=CNN|title=O'Brien to replace Leno on 'The Tonight Show'|date=September 27, 2004 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien's last ''Late Night'' episode was taped on February 20, 2009.

[[The Colbert Report]] that aired four days a week on [[Comedy Central]] from October 17, 2005, was hosted by [[Stephen Colbert]], one of the regulars on Comedy Central's [[The Daily Show]].

The popularity of late-night shows in the United States has been cited as a key factor why Americans do not get the requisite seven to eight hours of sleep per night.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8450575.stm "This diet of TV late at night is a key reason up to 40% of Americans get less than the "recommended" seven to eight hours of sleep, according to recent research from the University of Pennsylvania."&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015, late-night talk shows have competed for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Talk Series]]; prior to that, the genre competed against general variety shows for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series]].

''The Jay Leno Show'' ended after a short run on February 9, 2010, due to low ratings, which, combined with NBC's poor prime-time performance at the time, affected viewership of its lead-out late newscasts on many NBC stations.&lt;ref name="10pmleno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6620935.html|title=Jay Leno Taking Over 10 pm On NBC|publisher=BroadcastingCable|accessdate=December 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, news broke that NBC was expected to part ways with Leno for good after his contract expired in 2014, clearing the way for Fallon (whose tenure at ''Late Night'' had found success with a young, culturally savvy audience) to take over ''The Tonight Show'' beginning that year, which also marked the 60th anniversary of the franchise. NBC confirmed the change on April 3, 2013. Under Fallon, the show returned to New York City, where the show originated from its 1954 debut until 1972; NBC no longer owns the former [[The Burbank Studios|company-owned studios]] in Burbank where Carson and Leno's programs originated (O'Brien's ''Tonight Show'' taped at nearby [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios]]).

Depending on the law it denies, legal nihilism can be internal and international.

== Internal legal nihilism ==
=== Russian Empire, Soviet Union and its successors === 
[[Andrzej Walicki]] thought that both bureaucracy of the [[Russian Empire]] and socialists that replaced them had the similar negative attitude toward law because of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] character of [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="Flikke1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geir Flikke|title=Democracy or theocracy: Frank, Struve, Berdjaev, Bulgakov, and the 1905 Russian Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B04jAQAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Universitetet i Oslo, Slavisk-baltisk avdeling|isbn=978-82-90250-63-3|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by many scholars and public figures that legal nihilism is still widely spread in some countries of former [[Soviet Union]] including Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.&lt;ref name="Ivanova2010"/&gt; Russian president [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev]] often spoke against legal nihilism identifying increasing of the strength of law and legal awareness of the people.&lt;ref name="Gottemoeller2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rose Gottemoeller|authorlink=Rose Gottemoeller|title=The U.S.-Russia Civil Nuclear Agreement: A Framework for Cooperation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05Bj9EYq62MC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=27 November 2013|year=2008|publisher=CSIS|isbn=978-0-89206-535-6|page=48|quote=Medvedev has repeatedly spoken out against "legal nihilism," most recently in his inaugural address, identifying the...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IIIForrest2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Isaiah "Ike" Wilson III|author2=James J F Forrest|title=Handbook of Defence Politics: International and Comparative Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHJUW2qA7I4C&amp;pg=PA317|date=18 December 2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-63948-7|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Stewart|authorlink=Susan Stewart (author)|title=Presidents, Oligarchs and Bureaucrats: Forms of Rule in the Post-Soviet Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbYdjVkeKewC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=27 November 2013|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-1250-2|page=79|quote=Medvedev knows this and he pledges tirelessly to overcome the traditional 'legal nihilism'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pressure of the international public opinion has substantial influence on the struggle against internal legal nihilism in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sudebnik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn84AQAAIAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Simmonds &amp; Hill|page=253|quote=This might be the only hope for Russia to get out of the morass of internal legal nihilism. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International legal nihilism ==

International legal nihilism is denial of international law. It can be a consequence of dualist theory that international and national law are independent autonomous systems.&lt;ref name="Kuzne︠t︡sovTuzmukhamedov2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Valeriĭ Ivanovich Kuzne︠t︡sov|author2=B. R. Tuzmukhamedov|title=International Law - A Russian Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Jo6AQAAIAAJ|date=15 June 2009|publisher=Eleven International Publishing|isbn=978-90-77596-76-0|page=165|quote=In essence, this leads to a denial of international law, to international-legal nihilism. The dualist theory proceeds from the fact that international and national law belong to autonomous legal systems independent of one another }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian expert in international law [[Smilja Avramov]] publicly opposed the practice of [[Humanitarian intervention]]ism, emphasizing that the main danger for the modern world are not nationalism nor communism but legal nihilism which she thinks is employed during the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Avramov|first=Smilja|authorlink= Smilja Avramov|title=Beskrajno lutanje u tami|url=http://svetinjebraniceva.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=471:2012-08-17-20-19-54&amp;catid=38:2010-12-14-18-00-48&amp;Itemid=59|publisher=http://svetinjebraniceva.rs/|accessdate=26 November 2013|language=Serbian|date=June 1999|quote=У име “заштите људских права„ на делу је “оружани хуманизам„, у име демократије на делу је “Томахавк демократија„. Опасност по свет не долази од национализма, па ни комунизма, него од правног нихилизма, који је дошао до пуног изражаја у процесу разарања Југославије од 1991. до данас.["Armed humanism" has been introduced in the name of "human rights protection", "Tomahawk democracy" has been introduced in the name of democracy. Main danger for the world does not come from nationalism nor communism, but from legal nihilism, which was fully employed during the process of destruction of Yugoslavia since 1991 until today.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NATO and USA ===

[[Jan Nederveen Pieterse]] believes that the United States is in the position of new universal Empire which succeeds [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[British Empire|British]], but unlike them, the United States maintains "Pax" not on the basis of the rule of law, but on the rule of power. He also emphasized that breaches of the international law placed United States in the position of "international legal nihilism" and that USA does not recognize other polities as legitimate equals.&lt;ref name="DenzinGiardina2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jan Nederveen Pieterse|authorlink1=Jan Nederveen Pieterse|author2=Michael D.

As distinguished colonial Latin American historian John J. TePaske put it in 1968, "At least three generations of graduate students have studied the works of Lillian Estelle Fisher."&lt;ref&gt;John J. TePaske, "Review of ''The Last Inca Revolt, 1780-1783''", [[Hispanic American Historical Review]](hereafter HAHR) vol. 48 (no. 3), August 1968 499-500.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher is included as an example of sexual/gender discrimination in the historical profession.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Goggin, “Challenging Sexual Discrimination in the Historical Profession: Women Historians and the Aha, 1890-1940,” [[American Historical Review]]vol. 97, No. 3 (June 1992) 769-802, noted on p. 778.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Early life==
Fisher was born in Pennsylvania to farmers George P. Fisher and Etta R. Fisher in 1891. She attended [[Susquehanna University]] for her B.A., earning highest honors in 1912. She briefly taught at a Methodist Normal School (teacher-education training school), in Puebla Mexico (1913-1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6j49n8h4/admin/|title=Finding Aid to the Lillian Estelle Fisher Research Materials relating to Mexico,          1941|website=www.oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uwind.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/en/fm13-dab-detail-en/266|title=Ph.D. Lillian Estelle Fisher {{!}} University Women's International Networks Database|website=uwind.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She moved to California and earned her M.A. at [[University of Southern California]] in 1918, then attended University of California, Berkeley for her doctorate, which she completed in 1924 under [[Herbert I. Priestley]]. She remained for a time in California, teaching at [[Whittier College]]. She taught for 15 years at the Oklahoma College for Women (1926-1942), and returned to Berkeley, where she taught for a time at the extension of University of California. As Fisher was one a very small number of women earning doctorates in history, her mentor was concerned that as a woman she would face discrimination in the field; however, Priestley did not support the entrance of women in major departments of history.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Delpar, ''Looking South: Evolution of Latin Americanist Scholarship in the United States, 1850-1975''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 2008, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Academic career==
In keeping with the intellectual trends in Latin American history at the time, Fisher pursued institutional history, with one work on the viceregal administration and the other on the eighteenth-century [[Bourbon reforms]] establishing the intendancy system.  In 1955, she published the first full-length biography of reform bishop-elect of Michoacan, [[Manuel Abad y Queipo]].  This remains the main work on this important figure of the late colonial period in Mexico.  She also wrote a monograph on the background to Mexican independence, and her research on Masons in that era continues to be cited.  She also wrote an important early article on women in the Mexican Revolution, "The Influence of the Present Mexican Revolution on the Status of Women,"&lt;ref&gt;HAHR vol. 22, No. 1 (Feb. 1942), pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt; which has been included in an anthology on women in Latin American history.&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude M. Yeager, ed. ''Confronting Change, Challenging Tradition: Women in Latin American History''. Lanham MD: SR Books 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Her final monograph on the Tupac Amaru revolt was published in 1966, when she was 75.

She served as the Secretary of the [[Conference on Latin American History]] in 1938, when major organizational decisions were taken.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian E. Fisher, "Minutes of the Conference on Latin-American History of the American Historical Association. Held in Chicago December 28, 1938," HAHR vol. 19, No. 2 (May 1939), pp. 218-223.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
She donated her papers, unpublished novels, and personal correspondence to the [[Bancroft Library]], University of California, Berkeley. Materials relating to Mexico have been separated from her personal papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt958006w8/admin/|title=Guide to the Lillian Estelle Fisher papers, 1892-1981 (bulk 1940-1970)|website=www.oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6j49n8h4/admin/|title=Finding Aid to the Lillian Estelle Fisher Research Materials relating to Mexico,          1941|website=www.oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Estelle Fisher papers, BANC MSS 85/44 c, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in Moraga, California in May 1988, at age 97.

''50,000,000 Pearls Fans Can't Be Wrong'' is the first ''Pearls'' collection to feature full-color Sunday strips; publisher [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]] has begun to print Sunday strips in color in many of its regular-sized comic collections after strictly limiting them to treasury-sized books for years.

Pearls—shouting with arms extended, much like Jack from the film when he shouts, "I'm the king of the world!".  He has a rope tied around his chest, which Rat has attached to an anchor and is about to drop into the ocean.  Pig is also standing on the railing, heaving violently into a seasickness bag.  Goat stands by drinking a cup of coffee.  The Lemmings are diving from the deck into the sea on one side of the ship, and the Crocs are wading in the surf on the other side.

On the back cover, Rat is holding up a poster of himself, a parody of [[Shepard Fairey]]'s [[Barack Obama "Hope" poster]].  Instead of "Hope", the poster reads "Despair."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61979">The [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) has designated 73 [[World Heritage site]]s in 5 countries (also called "[[Sovereign state|state parties]]") of [[East Asia|Eastern Asia]]: [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Number of World Heritage Properties by region |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat#s1 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN division"&gt;{{cite web

In this region, [[China]] is home to the most inscribed sites with number of 50.&lt;ref name=listinchina&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/cn |title=World Heritage List in China |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sites from the region (and only sites designated in the 1980s or before) were the [[Great Wall of China]], [[Mount Tai]], the [[Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian]], [[Forbidden City|Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties]], the [[Mogao Caves]] and the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor]], and all of them were in China.&lt;ref name="SitebyYear"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;action=stat&amp;mode=table#s4 |title=Number of World Heritage properties inscribed each Year |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, UNESCO's [[World Heritage Committee]] may inscribe new sites on the list, or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria. Selection is based on [[World Heritage Site#Selection criteria|ten criteria]]: six for [[cultural heritage]] (i–vi) and four for [[natural heritage]] (vii–x).&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Criteria for Selection |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sites, designated "mixed sites," represent both cultural and natural heritage. In Eastern Asia, there are 53 cultural, 14 natural, and four mixed sites.&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/nominations/ |title=World Heritage List Nominations |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is [[World Heritage in Danger|endangered]], citing "conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List." In this region there are no sites currently listed as endangered, nor have been listed previously. Possible danger listing has been considered by UNESCO in a number of other cases.&lt;ref name="dangerlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/ |title=World Heritage in Danger |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a number of sites in [[Taiwan]] have been proposed, political considerations have prevented any site on the island from being listed. The United Nations considers Taiwan to be a territory of the People's Republic of China; any World Heritage site in Taiwan would be the responsibility of the PRC, which does not have any ''de facto'' authority over the island. The PRC actively interferes with any proposal to list a site in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/09/18/2003572437 Taipei Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in contrast to [[cognate]]s, which are words in two or more languages that are similar because they share an [[Etymology|etymological]] origin, and [[calque]]s, which involve translation.

== Examples and related terms ==
A loanword is distinguished from a [[calque]] (loan translation), which is a word or phrase whose [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] or [[idiom]] is adopted from another language by [[translation]] into existing words or word-forming roots of the recipient language.

Examples of loanwords in the [[English language]] include ''[[Coffeehouse|café]]'' (from French ''café'', which literally means "coffee"), [[bazaar]] (from Persian ''bāzār'', which means "market"), and [[kindergarten]] (from German ''Kindergarten'', which literally means  "children's garden").

In a bit of [[autological word|heterological]] irony, the word ''calque'' is a loanword from the French [[noun]], derived from the [[verb]] ''calquer'' (to trace, to copy);&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Calque Calque, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; the word ''loanword'' is a calque of the [[German language|German]] word ''Lehnwort'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Loans of multi-word phrases, such as the English use of the French term ''[[déjà vu]]'', are known as adoptions, adaptations, or lexical borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Strictly speaking, the term ''loanword'' conflicts with the ordinary meaning of ''loan'' in that something is taken from the donor language without it being something that is possible to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

==From the arts==

Most of the [[List of musical terms|technical vocabulary of classical music]] (such as [[concerto]], [[allegro (music)|allegro]], [[tempo]], [[aria]], [[opera]], and [[soprano]]) is borrowed from [[Italian language|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;Shanet 1956: 155.&lt;/ref&gt; and that of [[ballet]] from [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;Kersley &amp; Sinclair 1979: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic classification==

The studies by Werner Betz (1949, 1939), [[Einar Haugen]] (1950, also 1956), and [[Uriel Weinreich]] (1953) are regarded as the classical theoretical works on loan influence.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the two survey articles by Oksaar (1996: 4f.), Stanforth (2002) and Grzega (2003, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The basic theoretical statements all take Betz’s nomenclature as their starting point. Duckworth (1977) enlarges Betz’s scheme by the type “partial substitution” and supplements the system with English terms. A schematic illustration of these classifications is given below.&lt;ref&gt;The following comments and examples are taken from Grzega, Joachim (2004), ''Bezeichnungswandel: Wie, Warum, Wozu?'', Heidelberg: Winter, p. 139, and Grzega, Joachim (2003), [http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/SLF/EngluVglSW/grzega1032.pdf “Borrowing as a Word-Finding Process in Cognitive Historical Onomasiology”], ''[http://www.onomasiology.de Onomasiology Online]'' 4: 22&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression "foreign word" used in the illustration below is, however, an incorrect translation of the German term ''Fremdwort'', which refers to loanwords whose pronunciation, spelling, and possible inflection or gender have not yet been so much adapted to the new language that they cease to feel foreign. Such a separation of loanwords into two distinct categories is not used by linguists in English in talking about any language. In addition, basing such a separation mainly on spelling as described in the illustration is (or, in fact, was) not usually done except by German linguists and only when talking about German and sometimes other languages that tend to adapt foreign spellings, which is rare in English unless the word has been in wide use for a very long time.

According to the linguist Suzanne Kemmer, the expression "foreign word" can be defined as follows in English: "[W]hen most speakers do not know the word and if they hear it think it is from another language, the word can be called a foreign word. There are many foreign words and phrases used in English such as bon vivant (French), mutatis mutandis (Latin), and Schadenfreude (German)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Words/loanwords.html Loanwords] by Prof. S. Kemmer, Rice University&lt;/ref&gt; This is however not how the term is (incorrectly) used in this illustration:

[[File:Loanword classification tree 3.gif|center]]

On the basis of an importation-substitution distinction, Haugen (1950: 214f.) distinguishes three basic groups of borrowings: “(1) ''Loanwords'' show morphemic importation without substitution.... (2) ''Loanblends'' show morphemic substitution as well as importation.... (3) ''Loanshifts'' show morphemic substitution without importation”. Haugen later refined (1956) his model in a review of Gneuss’s (1955) book on Old English loan coinages, whose classification, in turn, is the one by Betz (1949) again.

Weinreich (1953: 47ff.) differentiates between two mechanisms of lexical interference, namely those initiated by simple words and those initiated by compound words and phrases. Weinreich (1953: 47) defines ''simple words'' “from the point of view of the bilinguals who perform the transfer, rather than that of the descriptive linguist. Accordingly, the category ‘simple’ words also includes compounds that are transferred in unanalysed form”. After this general classification, Weinreich then resorts to Betz’s (1949) terminology.

== Popular and learned loanwords ==
There is a distinction between "popular" and "learned" loanwords. Popular loanwords are transmitted orally. Learned loanwords are first used in written language, often for scholarly, scientific, or literary purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=znFmBZ2D8rEC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GW-MWpUf80&amp;sig=Mz1omR5ym9Re_HSiZ8sQymEn7-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz3YzyvsjTAhUMC8AKHXLWDn8Q6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20and%20learned%20loanwords%22&amp;f=false|title=The Origins and Development of the English Language|last=Algeo|first=John|date=2009-02-02|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1428231455|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some English loanwords remain relatively faithful to the donor language's phonology even though a particular [[phoneme]] might not exist or have contrastive status in English. For example, the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word ''[[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]]'' is used by geologists to specify lava that is relatively thick, chunky, and rough. The Hawaiian spelling indicates the two [[glottal stop]]s in the word, but the English pronunciation, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|(|ʔ|)|ɑː}}, contains at most one. In addition, the English spelling usually removes the [[ʻokina]] and [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] diacritics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elbert|first1=Samuel H.|last2=Pukui|first2=Mary Kawena|title=Hawaiian Dictionary|place=Honolulu|publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press|year=1986|edition=Revised and enlarged|isbn=0-8248-0703-0|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of English affixes, such as ''un-'', ''-ing'', and ''-ly'', were present in older forms in Old English. However, a few English affixes are borrowed. For example, the  English verbal suffix [[-ize|''-ize'' (American English) or ''ise'' (British English)]] comes from Greek -ιζειν (''-izein'') via Latin ''-izare''.

==In languages other than English==

===Transmission in the Ottoman Empire===
During more than 600 years of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the literary and administrative language of the empire was [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]], with many [[Persian (language)|Persian]], and [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] loanwords, called [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], considerably differing from the everyday spoken Turkish of the time. Many such words were exported to other languages of the empire, such as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. After the empire fell after [[World War I]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]] was founded, the Turkish language underwent an extensive [[language reform]] led by the newly founded [[Turkish Language Association]], during which [[List of replaced loanwords in Turkish|many adopted words]] were replaced with new formations derived from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] roots. That was part of the ongoing cultural reform of the time, in turn a part in the broader framework of [[Atatürk's Reforms]], which also included the introduction of the new [[Turkish alphabet]].

Turkish also has taken many words from [[French (language)|French]], such as ''pantolon'' for ''trousers'' (from French ''pantalon'') and ''komik'' for ''funny'' (from French ''comique''), most of them pronounced very similarly. Word usage in modern Turkey has acquired a political tinge: [[right-wing]] publications tend to use more Arabic or Persian originated words, [[left-wing]] ones use more adopted from European languages, while centrist ones use more native Turkish root words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Geoffrey|title=The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success|place=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-925669-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch words in Indonesian===
Almost 350 years of Dutch presence in what is now [[Indonesia]] have left significant linguistic traces. Though very few Indonesians have a fluent knowledge of Dutch, the Indonesian language inherited many words from Dutch, both in words for everyday life and as well in scientific or technological terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Sneddon (2003), p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argues that 20% of [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] words can be traced back to Dutch words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/ies/050208/ |title=A Hidden Language – Dutch in Indonesia [eScholarship&amp;#93; |publisher=Repositories.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loan words in Japanese===

{{Main|Gairaigo}}

===Romance Languages===
A large percentage of the lexicon of [[Romance languages]], themselves descended from [[Vulgar Latin]], consists of loanwords (later learned or scholarly borrowings) from Latin. These words can be distinguished by lack of typical sound changes and other transformations found in descended words, or by meanings taken directly from [[Classical Latin|Classical]] or [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] that did not evolve or change over time as expected; in addition, there are also semi-learned terms which were adapted partially to the Romance language's character. Latin borrowings can be known by several names in Romance languages: in Spanish, for example, they are usually referred to as "cultismos"&lt;ref&gt;http://aliso.pntic.mec.es/agalle17/latin/verba/definiciones.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=FtxywY_6g4UC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=semi+cultismos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=roJj7t4YpC&amp;sig=z1LCniOlEaGfTOSzsVMwOXayKnM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjL0P2XlujdAhWHTd8KHUgNBMgQ6AEwCnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=semi%20cultismos&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;, and in Italian as "latinismi". 

Latin is usually the most common source of loanwords in these languages, such as in Italian, Spanish, French, etc.&lt;ref&gt;cscanada.net/index.php/sll/article/download/9579/10252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1968.11435535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/HIST_FR_s92_Emprunts.htm#3._Lapport_des_langues_anciennes_au_fran%C3%A7ais_&lt;/ref&gt;, and in some cases the total number of loans may even outnumber inherited terms&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/157203089/Diccionario-Critico-Etimologico-castellano-A-CA-Corominas-Joan-pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (although the learned borrowings are less often used in common speech, with the most common vocabulary being of inherited, orally transmitted origin from Vulgar Latin). This has led to many cases of etymological [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] in these languages.

For most Romance languages, these loans were initiated by scholars, clergy, or other learned people and occurred in Medieval times, peaking in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance era&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/HIST_FR_s92_Emprunts.htm#3._Lapport_des_langues_anciennes_au_fran%C3%A7ais_&lt;/ref&gt;- in Italian, the 14th century had the highest number of loans&lt;ref&gt;cscanada.net/index.php/sll/article/download/9579/10252&lt;/ref&gt;. In the case of Romanian, the language underwent a "re-Latinization" process later than the others (see [[Romanian lexis]], {{section link|Romanian language|French, Italian, and English loanwords}}), in the 18th and 19th centuries, partially using French and Italian words (many of these themselves being earlier borrowings from Latin) as intermediaries&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dex.ro/&lt;/ref&gt;, in an effort to modernize the language, often adding concepts that did not exist until then, or replacing words of other origins. These common borrowings and features also essentially serve to raise mutual intelligibility of the Romance languages, particularly in academic/scholarly, literary, technical, and scientific domains. Many of these same words are also found in English (through its numerous borrowings from Latin and French) and other European languages.

In addition to Latin loanwords, many words of Ancient Greek origin were also borrowed into Romance languages, often in part through scholarly Latin intermediates, and these also often pertained to academic, scientific, literary, and technical topics. Furthermore, to a lesser extent, Romance languages borrowed from a variety of other languages; in particular English has become an important source in more recent times. Study of the origin of these words and their function and context within the language can illuminate some important aspects and characteristics of the language, and can reveal insights on the general phenomenon of lexical borrowing in linguistics as a method of enriching a language&lt;ref&gt;https://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=rlr-001:1969:33::530&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Cultural aspects==
According to [[Hans Henrich Hock]] and Brian Joseph, "languages and dialects ... do not exist in a vacuum": there is always linguistic contact between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|pages=241–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The contact influences what loanwords are integrated into the lexicon and which certain words are chosen over others.

==Changes in meaning and pronunciation==

In some cases, the original meaning shifts considerably through unexpected logical leaps.  The English word ''Viking'' became Japanese バイキング ''baikingu'' meaning 'buffet', because Imperial Viking was the first restaurant in Japan to offer [[buffet]]-style meals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20050524aj.html]  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Menhirs of Lavajo''' ({{lang-pt|Menires de Lavajo}}) are a group of [[menhir]]s, located in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Alcoutim e Pereiro]] in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Alcoutim]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Algarve]].

==History==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5424">'''Molisan''' is a group of [[dialect]]s of the [[Neapolitan language]] spoken in the [[Molise]] region of [[Southern Italy]].

==Distribution==
For centuries, the area of Molise was part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and later part of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].
It is not spoken in a large area (over [[Isernia]], [[Termoli]] and Riccia), but within this area there are many linguistic variations due to diverging historical events. Before the [[Italian unification]] some eastern parts of Molise were part of the [[Province of Foggia]] (Capitanata), whilst some western areas, in particular [[Venafro]], were part of the [[Terra di Lavoro]] (literally "Land of Work"), and Upper Molise was part of [[Abruzzo]].

For this very reason, the dialect spoken in Venafro may well be likened to the dialects of [[Campania]] and [[Naples]]. Some areas have also experienced an upsurge of minority languages such as [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]], whereas other areas of Molise represent isolated communities with little outside contact, who consequently appear to be more conservative. The Frentana area (Termoli, [[Larino]], [[Trivento]]) and Upper Molise has dialects that are more closely related to Southern Abruzzese.

Similarly to [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], Molisan contains words and sounds that are similar to those in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] but are not necessarily of Spanish origin. These include ''sartania'' ("pan", similar to Spanish ''sartén''), ''sctreppiàte'' ("broken", similar to Spanish ''estropeado''), and ''petacce'' ("piece", similar to Spanish ''pedazo''). The [[Roccamandolfi]] dialect of [[Isernia]], a province in Molise, shares many phonetic characteristics with Spanish.

With the exception of loan words from [[Italian language|Italian]] and Neapolitan, it has no palatal 'gl' sound (similar to the second syllable of ''million'' in the [[Received Pronunciation]] accent of [[British English]]) and instead employs the intervocalic /j/, as in the written Spanish 'll'. Roccamandolfi also maintains diphthongisation in [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]] through 'ue', rather than Standard Italian 'uo', such as in ''fuéche'' (Italian ''fuoco'', "fire"), ''cuéche'' (Italian ''cuoco'', "cook") and ''uéve'' (Italian ''uovo'', "egg"). Molisan also contains lexis derived from a substratum of [[Oscan language|Oscan]], a language spoken by the [[Samnites]]. For example, ''pjéskje'' ("rocks" or "stones") is related to Oscan *''psk''.

== Characteristics ==
As in the [[Neapolitan language]], the Molisan dialect group also employs [[vowel reduction]]. In all unstressed positions, vowels (often with the exception of 'a') are presented by [[schwa]] /ə/, whilst vowels in a stressed position are fully pronounced. This is in line with Standard Italian [[phonology]], in that the schwa never appears in a stressed position. Any vowel following a stressed syllable in a certain word is pronounced as a schwa. A final unstressed vowel, when followed by a pause, may be used for emphasis and is only mandatory when the word is immediately followed by a word with an initial consonant. Note that the schwa is a phoneme in itself, and distinguishes words of different meanings such as ''I səparə'' ("I separate myself") and ''I sparə'' ("I shoot").
The Molisan dialect group also displays the following phonological features:
* harsh pronunciation of single /z/ (unvoiced) compared to the more elongated Italian pronunciation, e.g. Italian ''situazione'' ("situation"): /sitwa'ts: jone/; Molisan: /sətwa'tsjonə/
* all unvoiced consonants following nasals become voiced, a phenomenon particularly common in many Central Italian dialects, e.g. Italian ''ancora'' ("still") is pronounced in Molisan as ''angora'')
* pronunciation of /s/ as ‘sh’ (as in "she") when it immediately precedes /t/, in direct opposition with the Neapolitan phenomenon in which /s/ is pronounced as ‘sh’ except when immediately preceding /t/
In the western area of the region (the Province of Isernia) spoken dialects share some common features:
* [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]] of masculine [[definite article]]s, e.g. Italian il cane ("the dog") becomes re cuàne in Roccamandolfi, and l'uccellino ("little bird") becomes ru cellùcce
* rhotacism of /d/, although this is applied inconsistently
* [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of Italian 'll' to "gl", e.g. Italian cappello ("hat") becomes cappiégle
* displacement of the central stressed 'a' when it appears between /a/, /e/ or /o/ in past participles, e.g. Italian mangiato ("eaten") becomes magnæt
The eastern and [[Adriatic Sea]] areas of Molise (the [[Province of Campobasso]]) hosts yet more linguistic variation, with some features nonhomogeneously distributed across the region:
* closure of stressed 'e' when not appearing at the beginning of a word, e.g. Italian ''bene'' ("well", "good") becomes ''béne'', in Capoluogo
* closure of stressed 'o' when in the middle of the word, e.g. Italian ''volta'' ("time") becomes ''vóte'', in Capoluogo
* palatalisation of the central 'a' when immediately preceding the word's stressed syllable, e.g. Italian ''Madonna'' becomes ''Medonne'', and ''pallone'' ("ball") becomes ''pellone'', in the area of [[Ripalimosani]]

[[Image:Arkansas Black apples.jpg|thumb|250px|right|"Those five beautiful shiny Jonathan apples sitting on the chair"]]
In [[systemic functional grammar]] (SFG), a '''nominal group''' is a group of [[word]]s which represents or describes an [[entity]], for example "''The nice old English police inspector who was sitting at the table'' is Mr Morse". Grammatically, the wording "The nice old English police inspector who was sitting at the table" can be understood as a nominal group (a description of someone), which functions as the subject of the information exchange and as the person being identified as "Mr Morse".

A ''nominal group'' is widely regarded as synonymous to [[noun phrase]] in other grammatical models.&lt;ref&gt;David Crystal, 2008. ''A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics'', 6th edition, p 328: '''''nominal group''' = ‘noun phrase’''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Downing, &amp; Lavid, 2007. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AQI6AAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Functional perspectives on grammar and discourse: in honour of Angela Downing]'', p xxi: ''the nominal group Halliday's term for the noun phrase)''; p 165: ''the English nominal group (aka noun phrase)''&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are two major differences between the functional notion of a ''nominal group'' and the formal notion of a ''noun phrase'' that must be taken into account. Firstly, the coiner of the term, [[Michael Halliday|Halliday]], and some of his followers draw a theoretical distinction between the terms ''group'' and ''phrase''. Halliday argues that "A phrase is different from a group in that, whereas a group is an expansion of a word, a phrase is a contraction of a clause".&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]. Arnold: p311.&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday borrowed the term ''group'' from the linguist/classicist Sydney Allen.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2005. Studies in the English Language. Volume 7 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second place, the functional notion of nominal group differs from the formal notion of noun phrase because the first is anchored on the thing being described whereas the second is anchored on word classes. For that reason, one can analyse the nominal groups ''some friends'' and ''a couple of friends'' very similarly in terms of function: a thing/entity quantified in an imprecise fashion; whereas one must recognise ''some friends'' as being a simple noun phrase and ''a couple of friends'' as being a noun phrase embedded in another noun phrase (one noun phrase per noun). In short, these notions are different even if formalists do not perceive them as different.

==The rank scale in SFG==

SFG postulates a ''rank scale'', in which the highest unit is the clause and the lowest is the [[morpheme]]: coming from the largest unit down, we can divide the parts of a clause into groups and phrases; and coming from the smallest units up, we can group morphemes into words. Typically, groups are made out of words while phrases are made out of groups: e.g. clause constituents ''(the apples) (are) (on the chair)'', phrase constituents ''(on) (the chair)'', group constituents ''(the) (apples)'', word constituents ''(apple)(s)''. In that sense, each unit of a rank typically consists of one or more units of the rank below, not of the same rank (see rank-shifting section for exceptions to this typical pattern).&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. An Introduction to Functional Grammar.Arnold: p9&lt;/ref&gt; At group/phrase rank besides ''nominal group'', Halliday proposes also the "verbal group", the "adverbial group", the "prepositional group" (e.g. ''from under''), and the "prepositional phrase" (e.g. ''from under the sofa'').

The term 'nominal' in 'nominal group' was adopted because it denotes a wider class of phenomena than the term ''noun''.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. An Introduction to Functional Grammar. Arnold; p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The nominal group is a structure which includes nouns, adjectives, numerals and determiners, which is associated with the thing under description (a.k.a. entity), and whose supporting logic is [[Description Logic]].

The term ''noun'' has a narrower purview and is detached from any notion of entity description. For instance, the words ''bit''/''bits'' in ''a bit of time'', ''a little bit of peanut butter'', and ''bits of information'' can be understood as a noun, but they can hardly be understood as representing some entity on its own. In that sense, these words shall be understood as being the head of a "noun phrase" in a formalist account of grammar, but as a portion of some unbounded entity in a nominal group. Since formal linguists are interested in the recurring patterns of word classes such as "a" + "[noun]" and not in the way humans describe entities, they recruit the term "noun phrase" for their grammatical descriptions, a structure defined as a pattern around a noun, and not as a way of describing an entity such as the "nominal group". In other words, given the different architectures of language that are assumed by functional and formal theories of language, the terms "noun phrase" and "nominal group" must be seen to be doing quite different descriptive work.

For instance, these group/phrase elements are re-interpreted as functional categories, in the first instance as ''process'', ''participant'' and ''circumstance'', with the nominal group as the pre-eminent structure for the expression of participant roles in discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 1999. Construing experience through meaning: a language-based approach to cognition. London and New York: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 
Within Halliday's functionalist classification of this structure, he identifies the functions of Deictic, Numerative, Epithet, Classifer and Thing. The word classes which typically realise these functions are set out in the table below: &lt;br /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-

| Deictic || Deictic2 || Numerative || Epithet || Classifier || Thing
|-
| determiner || adjective || numeral || adjective || noun or adjective || noun
|}

Within a [[clause]], a definite nominal group functions as if it were a proper noun. The proper noun (or the common noun when there is no proper noun) functions as the ''head'' of the nominal group; all other constituents work as modifiers of the head. The modifiers preceding the head are called ''premodifiers'' and the ones after it ''postmodifiers''. The modifiers that represent a circumstance such as a location are called ''qualifiers''. In English, most postmodifiers are qualifiers. &lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK and Mattheison C (2004) ''Introduction to functional grammar'', 3rd ed., London, Hodder Arnold, 311–12&lt;/ref&gt; In the following example of a nominal group, the head is bolded.

:Those five beautiful shiny Jonathan '''apples''' sitting on the chair

English is a highly nominalised language, and thus lexical meaning is largely carried in nominal groups. This is partly because of the flexibility of these groups in encompassing premodifiers and qualification, and partly because of the availability of a special resource called the [[thematic equative]], which has evolved as a means of packaging the message of a clause in the desired thematic form&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK (1985/94) ''Spoken and written language'', Deakin University Press, 72&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, the clause [What attracts her to the course] is [the depth of understanding it provides] is structured as [nominal group A] = [nominal group B]). Many things are most readily expressed in nominal constructions; this is particularly so in registers that have to do with the world of science and technology, where things, and the ideas behind them, are multiplying and proliferating all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK (1985/94) ''Spoken and written language'', Deakin University Press, 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three metafunctions in the nominal group==
Like the English clause, the nominal group is a combination of three distinct functional components, or [[Systemic functional linguistics#Metafunctions|metafunctions]], which express three largely independent sets of semantic choice: the [[Systemic functional linguistics#Ideational metafunction|ideational]] (what the clause or nominal group is about); the [[Systemic functional linguistics#Ideational metafunction|interpersonal]] (what the clause is doing as a verbal exchange between speaker and listener, or writer and reader); and the [[Systemic functional linguistics#Ideational metafunction|textual]] (how the message is organised—how it relates to the surrounding text and the context in which it is occurring/ it occurs). In a clause, each metafunction is a virtually complete structure, and the three structures combine into one in interpretation. However, beneath the clause—in phrases and in groups, such as the nominal group—the three structures are incomplete of themselves and need to be interpreted separately, "as partial contributions to a single structural line".&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK (1985/94) ''Introduction to functional grammar'', 2nd ed., London, Hodder Arnold, 179–80&lt;/ref&gt; In nominal groups, the ideational structure is by far the most significant in premodifying the head. To interpret premodification, it is necessary to split the ideational metafunction into two dimensions: the experiential and the logical.

==Experiential dimension==
The experiential dimension concerns how meaning is expressed in the group as the organisation of experience. The critical question is how and whether the head is modified. The head does not have to be modified to constitute a group in this technical sense.&lt;ref&gt;Bloor T, Bloor M (2004) ''The functional analysis of English'', 2nd ed., London, Edward Arnold, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, four types of nominal group are possible: the head alone ("'''apples'''"), the head with premodifiers ("Those five beautiful shiny Jonathan '''apples'''"), the head with a qualifier ("'''apples''' sitting on the chair"), and the full structure of premodification and qualification, as above.

===Functions of the premodifiers===
In this example, the premodifiers characterise the head, on what is known as the ''uppermost rank'' (see "Rankshifting" below). In some [[Formalism (philosophy)|formal]] grammars, all of the premodifying items in the example above, except for "Those", would be referred to as adjectives, despite the fact that each item has a quite different grammatical function in the group. An ''epithet'' indicates some quality of the head: "shiny" is an ''experiential epithet'', since it describes an objective quality that we can all experience; by contrast, "beautiful" is an ''interpersonal epithet'', since it is an expression of the speaker's subjective attitude towards the apples, and thus partly a matter of the relationship between speaker and listener. "Jonathan" is a ''classifier'', which indicates a particular subclass of the head (not Arkansas Black or Granny Smith apples, but Jonathan apples); a classifier cannot usually be intensified ("very Jonathan apples" is ungrammatical). "Five" is a ''numerator'', and unlike the other three items, describes not a quality of the head but its quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK and Mattheison C (2004) ''Introduction to functional grammar'', 3rd Ed, London, Hodder Arnold, 317–20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordering of the premodifiers: from speaker–now to increasingly permanent attributes===
The experiential pattern in nominal groups opens with the identification of the head in terms of the  immediate context of the speech event—the here-and-now—what Halliday calls "the speaker–now matrix". Take, for example, the first word of the nominal group exemplified above: "those": "''those'' apples", as opposed to "''these'' apples", means "you know the apples I mean—the ones over there, not close to me"; distance or proximity to the immediate speech event could also be in temporal terms (the ones we picked last week, not today), or in terms of the surrounding text (the apples mentioned in the previous paragraph in another context, not in the previous sentence in the same context as now) and the assumed background knowledge of the listener/speaker ("''the'' apple" as opposed to "''an'' apple" means "the one you know about"). The same function is true of other [[deictic]]s, such as "my", "all", "each", "no", "some", and "either": they establish the relevance of the head—they "fix" it, as it were—in terms of the speech event.

There is a progression from this opening of the nominal group, with the greatest specifying potential, through items that have successively less identifying potential and are increasingly permanent as attributes of the head. As Halliday points out, "the more permanent the attribute of a thing, the less likely it is to identify it in a particular context"&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK (1985/94) ''Introduction to functional grammar'', 2nd ed., London, Hodder Arnold, 187&lt;/ref&gt; (that is, of the speech event). The most permanent item, of course, is the head itself. This pattern from transient specification to permanent attribute explains why the items are ordered as they are in a nominal group. The deictic ("those") comes first; this is followed by the numerative, if there is one ("five"), since the number of apples, in this case, is the least permanent attribute; next comes the interpersonal epithet which, arising from the speaker's opinion, is closer to the speaker–now matrix than the more objectively testable experiential epithet ("shiny"); then comes the more permanent classifier ("Jonathon", a type of apple), leading to the head itself. This ordering of increasing permanence from left to right is why we are more likely to say "her new black car" than "her black new car": the newness will recede sooner than the blackness.

==Logical dimension==
The logic of the group in English is recursive, based on successive subsets:&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK (1985/94) ''Introduction to functional grammar'', 2nd ed., London, Hodder Arnold, 191&lt;/ref&gt; working leftwards from the head, the first question that can be asked is "what kind of apples?" (Jonathon apples.) Then, "what kind of Jonathon apples?" (Shiny Jonathon apples.) "What kind of shiny Jonathon apples?" (Beautiful shiny Jonathon apples) "What kind of beautiful shiny Jonathon apples?" (Here the recursive logic changes, since this is a multivariate, not a univariate, nominal group—the question now is "''How many'' beautiful shiny Jonathon apples?" and after that, "How do those five beautiful shiny Jonathon apples relate to me the speaker/writer, now?" ("Those ones".) In contrast, the logical questions of a univariate group would be unchanged right through, typical of long strings of nouns in news headlines and signage&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK (1985/94) ''Introduction to functional grammar'', 2nd ed., London, Hodder Arnold, 193&lt;/ref&gt; ("International departure lounge ladies' first-class washroom").

== Rank-shifting ==
The post-modifiers here contain information that is ''rankshifted''. Returning to the original example above, "on the chair" is a ''prepositional phrase'' embedded within the nominal group; this prepositional phrase itself contains a nominal group ("the chair"), comprising the head ("chair"), and a ''deictic'' ("the") which indicates whether some specific subset of the head is intended (here, a specific chair we can identify from the context).&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK (2004) ''Introduction to functional grammar'', 3rd ed, London, Hodder Arnold, 312&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, "Those" is a deictic on the uppermost rank and is applied to the head on the uppermost rank, "apples"; here, "those" means "You know which apples I mean—the ones over there".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15627">The '''Pandanan Shipwreck''' is an [[archaeological site]] which was excavated in 1995 by the Underwater Archaeology Division of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] in [[Pandanan Island]], in the coast of Southern Palawan. The ship was surmised to be a Southeast Asian cargo boat travelling from either [[Vietnam]] or Southern [[China]] and is one of the best preserved pre-Spanish trading ships within the jurisdiction of Philippines. It is speculated that the ship stopped at some ports in mainland South East Asia to load trade wares. Bad weather might have led to the sinking of the ship.&lt;ref name=Cayron&gt;Cayron, J. (2006) "Stringing the Past: An Archaeological Understanding of Early Southeast Asian Glass Bead Trade" The University of the Philippines Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat’s dimensions are about 25 to 30 meters long and about six to eight meters wide. It had a flat bottom which was suited for riverine water.&lt;ref name =Orillaneda&gt;Orillaneda, B. (2000) "The San Diego and Pandanan Wrecks: Two Underwater Archaeological Sites" Hukay Volume 2 Number 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pandanan shipwreck is considered a rare site dated approximately at the mid-15th century because, as per Sakuma (1989), the Chinese imperial court ordered complete banning of all private trading within this time.&lt;ref name =Sakuma&gt;Sakuma, S. (1989) "Prohibition of Overseas Trade and its Influence of International Relations in the Early Reign of the Ming Dynasty" ''Journal of East-West Maritime Relations'', vol. 1, pp. 31–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The discovery of the shipwreck was accidental. A long-time diver from the Ecofarm Systems Inc. (a pearl farm in Pandanan Island) named Eduardo Gordirilla stumbled upon the site by chance and found jars in the seabed as he was looking for a lost basket containing giant oysters. He then informed the manager of the farm, Efren T. Anies, who consequently called upon the national museum on June 9, 1993.  Although a report about the wreck was submitted as early as 1993, it was only in 1995 that the official extensive excavated began. Surveying was done within the span of one year (1993 to 1994).

The ship was spotted under a coral reef cliff covered in sand and mud and is relatively near the land mass-only 250 meters away from the northeast coast. Typical holes were discovered along the divisions of the bulkhead of the ship so as to aid in letting water pass as it is pumped out. In addition, only one fourth of the body of the ship remained intact. Two theories were proposed for the ship’s condition. One is the infestation of the exposed wood by tropical sea worms. Second is the destructive capability of the rapid water currents. The area is well-dated due to the presence of Chinese coins and ceramics. This site is considered a major step in discovering the culture of the country as there is little written records and archives about the Philippines and South East Asia in general during the 15th century.&lt;ref name = Cayron/&gt;

==Location and geography of the site==
Using the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) the coordinates were identified to be eight degrees, nine minutes and forty-eight seconds (8° 9′ 48″) north latitude and one hundred seventeen degrees three minutes and six seconds (117° 3′ 6″) east longitude and had a depth of approximately 40 meters below sea level. The Pandanan Island is 9.6&amp;nbsp;km long and 4&amp;nbsp;km wide and shaped like a quadrangle.

Grid maps were also made so as to accurately note the part of the site where a certain artifact was discovered. 

==Site excavation==
Three rafts were employed in the Pandanan excavation. The first raft was used to travel the generator for the SCUBA tank compressor and for supplying power to the submersible power pump. As for the second raft, it was used to carry and store diving gears and wet suits. The last raft served the role of lifting and delivering the artifacts that were obtained from the underwater site.  Dredging systems were used to clear away the mud, sand and coral that covered the ship. Once artifacts have been lifted from the site, they were immediately put in a saltwater bath. This allowed the limestone and coral to keep its layers from being damaged. Archaeologists and Conservators then cautiously cleansed, tagged and put the recovered ceramics in a protective storage before it was sent to the National Museum.&lt;ref name=Lord&gt;Lord, B. and Lord, G. (1992) "The Manual of Museum Exhibitions". Altamira Press: A Division of Rowman and LittleField Publishers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

All operations were undertaken only done during the day in order to maintain the safety of the divers and staff as well as to the inefficiency of work and low visibility during the night. Divers excavated for thirty minutes before ascending. They spend an hour for decompression stops to eliminate dissolved inert gases such as nitrogen in the blood- starting from 15 meters then ascending at three meters increments and switching from air to oxygen at the last two stops.&lt;ref name = Orillaneda/&gt;

==Artifacts retrieved==
A total of 4,722 artifacts have been recovered from the ship, a major percentage of which are Vietnamese ceramics (at 72.4 percent).&lt;ref name = Cayron/&gt; These finds are categorized into six main groups depending on their kinds namely: Porcelain and ceramics, metals, coins, glass artifacts (beads), stone tools and earthenwares. These are discussed individually below.&lt;ref name =Dizon&gt;Dizon, E. and Tanaka, K. "Shipwreck Site and Earthenware Vessels in the Philippines: Earthenware vessels of the Pandanan Shipwreck Site"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese porcelain and stonewares===
The Chinese porcelain category are made up of blue-and-white materials as well as the white wares, both of which have been manufactured in [[Jingdezhen porcelain|Jingdezhen kiln]]. The blue-and-white wares consist of several items such as saucers, bowls, large bowls and small jarlets. Another blue-and-white item was a [[Ming dynasty]] bowl with [[qilin]]. On the other hand, white wares accounts for the two pieces of gourd-shaped pouring vessels- [[Yuan dynasty]] spotted [[Qingbai]] double gourd pouring vessel.&lt;ref name = Cayron/&gt; The spots from the gourd were applied by putting droplets of ferrous oxide on the white glaze.&lt;ref name = Schreurs&gt;Schreurs, g. (2011) "The Rasikajy civilization in northeast Madagascar: a pre-European Chinese community?" (http://oceanindien.revues.org/1221)&lt;/ref&gt; The Celadon wares produced in [[Longquan kiln]] have also been located and these were composed on dishes with floral flaring rim, bowls having lotus patterns, saucers and stemmed cups. The Chinese stonewares that were made in kilns in [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] provinces in southern China were in the form of six eared jars donned with a dragon design.&lt;ref name =Dizon/&gt;

===Porcelain from Northern Vietnam and Central Vietnam===
The porcelain from Northern Vietnam was also blue-and-white ware which were manufactured in Chu Dau kiln. These were consisted of bowls, dishes, pots, jarlets, covered boxes and lastly water droppers. Meanwhile, the porcelain and stonewares from Central Vietnam were speculated to be produced on the Go Sanh kiln in Binh Dinh Province in Central Vietnam. These consisted mainly of celadon saucers and dishes with an unglazed ring portion inside it.&lt;ref name = Dizon/&gt;

===Porcelain and stonewares from Thailand===
The porcelain from Thailand were consisted of a large bowl with a fish design drawn in iron pigment inside made in the Sukhothai kiln. As for the stonewares, it was a black brown glazed four-eared jar and was manufactured in Noi River kiln.&lt;ref name = Dizon/&gt;

===Metallic artifacts===
Under this category were bronze artifacts and iron tools. The bronze items were made up of two small canons, a lamp, a scale balance, a mirror, a covered box, a disc, a fish hook, a fernule and lastly five gongs. The latter consists of a sword, a knife and approximately 60 pieces of cauldrons.&lt;ref name = Dizon/&gt;

===Chinese coins===
The Chinese coins were dated to be from 1403 to 1424 AD.&lt;ref name =Cayron/&gt; One of them was determined to be a coin issued during the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]].

===Stone tools===
There were 21 grinding stones excavated from the shipwreck. These were postulated to be used for honing and sharpening metal blades such as swords and knives or for processing of food.&lt;ref name = Dizon/&gt;

===Earthenwares===
A total of 301 earthenware vessels and fragments were recovered from the wreck. These were further classified into five categories according to type namely: pot, lid, jarlet, pouring vessel and stove.&lt;ref name = Dizon/&gt;

====Pots====

Four restorable pots were found of which one has a design and the remaining three pots without design. The decorated pot has a carination at the middle of the body and an out-turned rim of about 15.6 centimeters diameter, 10.8 centimeters height and 17.2 centimeters maximum body width. A pronged tool was said to be used to carve decorations from the neck to the anterior portion of the body. In addition, two parallel vertical lines are added extending from the neck to the upper part of the body at 7 to 8 millimeter intervals. As for the lower ends of the parallel lines, they were bordered off with incised horizontal wavy lines. It is heavily substantiated that this pot was used for cooking in the ship due to the soot covering the upper body of the said pot.

Meanwhile, one of the plain pots was found to have polishing markings on the bottom executed in just one direction. It also had an out-turned rim. This pot had 13.7 centimeters of rim diameter, 8.2 centimeters of height and 13.2 centimeters of bottom width. As from the specified dimensions, it can be observed that it is a relatively small pot. This whole pot was covered completely in soot with the exception of te bottom part.

The second plain pot which had a designated accession no. 3684 is larger compared to the previous pot. This, too had an out-turned rim. It had a rounded bottom as well. The dimensions are as follows:  17.1 centimeter rim diameter, 10.8 centimeter height, and 17.7 centimeter maximum body width. Soot covered the pot from the outer surface until the curved part.

The third plain pot donning the accession no. 3044 had an out-turned rim and rounded bottom just as that from the second pot. It had a rim diameter of 14.8 centimeters, a maximum body width of 19 centimeters and a height of 14.5 centimeters. Soot covered it from the outside of the rim to the angled portion of the body.

====Lids====

Under this category, there were three whole artifacts of the similar shape was located. They were all characterized as having a concave top portion and a convex bottom portion. They also had a small knob at the center of the top part and two of them had knobs with a flattened top and the other with a knob with a rounded top. One was 11.8&amp;nbsp;cm–11.9&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 2.6&amp;nbsp;cm–2.7&amp;nbsp;cm in height.The rest was at 14.3&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 3&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Reddish brown particles were scattered over the lids too. All the lids are proposed to have been created in Thailand due to the iconic shape of the three.

====Jarlet====
There was only one piece of jarlet. It had an out-turned rim, a short neck plus an ellipsoidal body. Rim diameter was measured to be 6.8&amp;nbsp;cm, maximum body width is 10&amp;nbsp;cm and height is 6.5&amp;nbsp;cm. Horizontal markings caused by wiping at the rim and neck were identified as well.

====Pouring vessels====
Two vessels were excavated and one of them was preserved well such that it was almost complete. In contrast, the other one had a missing rim and neck—hence only the body and bottom remained intact.

The almost complete pouring vessel had a spherical body. The outer surface had a dimple at the center and a horizontal applique ridge at the upper part of the body. The bottom was polished. The incomplete vessel had an ellipse body shape and the upper part is quite flat in comparison. The center portion is higher than the outside portion and a 3.1&amp;nbsp;cm diameter hole. Maximum body width is 16&amp;nbsp;cm, the height of remaining body is 9.7 and width of spout is 7.3&amp;nbsp;cm measured at its junction to the body.

====Stove====
There are two sections of the stove. The first is used to cradle the pod and the second is the lighted firewood underneath. The long end of the wood stretches until the other section where the cook can maneuver the firewood to keep the strength of fire under control.

There are three types of stove identified. The first type has a fan-shaped for the part used in putting firewood, and a half-cut cylindrical shape for the part used in burning the wood. The second type is quadrangular for the part used in putting firewood. It also has low walls around the edges. Lastly the third stove type has a similar quadrangular shape for the part used in putting firewood, and a cylindrical shape with quadrangular cut in front for the part used in burning. It looks like a ring from the top and three small cleats are attached around the ring.

===Glass beads===
The glass beads were found inside the Vietnamese stoneware jars. Only two colors of the beads were present- black and red. Several aspects of the beads were specified by Jun Cayron (2006) to be able to determine the origin of the beads.
The first proposed method was through chemical analysis which is a technique based on the composition of the material and after which the result was then to be compared with data from several manufacturing sites. However, aside from the high cost and unavailability of the procedure, the technique is believed to be unreliable in this situation and will contribute very little to the bead-sourcing according to Dr. Peter Grave and other experts. This is mostly because the glass’ deterioration is unstable due to the submersion for hundreds of years.

Thus, physical analyses had been the main method used. The stylistic attribute (color and decoration), form attribute (shape and size) and technological attribute (method of manufacture) of 204 glass Pandanan beads were consequently studied and compared with the 20 glass beads from Sungai Mas. The study revealed that the beads from the two sources were very similar in their overall diameter and perforation diameter- 17 pieces (85%) from Sungai Mas had identical match with those from Pandanan site. Therefore, it was concluded that Sungai Mas was the source of the Pandanan glass beads.

==Implications on theory of trade==
The location of Sungai Mas at the northwest coast of Malaysia suggested that in order to reach South China Sea and Philippines the beads were travelled towards the east coast across the [[Malaysian peninsula]]. In turn, the Malaysian peninsula could be reached either en route [[Malacca strait]] (if by sea) or Sunda Strait (if by land). The Pandanan ship is said to be a Southeast Asian cargo boat from South China or Vietnam, and most likely travelled southward stopping at either port of Patani or port of Singora where the Sungai Mas beads were loaded together with other trade goods. Then from the port,the vessel traversed towards northern Borneo and then to Labuan. Consequently, it may have entered the Balabac Strait on its way towards southern Palawan where it ultimately sank.&lt;ref name =Cayron/&gt;

'''Patient Abuse''' is a sketch from the final episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', "Party Political Broadcast". The sketch is among the few not entirely written by members of [[Monty Python]], and is notable for its considerable amount of [[black comedy|black humour]]. It was co-written by Python [[Graham Chapman]] and his friend [[Douglas Adams]], later known for creating ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkermatter.com/issue1/douglas_adams.php Douglas Adams: The First and Last Tapes]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mind-boggling [[bureaucracy]] is a recurring comic theme of Adams' work.

==Outline==

The sketch is set in a doctor's office. A man ([[Terry Jones]]) rushes in, blood gushing from his stomach. The doctor ([[Graham Chapman]]), barely reacting to the blood, blandly asks what the problem is, to which the man responds that the nurse stabbed him. The doctor tells the man that he has to fill out paperwork before receiving any care. With his blood still spilling to the floor, the man attempts to fill out the paperwork, while the oblivious doctor complains about the difficulties of paperwork and [[bureaucracy]]. Straining to the floor, the man hands the doctor his blood-soaked paperwork, which the doctor proceeds to criticise ("Surely you know number four! It's from ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', even I knew that!"). The sketch ends with the nurse ([[Carol Cleveland]]) coming in with a bloody [[sabre]], implying that she has just stabbed the last waiting patient. The doctor and the nurse decide to "pop[…] out for a bit of lunch", leaving the dying patient with a second form and the promise of some [[morphine]] if he gets at least the questions about history right.

{{this|Political Communications Principles|the academic journal|Political Communication (journal)}}

'''Political communication(s)''' is a subfield of [[communication]] and [[political science]] that is concerned with how [[information flow|information spread]]s and [[social influence|influences]] [[politics]] and [[policy maker]]s, the [[news media]] and [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/Political%20Communications%20encyclopedia2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], the amount of data to analyze has exploded, and researchers are shifting to computational methods to study the dynamics of political communication. In recent years, [[machine learning]], [[natural language processing]], and [[Social network analysis|network analysis]] have become key tools in the subfield. It deals with the production, dissemination, procession and effects of information, both through [[mass media]] and [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonally]], within a political context. This includes the study of the media, the analysis of [[political speech|speeches by politicians]] and those that are trying to influence the [[political process]], and formal and informal conversations among members of the public, among other aspects. The media acts as bridge between government and public. Political communication can be defined as the connection concerning politics and citizens and the interaction modes that connect these groups to each other. Whether the relationship is formed by the modes of persuasion, Pathos, Ethos or Logos. 

== Defining the concept ==

The study and practice of political communication focuses on the ways and means of expression of a political nature. Robert E. Denton and Gary C. Woodward, two important contributors to the field, in  ''Political Communication in America'' characterize it as the ways and intentions of message senders to influence the political environment. This includes public discussion (e.g. political speeches, news media coverage, and ordinary citizens' talk) that considers who has authority to sanction, the allocation of public resources, who has authority to make decision, as well as social meaning like what makes someone American. In their words "the crucial factor that makes communication 'political' is not the source of a message, but its content and purpose." &lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Denton R.E., Woodward G.C.|title=Political Communication in America|publisher=New York: Praeger|year=1998|pages=11|isbn=978-0275957834}}&lt;/ref&gt; David L. Swanson and Dan Nimmo, also key members of this sub-discipline, define political communication as "the strategic use of communication to influence public knowledge, beliefs, and action on political matters." &lt;ref name="b"&gt;Swanson, D. &amp; Nimmo D. "New Directions in Political Communication: A Resource Book." Thousand Oaks: Sage, 1990, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize the strategic nature of political communication, highlighting the role of [[persuasion]] in [[political discourse]]. Brian McNair provides a similar definition when he writes that political communication is "purposeful communication about politics." For McNair this means that this not only covers [[Words|verbal]] or [[written]] statements, but also [[visual]] representations such as dress, make-up, hairstyle or logo design. With other words, it also includes all those aspects that develop a "political identity" or "image".&lt;ref name="c"&gt;McNair B. ''An Introduction to Political Communication'', London: Routledge, 2003, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on the relationship between political communication and contemporary agenda-building, Vian Bakir defines Strategic Political Communication (SPC) as comprising 'political communication that is [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] in intent, that utilises [[social science|social scientific]] techniques and heuristic devices to understand human [[motivation]], [[human behavior]] and the media environment, to inform effectively what should be communicated – encompassing its detail and overall direction – and what should be withheld, with the aim of taking into account and influencing [[public opinion]], and creating [[strategic alliance]]s and an enabling environment for government policies – both at home and abroad'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bakir, V.|title=Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles|publisher=Farnham: Ashgate|year=2013|pages=3|isbn=9781472402554}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are many academic departments and schools around the world that specialize in political communication. These programs are housed in programs of communication, [[political journalism|journalism]] and [[political science]], among others. The study of political communication is clearly [[interdisciplinary]].

== Contemporary examples of strategic political communication ==
The ''[[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]’s torture-for-intelligence policy'', initiated soon after [[9/11]], was kept secret for several years, as remains the level of complicity of many other nation-states' governments. While this secret policy was gradually revealed from 2004 onwards, initiated by the [[Abu Ghraib]] torture photos, the Bush administration engaged in SPC to publicly reframe and protect its secret policy. SPC included ''[[silencing]]'' and ''persuasive'' discursive activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse|Discursive]] activity aimed at generating ''silences'' comprised [[plea bargain]]s that silenced detainees, censoring Guantánamo detainees’ descriptions of their own torture in pre–trial hearings, deals with journalists to censor or withhold information that affected national security, weeding out personal sousveillance of torture online, suppression of visual [[sousveillance]] of torture while [[courts–martial]] and criminal investigations proceeded; destruction of videotapes of CIA interrogations; and withholding key information from intelligence oversight committees. These position those in the know as part of an elite force policing the public sphere to keep the wider public and their representatives ignorant of unpalatable but necessary official practices, relegating the likely emotional and/or moral public dissent towards such practices as unaffordable niceties. 
* ''[[Persuasive]]'' [[discourse|discursive]] activity included the propagation and repetition of a few key messages consistently over time, with the aim of misdirecting [[public attention]] from the silence–generating activities. Key Bush Administration messages were that detainees were evil, dangerous [[war on terror|terrorists]]; that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic; that interrogation techniques, although harsh, were legal (apart from isolated acts of abuse), necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror; and that Guantánamo was a model prison. Key British Administration messages were of initial ministerial ignorance (until 2004) of American intelligence agencies’ new interrogation strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened; and of no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies in extraordinary rendition. Key messages common to both British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy from which lessons had been learned regarding Army training and interrogation guidance (new Army guidelines on interrogation were produced under the Bush and Blair Administrations). These key messages were propagated through a range of discursive activity (including [[press conference]]s and media interviews, authorised [[News leak|leak]]s, real–time reporting, official investigations and [[public inquiries]]) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once–secret documents. The consistency of key messages over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth–telling, positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable. However, the strategic generation of key messages and selectivity of supporting information presented across all these discursive modes means that full [[accountability]] is avoided, while the public is potentially fooled into thinking that [[justice]] has been served, all–the–while being constant targets of manipulation.

==Fields and areas of study==

The field of political communication is focused on 4 main areas:

* [[Election campaigns]] - Political communications involved in campaigning for elections.
* [[Government operations]] - This role is usually fulfilled by a [[Ministry of Communications]], [[Information Technology]] or similar political entity. Such an entity is in charge of maintaining communication legislation and would be responsible for setting [[telecommunications]] policy and regulations as well as issuing broadcasting licenses, comments [[press releases]], etc...
*[[Content (media)|Media content]] - The interaction between politics, media content and the public.
*[[Communication|Communication processes]] - How people communication about about politics.

According to [[James Chesebro]], there are five critical approaches to contemporary Political communications:
# [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] - i.e. power relationships
# [[Symbol|Iconic]] - symbols are important
# [[Ritual]]istic - Redundant and superficial nature of political acts - manipulation of symbols.
# [[Leadership|Confirmation]] - political aspects looked at as people we endorse
# [[Narrative|Dramatistic]] - politics is symbolically constructed. (Kenneth Burke)

==Role of social media==
[[Social media]] has dramatically changed the way in which modern [[political campaign]]s are run. With more [[digital native]] citizens coming into the [[voting]] population, social media is the platform on which the politicians need to establish themselves and engage with the voters. In a [[digital age]], social media will be more important than traditional media to the politicians.

Taking Australia as an example below: 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=AU&lt;/ref&gt; around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media. (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalmktg.net|title=Political Campaign and Social Media|publisher=Political Marketing|accessdate=2014-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131040/http://www.politicalmktg.net/|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With almost half of Australian voting population active on social media, political parties are adapting quickly to influence and connect with their voters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesocialsavior.com/benefits-of-social-media-for-business/&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media experience relies heavily on the user themselves due to the platforms' algorithms which tailor consumer experience for each user. This results in each person seeing more like-minded news due to the increase in digital social behavior. Additionally, social media has changed politics because it has given politicians a direct medium to give their constituents information and the people to speak directly to the politicians. This informal nature can lead to informational mistakes because it is not being subjected to the same "[[Fact checking|fact-checking]] processes as institutional journalism." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=d2NCDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=political+communication+in+media+society&amp;ots=ofCknFEU1v&amp;sig=UHjO4A3LY9_GEVss0uKJvsJgeJM#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20communication%20in%20media%20society&amp;f=false|title=Mass Media and American Politics|last=Graber|first=Doris A.|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|date=2017-07-20|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781506340227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media creates greater opportunity for political persuasion due to the high number of citizens that regularly engage and build followings on social media. The more that a person engages on social media, the more influential they believe themselves to be, resulting in more people considering themselves to be politically persuasive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=Brian E.|last2=Ardèvol-Abreu|first2=Alberto|last3=Gil de Zúñiga|first3=Homero|date=2015-12-31|title=Online Influence?

'''Post-Impressionism''' (also spelled '''Postimpressionism''') is a predominantly French [[art movement]] that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of [[Fauvism]]. Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction against [[Impressionism|Impressionists']] concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour. Due to its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content, Post-Impressionism encompasses [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cloisonnism]], [[Pont-Aven School]], and [[Synthetism]], along with some later Impressionists' work. The movement was led by [[Paul Cézanne]] (known as father of Post-impressionism), [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/hd_poim.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Timeline, Post-Impressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Post-Impressionism'' was first used by art critic [[Roger Fry]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="brettell"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=v5TcYXGDeI8C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22the+term+Post-impressionism%22,+%221906%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIqYXYo8DMAhVLuhQKHROHBYAQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20term%20Post-impressionism%22%2C%20%221906%22&amp;f=false Richard R. Brettell, ''Modern Art, 1851-1929: Capitalism and Representation'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al"&gt;Peter Morrin, Judith Zilczer, William C. Agee, ''The Advent of Modernism. Post-Impressionism and North American Art, 1900-1918'', High Museum of Art, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Frank Rutter]] in a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]] published in ''Art News'', 15 October 1910, described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen&gt;Bullen, J. B. ''Post-impressionists in England'', p.37. Routledge, 1988. {{ISBN|0-415-00216-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-00216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organized the 1910 exhibition, ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', defining it as the development of French art since [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]. 

Post-Impressionists extended [[Impressionism]] while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or arbitrary colour.

==Overview==
The Post-Impressionists were dissatisfied with what they felt was the triviality of subject matter and the loss of structure in Impressionist paintings, though they did not agree on the way forward. [[Georges Seurat]] and his followers concerned themselves with [[Pointillism]], the systematic use of tiny dots of colour. [[Paul Cézanne]] set out to restore a sense of order and structure to painting, to "make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of the museums".&lt;ref&gt;Huyghe, Rene: ''Impressionism''. (1973). Secaucus, N.J.: Chartwell Books Inc., p. 222. {{OCLC|153804642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved this by reducing objects to their basic shapes while retaining the saturated colours of Impressionism. The Impressionist [[Camille Pissarro]] experimented with [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] ideas between the mid-1880s and the early 1890s. Discontented with what he referred to as romantic Impressionism, he investigated [[Pointillism]], which he called scientific Impressionism, before returning to a purer [[Impressionism]] in the last decade of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Cogniat, Raymond (1975). Pissarro. New York: Crown, pp. 69–72. {{ISBN|0-517-52477-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent van Gogh]] used colour and vibrant swirling brush strokes to convey his feelings and his state of mind.

Although they often exhibited together, Post-Impressionist artists were not in agreement concerning a cohesive movement. Yet, the abstract concerns of harmony and structural arrangement, in the work of all these artists, took precedence over [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]]. Artists such as Seurat adopted a meticulously scientific approach to colour and composition.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10173&amp;section_id=T068997#skipToContent Caroline Boyle-Turner, ''Post-Impressionism, History and application of the term'', MoMA, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger painters during the early 20th century worked in geographically disparate regions and in various stylistic categories, such as [[Fauvism]] and [[Cubism]], breaking from Post-Impressionism.

==Defining Post-Impressionism==
[[File:Affiche Volpini.jpg|thumb|left|Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the [[Impressionist]] and [[Synthetism|Synthetist Group]], at Café des Arts, known as [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889]]]]
[[Image:Lautrecx07.jpg|thumb|[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], ''Portrait of [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]'', 1886, [[Tate Gallery]] [[London]]]]
The term was used in 1906,&lt;ref name="brettell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al" /&gt; and again in 1910 by [[Roger Fry]] in the title of an exhibition of modern French painters: ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', organized by Fry for the [[Grafton Galleries]] in London.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/manetpostimpress00graf  ''Manet and the post-impressionists''; Nov. 8 to Jan. 15, 1910-11, Grafton Galleries, London]&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks before Fry's show, art critic [[Frank Rutter]] had put the term ''Post-Impressionist'' in print in ''Art News'' of 15 October 1910, during a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]], where he described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert in the journal for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen /&gt;

Most of the artists in Fry's exhibition were younger than the Impressionists. Fry later explained: "For purposes of convenience, it was necessary to give these artists a name, and I chose, as being the vaguest and most non-committal, the name of Post-Impressionism. This merely stated their position in time relatively to the Impressionist movement."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing, Lawrence (2005). ''Facts on File Encyclopedia of Art'': 5. New York: Facts on File, p. 804. {{ISBN|0-8160-5802-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rewald]] limited the scope to the years between 1886 and 1892 in his pioneering publication on ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'' (1956). Rewald considered this a continuation of his 1946 study, ''History of Impressionism'', and pointed out that a "subsequent volume dedicated to the second half of the post-impressionist period":&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"&gt;Rewald, John: ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'', revised edition: Secker &amp; Warburg, London, 1978, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Post-Impressionism: From Gauguin to Matisse'', was to follow. This volume would extend the period covered to other artistic movements derived from Impressionism, though confined to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rewald focused on such outstanding early Post-Impressionists active in France as [[van Gogh]], [[Gauguin]], [[Seurat]], and [[Odilon Redon|Redon]]. He explored their relationships as well as the artistic circles they frequented (or were in opposition to), including:
* [[Neo-Impressionism]]: ridiculed by contemporary art critics as well as artists as [[Pointillism]]; [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac|Signac]] would have preferred other terms: [[Divisionism]] for example
* [[Cloisonnism]]: a short-lived term introduced in 1888 by the art critic [[Édouard Dujardin]], was to promote the work of [[Louis Anquetin]], and was later also applied to contemporary works of his friend [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]
* [[Synthetism]]: another short-lived term coined in 1889 to distinguish recent works of Gauguin and Bernard from that of more traditional Impressionists exhibiting with them at the [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889|Café Volpini]].
* [[Pont-Aven School]]: implying little more than that the artists involved had been working for a while in Pont-Aven or elsewhere in Brittany.
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]: a term highly welcomed by vanguard critics in 1891, when Gauguin dropped Synthetism as soon as he was acclaimed to be the leader of Symbolism in painting.
Furthermore, in his introduction to Post-Impressionism, Rewald opted for a second volume featuring [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Henri Rousseau]] "le Douanier", [[Les Nabis]] and [[Cézanne]] as well as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], the young [[Picasso]] and Gauguin's last trip to the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]]; it was to expand the period covered at least into the first decade of the 20th century—yet this second volume remained unfinished.

===Reviews and adjustments===
Rewald wrote that "the term 'Post-Impressionism' is not a very precise one, though a very convenient one." Convenient, when the term is by definition limited to French visual arts derived from Impressionism since 1886.  Rewald's approach to historical data was narrative rather than analytic, and beyond this point he believed it would be sufficient to "let the sources speak for themselves."&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"/&gt;

Rival terms like [[Modernism]] or [[Symbolism in art|Symbolism]] were never as easy to handle, for they covered literature, architecture and other arts as well, and they expanded to other countries.

* [[Modernism]], thus, is now considered to be the central movement within ''international'' western civilization with its original roots in France, going back beyond the [[French Revolution]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], however, is considered to be a concept which emerged a century later in France, and implied an individual approach. Local national traditions as well as individual settings therefore could stand side by side, and from the very beginning a broad variety of artists practicing some kind of symbolic imagery, ranged between extreme positions: [[The Nabis]] for example united to find synthesis of tradition and brand new form, while others kept to traditional, more or less academic forms, when they were looking for fresh contents: Symbolism is therefore often linked to fantastic, esoteric, erotic and other non-realist subject matter.

To meet the recent discussion, the connotations of the term 'Post-Impressionism' were challenged again: [[Alan Bowness]] and his collaborators expanded the period covered forward to 1914 and the beginning of [[World War I]], but limited their approach widely on the 1890s to France. Other European countries are pushed back to standard connotations, and Eastern Europe is completely excluded.

So, while a split may be seen between classical 'Impressionism' and 'Post-Impressionism' in 1886, the end and the extent of 'Post-Impressionism' remains under discussion. For Bowness and his contributors as well as for Rewald, '[[Cubism]]' was an absolutely fresh start, and so Cubism has been seen in France since the beginning, and later in Anglosaxonia. Meanwhile, Eastern European artists, however, did not care so much for western traditions, and proceeded to manners of painting called [[Abstract painting|abstract]] and [[Suprematism|suprematic]]—terms expanding far into the 20th century.

According to the present state of discussion, ''Post-Impressionism'' is a term best used within Rewald's definition in a strictly historical manner, concentrating on French art between 1886 and 1914, and re-considering the altered positions of ''[[Impressionists|impressionist]]'' painters like [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Auguste Renoir]], and others—as well as all new schools and movements at the turn of the century: from [[Cloisonnism]] to [[Cubism]]. The declarations of war, in July/August 1914, indicate probably far more than the beginning of a [[World War I|World War]]—they signal a major break in European cultural history, too.

Along with general art history information given about "Post-Impressionism" works, there are many museums that offer additional history, information and gallery works, both online and in house, that can help viewers understand a deeper meaning of "Post-Impressionism" in terms of fine art and traditional art applications.

In [[linguistics]], a ''quantized expression'' is such that, whenever it is true of some entity,  it is ''not'' true of any proper subparts of that entity.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

For example, if something is an "apple", then no proper subpart of that thing is an "apple". If something is "water", then many of its subparts will also be "water". Hence, "apple" is quantized, while "water" is not.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

==Usage==
Quantization has proven relevant to the proper characterization of grammatical [[telicity]] (roughly, sentences that present events as '''bounded/unbounded''' in time) and the [[mass noun|mass/count]] distinction for [[nouns]]. The notion was first applied{{when|date=April 2017}}{{why|date=April 2017}} to linguistic [[semantics]] by the linguist [[Manfred Krifka]].{{fact|date=April 2017}}

==Definition==
Formally, a '''quantization''' predicate ''QUA'' can be defined as follows, where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universe of discourse]], &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a variable over [[set (mathematics)|sets]], and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[mereology|mereological]] part [[mathematical structure|structure]] on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; &lt;_p&lt;/math&gt; the [[mereology|mereological]] part-of [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]:{{clarifyme|date=April 2017}}{{fact|date=April 2017}}

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(\forall F\subseteq U_p)(QUA(F) \iff (\forall x,y)(F(x)\wedge F(y) \Rightarrow \neg x&lt;_p y))&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World'''''|Re：ゼロから始める異世界生活|Ri:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu|{{lit}} "Re: Starting life in a different world from zero"|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[light novel]] series written by Tappei Nagatsuki and illustrated by Shinichirou Otsuka. The story centers on [[List of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World- characters#Subaru Natsuki|Subaru Natsuki]], a ''[[hikikomori]]'' who suddenly finds himself transported to another world on his way home from the convenience store. The series was initially serialized on the website [[Shōsetsuka ni Narō]] from 2012 onwards. Seventeen volumes have been published by [[Media Factory]] since January 24, 2014, under their [[MF Bunko J]] imprint.

The series' first three arcs have been adapted into separate [[manga]] series. The first, by Daichi Matsue, was published by Media Factory between June 2014 and March 2015. The second, by Makoto Fugetsu, has been published by [[Square Enix]] since October 2014. Matsue launched the third adaptation, also published by Media Factory, in May 2015. Additionally, Media Factory has published two anthology manga with stories by different artists. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[White Fox]] aired from April 4, 2016 to September 19, 2016, starting with an hour-long special.  The first of two [[original video animation|OVA]] based on the series was released on October 6, 2018. In March 2017, game developer [[5pb.]] released a [[visual novel]] based on the series.

The novels and all three manga adaptations are published in North America by [[Yen Press]]. The anime adaptation has been licensed by [[Crunchyroll]], which released the anime on home video through [[Funimation]] in the United States and [[Anime Limited]] in the United Kingdom.  The light novels have sold more than three million copies, while the anime series has sold more than 60,000 copies on home video. The light novels have been praised for their fresh take on the "[[Isekai|another world]]" concept, but have been criticized for awkward dialogue and redundancy. The anime series has been praised by critics for its "culturally complex world" and for the actions of its characters. The series received awards at the 2015–2016 [[Newtype|''Newtype'' Anime Awards]] and the 2017 Sugoi Japan Awards, and was nominated for Anime of the Year at [[The Anime Awards]] 2016.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters}}
[[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Subaru Natsuki|Subaru Natsuki]] is a ''[[hikikomori]]'' who does nothing but play games. One night, after visiting a convenience store, he is suddenly summoned to another world. With no sign of who summoned him, he soon befriends a [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Emilia|silver-haired half-elf girl]] who introduces herself as Satella, and her companion [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Puck|Puck]]. Satella mentions that her insignia was stolen by a thief named [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Felt|Felt]]. When he and Satella are mysteriously killed, Subaru awakens and discover that he has acquired the ability "Return by Death", enabling him to [[time travel|reverse time]] by dying. He greets Satella again, only for her to be offended at being addressed by the name "Satella", which in fact refers to the "Jealous Witch", and is considered a taboo. With the help of [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Reinhard van Astrea|Reinhard]] (a knight) in another timeline, Subaru saves "Satella's" life from the assassin Elsa; she reveals that her real name is Emilia, and as a token of gratitude, Felt returns the insignia to her.

While recovering at the margrave [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Roswaal L. Mathers|Roswaal]]'s mansion, the mage [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Beatrice|Beatrice]] drains Subaru's mana. After waking up, he meets the twin maids [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Ram|Ram]] and [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Rem|Rem]], as well as Roswaal, who hires him as a butler. Roswaal reveals that Emilia needed the insignia to qualify as a candidate in the upcoming royal election. After mysteriously dying again, Subaru decides to investigate the circumstances leading to his death, and tries to recreate these events. Following a series of traumatic deaths and revivals, he learns that a curse had been placed on him, then deduces it came from a village he had visited earlier, also resolving Rem's intense hatred for witches. Eventually, the village is threatened by creatures known as mabeasts, so Subaru, Rem and Ram have to rescue the villagers.

Later, Emilia is summoned to the capital by two members of the Royal Guard, [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Wilhelm van Astrea|Wilhelm]] and [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Felix Argyle|Felix]]. There, Subaru and company meet the other royal candidates: [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Priscilla Barielle|Priscilla]], [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Crusch Kartsen|Crusch]], [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Anastasia Hoshin|Anastasia]] and Felt; and their knights, [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Aldebaran|Aldebaran]], [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Julius Euclius|Julius]], and Reinhard. Felt initially announces that she will not participate in the election, and Subaru declares himself to be Emilia's knight. Following a public fight which leaves Subaru badly injured, he gets into a huge argument with Emilia, and she decides to cut ties with Subaru, leaving him behind.

After recovering, Subaru decides to train under Wilhelm, while Felix advises him to make up with Emilia. Rem then warns Subaru that something is occurring at the mansion, and against Crusch and Felix's warning, Subaru decides to return to the mansion. There, he discovers many dead bodies, including that of Rem, much to his horror. After dying and respawning, he is ambushed by a wicked group known as the Witch's Cult and meets the insane leader, [[List of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World characters#Betelgeuse Romanee-Conti|Petelgeuse]], who then tortures and kills Rem. Having later been killed by a monstrous Puck, Subaru respawns and curses Petelgeuse.

Knowing that the mansion and village will be attacked, Subaru seeks help from the other royal candidates, but they all decline. While gathering an evacuation, he encounters a legendary mabeast called the White Whale. Rem sacrifices herself to allow Subaru to escape. After returning to the mansion, Subaru encounters Ram and Emilia, who have no recollection of Rem. Disturbed by the situation, Subaru reveals his "Return by Death" ability to Emilia, only for her to die afterwards. Puck, enraged, transforms and kills Petelgeuse and his cult, then freezes Subaru to death as punishment for Emilia's death. After respawning, Subaru, having fallen into utter despair, has a serious conversation with Rem, asking her to run away with him. Rem, however, strongly encourages Subaru not to give up and confesses her love for him, already knowing that his heart is for Emilia. With newfound resolve, Subaru then decides that he will start again from zero.

Subaru and Rem later battle against the White Whale, after successfully striking an alliance with Crusch's and Anastasia's camps. Following a long and hard fought battle, Wilhelm ultimately kills the White Whale, thus avenging the death of his wife. Eventually, with the help of his new allies, Subaru is finally able to defeat Petelgeuse and his cult, saving the lives of Emilia and the villagers. Having reconciled with Emilia, Subaru confesses his love for her, leading Emilia to tearfully thank Subaru for saving her.

===Light novel===
The series' editor at MF Bunko J, Ikemoto Masahito, first became aware of the [[web fiction|web novel]] in April 2013, when it began to appear on his [[Twitter]] feed.&lt;ref name="marathon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2016/07/17/rezero-all-night-marathon-and-staff-discussion-what-makes-subaru-tick-everyone-off |title=FEATURE: "Re:ZERO" All-Night Marathon and Staff Discussion – What Makes Subaru Tick (Everyone Off) |last=Luster |first=Joseph |date=July 17, 2016 |website=[[Crunchyroll]] |accessdate=August 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was immediately impressed by the series' use of Return by Death, and how it was a "depressing, yet surprising, twist on the fantasy genre", and began working with Nagatsuki to adapt the series into a [[light novel]].&lt;ref name="marathon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="event"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2016/06/26-1/feature-rezero-all-night-screening-event |title=FEATURE: "Re:ZERO" All-Night Screening Event! |last=Jack |first=Er Gin |date=June 26, 2016 |website=[[Crunchyroll]] |accessdate=August 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most light novels are around 250 pages in length, but Nagatsuki submitted a manuscript of more than 1,000 pages for the first novel, forcing Ikemoto to edit it heavily.&lt;ref name="event" /&gt;  While Nagatsuki wanted to engage in [[worldbuilding]] early on, Ikemoto felt that it was more necessary to make the readers feel engaged with the characters.  He ended up rearranging the story so that parts focusing on the world and its lore were pushed back to the third arc of the series.&lt;ref name="event" /&gt;

Japanese text on either side of the image.|Early [[concept art]] for the characters [[List of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World- characters#Subaru Natsuki|Subaru]] and [[List of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World- characters#Emilia|Emilia]]]]
Prior to his involvement in ''Re:Zero'', illustrator Shinichirou Otsuka worked on [[video game]]s, which led him to draw the backgrounds first when illustrating the series.&lt;ref name="Emilia vs Rem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2016/08/13/feature-rezero-director-and-composer-discuss-who-the-true-heroine-is-emilia-or-rem |title=FEATURE: "Re:ZERO" Director and Composer Discuss Who The True Heroine Is: Emilia or Rem? |last=Luster |first=Joseph |date=August 13, 2016 |website=[[Crunchyroll]] |accessdate=August 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After reading the web novel, he submitted a number of character designs for the major characters to Ikemoto.&lt;ref name="marathon" /&gt;  [[List of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World- characters#Subaru Natsuki|Subaru]]'s initial design made him look like a delinquent,&lt;ref name="marathon" /&gt; with Otsuka later describing it as "not the face of a boy in his teens",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nagatsuki |first=Tappei |date=July 2016 |title=Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Volume 1 |language=English |publisher=[[Yen Press]] |page=233 |isbn=978-0-316-31530-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading Ikemoto to request that the character be "more friendly and less fierce" so that the audience could empathize with him during emotional scenes.&lt;ref name="event" /&gt;  Originally, [[List of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World- characters#Emilia|Emilia]]'s character design appeared extremely plain, so a number of features were added to make her more interesting.&lt;ref name="event" /&gt;  Ikemoto specified that she must fit the "archetypal heroine" mold.&lt;ref name="marathon" /&gt; Rem and Ram also underwent significant changes from the first draft: their original designs lacked the characteristic hair parts, and their maid uniforms were longer and more "traditional".&lt;ref name="event" /&gt;

===Anime===
====Development and production====
The possibility of an [[anime]] adaptation came up early in the development of the series; Sho Tanaka, a producer at Kadokawa, asked Ikemoto about properties which might lend themselves to being animated, and Ikemoto recommended that Tanaka read Nagatsuki's web novels.&lt;ref name="marathon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="event" /&gt;  Despite an initial miscommunication which led to Ikemoto believing that Tanaka wasn't interested, talks of adapting the series began soon after the web novels began the transition to print.&lt;ref name="event" /&gt;

As part of talks for the potential anime adaptation, Ikemoto and Tanaka spoke to Tsunaki Yoshikawa, an animation producer at studio [[White Fox]], about the possibility of his [[animation studio|studio]] animating the series.&lt;ref name="event" /&gt;  Hoping to adapt the series into an anime similar to ''[[Steins;Gate]]'' (which White Fox also produced), and having a positive impression of the studio as one that did faithful adaptations, Tanaka then formally approached them about producing the show.  White Fox's president contacted Yoshikawa for his opinion, and Yoshikawa recommended they accept, as long as the series "doesn't violate any broadcasting regulations".&lt;ref name="marathon" /&gt;

When it proved unfeasible for Yokotani and Nakamura to write the scripts alone, the decision was made to bring another scriptwriter on board.  Gaku Iwasa, the president of White Fox, asked them to hire someone "younger", leading Yokotani to suggest Eiji Umehara.  Nagatsuki had recently been playing ''[[Chaos;Child]]'', which Umehara had written for, and he approved the choice, suggesting that they let Umehara write the "painful parts"; Umehara was invited to join the project around the time that the scripts for episodes 8 and 9 were being written.&lt;ref name="scriptwriters" /&gt;  ''Re:Zero'' was the first light novel adaptation that either of the screenwriters had worked on.&lt;ref name="scriptwriters" /&gt;

Original author Tappei Nagatsuki was very active in the production of the anime, attending script meetings and recording sessions.&lt;ref name="marathon" /&gt;  When the staff would encounter a problem with a scene, he would occasionally write lines for them to use as reference while writing the script.&lt;ref name="scriptwriters" /&gt;  The series was not initially intended to have 25 episodes, but was extended to give more time to the battle with the White Whale (which was expanded from two to three episodes) and to the content of episode 18 (episodes 16 to 18 were originally supposed to be covered in two episodes).&lt;ref name="scriptwriters" /&gt;  Watanabe's main directive to the staff was to "capture the mood of the novel as much as possible";&lt;ref name="Emilia vs Rem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scriptwriters" /&gt; the scriptwriters had discussions about how to compress the dense source material without losing the central elements of the story, and Nakamura recalls working with composition notes that "went on for pages".&lt;ref name="scriptwriters" /&gt;  While planning and scripting the anime, choosing a proper conclusion was one of the most difficult parts for the staff, and a significant amount of time was devoted to choosing what to cover in the final episode,&lt;ref name="marathon" /&gt; which included material not yet covered in the light novel.{{efn|The episode, which was released on September 19, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/program/detail/24023_201609182505.html |title=Ｒｅ：ゼロから始める異世界生活「ただそれだけの物語」 |trans-title=''Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World-'': "That's All This Story Is About" |website=[[TV Tokyo]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; included material from the ninth novel, which was released four days later on September 23, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediafactory.co.jp/bunkoj/book_detail/1463 |title=Re：ゼロから始める異世界生活 9 |language=Japanese |website=[[Media Factory]] |accessdate=September 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/09/12/rezero-anime-overtakes-published-light-novel-material-spoiler-warning |title="Re:Zero" Anime Overtakes Published Light Novel Material (Spoiler Warning) |last=Green |first=Scott |date=September 12, 2016 |website=[[Crunchyroll]] |accessdate=September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/Rezero_official/status/775015022514679808 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912011813/https://twitter.com/Rezero_official/status/775015022514679808 |archivedate=September 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |title=文庫「Ｒｅ：ゼロから始める異世界生活９」の口絵イラストがこちら！　あれ、この状況、台詞、見覚えがあるような……。つまり――現在TVアニメが原作文庫を追い抜いています。ということで来週放送の第25話はまだ原作文庫でも未公開の内容！ |author=Rezero_official |date=September 11, 2016 |website=[[Twitter]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After joining the project, both Nakamura and Umehara had to adjust their views of the main character, and were forced to rewrite scenes where they had made Subaru appear "cool". At Watanabe's direction, Nakamura was made to rewrite Subaru's telling of ''The Red Ogre Who Cried'' in episode 6 multiple times.&lt;ref name="scriptwriters" /&gt;  The staff also had difficulty deciding on a song to use for Subaru's [[ringtone]] that plays during the closing scene of episode 19, considering songs like "Kanpaku Sengen", "The Beard Song", and "M" by [[Princess Princess (band)|Princess Princess]], before settling on "Yoake no Michi" from ''[[Dog of Flanders (TV series)|Dog of Flanders]]''.&lt;ref name="scriptwriters" /&gt;

====Soundtrack====
While choosing a composer to produce the series' music, director Watanabe wanted to choose someone who had "hit a nerve" with him.  A fan of [[Japanese television drama|drama]] series, Watanabe was struck by a piece of music in the [[medical drama]] ''Death's Organ'', and found that the series' composer, Suehiro Kenichirō, had also worked on a number of his favorite anime and drama series.&lt;ref name="theatrical music"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2016/07/31-1/feature-rezero-director-and-composer-discuss-their-fixation-on-theatrical-music |title=FEATURE: "Re:ZERO" Director and Composer Discuss Their Fixation on Theatrical Music |last=Luster |first=Joseph |date=July 31, 2016 |website=[[Crunchyroll]] |accessdate=August 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Suehiro was attached to the production, Watanabe gave him three major guidelines: use human voices during the Return by Death sequences; compose the music like he would for a drama or a movie to capture the emotional scenes; and "pull all the stops" for the suspenseful scenes.&lt;ref name="theatrical music" /&gt;  Additionally, for the first cour, Watanabe asked for music with a "suspenseful" vibe, while requesting music with a "romantic" feel for the second cour.&lt;ref name="theatrical music" /&gt;  Both Watanabe and Suehiro are fans of Italian composer [[Ennio Morricone]], and Suehiro tried to take inspiration from his works while composing the soundtrack.&lt;ref name="theatrical music" /&gt;  Watanabe also requested that there be songs that mimicked [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score from ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.&lt;ref name="theatrical music" /&gt;  While Suehiro used music that wasn't very "anime-ish" during most of the series, he was asked to use more traditional anime music during the slice of life scenes.&lt;ref name="theatrical music" /&gt;  A number of times during the series, such as in episodes 7 and 15, Watanabe made it a point to use an entire song, something which is unusual in most anime.&lt;ref name="theatrical music" /&gt;

The series makes limited use of its opening and ending themes, and Watanabe has said that he wished he could use them more frequently.&lt;ref name="Emilia vs Rem" /&gt;

Theron Martin of [[Anime News Network]] reviewed the first book, praising it for being a somewhat fresher take on the "transported to another world" concept, but leveled criticism at it for bumpy and awkwardly timed dialogue and a tendency for redundancy.&lt;ref name="Theron Martin 1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Theron Martin|title=Re:ZERO Novel 1 – Review|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/re-zero/novel-1/.104935|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=August 4, 2016|date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Managing Editor from Anime Now!, Richard Eisenbeis lists the anime as his top picks from 2016 for its "culturally complex" world and characters that has "their own plans, faults, and motivations". He praised Subaru as the "most complex character of the year" due to provoking the audience to "cheer him and despise him" in a world that portrayed him as the "least special person in it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anime-now.com/entry/2017/01/01/000041|title=The Best Anime of 2016|author=Eisenbeis, Richard|website=Anime Now|date=January 1, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305195129/http://www.anime-now.com/entry/2017/01/01/000041|archivedate=March 5, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">The '''Reichskunstwart''' ([[German language|German]]: Imperial Art Protector) was an official position within the [[Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Ministry of the Interior]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], which was concerned with artistic matters and other regulatory issues. It mediated between regulators and artists. Its official address was Berlin NW 40, [[Platz der Republik (Berlin)|Platz der Republik 6]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cuno Horkenbach]].

{{Semiotics}}
'''Roman Osipovich Jakobson''' ({{lang-ru|Рома́н О́сипович Якобсо́н}}; October 11, 1896&lt;ref name="Kucera"&gt;Kucera, Henry. 1983. "Roman Jakobson." ''Language: Journal of the Linguistic Society of America'' 59(4): 871–883.&lt;/ref&gt; – July 18,&lt;ref name="rudy"&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/research/collections/collections-mc/mc72.html#ref8425 "Roman Jakobson: A Brief Chronology"], compiled by Stephen Rudy&lt;/ref&gt; 1982) was a [[Russia]]n–[[United States|American]] [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Literary theory|literary theorist]].

A pioneer of [[structural linguistics]], Jakobson was one of the most celebrated and influential [[linguistics|linguists]] of the twentieth century. With [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], he developed revolutionary new techniques for the analysis of linguistic sound systems, in effect founding the modern discipline of [[phonology]]. Jakobson went on to extend similar principles and techniques to the study of other aspects of language such as [[syntax]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[semantics]]. He made numerous contributions to [[Slavic studies|Slavic linguistics]], most notably two studies of [[Russian declension|Russian case]] and an analysis of the categories of the [[Russian verbs|Russian verb]]. Drawing on insights from [[C. S. Peirce]]'s [[semiotics]], as well as from [[communication theory]] and [[cybernetics]], he proposed methods for the investigation of [[poetry]], [[music]], the [[visual arts]], and [[Film|cinema]].

Through his decisive influence on [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]], among others, Jakobson became a pivotal figure in the adaptation of structural analysis to disciplines beyond linguistics, including [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[literary theory]]; his development of the approach pioneered by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], known as "[[structuralism]]", became a major post-war intellectual movement in Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, though the influence of structuralism declined during the 1970s, Jakobson's work has continued to receive attention in [[linguistic anthropology]], especially through the ethnography of communication developed by [[Dell Hymes]] and the semiotics of culture developed by Jakobson's former student [[Michael Silverstein]]. It should also be remembered that Jakobson's concept of underlying linguistic universals, particularly his celebrated theory of  [[distinctive features]], decisively influenced the early thinking of [[Noam Chomsky]], who became the dominant figure in theoretical linguistics during the second half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Chris, 2018. ''Decoding Chomsky: Science and revolutionary politics.'' New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, &lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Jakobson was born in Russia on 11 October 1896&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; to a well-to-do family of [[Jewish]] descent, the industrialist Osip Jakobson and chemist Anna Volpert Jakobson,&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; and he developed a fascination with language at a very young age. He studied at the [[Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages]] and then at the Historical-Philological Faculty of [[Moscow University]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, Roman (1997). ''My Futurist Years'', pp. 5, 30. trans. Stephen Rudy. Marsilio Publishers. {{ISBN|1-56886-049-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a student he was a leading figure of the [[Moscow Linguistic Circle]] and took part in [[Moscow]]'s active world of [[avant-garde]] art and poetry. The linguistics of the time was overwhelmingly [[neogrammarian]] and insisted that the only scientific study of language was to study the history and development of words across time (the [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] approach, in [[Course in General Linguistics#The Synchronic and Diachronic Axes|Saussure's terms]]). Jakobson, on the other hand, had come into contact with the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], and developed an approach focused on the way in which language's structure served its basic function ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] approach) – to communicate information between speakers. Jakobson was also well known for his critique of the emergence of sound in film. Jakobson received a master's degree from Moscow University in 1918.&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt;

===In Czechoslovakia===
Although he was initially an enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik revolution, Jakobson soon became disillusioned as his early hopes for an explosion of creativity in the arts fell victim to increasing state conservatism and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Chris, 2018.  "Decoding Chomsky: Science and revolutionary politics". London &amp; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2018, pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Moscow for Prague in 1920, where he worked as a member of the Soviet diplomatic mission while continuing with his doctoral studies. Then, in 1933, he took up a chair at Brno. Living in Czechoslovakia meant that Jakobson was physically close to the linguist who would be his most important collaborator during the 1920s and 1930s, Prince Nikolai Trubetzkoy, who fled Russia at the time of the Revolution and took up a chair at Vienna in 1922. In 1926 the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]] of linguistic theory was established by the professor of English at Charles University, Vilém Mathesius, with Jakobson as a founding member and a prime intellectual force (other members included [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], [[René Wellek]] and [[Jan Mukařovský]]). Jakobson immersed himself in both the academic and cultural life of [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|pre-World War II Czechoslovakia]] and established close relationships with a number of Czech poets and literary figures. Jakobson received his Ph.D. from Charles University in 1930.&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; He became a professor at [[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno]] in 1933. He also made an impression on Czech academics with his studies of Czech verse.

===Escapes before the war===
Jakobson escaped from Prague in early March 1939&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; via Berlin for [[Denmark]], where he was associated with the [[Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen linguistic circle]], and such intellectuals as [[Louis Hjelmslev]]. He fled to Norway on 1 September 1939,&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; and in 1940 walked across the border to Sweden,&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; where he continued his work at the [[Karolinska Hospital]] (with works on [[aphasia]] and language competence). When Swedish colleagues feared a possible German occupation, he managed to leave on a cargo ship, together with [[Ernst Cassirer]] (the former rector of Hamburg University) to [[New York City]] in 1941&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; to become part of the wider community of intellectual émigrés who fled there.

===Career in the United States and later life ===
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|Roman Jakobson]]
In New York, he began teaching at [[The New School]], still closely associated with the Czech émigré community during that period. At the [[École libre des hautes études]], a sort of Francophone university-in-exile, he met and collaborated with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], who would also become a key exponent of [[structuralism]]. He also made the acquaintance of many American linguists and [[anthropology|anthropologists]], such as [[Franz Boas]], [[Benjamin Whorf]], and [[Leonard Bloomfield]]. When the American authorities considered "repatriating" him to Europe, it was Franz Boas who actually saved his life. After the war, he became a consultant to the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]], which would present [[Interlingua]] in 1951.

In 1949&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; Jakobson moved to [[Harvard University]], where he remained until his retirement in 1967.&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; His universalizing structuralist theory of [[phonology]], based on a [[markedness]] hierarchy of [[distinctive features]], achieved its canonical exposition in a book published in the United States in 1951, jointly authored by Roman Jakobson, C. Gunnar Fant and [[Morris Halle]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R., C. Gunnar Fant and M. Halle, 1951. ''Preliminaries to Speech Analysis: The distinctive features and their correlates.'' Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Jakobson's theory of 'distinctive features' made a profound impression on the thinking of a young American linguist named Noam Chomsky, in this way decisively shaping the development of linguistics for the remainder of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Chris, 2018. "Decoding Chomsky: Science and revolutionary politics". London &amp; New Haven: Yale University Press, pp. 85-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last decade, Jakobson maintained an office at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he was an honorary Professor Emeritus. In the early 1960s Jakobson shifted his emphasis to a more comprehensive view of language and began writing about communication sciences as a whole. He converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Jakobson_Roman_Osipovich |title=YIVO &amp;#124; Jakobson, Roman Osipovich |publisher=Yivoencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jakobson died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on 18 July 1982.&lt;ref name="Kucera"/&gt; His widow died in 1986. His first wife, who was born in 1908, died in 2000.

== Intellectual contributions ==
According to Jakobson's own personal reminiscinces, the most decisive stage in the development of his thinking was the period of revolutionary anticipation and upheaval in Russia between 1912 and 1920, when, as a young student, he fell under the spell of the celebrated Russian futurist wordsmith and linguistic thinker [[Velimir Khlebnikov]].&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Chris, 2018. 'Incantation by Laughter', chapter 11 in ''Decoding Chomsky: Science and revolutionary politics.'' London &amp; New Haven: Yale University Press, pp. 91-103. &lt;/ref&gt;
 
Offering a slightly different picture, the preface to the second edition of ''The Sound Shape of Language'' argues that this book represents the fourth stage in "Jakobson's quest to uncover the function and structure of sound in language."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrZTFHTD-r4C&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;ots=IERqjizyJ4&amp;dq=jakobson%20saussure%20%22fig.%20*%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Sound Shape of Language|last=Jakobson|first=Roman|last2=Waugh|first2=Linda R.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110889451|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage was roughly the 1920s to 1930s where he collaborated with [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy|Trubetzkoy]], in which they developed the concept of the phoneme, and elucidated the structure of phonological systems. The second stage, from roughly the late 1930s to the 1940s, during which he developed the notion that "binary distinctive features" were the foundational element in language, and that such distinctiveness is "mere otherness" or differentiation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the third stage in Jakobson's work, from the 1950s to 1960s, he worked with the acoustician C. Gunnar Fant and Morris Halle (a student of Jakobson's) to consider the acoustic aspects of distinctive features. 
===The communication functions===
{{main|Jakobson's functions of language}}
Influenced by the [[Organon-Model]] by [[Karl Bühler]], Jakobson distinguishes six communication functions, each associated with a dimension or factor of the [[communication]] process [n.b. – Elements from Bühler's theory appear in the diagram below in yellow and pink, Jakobson's elaborations in blue]:
*Functions
#referential (: contextual information)
#aesthetic/poetic (: auto-reflection)
#emotive (: self-expression)
#conative (: vocative or imperative addressing of receiver)
#phatic (: checking channel working)
#metalingual (: checking code working)&lt;ref name="Middleton"/&gt;

[[Image:Roma jakobson theory.png|center|&lt;ref name="Middleton"&gt;Middleton, Richard (1990/2002). ''Studying Popular Music'', p.241. Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One of the six functions is always the dominant function in a text and usually related to the type of text. In poetry, the dominant function is the poetic function: the focus is on the message itself. The true hallmark of poetry is according to Jakobson "the projection of the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection to the axis of combination". Very broadly speaking, it implies that poetry successfully combines and integrates form and function, that poetry turns the poetry of grammar into the grammar of poetry, so to speak. Jakobson's theory of communicative functions was first published in "Closing Statements: Linguistics and Poetics" (in [[Thomas A. Sebeok]], ''Style In Language'', Cambridge Massachusetts, MIT Press, 1960, pp.&amp;nbsp;350–377). Despite its wide adoption, the six-functions model has been criticized for lacking specific interest in the "play function" of language that, according to an early review by Georges Mounin, is "not enough studied in general by linguistics researchers".&lt;ref&gt;Mounin, Georges (1972) La linguistique du XX siècle. Presses Universitaires de France&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Jakobson's three principal ideas in linguistics play a major role in the field to this day: [[linguistic typology]], [[markedness]], and [[linguistic universals]]. The three concepts are tightly intertwined: typology is the classification of languages in terms of shared grammatical features (as opposed to shared origin), markedness is (very roughly) a study of how certain forms of grammatical organization are more "optimized" than others, and linguistic universals is the study of the general features of languages in the world. He also influenced [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s [[paradigmatic analysis]].&lt;ref name="Middleton"/&gt;

Jakobson has also influenced [[Friedemann Schulz von Thun]]'s [[four sides model]], as well as [[Michael Silverstein]]'s [[metapragmatics]], [[Dell Hymes]]'s [[ethnography of communication]] and [[ethnopoetics]], the psychoanalysis of [[Jacques Lacan]], and philosophy of [[Giorgio Agamben]].

Jakobson's legacy among researchers specializing in Slavics, and especially Slavic linguistics in North America, has been enormous, for example, [[Olga Yokoyama]].

==Life and work==
Saira Jamil Elizabeth Luiza Shah came from a middle-class Scottish family. Her future husband, Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, who was descended from the [[Sayyid|Sadaat]] of [[Paghman]], had settled in England before the first world war and she met him in Edinburgh during that war, where he was studying [[medicine]] at [[Edinburgh Medical School]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite journal

'''Shahina Farid''' is a British archaeologist who is best known for her work as  Field Director and Project Coordinator at the Neolithic site of [[Çatalhöyük]] in Turkey. She is currently the scientific dating coordinator for [[Historic England]].&lt;ref name="Scientific Dating" /&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Farid was born in [[London]], England to [[Pakistani]] parents who had migrated to England. She spent her early years in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], England and studied [[archaeology]] at the [[University of Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="TrowelBlazers" /&gt;

== Archaeological career ==

After college, Farid worked as a commercial [[archaeologist]] in England, Turkey, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref name="TrowelBlazers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shillito|first1=Lisa-Marie|title=Shahina Farid|url=http://trowelblazers.com/shahina-farid/|publisher=TrowelBlazers|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was hired as field director of the [[Çatalhöyük]] project in 1999 and worked for 20 years as Field Director and Project Coordinator at the Neolithic Site, until leaving in 2012.&lt;ref name="Scientific Dating"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Dating|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/research/methods/archaeology/scientific-dating/|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Her work in constructing the Çatalhöyük stratigraphic sequence is the cornerstone of countless archaeological and scientific studies, reflected in her publication record of over 40 articles and reports, and without her input, the famous Hodder 'reflexive methodology' would only be a theory".&lt;ref name="TrowelBlazers" /&gt;

In 2012, Farid joined [[English Heritage]]. As a member of the Scientific Dating Team, she directs the commissioned dendrochronology program and is also honorary secretary for the [[British Institute at Ankara]].&lt;ref name="Scientific Dating" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23647">The emergence of [[social media]] has changed the way in which political communication takes place in the [[Politics of the United States|United States]]. Political institutions such as politicians, [[political parties]], foundations, institutions, and political [[think tank]]s are all using social media platforms, like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], to communicate with and engage voters. Regular individuals, politicians, "[[pundit]]s" and [[thought leader]]s alike are able to voice their opinions, engage with a wide network, and connect with other likeminded individuals.&lt;ref name="Kearney2013"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kearney|first=Michael||date=2013|title=Political Discussion on Facebook: An Analysis of Interpersonal Goals and Disagreement|publisher= University of Kansas|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1808/12975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The active participation of social media users has been an increasingly important element in political communication, especially during political elections in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Skogerbø &amp; Arne H. Krumsvik, "Newspapers, Facebook and Twitter: Intermedial agenda setting in local election campaigns," Journalism Practice (2015) 9#3 DOI:10.1080/17512786.2014.950471&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media are changing the nature of political communication because they are tools that can be used to inform and mobilize users in new ways. Users are able to connect directly to politicians and campaign managers and engage in political activities in new ways. Each social media platform is programmed in code by developers, creating a unique digital architecture that influences how politicians and citizens can use the platform for political ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bossetta|first=Michael|date=March 2018|title=The Digital Architectures of Social Media: Comparing Political Campaigning on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat in the 2016 U.S. Election|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077699018763307|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=95(2)|pages=471-496|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by simply pressing the "[[like button]]" on [[Facebook]] or by following someone on [[Twitter]], users have the ability to connect with others and express their views in new ways. The option for users to share, like, or [[retweet]] political messages instantly has opened up a new avenue for politicians to reach out to voters. At the same time, social media campaigns can carry risks that are not present on traditional platforms, such as TV or newspaper ads. Whereas the political party controls all of the messaging on a TV or newspaper ad, in a social media campaign, critics and opposing party supporters can post negative comments immediately below campaign messages.

Politicians have a platform to communicate with that is different from the mainstream media. Politicians have the ability to raise large amounts of money in relatively short periods of time through social media campaigns. In 2012 president Obama raised over a billion dollars for his campaign, which broke the fundraising record. Around $690 million was raised through online donations including social media, email, and website donations and more money was raised from small donors than ever before.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scherer, Michael. “Exclusive: Obama’s 2012 Digital Fundraising Outperformed 2008.” Time. November 15, 2012. http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/15/exclusive-obamas-2012-digital-fundraising-outperformed-2008/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on elections==

===Early history===
Democrat [[Howard Dean]] is credited with being the first politician to use the Internet for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;”Campaign 2.0” Webspace at University of Texas at Austin.  April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Dean served as the Governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and decided to run for president for the 2004 election. Dean is credited with organizing the first campaign website, acting as a virtual headquarters for fundraising and volunteer recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Hindman, Matthew. “The Real Lessons of Howard Dean: Reflections on the First Digital Campaign.” Perspectives on Politics, 2005, p.121-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean’s website had a number of online metrics of success including the hits on his homepage, weblogs, campaign sign-ups, house parties and meet ups.&lt;ref&gt;Rospars, Joe. “How Howard Dean’s Scream Helped Obama Land The Presidency.” Time Magazine. July 1, 2014. http://time.com/2946448/howard-dean-scream-obama-president/&lt;/ref&gt; Dean’s supporters hosted house parties and invited individuals to learn about Dean’s campaign. Dean also encouraged use of the website [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]] for his upstart presidential campaign in 2002, making it easy for people "with a common interest to find each other and arrange to meet, face to face".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Individuals would attend face-to-face meetings to learn more about his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cornfield, Michael. “The Internet and Campaign: A Look Back at the Campaigners”.  Pew Research Center, 2005, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people coming out to Dean's Meetups in 600 location across the country ultimately reached about 143,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About 75,000 individuals attended these meet-ups and more than 96% of respondents reported that they wished to become actively involved in Dean’s campaign. The engagement in face-to-face local groups "dramatically affected how involved volunteers got with the campaign. The more Meetups people attended, the higher their average donation to the campaign".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/07/tech/web/meetup-2012-campaign-sifry/|title=From Howard Dean to the tea party: The power of Meetup.com|website=CNN|publisher=Cable News Network.|last1=Sifry|first1=Micah|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean won a "digital" [[primary election]] that was held on [[MoveOn.org]] with 44% of the votes. His success in the primary generated positive coverage by the news media. This early victory was important to the momentum of the campaign. Dean’s campaign was also viewed as a success for his ability to raise large amounts of money in small increments. In January 2004, his campaign had raised $41 million from supporters mostly online. A total of 318,884 individuals contributed to his campaign, with over 61% of the contributions under $200. Less than 1% of individuals gave $2,000, which was the federal limit.&lt;ref name=FEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Contribution Limits for 2003-2004|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/ContributionLimits2003-2004.htm|website=FEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dean’s fundraising behavior was opposite of his rivals. [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] raised $130.8 million in 2003 and 68% of his donations were the maximum donation limit.&lt;ref&gt;Justice, Glen. “Campaign Fund-Raising; Financial Firms are Bush’s Biggest Donors, Study Reports.”The New York Times.  January 9, 2004. https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/09/us/2004-campaign-fund-raising-financial-firms-are-bush-s-biggest-donors-study.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political Origins of Facebook===
[[Mark Zuckerberg]] served as a field organizer for Democrat [[John Kerry]] in the 2004 presidential election.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Slotnick, Allison. “Friend the President”.  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zuckerberg was responsible for [[Get out the vote]] and mobilization efforts.  Facebook was launched the same year. The [[Facebook Platform]] relies on group formation and constant communication, both of which are goals for any political campaign.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
[[Chris Hughes]], a founding member and developer at Facebook, left the company to work as an advisor for President Barack Obama. While working at Facebook, Hughes designed a Facebook profile for the then presidential candidate. Following his departure, Hughes worked on Obama’s Facebook page and utilized his knowledge of [[content management]] and new developments to outpace other candidates in relation to their online presence.&lt;ref&gt;McGirt, Ellen. “How Chris Hughes helped launch Facebook and the Barack Obama Campaign.” Fast Company Magazine. April 2009. http://www.fastcompany.com/1207594/how-chris-hughes-helped-launch-facebook-and-barack-obama-campaign&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes created the website MyBarak0bama.com which had a similar layout and concept as Facebook.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== 2008 Presidential Election ===
The 2008 presidential election was the first election in which candidates utilized the Internet and social media as a tool for their campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, David. “How Obama Tapped Into Social Networks’ Power.” New York Times. November 9, 2008. https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10carr.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Then President-elect Barack Obama was the first to use the Internet to organize supporters, advertise, and communicate with individuals in a way that had been impossible in previous elections.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Miller, Claire Cain. “How Obama’s Internet Campaign Changed Politics.” New York Times. November 7, 2008. http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/how-obamas-internet-campaign-changed-politics/&lt;/ref&gt; Obama utilized sites like [[YouTube]] to advertise through videos. The videos posted on YouTube by Obama’s were viewed for 14.5 million hours.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Jessica. “The YouTube Election.” Newsweek. November 9, 2008. http://www.newsweek.com/youtube-election-85069&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 Presidential Election===
By the 2012 election more candidates were utilizing a wider array of social media platforms.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Fouhy, Beth. “Elections 2012: The Social Network, Presidential Campaign Edition.” Huffington Post. April 17, 2011 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/17/elections-2012-social-media_n_850172.html&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians were now on social networking sites like [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]] and other new social media tools and [[mobile apps]]. Some of the candidates used social media sites to announce their candidacy. [[Barack Obama]] emailed a video to 13 million when he announced his intention to run for re-election and [[Mitt Romney]]  sent out a [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweet]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Other candidates posted on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to announce their candidacy.

There is a clear difference between the Obama and Romney campaign's presence on social media throughout the 2012 campaign. In October 2012, President Obama had over 20 million followers on [[Twitter]] and Romney had 1.2 million. On [[Facebook]] Obama had over 29 million likes on his page and Romney had 7.9 million. On [[Instagram]] Obama had 1.4 million followers and Romney had 38,000 followers. President Obama had higher followers on all of his other social media accounts including [[Spotify]] [[Pinterest]] and [[YouTube]],&lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Jenna. “The Presidential Campaign on Social Media.” The New York Times. October 8, 2012. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/08/technology/campaign-social-media.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; though research suggests merely following Obama or Romney on social media sites such as Facebook may have had little influence on voter behaviors.&lt;ref name="Pennington2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pennington|first1=Natalie|last2=Winfrey|first2=Kelly| last3=Warner|first3=Benjamin|last4=Kearney|first4=Michael|title=Liking Obama and Romney (on Facebook): An experimental evaluation of political engagement and efficacy during the 2012 general election|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=44|year=2015|pages=279–283|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama also utilized his social media accounts more than any other candidate online.&lt;ref&gt;“How the Presidential Candidates Use the Web and Social Media: Obama Leads but Neither Candidate Engages in Much Dialogue with Voters.” Pew Research Center Journalism &amp; Media. August 15, 2012 http:// www.journalism.org/2012/08/15/how-presidential-candidates-use-web-and-social-media/&lt;/ref&gt; He actively posted more on Twitter, YouTube and on his personal website [[blog]].

President Obama’s campaign thrived on online donations in both 2008 and 2012. In 2008 3.95 million people donated to president Obama’s campaign.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; That number reached 4.4 million people during his 2012 campaign. The total online donation also rose from $500 million in 2008 to $690 million in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===2016 Presidential campaign===
{{main|Social media in the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign}}

===Limitations and constraints===
[[Social media]] has been used in political campaigns ranging from small local elections to larger-scale presidential elections. According to [[Wael Ghonim]], social media can reinforce pre-existing beliefs rather than promote new ones. Social media, while a great source of gathering volunteers and money, serves the main purpose of affirming political beliefs and strengthening a political base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another limitation of the way social media is used in political campaigns is that politicians cannot control the conversation. According to a study by Miguel del Fresno García, Alan J. Daly, and Sagrario Segado Sánchez-Cabezudo, regular friends and followers hold high levels of influence on social media, instead of blogs and campaign pages. Users with the most influence over social media fall into three different categories: users who disseminate knowledge, those who engage other people, and those who lead conversations. These three types of users are the ones who others tend to follow and listen to through social media. Therefore, for political campaigns to truly reach as many people as possible, political groups first need to get those three users talking about their campaigns on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While "critics [may] worry that governance by social media will cheapen the power of the presidency by substituting hashtag activism for serious policymaking," President Obama's Administration has been credited with successfully "[leveraging] the opportunities of the digital age to maximum political advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2015/05/26/heres-how-the-first-president-of-the-social-media-age-has-chosen-to-connect-with-americans/|title=Here's how the first president of the social media age has chosen to connect with Americans|website=The Washington Post|publisher=WP Company LLC|last1=Eilperin|first1=Juliet|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals==
Scandals have been a part of the American political system since its inception (see [[List of federal political scandals in the United States]]). [[Political scandals]] are events that capture a lot of attention and eventually disappear over and are the source of intense public communication. The media has subsequently played an important role in both the breaking of these stories and the coverage they receive. In recent decades there have been an increased number of scandals relating to the Internet and social media.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Arsenault, Amelia. “Scandal Politics in the New Media Environment” Analytical Note: Scandal Politics Review. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most notable political scandal related to social media has been the demise of Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] in 2011. Weiner, a Democrat from New York, sent a link of a suggestive photograph to a woman on his public Twitter account. The tweet and picture were then sent to [[Andrew Breitbart]] , a conservative blogger, who posted them to his website before Weiner had a chance to take the tweet down.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Alex. “Weinergate: Anatomy of Social Media Scandal” Time.  May 31, 2011. http://swampland.time.com/2011/05/31/weinergate-anatomy-of-a-social-media-scandal/&lt;/ref&gt; Within days the Anthony Weiner incident became national news. The scandal, nicknamed [[Weinergate]],  is widely considered to be the first political sex scandal to come about as a result of social media.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, William. “Weinergate’s Lasting Impact: The First Big Social Media Political Sex Scandal.” Huffington Post. June 7, 2011. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-bradley/weinergates-lasting-impac_b_872585.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other political scandals have emerged as a result of social media. [[Joe Miller (Alaska politician)|Joe Miller]] a Senate candidate from Alaska tweeted about decorating his office prior to any announcement that he had won the race. Miller deleted the tweets, but not before a blogger was able to screen shot them. Miller eventually lost the election.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Bosker, Bianca. “The Most Embarrassing Politician Twitter Scandals.” The Huffington Post. August 3, 2011. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/03/politicians-top-twitter-s_n_870967.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meg Whitman]] a Republican candidate in California was embarrassed following a tweet sent out by her press secretary that included a YouTube video of a cross-dressed musician. Whitman lost the election to [[Jerry Brown]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; [[Pete Hoekstra]], a Michigan Congressman, got into trouble after tweeting throughout a trip to [[Iraq]], in which he breached security by posting confidential details about the visit.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; There is a changing nature of political scandals that has resulted from the increased use of social media and the Internet. Politicians are increasingly more vulnerable online as the separation between public and private life has quickly diminished in the increasingly more connected world.&lt;ref&gt;Lunt and Livingstone. Media and Communications Regulation &amp; The Public Interest. Sage Publication. April 4, 2011 http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/45145_Lunt_and_Livingstone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Political scandals are shifting from illegal or corrupt activities towards personal missteps no longer about illegal or corrupt activities.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

on October 26, 2018 social network Facebook announced that it has deleted 82 accounts created in [[Iran]] that included posts advocating harsh issues such as race, immigration, and U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], . . ..  just before U.S. congressional elections on November 6.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.radiofarda.com/a/facebook-deletes-iran-linked-accounts-followed-by-1-million-us-britain-political-divisive-sow-discord/29566728.html Facebook Deletes Iran-Linked Accounts Followed By 1 Million In U.S., Britain]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition''' ({{lang-es|Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisición|links=no}}), commonly known as the '''Spanish Inquisition''' (''Inquisición española''), was established in 1478 by [[Catholic Monarchs]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]]. It was intended to maintain [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] orthodoxy in their kingdoms and to replace the [[Medieval Inquisition]], which was under [[Pope|Papal control]]. It became the most substantive of the three different manifestations of the wider [[Inquisition|Catholic Inquisition]] along with the [[Roman Inquisition]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]. The "Spanish Inquisition" may be defined broadly, operating in Spain and in all Spanish colonies and territories, which included the Canary Islands, the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and all Spanish possessions in [[Spanish America|North, Central, and South America]]. According to modern estimates, around 150,000 were prosecuted for various offenses during the three centuries of duration of the Spanish Inquisition, out of which between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.

The Inquisition was originally intended primarily to identify [[heretics]] among those who converted from Judaism and Islam to Catholicism. The regulation of the faith of newly converted Catholics was intensified after the [[Alhambra Decree|royal decrees]] issued in 1492 and 1502 ordering Jews and Muslims to convert to Catholicism or leave [[Crown of Castile|Castile]].&lt;ref name="Prien2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans-Jürgen Prien|title=Christianity in Latin America: Revised and Expanded Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSAbYoBGmxQC|date=21 November 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-22262-5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, during the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]], after a period of declining influence in the preceding century.

The Spanish Inquisition is often cited in popular literature and history as an example of religious intolerance and repression. However, some historians have come to conclude that many of the charges levied against the Inquisition are exaggerated, and are a result of the [[Black Legend#The Spanish Black Legend|Black Legend]] produced by political and religious enemies of Spain, especially England.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen: The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Previous Inquisitions==
The [[Inquisition]] was created through [[papal bull]], ''[[Ad Abolendam]]'', issued at the end of the 12th century by [[Pope Lucius III]] to combat the [[Albigensian|Albigensian heresy]] in southern France. There were a large number of tribunals of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Papal Inquisition]] in various European kingdoms during the Middle Ages through different diplomatic and political means. In the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition was established by the statute of ''Excommunicamus'' of Pope [[Gregory IX]], in 1232, during the era of the [[Albigensian]] heresy, as a condition for peace with Aragon. The Inquisition was ill-received by the Aragonese, which led to prohibitions against insults or attacks on it. Rome was particularly concerned about the 'heretical' influence of the Iberian peninsula's large Muslim and Jewish population on the Catholic. It pressed the kingdoms to accept the Papal Inquisition after Aragon. Navarra conceded in the 13th century and Portugal by the end of the 14th, however its 'Roman Inquisition' was famously inactive. Castile refused steadily, trusting on its prominent position in Europe and its military power to keep the Pope's interventionism in check. By the end of the Middle Ages, [[England]], due to distance and voluntary compliance, and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (future part of Spain) due to resistance and power, were the only Western European kingdoms to successfully resist establishment of the Inquisition in their realms.

===Medieval Inquisition in Aragon===
Although [[Raymond of Penyafort]] was not an inquisitor, as a canon lawyer and the king's advisor, [[James I of Aragon]], had often consulted him on questions of law regarding the practices of the Inquisition in the king's domains.
"...[T]he lawyer's deep sense of justice and equity, combined with the worthy Dominican's sense of compassion, allowed him to steer clear of the excesses that were found elsewhere in the formative years of the inquisitions into heresy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BEfrDPxlraYC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=Raymond+of+Penyafort+%2B+inquisition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VZ5vbpyeWK&amp;sig=DNuuDEXkW1ypFlYVBrL5Ugb0P8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwxaWi7KPLAhXHw4MKHbH7Dx8Q6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Raymond%20of%20Penyafort%20%20%20inquisition&amp;f=false Smith, Damian J., ''Crusade, Heresy and Inquisition in the Lands of the Crown of Aragon'', Brill, 2010] {{ISBN|9789004182899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its early implantation, the Papal inquisition was greatly resisted within the crown of Aragon by both population and monarchs.
With time, its importance was diluted, and, by the middle of the fifteenth century, it was almost forgotten although still there according to the law.

Regarding the living conditions of minorities, the kings of Aragon and other monarchies imposed some discriminatory taxation of religious minorities, so false conversions were a way of tax evasion.

In addition to said discriminatory legislation, Aragon had laws specifically targeted at protecting minorities. For example, crusades attacking Jewish or Muslim subjects of the King of Aragon while on their way to fight in the reconquest were punished with death by hanging. Up to the 14th century, the census and weddings records show an absolute lack of concern with avoiding intermarriage or blood mixture so present in other areas. Both the Roman Inquisition and neighbouring Christian powers showed discomfort with these two aspects of Aragonese law and lack of concern with ethnicity, but to little effect.
High-ranking officials of Jewish religion were not as common as in Castile, but were not unheard of either.&lt;ref&gt;Parrilla, Gonzalo Fernández, Miguel Hernando De Larramendi, and José Sangrador Gil.

(Thught and Idea Propagation across the Mediterranean: The Role of Translators) Cuenca: Servicio De Publicaciones De La Universidad De Castilla-La Mancha, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was said to have Jewish ancestry &lt;ref&gt;Cervera, César:  "La ascendencia judía del Rey Fernando «El Católico» y su primo el II Duque de Alba" ABC, 03/06/2015 08:34h https://www.abc.es/espana/20150602/abci-ascendencia-judia-fernando-catolico-201506011949.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Inquisition in Castile===

There was never a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], nor any inquisition during the Middle Ages. Members of the [[episcopate]] were charged with surveillance of the faithful and punishment of transgressors, always under the direction of the king.

During the Middle Ages, in Castile, little to no attention was paid to heresy by the Catholic ruling class, or by the population. Castile didn´t see proliferation of anti-Jew pamphlets like England and France did during the 13th and 14th century, and those who have been found had modified, somehow watered down versions form the original stories&lt;ref&gt;Hassán, Iacob; Izquierdo Benito, Ricardo (2001). Universidad de Castilla La Mancha, ed. Judíos en la literatura española(Jews in Spanish Literature). España&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}. Jews and Muslims were tolerated and generally allowed to follow their traditional customs in domestic matters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The legislation regarding Muslims and Jews in Castilian territory varied greatly, becoming more intolerant during the period of great instability and dynastic wars that occurred by the end of the 14th century. The Castilian law is particularly difficult to summarize since due to the model of the free [[Royal Villas]] mayors and the population of border areas had the right to create their own [[fueros]] (law) that varied from one villa to the next. In general, the Castilian model was parallel to the initial model of Islamic Spain. Non-Catholics were subject to discriminatory legislation regarding taxation and some other specific discriminatory legislation-such as prohibition of wearing silk or "flashy clothes" &lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"&gt;Suárez Fernández, Luis (2012). La expulsión de los judíos. Un problema europeo. Barcelona: Ariel.&lt;/ref&gt;- that varied from county to county, but were left alone besides that. Forced conversion of minorities was against the law, and so was the belief in the existence of witchcraft, oracles or similar superstitions. In general, all "people from the book" were permitted to practice their own customs and religions as far as they did not attempt proselytizing on the Christian population. Jews particularly had surprising freedoms and protections compared to other areas of Europe and were allowed to hold high public offices such as the counselor, treasurer or secretary for the crown.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

During most of the medieval period intermarriage with converts was allowed and encouraged. The intellectual cooperation between religions was the norm in Castile. Some examples are the [[Toledo School of Translators]] from the 11th century. Jews and moriscos were allowed to hold high offices in the administration.&lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2018}}

A tightening of the laws to protect the right of Jews to collect loans during the Medieval Crisis, was one of the causes of the revolt against [[Peter the Cruel]] and catalyst of the anti-semitic episodes of 1490 in Castile, a kingdom that had shown no significant antisemitic backlash to the black death and drought crisis of the early 14th century. Even after the sudden increase in hostility towards other religions that the kingdom experienced after the 14th century crisis, which clearly worsened the living conditions of non-Catholics in Castile, it remained one of the most tolerant kingdoms in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, César Mantilla.

The kingdom had serious tensions with Rome regarding the Church's attempts to extend its authority into it. A focuss of conflict was Castilian resistance to truly abandon the [[mozarabic rite]], and the refusal to grant Papal control over Reconquest land (a request Aragon and Portugal conceded). These conflicts added up with a strong resistance to allow the creation of an Inquisition, and the kingdom´s general willingness to accept the heretics that came in seeking refuge from prosecution in France.

==Creation of the Spanish Inquisition==
There are several hypotheses of what prompted the creation of the tribunal after [[La Convivencia|centuries of outstanding tolerance]] (within the context of medieval Europe). The truth is probably a combination of varieties of them.

===The "Too Multi-Religious" hypothesis===
The Spanish Inquisition (Inquisición Española) can be interpreted as a response to the multi-religious nature of Spanish society following the [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the Muslim [[Moors]]. After invading in 711, large areas of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by Muslims until 1250, when they were restricted to Granada, which fell in 1492. However, the Reconquista did not result in the total expulsion of Muslims from Spain, since they, along with Jews, were tolerated by the ruling Christian elite. Large cities, especially [[Seville]], [[Valladolid]] and [[Barcelona]], had significant Jewish populations centered in [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Juderia]], but in the coming years the Muslims were increasingly subjugated by alienation and torture.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Post-reconquest medieval Spain has been characterized by [[Americo Castro]] as a society of relatively peaceful co-existence (''convivencia'') punctuated by occasional conflict among the ruling Catholics and the Jews and Muslims. However, as historian Henry Kamen notes, the "so-called convivencia was always a relationship between unequals."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their legal inequality, there was a long tradition of Jewish service to the crown of Aragon and Jews occupied many important posts, both religious and political. Castile itself had an unofficial [[rabbi]]. Ferdinand's father [[John II of Castile|John II]] named the Jewish [[Abiathar Crescas]] to be Court [[Astronomer]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Antisemitic]] attitudes increased all over Europe during the late 13th century and throughout the 14th century. England and France expelled their [[Jewish]] populations in 1290 and 1306 respectively.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=79}}  At the same time, during the [[Reconquista]], Spain's anti-Jewish sentiment steadily increased. This prejudice climaxed in the summer of 1391 when violent anti-Jewish riots broke out in Spanish cities like [[Barcelona]]{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=82}}  To linguistically distinguish them from non-converted or long-established Catholic families, new converts were called [[conversos]], or New Catholics.

According to Don [[Hasdai Crescas]], persecution against Jews began in earnest in [[Seville]] in 1391, on the 1st day of the lunar month Tammuz (June).&lt;ref name="Crescas"&gt;Letter of Hasdai Crescas, ''Shevaṭ Yehudah'' by [[Solomon ibn Verga]] (ed.

See pages 138 – 140 in PDF (Hebrew); Fritz Kobler, ''Letters of the Jews through the Ages'', London 1952, pp. 272–75.&lt;/ref&gt; From there, the violence had spread to [[Majorca]] and by the 1st day of the lunar month Elul it had also reached the Jews of [[Barcelona]] in [[Catalonia]], where the slain were estimated at two-hundred and fifty. So, too, many Jews who resided in the neighboring provinces of [[Province of Lleida|Lérida]] and Gironda and in the kingdom of  [[Valencia, Spain|València]] had been affected,&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon ibn Verga]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/39487 ''Shevaṭ Yehudah'' (The Sceptre of Judah)], Lvov 1846, pp. 41 (end) – 42 in PDF); {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=17}}. Kamen cites approximate numbers for Valencia (250) and Barcelona (400), but no solid data about Córdoba.&lt;/ref&gt; as were also the Jews of [[Al-Andalus]] (Andalucía),&lt;ref&gt;According to Gedaliah Ibn Yechia, these disturbances were caused by a malicious report spread about the Jews. See: [[Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph|Gedaliah Ibn Yechia]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6618 ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah''] Jerusalem 1962, p. רסח, in PDF p. 277 (top) (Hebrew); Solomon ibn Verga, ''Shevat Yehudah'', Lvov 1846 (p. 76 in PDF) (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas many died a martyr’s death, while others converted in order to save themselves.

Encouraged by the preaching of [[Ferrand Martinez]], [[Archdeacon]] of [[Ecija]], the general unrest affected nearly all of the Jews in Spain, during which time an estimated 200,000 Jews changed their religion or else concealed their religion, becoming known in Hebrew as "Anūsim",&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Zacuto]], ''Sefer Yuchasin'', [[Cracow]] 1580 (q.v. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/11550 ''Sefer Yuchasin''], p. 266 in PDF) (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, "those who are compelled [to hide their religion]." Only a handful of the more principal persons of the Jewish community managed to escape, who had found refuge among the viceroys in the outlying towns and districts.&lt;ref name="Crescas" /&gt;

Forced baptism was contrary to the law of the Catholic Church, and theoretically anybody who had been forcibly baptized could legally return to Judaism. Legal definitions of the time theoretically acknowledged that a forced baptism was not a valid sacrament, but confined this to cases where it was literally administered by physical force: a person who had consented to baptism under threat of death or serious injury was still regarded as a voluntary convert, and accordingly forbidden to revert to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond of Peñafort]], ''Summa'', lib. 1 p.33, citing D.45 c.5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the public violence, many of the converted "felt it safer to remain in their new religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after 1391, a new social group appeared and were referred to as ''[[conversos]]'' or ''New Christians''. Many ''conversos'', now freed from the anti-Semitic restrictions imposed on Jewish employment, attained important positions in fifteenth century Spain, including positions in the government and in the Church. Among many others, physicians [[Andrés Laguna]] and Francisco Lopez Villalobos (Ferdinand's court physician), writers [[Juan del Enzina]], [[Juan de Mena]], [[Diego de Valera]] and [[Alonso de Palencia]], and bankers [[Luis de Santangel]] and Gabriel Sanchez (who financed the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]]) were all ''conversos''. ''Conversos'' – not without opposition – managed to attain high positions in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, at times becoming severe detractors of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Notably Bishop [[Pablo de Santa Maria]], author of ''Scrutinium Scripturarum'', [[Jeronimo de Santa Fe]] (''Hebraomastix'') and [[Pedro de la Caballeria]] (''Zelus Christi contra Judaeos''). All three were ''conversos''. ({{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=39}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Some even received titles of nobility, and as a result, during the following century some works attempted to demonstrate that virtually all of the nobles of Spain were descended from Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Notably the ''Libro verde de Aragon'' and ''Tizón de la nobleza de España'' (cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=38}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Enforcement Across Borders" hypothesis===
According to this hypothesis, the Inquisition was created to standardize the variety of laws and many jurisdictions Spain was divided into. It would be an administrative program analogous to the [[Santa Hermandad]] (the "Holy Brotherhood", a law enforcement body, answering to the crown, that prosecuted thieves and criminals across counties in a way local county authorities could not, ancestor to the [[Guardia Civil]]), an institution that would guarantee uniform prosecution of crimes against royal laws across all local jurisdictions.

The Kingdom of Castile had been prosperous and successful in Europe thanks in part to the unusual authority and control the king exerted over the nobility, which ensured political stability and kept the kingdom from being weakened by in-fighting (as was the case in England, for example). However, under the [[Trastamara]] dynasty, both the kings of Castile and Aragon had lost power to the great nobles, who now formed dissenting and conspiratorial factions. Taxation and varying privileges differed from county to county, and powerful noble families constantly extorted the kings to attain further concessions, particularly in Aragon.

The main goals of the reign of the Catholic Monarchs were to strengthen royal power to guarantee stability, and to unite their two kingdoms. In this, they sought to further unify the laws of their realms and reduce the power of the nobility in certain local areas. They attained this partially by raw military strength, by creating a combined army between the two of them that could outmatch the army of most noble coalitions in the Peninsula. However, it was impossible to change the entire laws of both realms by force alone, and due to reasonable suspicion of one another, the monarchs kept their kingdoms separate during their lifetimes. The only way to unify both kingdoms and ensure that Isabella, Ferdinand, and their descendants maintained the power of both kingdoms without uniting them in life was to find, or create, an executive, legislative and judicial arm directly under the Crown empowered to act in both kingdoms. This goal, the hypothesis goes, might have given birth to the Spanish Inquisition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Spanish Inquisition: a History. Joseph Pérez - Yale University Press - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious organization to oversee this role was obvious: Catholicism was the only institution common to both kingdoms, and the only one with enough popular support that the nobility could not easily attack it. Through the Spanish Inquisition, Isabella and Ferdinand created a personal police force and personal code of law that rested above the structure of their respective realms without altering it or mixing them, and that could operate freely in both. As the Inquisition had the backing of both kingdoms, it would exist independent of both the nobility and local interests of either kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joseph (2012) [2009]. Breve Historia de la Inquisición en España. Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|978-84-08-00695-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, the prosecution of heretics would be secondary, or simply not considered different at the time from the prosecution of conspirators, traitors, or groups of any kind who planned to resist royal authority. At the time, royal authority rested on divine right and on oaths of loyalty held before God, so the connection between religious deviation and political disloyalty would appear obvious. This hypothesis is supported by the disproportionately high representation of the nobility and high clergy among those investigated by the Inquisition, as well as by the many administrative and civil crimes the inquisition prosecuted. The Inquisition prosecuted the counterfeiting of royal seals and currency, ensured the effective transmission of the orders of the kings, and verified the authenticity of official documents traveling through the kingdoms, especially from one kingdom to the other. See "Non-Religious Crimes".&lt;ref&gt;Canessa De Sanguinetti, Marta. El Bien Nacer: Limpieza De Oficios Y Limpieza De Sangre : Raíces Ibéricas De Un Mal Latinoamericano. Taurus, Ediciones Santillana, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The "Placate Europe" hypothesis===

At a time in which most of Europe had already [[History of the Jews in the Middle Ages|expelled the Jews from the Christian kingdoms]] the "dirty blood" of Spaniards was met with open suspicion and contempt by the rest of Europe. As the world became smaller and foreign relations became more relevant to stay in power this foreign image of "being the seed of jews and moors" may have become a problem. In addition, the coup that allowed Isabella to take the throne from [[Joana of Portugal|Joana of Avis]] and the Catholic Monarchs to marry had estranged Castile from Portugal, its historical ally, and created the need for new relationships. Similarly, Aragon's ambitions lay in control of the Mediterranean and the defence against France. As their [[Catholic Monarchs|policy of royal marriages]] proved, the Catholic Monarchs were deeply concerned about France's growing power and expected to create strong dynastic alliances across Europe. In this scenario, the Iberian reputation of being too tolerant was a problem. 
Despite the prestige earned through the reconquest ([[reconquista]]) that foreign image on Spaniards coexisted with an almost universal image of heretics and "bad Christians" due to the long coexistence between the three religions, they had accepted in their lands. Anti-Jews stereotypes created to justify or prompt the expulsion and expropriation of the European Jews were also applied to Spaniards in most European courts, and the idea of them being "greedy, gold-thirsty, cruel and violent", "like Jews", due to the "Jewish and Moorish blood" was prevalent in Europe before America was discovered by Europeans. Chronicles by foreign travelers circulated through Europe, describing the tolerant ambiance reigning in the court of Isabela and Ferdinand and how Moors and Jews were free to go about without anyone trying to convert them. Past and common clashes between the Pope and the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, regarding the Inquisition in Castile's case and regarding South Italy in Aragon's case, also reinforced their image of heretics in the international courts. These accusations and image could have direct political and military consequences at the time, especially considering that the union two powerful kingdoms were a particularly delicate moment that could prompt the fear and violent reactions from neighbors, even more, if combined with the expansion of the Ottoman Turks on the Mediterranean.
The creation of the Inquisition and the expulsion of both Jews and Moriscos may have been part of a strategy to whitewash the image of Spain and ease international fears regarding Spain's allegiance. In this scenario, the creation of the Inquisition could have been part of the catholic's Monarch strategy to " turn" away from African allies and "towards" Europe, a tool to turn both actual Spain and Spanish image more European and improve relations with the Pope.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Elvira, Roca Barea María, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos Y El Imperio Español. Madrid: Siruela, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Ottoman Scare" hypothesis===

No matter if any of the previous hypotheses were already operating in the minds of the monarchs, the alleged discovery of Morisco plots to support a possible Ottoman invasion were crucial factors in their decision to create the Inquisition.

At this time, the Ottoman Empire was in expansion and making its power noticeable in the Mediterranean and North Africa. At the same time, the Aragonese Mediterranean Empire was crumbling under debt and war exhaustion. Ferdinand reasonably feared that he would not be capable of repelling an Ottoman attack to Spain's shores, especially if the Ottomans had internal help. The regions with the highest concentration of Moriscos were those close to the common naval crossings between Spain and Africa. If the weakness of the Aragonese Naval Empire was combined with the resentment of the higher nobility against the monarchs, the dynastic [[War of the Castilian Succession|claims of Portugal on Castile]] and the two monarch's exterior politic that turned away from Morocco and other African nations in favor of Europe, the fear of a second Muslim invasion - and thus a second Muslim occupation was hardly unfounded. This fear may have been the base reason for the expulsion of those citizens who had either a religious reason to support the invasion of the Ottomans (Moriscos) or no particular religious reason to not do it (Jews). The Inquisition might have been part of the preparations to enforce these measures and ensure their effectiveness by rooting out false converts that would still pose a threat of foreign espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Abou Al Fadl, K. (1994). Islamic law and Muslim minorities: the juristic discourse on Muslim minorities from the second/eight to the eleventh/seventeenth centuries. Islamic Law and Society, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goosenes, A. (1997). Les inquisitions modernes dans les Pays-Bas meridionaux. 1520-1633. 2 vols. Bruselas&lt;/ref&gt;

In favor of this view there is the obvious military sense it makes, and the many early attempts of peaceful conversion and persuasion that the Monarchs used at the beginning of their reign, and the sudden turn towards the creation of the Inquisition and the edicts of expulsion when those initial attempts failed. The [[History of Naples|conquest of Naples]] by the [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba|Gran Capitan]] is also proof of an interest in Mediterranean expansion and re-establishment of Spanish power in that sea that was bound to generate frictions with the Ottoman Empire and other African nations. So, the Inquisition would have been created as a permanent body to prevent the existence of citizens with religious sympathies with African nations now that rivalry with them had been deemed unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Boronat, P. (1901). Los moriscos españoles y su expulsión. 2 vols. Valencia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical and Religious Reasons===

The creation of the Spanish Inquisition would be consistent with the most important political philosophers of the [[Florentine School]], with whom the kings were known to have contact ([[Guicciardini]], [[Pico della Mirandola]], [[Machiavelli]], Segni, Pitti, Nardi, Varchi…). Both Guicciardini and Machiavelli defended the importance of centralization and unification in order to create a strong state capable of repelling foreign invasions, and also warned of the dangers of excessive social uniformity to the creativity and innovation of a nation. Machiavelli considered piety and morals desirable for the subjects but not so much for the ruler, whom should use them as a way to unify its population. He also warned of the nefarious influence of a corrupt church in the creation of a selfish population and middle nobility,  which had fragmented the peninsula and made it unable to resist either France or Aragon. German philosophers at the time were spreading the importance of a vassal to share the religion of their lord.

The Inquisition may have just been the result of putting these ideas into practice. The use of religion as a unifying factor across a land that was allowed to stay diverse and maintain different laws in other respects, and the creation of the Inquisition to enforce laws across it, maintain said religious unity and control the local elites were consistent with most of those teachings.

Alternatively, the enforcement of Catholicism across the realm might indeed be the result of simple religious devotion or a belief in a mystic religious ditty by the monarchs. The recent scholarship on the expulsion of the Jews leans towards the belief of religious motivations being at the bottom of it.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Nancy Rubin. Isabella of Castile: The First Renaissance Queen. New York: ASJA Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; but considering the reports on Ferdinand's political persona that is unlikely to be the only reason. Ferdinand was described, among others, by Machiavelli, as "a man who didn't know the meaning of piety, but who made political use of it and would had achieved little if he had really known it." He was Machiavelli's main inspiration while writing [[The Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Robert. Machiavelli. Abigdon, Oxon: Routledge, Tylor &amp;, 2013. pp83-120 (the quote is paraphrased)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Keeping the Pope in Check" hypothesis===

The hierarchy of the Catholic Church had made many attempts during the Middle Ages to take over Christian Spain politically, such as claiming the Church's ownership over all land reconquered from non Christians (a claim that was rejected by Castille but accepted by Aragon and Portugal). In the past, the papacy had tried and partially succeeded, in forcing out of Iberia the [[mozarabic rite]]. Its meddling attempts had been pivotal for [[Albigensian crusade|Aragon's lose of Rosellon]]. The [[Crusade of Aragon|meddling regarding Aragon's control over South Italy]] was even stronger historically. In their lifetime, the Catholic Monarchs had [[Carrillo de Acuña|problems with]] [[Pope Paul II]], a very strong proponent of absolute authority of the church over the Kings. Carrillo actively opposed them both and often used Spain's "mixed blood" as an excuse to intervene. The papacy and the monarch of Europe had been involved in a  [[Investiture controversy|war for power all through the high Middle Ages]] that Rome had already won in other powerful kingdoms like [[France]].
Since the legitimacy granted by the church was necessary both, especially Isabella, to stay in power, the creation of the Spanish Inquisition may have been a way to apparently concede to the Pope's demands and criticism regarding Spain's mixed religious heritage, while at the same time ensuring that the Pope could hardly force the second inquisition of his own, and at the same time create a tool to control the power of the Roman Church in Spain.
The Spanish Inquisition was unique at the time because it did not depend on the Pope in the slightest. Once the bull of creation was granted the head of the inquisition was the Monarch of Spain. It was in charge of enforcing the laws of the king regarding religion and other private-life matters, not of following orders from Rome, from which was independent. This independence allowed the Inquisition to investigate, prosecute and convict clergy for both corruptions ([[pedophilia]], forgery of documents..) and possible charges of treason of conspiracy against the crown (on the Pope's behalf presumably) without the Pope's intervention. The inquisition was, despite of its title of "Holy", not formed necessarily by clergy but secular lawyers were equally welcome to it. If it was an attempt at keeping Rome out of Spain, it was an extremely successful and refined one. It was a bureaucratic body which had the nominal authority of the church and permission to prosecute members of the church, which the kings couldn't do while responding only to the Spanish Crown. This did not prevent the Pope from having influence on the decisions of Spanish monarchs of course, but it forced the influence to be through the kings and made direct influence very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;El Rey Y El Papa: Política Y Diplomacia En Los Albores Del Renacimiento (Castilla En El Siglo Xv) Óscar González - Sílex - 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other hypotheses===
Other hypotheses that circulate regarding the Spanish Inquisition's creation include:
*'''Economic reasons''': Since one of the penalties that the inquisition could enforce on the convicts was the confiscation of their property, which became Crown property, it has been stated that the creation of the Inquisition was a way to finance the crown. There is no solid reason for this hypothesis to stand alone, nor for the Kings of Spain to need an institution to do this gradually instead of confiscating property through edicts, but it may be one of the reasons why the Inquisition stayed for so long. This hypothesis notices the tendency of the Inquisition to operate in large and wealthy cities and is favoured for those who consider that most of those prosecuted for practising Judaism and Islam in secret were actually innocent of it.&lt;ref name="Spain 1966"&gt;The Marranos of Spain. From the late XIVth to the early XVIth Century, 1966. Ithaca, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gustav Bergenroth]] editor and translator of the Spanish state papers 1485-1509 believed that revenue was the incentive for Ferdinand and Isabella's decision to invite the Inquisition into Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/spain/vol1/i-lxxiii Calendar of State Papers, Spain, Vol. 1, 1485-1509; intro.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors point out that both monarchs were very aware of the economic backlash they would suffer from such decrease in population.
*'''Intolerance and racism''': This argument is usually made regarding the expulsion of the Jews or the Moriscos,&lt;ref name="Spain 1966"/&gt; and since the Inquisition was so closely interconnected with those actions can be expanded to it. It varies between those who deny that Spain was really that different to the rest of Europe regarding tolerance and openmindedness, and those who argue that it used to be but gradually the antisemitic and racism atmosphere of medieval Europe rubbed onto it. It explains the creation of the Inquisition as the result of exactly the same forces than the creation of similar entities across Europe. This view may account for the similarities between the Spanish Inquisition and similar institutions but completely fails to account for its many unique characteristics, including its time of appearance and its duration through time, so even if accepted requires the addition of some of the other hypothesis to be complete.&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish Inquisition: a History
Joseph Pérez - Yale University Press - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Purely religious reasons''': essentially this view suggests that the Catholic Monarchs created the Inquisition to prosecute heretics and sodomites "because the Bible says so". A common criticism that this view receives is that the Bible also condemns greed, hypocrisy, and adultery, but the Inquisition was not in charge of prosecuting any of those things. It also did not prosecute those who did not go to mass on Sunday or otherwise broke the Catholic rituals as far as it was out of simple laziness. Considering this double standard, its role was probably more complex and specific.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Activity of the Inquisition==

===Start of the Inquisition===
Fray Alonso de Ojeda, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar from Seville, convinced [[Queen Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of the existence of [[Crypto-Judaism]] among [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] ''[[conversos]]'' during her stay in [[Seville]] between 1477 and 1478.&lt;ref&gt;The terms ''converso'' and crypto-Jew are somewhat vexed, and occasionally historians are not clear on how, precisely, they are intended to be understood. For the purpose of clarity, in this article ''converso'' will be taken to mean one who has sincerely renounced Judaism or Islam and embraced Catholicism. Crypto-Jew will be taken to mean one who accepts Christian baptism, yet continues to practice Judaism.&lt;/ref&gt; A report, produced by [[Pedro González de Mendoza]], Archbishop of Seville, and by the Segovian Dominican [[Tomás de Torquemada]], corroborated this assertion.

Spanish monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] requested a [[papal bull]] establishing an inquisition in Spain in 1478 in response to the ''conversos'' returning to the practice of Judaism. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] granted a bull permitting the monarchs to select and appoint two or three priests over forty years of age to act as inquisitors.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=85}} In 1483, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] established a state council to administer the inquisition with the Dominican Friar [[Tomás de Torquemada]] acting as its president, even though Sixtus IV protested the activities of the inquisition in [[Aragon]] and its treatment of the ''conversos''. Torquemada eventually assumed the title of Inquisitor-General.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=89}}

[[Thomas F. Madden]] describes the world that formed medieval politics: "The Inquisition was not born out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. Yes, you read that correctly. Heresy was a crime against the state. Roman law in the [[Code of Justinian]] made it a capital offense. Rulers, whose authority was believed to come from God, had no patience for heretics".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Madden: The Real Inquisition. National Review 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchs decided to introduce the Inquisition to [[Castile (Spain)|Castile]] to discover and punish crypto-Jews, and requested the pope's assent. [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] pressured Pope Sixtus IV to agree to an Inquisition controlled by the monarchy by threatening to withdraw military support at a time when the Turks were a threat to Rome. The pope issued a [[papal bull|bull]] to stop the Inquisition but was pressured into withdrawing it.  On 1 November 1478, Sixtus published the [[Papal bull]], ''Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus'', through which he gave the monarchs exclusive authority to name the inquisitors in their kingdoms. The first two inquisitors, [[Miguel de Morillo]] and [[Juan de San Martín]], were not named, however, until two years later, on 27 September 1480 in [[Medina del Campo]].

The first ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' was held in Seville on 6 February 1481: six people were burned alive. From there, the Inquisition grew rapidly in the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. By 1492, tribunals existed in eight Castilian cities: [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Medina del Campo]], [[Segovia]], [[Sigüenza]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and [[Valladolid]]. Sixtus IV promulgated a new [[papal bull|bull]] categorically prohibiting the Inquisition's extension to [[Aragón]], affirming that:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | ... many true and faithful Christians, because of the testimony of enemies, rivals, slaves and other low people—and still less appropriate—without tests of any kind, have been locked up in secular prisons, tortured and condemned like relapsed heretics, deprived of their goods and properties, and given over to the [[secular arm]] to be executed, at great danger to their souls, giving a pernicious example and causing scandal to many. | Henry Kamen | The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision}}

According to the book ''A History of the Jewish People'',&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., editor. 1976. p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | In 1482 the pope was still trying to maintain control over the Inquisition and to gain acceptance for his own attitude towards the [[New Christian]]s, which was generally more moderate than that of the Inquisition and the local rulers. | A History of the Jewish People}}

In 1483, Jews were expelled from all of [[Andalusia]]. Though the pope wanted to crack down on abuses, Ferdinand pressured him to promulgate a new bull, threatening that he would otherwise separate the Inquisition from Church authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Mathew|Archbishop Arnold H. Mathew]], ''The Life and Times of Rodrigo Borgia'', p. 52-53. Quote: "Isabella's Confessor, [[Tomás de Torquemada|Torquemada]], had imbued her with the idea that the suppression of all heresy within her realms was a sacred duty. She had, therefore, in November 1478, obtained a bull from the Pope, Sixtus IV., for the establishment of the Inquisition in Castile. Many modern writers have sought to reduce her share in the introduction of this terrible institution, but it must be remembered that Isabella herself probably considered it a meritorious action to punish with inhuman barbarity those whom she looked upon as the enemies of the Almighty. In 1480, two Dominicans were appointed by her, as Inquisitors, to set up their tribunal at Seville. Before the end of the year 1481, 2,000 victims were burned alive in Andalusia alone. The Pope himself became alarmed and threatened to withdraw the bull, but Ferdinand intimated that he would make the Inquisition altogether an independent tribunal. This it became later for all practical purposes, and its iniquitous proceedings continued unchecked."&lt;/ref&gt; Sixtus did so on 17 October 1483, naming [[Tomás de Torquemada]] Inquisidor General of Aragón, Valencia, and [[Catalonia]].

Torquemada quickly established procedures for the Inquisition. A new court would be announced with a thirty-day grace period for confessions and the gathering of accusations by neighbors. Evidence that was used to identify a crypto-Jew included the absence of chimney smoke on Saturdays (a sign the family might secretly be honoring the Sabbath) or the buying of many vegetables before Passover or the purchase of meat from a converted butcher. The court employed [[Forced confession|physical torture to extract confessions]]. Crypto-Jews were allowed to confess and do penance, although those who relapsed were burned at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, H.H., editor. A History of the Jewish People. Harvard University Press, 1976, pp. 588-590.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1484, Pope [[Innocent VIII]] attempted to allow appeals to Rome against the Inquisition, but Ferdinand in December 1484 and again in 1509 decreed death and confiscation for anyone trying to make use of such procedures without royal permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the Inquisition became the only institution that held authority across all the realms of the Spanish monarchy and, in all of them, a useful mechanism at the service of the crown. However, the cities of Aragón continued resisting, and even saw revolt, as in [[Teruel]] from 1484 to 1485. However, the murder of ''Inquisidor'' [[Pedro Arbués]] in [[Zaragoza]] on September 15, 1485, caused public opinion to turn against the ''conversos'' and in favour of the Inquisition. In Aragón, the Inquisitorial courts were focused specifically on members of the powerful ''converso'' minority, ending their influence in the Aragonese administration.

The Inquisition was extremely active between 1480 and 1530. Different sources give different estimates of the number of trials and executions in this period; some estimate about 2,000 executions, based on the documentation of the ''autos-da-fé'', the great majority being ''conversos'' of Jewish origin. He offers striking statistics: 91.6% of those judged in Valencia between 1484 and 1530 and 99.3% of those judged in Barcelona between 1484 and 1505 were of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False conversions===

The Inquisition had jurisdiction only over Christians. It had no power to investigate, prosecute, or convict Jews, Muslims, or any open member of other religion. Anyone who was known to identify as either Jew or Muslim was outside of Inquisitorial jurisdiction and could only be tried by the King. All the inquisition could do in some of those cases was to deport the individual according to the King's law, but usually, even that had to go through a Civil Tribunal. The Inquisition only had power to try those who self-identified as Christians (initially for taxation purposes, later to avoid deportation well) while practicing another religion de facto. Even those were treated as Christians. If they confessed or identified not as "judeizantes" but as fully practicing Jews, they fell back into the previously explained category and could not be targeted (they would have pleaded guilty to lying about being Christians previously though).

====Expulsion of Jews. Jewish ''conversos''====
[[File:An auto-da-fé of the Spanish Inquisition and the execution o Wellcome V0041892.jpg|thumb|Though not subject to the Inquisition, Jews who refused to convert or leave Spain were called heretics and could be burned to death on a stake]]
The Spanish Inquisition had been established in part to prevent ''conversos'' from engaging in Jewish practices, which, as Christians, they were supposed to have given up. However this remedy for securing the orthodoxy of ''conversos'' was eventually deemed inadequate since the main justification the monarchy gave for [[Antisemitism in Spain|formally expelling all Jews from Spain]] was the "great harm suffered by Christians (i.e., ''conversos'') from the contact, intercourse and communication which they have with the Jews, who always attempt in various ways to seduce faithful Christians from our Holy Catholic Faith", according to the 1492 edict.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alhambra Decree]], issued in January 1492, gave the choice between expulsion and conversion. It was among the few expulsion orders that allowed conversion as an alternative and is used as a proof of the religious, not racial, element of the measure. The enforcement of this decree was very unequal however, with the focus mainly on coastal and southern regions-those at risk of Ottoman invasion- and a more gradual and ineffective enforcement towards the interior.&lt;ref name="Suárez Fernández 2012"/&gt;

Historic accounts of the numbers of Jews who left Spain were based on speculation, and some aspects were exaggerated by early accounts and historians: [[Juan de Mariana]] speaks of 800,000 people, and [[Don Isaac Abravanel]] of 300,000. While few reliable statistics exist for the expulsion, modern estimates based on tax returns and population estimates of communities are much lower, with Kamen stating that, of a population of approximately 80,000 Jews and 200,000 ''conversos'', about 40,000 emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of the kingdom of Castile emigrated mainly to Portugal (where the entire community was forcibly converted in 1497) and to North Africa. The Jews of the kingdom of Aragon fled to other Christian areas including Italy, rather than to Muslim lands as is often assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the vast majority of ''conversos'' simply assimilated into the Catholic dominant culture, a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present as a result of the Alhambra Decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murphy | first = Cullen | title = God's jury : the Inquisition and the making of the modern world | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | location = Boston | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-618-09156-0 | page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most intense period of persecution of ''conversos'' lasted until 1530. From 1531 to 1560, however, the percentage of ''conversos'' among the Inquisition trials dropped to 3% of the total. There was a rebound of persecutions when a group of crypto-Jews was discovered in [[Quintanar de la Orden]] in 1588; and there was a rise in denunciations of ''conversos'' in the last decade of the sixteenth century. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, some ''conversos'' who had fled to Portugal began to return to Spain, fleeing the persecution of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], founded in 1536. This led to a rapid increase in the trials of crypto-Jews, among them a number of important financiers. In 1691, during a number of ''[[autos-da-fé]]'' in [[Majorca]], 37 ''chuetas'', or ''conversos'' of Majorca, were burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eighteenth century the number of ''conversos'' accused by the Inquisition decreased significantly. [[Manuel Santiago Vivar]], tried in Córdoba in 1818, was the last person tried for being a crypto-Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expulsion of the Moriscos and Morisco ''conversos''====
The Inquisition searched for false or relapsed converts among the [[Moriscos]], who had converted from [[Islam]]. Beginning with a decree on February 14, 1502, Muslims in Granada had to choose between conversion to Christianity or expulsion.&lt;ref name="Prien2012" /&gt; In the Crown of Aragon, most Muslims had faced this choice after the [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]] (1519–1523). It is important to note that the enforcement of the expulsion of the moriscos was enforced really unevenly, especially in the lands of the interior and the north, where the coexistence had lasted for over five centuries and moriscos were protected by the population, and orders were partially or completely ignored.

The [[Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568–71)|War of the Alpujarras]] (1568–71), a general Muslim/Morisco uprising in Granada that expected to aid an Ottoman disembarcation in the peninsula, ended in a forced dispersal of about half of the region's Moriscos throughout Castile and Andalusia as well as increased suspicions by Spanish authorities against this community.

Many Moriscos were suspected of practising Islam in secret, and the jealousy with which they guarded the privacy of their domestic life prevented the verification of this suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Scott: History, Vol II, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially they were not severely persecuted by the Inquisition, experiencing instead a policy of evangelization&lt;ref&gt;Absent records, the Inquisition decreed that all Moors were to be regarded as baptized and thus were Moriscos subject to the Inquisition.  Secular authorities then decreed (in 1526) that 40 years of religious instruction would precede any prosecution.  Fifty Moriscos were burnt at the stake before the Crown clarified its position.  Neither the Church nor the Moriscos utilized the years well. The Moriscos can be stereotyped as poor, rural, uneducated agricultural workers who spoke Arabic.  The Church had limited willingness or ability to educate this now-hostile group.{{harvp|Green|2007|pp=124-127}}&lt;/ref&gt; a policy not followed with those ''conversos'' who were suspected of being crypto-Jews. There were various reasons for this. In the kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon a large number of the Moriscos were under the jurisdiction of the nobility, and persecution would have been viewed as a frontal assault on the economic interests of this powerful social class. Most importantly, the moriscos had integrated in the Spanish society way better than the Jews, intermarrying with the population often, and were not seen as a foreign element, especially in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor J. Dadson, The Assimilation of Spain’s Moriscos:
Fiction or Reality? Journal of Levantine Studies, Vol. 1, No. 2, Winter 2011, pp. 11-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, fears ran high among the population that the Moriscos were traitorous, especially in Granada. The coast was regularly raided by [[Barbary pirate]]s backed by Spain's enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Moriscos were suspected of aiding them.

In the second half of the century, late in the reign of Philip II, conditions worsened between [[Old Christians]] and Moriscos. The [[Morisco Revolt]] in Granada in 1568–1570 was harshly suppressed, and the Inquisition intensified its attention on the Moriscos. From 1570 Morisco cases became predominant in the tribunals of [[Zaragoza]], Valencia and Granada; in the tribunal of Granada, between 1560 and 1571, 82% of those accused were Moriscos, who were a vast majority of the Kingdom's population at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still the Moriscos did not experience the same harshness as judaizing ''conversos'' and Protestants, and the number of capital punishments was proportionally less.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], upon the advice of his financial adviser the [[Duke of Lerma]] and Archbishop of Valencia [[Juan de Ribera]], decreed the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]]. Hundreds of thousands of Moriscos were expelled, some of them probably sincere Christians. This was further fueled by the religious intolerance of Archbishop Ribera who quoted the Old Testament texts ordering the enemies of God to be slain without mercy and setting forth the duties of kings to extirpate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lea|1901|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict required: 'The [[Moriscos]] to depart, under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels or bills of exchange.... just what they could carry.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lea|1901|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initial estimates of the number expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 Moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion in much of Spain has been increasingly challenged by modern historians such as Trevor J. Dadson.&lt;ref name="bibliotecaspublicas.es"&gt;Trevor J. Dadson:  [http://www.bibliotecaspublicas.es/villarrubiadelosojos/imagenes/Dadson_Assimilation_Reality_or_Fiction.pdf ''The Assimilation of Spain's Moriscos: Fiction or Reality?'']. Journal of Levantine Studies, vol. 1, no. 2, Winter 2011, pp. 11-30&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the eastern region of Valencia, where ethnic tensions were high, was particularly affected by the expulsion, suffering economic collapse and depopulation of much of its territory.

Of those permanently expelled, the majority finally settled in the Maghreb or the Barbary coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boase|first=Roger|date=4 April 2002|title=The Muslim Expulsion from Spain|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=52|issue=4|quote=The majority of those permanently expelled settling in the [[Maghreb]] or [[Barbary Coast]], especially in Oran, Tunis, Tlemcen, Tetuán, Rabat and Salé.

The Inquisition pursued some trials against Moriscos who remained or returned after expulsion: at the height of the Inquisition, cases against Moriscos are estimated to have constituted less than 10 percent of those judged by the Inquisition. Upon the coronation of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in 1621, the new king gave the order to desist from attempting to impose measures on remaining Moriscos and returnees. In September 1628 the Council of the Supreme Inquisition ordered inquisitors in Seville not to prosecute expelled Moriscos "unless they cause significant commotion." &lt;ref&gt;[http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CHMO/article/view/37358/36158 Michel Boeglin: ''La expulsión de los moriscos de Andalucía y sus límites. El caso de Sevilla (1610-1613)''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The last mass prosecution against Moriscos for crypto-Islamic practices occurred in Granada in 1727, with most of those convicted receiving relatively light sentences. By the end of the 18th century, the indigenous practice of Islam is considered to have been effectively extinguished in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4040221 ''Vínculos Historia'': ''The Moriscos who remained. The permanence of Islamic origin population in Early Modern Spain: Kingdom of Granada, XVII-XVIII centuries''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Heretics===

The Spanish Inquisition had jurisdiction only over Christians. As such, those who self-identified as Christians could be investigated and trialed by it. Those in the group of "heretics" were all subject to investigation. All forms of heretic Christianity (Protestants, Orthodox, blaspheming Catholics, etc.) were considered under its jurisdiction.

==== Protestants and Anglicans====
[[File:Witch-scene4.JPG|thumb|The burning of a 16th-century Dutch [[Anabaptist]], Anneken Hendriks, who was charged with heresy]]
Despite popular myths about the Spanish Inquisition relating to Protestants, it dealt with very few cases involving actual Protestants, as there were so few in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the [[Inquisition of the Netherlands]], is here not considered part of the Spanish Inquisition. Lutheran was a portmanteau accusation used by the Inquisition to act against all those who acted in a way that was offensive to the church. The first of the trials against those labeled by the Inquisition as "Lutheran" were those against the sect of [[mysticism|mystics]] known as the "[[Alumbrados]]" of [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]] and [[Valladolid]]. The trials were long and ended with prison sentences of differing lengths, though none of the sect were executed. Nevertheless, the subject of the "Alumbrados" put the Inquisition on the trail of many intellectuals and clerics who, interested in [[Erasmian]] ideas, had strayed from orthodoxy. This is striking because both Charles I and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] were confessed admirers of [[Erasmus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such{{clarify|being an intellectual or professing Erasmian ideas/and/or both?|date=June 2014}} was the case with the humanist [[Juan de Valdés]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was forced to flee to Italy to escape the process that had been begun against him, and the preacher, [[Juan de Ávila]], who spent close to a year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first trials against [[Lutheran]] groups, as such, took place between 1558 and 1562, at the beginning of the reign of Philip II, against two communities of Protestants from the cities of Valladolid and Seville, numbering about 120.&lt;ref&gt;These trials, specifically those of Valladolid, form the basis of the plot of ''The Heretic: A novel of the Inquisition'' by Miguel Delibes (Overlook: 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The trials signaled a notable intensification of the Inquisition's activities. A number of ''[[auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]]'' were held, some of them presided over by members of the royal family, and around 100 executions took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=99}} gives the figure of about 100 executions for heresy of any kind between 1559 and 1566. He compares these figures with those condemned to death in other European countries during the same period, concluding that in similar periods England, under [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], executed about twice as many for heresy: in France, three times the number, and ten times as many in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''autos-da-fé'' of the mid-century virtually put an end to Spanish Protestantism, which was, throughout, a small phenomenon to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|pp=102-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1562, though the trials continued, the repression was much reduced. About 200 Spaniards were accused of being Protestants in the last decades of the 16th century. &lt;blockquote&gt;Most of them were in no sense Protestants ... Irreligious sentiments, drunken mockery, anticlerical expressions, were all captiously classified by the inquisitors (or by those who denounced the cases) as "Lutheran." Disrespect to church images, and eating meat on forbidden days, were taken as signs of heresy...&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; It is estimated that a dozen Spaniards were burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to notice that Protestantism and Anglicanism were treated as a marker to identify agents of foreign powers and symptoms of political disloyalty as much, if not more, than as a cause of prosecution in itself. Religion, patriotism, obedience to the king and personal beliefs were not seen as separate aspects of life until the end of the Modern Age. Spain especially had a long tradition of using self-identified religion as a political and cultural marker, and expression of loyalty to a specific overlord, more than as an accurate description of personal beliefs -here the common accusation of heretics they received from Rome. In that note, accusations or prosecutions due to beliefs held by enemy countries must be seen as political accusations regarding political treason more than as religious ones. Other times the accusation of Protestantism was considered as an equivalent of blasphemy, just a general way of addressing insubordination.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Sala, Maria Luisa. Los PROTESTANTES Y LA INQUISICIÓN. UNAM. https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/6/2905/6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity====
Even though the Inquisition had theoretical permission to investigate Orthodox "heretics", it almost never did. There was no major war between Spain and any Orthodox nation, so there was no reason to do so. There was one casualty tortured by those "Jesuits" (though most likely, [[Franciscans]]) who administered the Spanish Inquisition in North America, according to authorities within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],:  St. [[Peter the Aleut]]. Even that single report has various numbers of inaccuracies that make it problematic, and has no confirmation in the Inquisitorial archives.

===Witchcraft and Superstition===
The category "superstitions" includes trials related to [[witchcraft]]. The [[witch-hunt]] in Spain had much less intensity than in other European countries (particularly France, Scotland, and Germany). One remarkable case was [[Logroño witch trials|that of Logroño]], in which the witches of [[Zugarramurdi]] in [[Navarre]] were persecuted. During the ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' that took place in [[Logroño]] on November 7 and November 8, 1610, six people were burned and another five burned in [[effigy]].&lt;ref&gt;These trials are the theme of the film ''Akelarre'', by the Spanish director Pedro Olea.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the inquisition in cases of witchcraft was much more restricted than is commonly believed. Well after the foundation of the inquisition, jurisdiction over sorcery and witchcraft remained in secular hands.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen: The Spanish Inquisition A Historical Revision. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In general the Inquisition maintained a skeptical attitude towards cases of witchcraft, considering it as a mere superstition without any basis. [[Alonso Salazar Frias|Alonso de Salazar Frías]], who took the Edict of Faith to various parts of Navarre after the trials of Logroño, noted in his report to the Suprema that, "There were neither [[witches]] nor [[bewitched]] in a village until they were talked and written about".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Henningsen, Gustav, ed. The Salazar Documents: Inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías and Others on the Basque Witch Persecution. Vol 21, Cultures, Beliefs, and Traditions: Medieval and Early Modern Peoples. Boston: Koninklijke Brill, 2004. Second Report of Salazar to the Inquisitor General (Logroño, 24 March 1612): An account of the whole visitation and publication of the Edict with special reference to the witches' sect, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blasphemy====
Included under the rubric of ''heretical propositions'' were verbal offences, from outright [[blasphemy]] to questionable statements regarding religious beliefs, from issues of sexual morality to misbehaviour of the clergy. Many were brought to trial for affirming that ''simple fornication'' (sex between unmarried persons) was not a sin or for putting in doubt different aspects of [[Christian]] faith such as [[Transubstantiation]] or the virginity of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|pp=223-224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, members of the clergy itself were occasionally accused of heretical propositions. These offences rarely led to severe penalties.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Sodomy====
The first sodomite was burned by the Inquisition in Valencia in 1572, and those accused included 19% clergy, 6% nobles, 37% workers, 19% servants, and 18% soldiers and sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all of almost 500 cases of sodomy between persons concerned the relationship [[pederasty|between an older man and an adolescent]], often by coercion, with only a few cases where the couple were consenting [[homosexual]] adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse. Adolescents were generally punished more leniently than adults, but only when they were very young (under ca. 12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape did they have a chance to avoid punishment altogether. As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years. As about half of those tried were under this age, it explains the relatively small percentage of death sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Monter, ''Frontiers of Heresy'', pp. 276-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to notice that cases of sodomy did not receive the same treatment in all areas of Spain. In the Kingdom of Castile crimes of sodomy were not investigated by the Inquisition unless they were associated with religious heresy (In other words, the sodomy itself was investigated only as, and when, considered a symptom of a heretic belief or practice). In any other area cases were considered an issue of civil authorities, and even then was not very actively investigated. The Crown of Aragon was the only area in which they were considered under the Inquisitorial jurisdiction, probably due to the previous presence of the Pontifical Inquisition in that kingdom. Within the Crown of Aragon, the tribunal of the city of Zaragoza was famously harsh even at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (2011). La Inquisición Española. Una revisión histórica. p. 192 pp259&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason to group "sodomy" with heresies and not with "marriage and family" is that sodomy was strongly associated with Islam, Judaism, Catharism, and heresy in general. It was seen as a symptom of them more than as a condition or peculiarity in itself.

====Freemasonry====
{{Further|Papal ban of Freemasonry|In eminenti apostolatus}}
The Catholic Church has regarded [[Freemasonry]] as heretical since about 1738; the ''suspicion'' of Freemasonry was potentially a capital offense. Spanish Inquisition records reveal two prosecutions in Spain and only a few more throughout the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, [[Francisco Javier de Mier y Campillo]], the [[Inquisitor General]] of the Spanish Inquisition and the [[Bishop of Almería]], suppressed Freemasonry and denounced the lodges as "societies which lead to atheism, to sedition and to all errors and crimes."&lt;ref name="Denslow"&gt;William R. Denslow, [[Harry S. Truman]]: ''10,000 Famous Freemasons'', {{ISBN|1-4179-7579-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He then instituted a purge during which [[Spaniards]] could be arrested on the charge of being "suspected of Freemasonry".&lt;ref name="Denslow" /&gt;

=== Censorship ===
[[File:Inquisition01.jpg|thumb|A 1508 woodcut of the Inquisition]]

As one manifestation of the [[Counter-Reformation]], the Spanish Inquisition worked actively to impede the diffusion of heretical ideas in Spain by producing "Indexes" of prohibited books. Such lists of prohibited books were common in Europe a decade before the Inquisition published its first. The first Index published in Spain in 1551 was, in reality, a reprinting of the Index published by the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] in 1550, with an appendix dedicated to Spanish texts. Subsequent Indexes were published in 1559, 1583, 1612, 1632, and 1640. The Indexes included an enormous number of books of all types, though special attention was dedicated to religious works, and, particularly, vernacular translations of the Bible.

Included in the Indices, at one point, were many of the great works of [[Spanish literature]]. Also, a number of religious writers who are today considered saints by the Catholic Church saw their works appear in the Indexes. At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how were these Spanish authors published in the first place if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index? The answer lies in the process of publication and censorship in Early Modern Spain. Books in Early Modern Spain faced prepublication licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities. However, once approved and published, the circulating text also faced the possibility of post-hoc censorship by being denounced to the Inquisition—sometimes decades later. Likewise, as Catholic theology evolved, once-prohibited texts might be removed from the Index.

At first, inclusion in the Index meant total prohibition of a text; however, this proved not only impractical and unworkable, but also contrary to the goals of having a literate and well-educated clergy. Works with one line of suspect dogma would be prohibited in their entirety, despite the orthodoxy of the remainder of the text. In time, a compromise solution was adopted in which trusted Inquisition officials blotted out words, lines or whole passages of otherwise acceptable texts, thus allowing these expurgated editions to circulate. Although in theory the Indexes imposed enormous restrictions on the diffusion of culture in Spain, some historians argue that such strict control was impossible in practice and that there was much more liberty in this respect than is often believed. And Irving Leonard has conclusively demonstrated that, despite repeated royal prohibitions, romances of chivalry, such as ''[[Amadis de Gaula|Amadis of Gaul]]'', found their way to the New World with the blessing of the Inquisition. Moreover, with the coming of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century, increasing numbers of licenses to possess and read prohibited texts were granted.

[[File:Scene from an Inquisition by Goya.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Inquisition Scene'' by [[Francisco Goya]]. The Spanish Inquisition was still in force in the late eighteenth century, but much reduced in power.]]
Despite the repeated publication of the Indexes and a large bureaucracy of censors, the activities of the Inquisition did not impede the development of Spanish literature's "Siglo de Oro", although almost all of its major authors crossed paths with the Holy Office at one point or another. Among the Spanish authors included in the Index are [[Bartolomé Torres Naharro]], [[Juan del Enzina]], [[Jorge de Montemayor]], [[Juan de Valdés]] and [[Lope de Vega]], as well as the anonymous ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' and the ''[[Cancionero General]]'' by [[Hernando del Castillo]]. ''[[La Celestina]]'', which was not included in the Indexes of the [[16th century]], was expurgated in 1632 and prohibited in its entirety in 1790. Among the non-Spanish authors prohibited were [[Ovid]], [[Dante]], [[Rabelais]], [[Ariosto]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Erasmus]], [[Jean Bodin]], [[Valentin Naboth#cite note-13|Valentine Naibod]] and [[Thomas More]] (known in Spain as Tomás Moro). One of the most outstanding and best-known cases in which the Inquisition directly confronted literary activity is that of [[Fray Luis de León]], noted humanist and religious writer of converso origin, who was imprisoned for four years (from 1572 to 1576) for having translated the [[Song of Songs]] directly from Hebrew.

Some scholars state that one of the main effects of the inquisition was to end free thought and scientific thought in Spain. As one contemporary Spaniard in exile put it: "Our country is a land of ... [[barbarian|barbarism]]; down there one cannot produce any culture without being suspected of [[heresy]], error and [[Judaism]]. Thus silence was imposed on the learned."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For the next few centuries, while the rest of Europe was slowly awakened by the influence of the Enlightenment, Spain stagnated.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, ''A History of Christianity'', [[Penguin Books|Penguin]], [[London]] 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this conclusion is contested.

The [[censorship]] of books was actually very ineffective, and prohibited books circulated in Spain without significant problems. The Spanish Inquisition never persecuted [[scientist]]s, and relatively few scientific books were placed on the Index. On the other hand, Spain was a state with more political freedom than in other absolute monarchies in the 16th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2005|pp=126–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent paradox gets explained by both the [[hermeticist]] religious ideas of the Spanish church and monarchy, and the budding seed of what would become [[Enlightened absolutism]] taking shape in Spain. The list of banned books was not, as interpreted sometimes, a list of evil books but a list of books that lay people were very likely to misinterpret. The presence of highly symbolical and high-quality literature in the list was so explained. These metaphorical or parable sounding books were listed as not meant for free circulation, but there might be no objections to the book itself and the circulation among scholars was mostly free. Most of this books were carefully collected by the elite. The practical totality of the prohibited books can be found now as then in the library of the [[monasterio del Escorial]], carefully collected by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. The collection was "public" after Philip II's death and members of universities, intellectuals, courtesans, clergy, and certain branches of the nobility didn't have too many problems to access them and commission authorised copies. The Inquisition has not been known to make any serious attempt to stop this for all the books, but there are some records of them "suggesting" the King of Spain to stop collecting grimoires or magic related ones.
This attitude was also not new. Translations of the Bible to Castillian and Provenzal (Catalan) had been made and allowed in Spain since the Middle Ages. The first preserved copy dates from the 13th century. However, like [[Polyglot Bible|the bible of Cisneros]] they were mostly for scholarly use, and it was customary for laymen to ask religious or academic authorities to review the translation and supervise the use.

===Family and Marriage===

====Bigamy====
The Inquisition also pursued offenses against morals and general social order, at times in open conflict with the jurisdictions of civil tribunals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In particular, there were trials for [[bigamy]], a relatively frequent offence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a society that only permitted divorce under the most extreme circumstances.  In the case of men, the penalty was two hundred lashes and five to ten years of "service to the Crown". Said service could be whatever the court deemed most beneficial for the nation but it usually was either five years as an oarsman in a royal [[galley]] for those without any qualification&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Green|2007|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; (possibly a death sentence),&lt;ref&gt;Statistics are not available for Spanish oarsmen, but the general state of Mediterranean oared galleys circa 1570 was grim.  "... galley slaves led lives bitter and short."  "One way or another the oared galley consumed men like fuel.  Each dying wretch dumped overboard had to be replaced - and there were never enough."{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Roger |title=Empires of the sea : the siege of Malta, the battle of Lepanto, and the contest for the center of the world |publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8129-77646 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ten years working maintained but without salary in a public Hospital or charitable institution of the sort for those with some special skill, such as doctors, surgeons, or lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Arrazola, Lorenzo. Enciclopedia Espanola De Derecho Y Administracion: Ciu-col .. Madrid: Saraswati Press, 2012 pp 572(Enciclopedia of Spanish Penal and Administrative Law)&lt;/ref&gt; The penalty was five to seven years as an oarsman in the case of Portugal.

====Unnatural Marriage====

Under the category of "unnatural marriage" fell any marriage or attempted marriage between two individuals who could not procreate. The Catholic Church in general, and in particular a nation constantly at war like Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Estudios Sobre Cultura, Guerra Y Polt̕ica En La Corona De Castilla (siglos Xiv-xvii) (Studies Over War Culture and Politics in the Kingdom of Castile) Fernando Cc̀eres - Editorial Csic Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientf̕icas - 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaler, Amy. Fertility, Gender and War: The "culture of Contraception". University of Minnesota, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the reproductive goal of marriage. The Spanish Inquisition's policy in this regard was restrictive but applied in a very egalitarian way. It considered unnatural any non-reproductive marriage, and natural any reproductive one, regardless of gender or sex involved. The two forms of obvious male sterility were either due to damage to the genitals through castration or accidental wounding at war (capón) or to some genetic condition that might keep the man from completing puberty (lampiño). Female sterility was also a reason to declare a marriage unnatural but was harder to prove. One of the most interesting cases to study the attitude of the Spanish Inquisition regarding marriage, sex, and gender is the trial of [[Eleno de Céspedes]].

===Non-religious Crimes===

Despite popular belief, the role of the Inquisition as a mainly religious institution, or religious in nature at all, is contested at best. Its main function was that of a private police for the Crown with jurisdiction to enforce the law in those crimes that took place in the private sphere of life. The notion of religion and civil law being separate is a modern construction and made no sense in the 15th century, so there was no difference between breaking a law regarding religion and breaking a law regarding tax collection. The difference between them is a modern projection the institution itself did not have.
As such, the Inquisition was the prosecutor (in some cases the only prosecutor) of any crimes that could be perpetrated without the public taking notice (mainly domestic crimes, crimes against the weakest members of society, administrative crimes and forgeries, organized crime, and crimes against the Crown).

Examples include crimes associated with sexual or family relations such as [[rape]] and [[sexual violence]] (the Inquisition was the first and only body who punished it across the nation), [[bestiality]], [[pedophilia]] (often overlapping with sodomy), [[incest]], [[child abuse]] or [[child neglect|neglect]] and (as discussed) [[bigamy]]. Non-religious crimes also included [[procurement]] (not [[prostitution]]), [[human trafficking]], [[smuggling]], forgery or falsification of [[counterfeit currency|currency]], [[document forgery|documents]] or [[signature forgery|signatures]], tax [[fraud]] (many religious crimes were considered subdivisions of this one), [[illegal weapons]], [[wikt:swindle|swindle]]s, disrespect to the Crown or its institutions (the Inquisition included, but also the church, the guard, and the kings themselves), [[espionage]] for a foreign power, [[conspiracy]], [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/3241610 Online access to the Historical Archives of the Inquisition in Valencia], where the records of the trials and correspondence to officials can be found; you can find the corresponding ones to various other areas in Spain in the same webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The non-religious crimes processed by the Inquisition accounted for a considerable percentage of its total investigations and are often hard to separate in the statistics, even when documentation is available. The line between religious and non-religious crimes did not exist in 15th century Spain as legal concept. Many of the crimes listed here and some of the religious crimes listed in previous sections were contemplated under the same article. For example, "sodomy" included paedophilia as a subtype. Often part of the data given for prosecution of male homosexuality corresponds to convictions for paedophilia, not adult homosexuality. In other cases, religious and non-religious crimes were seen as distinct but equivalent. The treatment of public blasphemy and street swindlers was similar (since in both cases you are "misleading the public in a harmful way). Making counterfeit currency and heretic proselytism was also treated similarly; both of them were punished by death and subdivided in similar ways since both were "spreading falsifications". In general heresy and falsifications of material documents were treated similarly by the Spanish Inquisition, indicating that they may have been thought of as equivalent actions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Another difficulty to discriminate the inquisition's secular and religious activity is the common association of certain types of investigations. An accusation or suspicion on certain crime often launched an automatic investigation on many others. Anyone accused of espionage due to non-religious reasons would likely be investigated for heresy too, and anyone suspected of a heresy associated to a foreign power would be investigated for espionage too automatically. Likewise, some religious crimes were considered likely to be associated with non-religious crimes, like human trafficking, procurement, and child abuse was expected to be associated to sodomy, or sodomy was expected to be associated to heresy and false conversions. Which accusation started the investigation isn't always clear.
Finally, trials were often further complicated by the attempts of witnesses or victims to add further charges, especially [[witchcraft]]. Like in the case of [[Eleno de Céspedes]], charges for witchcraft done in this way, or in general, were quickly dismissed but they often show in the statistics as investigations made.

== Organization ==
Beyond its role in religious affairs, the Inquisition was also an institution at the service of the monarchy. The Inquisitor General, in charge of the Holy Office, was designated by the crown. The Inquisitor General was the only public office whose authority stretched to all the kingdoms of Spain (including the American viceroyalties), except for a brief period (1507–1518) during which there were two Inquisitors General, one in the kingdom of Castile, and the other in [[Aragon]].

[[File:Auto de fe Lima.jpg|thumb|Auto-da-fé, [[Plaza Mayor, Lima|Plaza Mayor]] in [[Lima]], Viceroyalty of Peru, 17th century]]

The Inquisitor General presided over the Council of the Supreme and General Inquisition (generally abbreviated as "Council of the Suprema"), created in 1483, which was made up of six members named directly by the crown (the number of members of the Suprema varied over the course of the Inquisition's history, but it was never more than 10). Over time, the authority of the Suprema grew at the expense of the power of the Inquisitor General.

The Suprema met every morning, except for holidays, and for two hours in the afternoon on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The morning sessions were devoted to questions of faith, while the afternoons were reserved for "minor heresies"&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, Gustav: The Spanish Inquisition and the Inquisitorial Mind, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; cases of perceived unacceptable sexual behavior, [[bigamy]], [[witchcraft]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the Suprema were the various tribunals of the Inquisition, which were originally itinerant, installing themselves where they were necessary to combat heresy, but later being established in fixed locations. During the first phase numerous tribunals were established, but the period after 1495 saw a marked tendency towards centralization.

In the kingdom of Castile, the following permanent tribunals of the Inquisition were established:
* 1482 In [[Seville]] and in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].
* 1485 In [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and in [[Llerena, Badajoz|Llerena]].
* 1488 In [[Valladolid]] and in [[Murcia]].
* 1489 In [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]].
* 1505 In [[Las Palmas]] ([[Canary Islands]]).
* 1512 In [[Logroño]].
* 1526 In [[Granada]].
* 1574 In [[Santiago de Compostela]].

There were only four tribunals in the kingdom of [[Aragon]]: [[Zaragoza]] and [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] (1482), [[Barcelona]] (1484), and [[Majorca]] (1488).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand the Catholic]] also established the Spanish Inquisition in [[Sicily]] (1513), housed in [[Palermo]], and [[Sardinia]], in the town of [[Sassari]].&lt;ref&gt;In [[Sicily]], the Inquisition functioned until 30 March 1782, when it was abolished by King [[Ferdinand IV of Naples]]. It is estimated that 200 people were executed during this period.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Americas, tribunals were established in [[Lima]] and in [[Mexico City]] (1569) and, in 1610, in [[Cartagena de Indias]] (present day [[Colombia]]).

==Composition of the tribunals==
[[File:Estructura de la Inquisición.svg|thumb|Structure of the Spanish Inquisition]]

Initially, each of the tribunals included two inquisitors, a ''calificador'' (qualifiers), an ''alguacil'' (bailiff), and a ''fiscal'' (prosecutor); new positions were added as the institution matured. The inquisitors were preferably jurists more than theologians; in 1608 [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] even stipulated that all the inquisitors must have a background in law. The inquisitors did not typically remain in the position for a long time: for the Court of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], for example, the average tenure in the position was about two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the inquisitors belonged to the secular clergy (priests who were not members of [[religious orders]]) and had a university education.

The ''fiscal'' was in charge of presenting the accusation, investigating the denunciations and interrogating the witnesses by the use of physical and mental torture. The ''calificadores'' were generally theologians; it fell to them to determine if the defendant's conduct added up to a crime against the faith. Consultants were expert jurists who advised the court in questions of procedure. The court had, in addition, three secretaries: the ''notario de secuestros'' (Notary of Property), who registered the goods of the accused at the moment of his detention; the ''notario del secreto'' (Notary of the Secret), who recorded the testimony of the defendant and the witnesses; and the ''escribano general'' (General Notary), secretary of the court. The ''alguacil'' was the executive arm of the court, responsible for detaining, jailing, and physically torturing the defendant. Other civil employees were the ''nuncio'', ordered to spread official notices of the court, and the ''alcaide'', jailer in charge of feeding the prisoners.

In addition to the members of the court, two auxiliary figures existed that collaborated with the Holy Office: the ''familiares'' and the ''comissarios'' (commissioners). ''Familiares'' were lay collaborators of the Inquisition, who had to be permanently at the service of the Holy Office. To become a ''familiar'' was considered an honour, since it was a public recognition of ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'' — Old Christian status — and brought with it certain additional privileges. Although many nobles held the position, most of the ''familiares'' came from the ranks of commoners. The commissioners, on the other hand, were members of the religious orders who collaborated occasionally with the Holy Office.

One of the most striking aspects of the organization of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of those prosecuted were rich men. That the situation was open to abuse is evident, as stands out in the memorandum that a ''converso'' from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] directed to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Your Majesty must provide, before all else, that the expenses of the Holy Office do not come from the properties of the condemned, because if that is the case, if they do not burn they do not eat.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Accusation ===
When the Inquisition arrived in a city, the first step was the ''Edict of Grace''. Following the Sunday mass, the Inquisitor would proceed to read the edict; it explained possible heresies and encouraged all the congregation to come to the tribunals of the Inquisition to "relieve their consciences". They were called ''Edicts of Grace'' because all of the self-incriminated who presented themselves within a ''period of grace'' (usually ranging from thirty to forty days) were offered the possibility of reconciliation with the Church without severe punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of benevolence was effective, and many voluntarily presented themselves to the Inquisition and were often encouraged to denounce others who had also committed offenses, informants being the Inquisition's primary source of information. After about 1500, the Edicts of Grace were replaced by the ''Edicts of Faith'', which left out the grace period and instead encouraged the denunciation of those guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denunciations were anonymous, and the defendants had no way of knowing the identities of their accusers.&lt;ref&gt;Though over the course of the trial, their identities likely became apparent.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the points most criticized by those who opposed the Inquisition (for example, the [[Cortes of Castile]], in 1518). In practice, false denunciations were frequent. Denunciations were made for a variety of reasons, from genuine concern, to rivalries and personal jealousies.

=== Detention ===
[[File:Mateo Zapata.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Diego Mateo Zapata|Diego Mateo López Zapata]] in his cell before his trial by the Inquisition Court of Cuenca]]

After a denunciation, the case was examined by the ''calificadores'', who had to determine if there was heresy involved, followed by detention of the accused. In practice, however, many were detained in preventive custody, and many cases of lengthy incarcerations occurred, lasting up to two years, before the ''calificadores'' examined the case.&lt;ref&gt;"In the tribunal of [[Valladolid]], in 1699, various suspects (including a girl of 9 and a boy of 14) were jailed for up to two years with having had the least evaluation of the accusations presented against them" ({{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=180}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Detention of the accused entailed the preventive sequestration of their property by the Inquisition. The property of the prisoner was used to pay for procedural expenses and the accused's own maintenance and costs. Often the relatives of the defendant found themselves in outright misery. This situation was remedied only following instructions written in 1561.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Some authors, such as [[Thomas William Walsh]], stated that the entire process was undertaken with the utmost secrecy, as much for the public as for the accused, who were not informed about the accusations that were levied against them. Months or even years could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] nor receive the [[sacraments]]. The jails of the Inquisition were no worse than those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Thomas William, ''Characters of the Inquisition'', P.J. Kennedy &amp; Sons, 1940, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are few records of the time of the accused in prison, but the transcription of the trials repeatedly shows the accused being informed of every charge during the trial. They also show the accused answers, in which they address each accusation specifically. Given that they would be informed anyway, it makes little sense for the accused to be kept in the dark prior to the trial, unless the investigation was still open.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:7d0f0b12-1c0e-49f6-b437-23206a95086d/original-primera-parte.pdf preserved transcripts of a trial as sample&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:a1b40405-5bbd-4a44-a031-41bb121702a3/transcripcion.pdf Printed version of previous source&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial ===
The inquisitorial process consisted of a series of hearings, in which both the denouncers and the defendant gave testimony. A [[defense counsel]] was assigned to the defendant, a member of the tribunal itself, whose role was simply to advise the defendant and to encourage them to speak the truth. The prosecution was directed by the ''fiscal''. Interrogation of the defendant was done in the presence of the ''Notary of the Secreto'', who meticulously wrote down the words of the accused. The archives of the Inquisition, in comparison to those of other judicial systems of the era, are striking in the completeness of their documentation. 
In order to defend themselves, the accused had two possibilities: ''abonos'' (to find favourable witnesses, akin to "substantive" evidence/testimony in Anglo-American law) or ''tachas'' (to demonstrate that the witnesses of accusers were not trustworthy, akin to Anglo-American "impeachment" evidence/testimony).

The documentation from the notary usually show the following content, which gives us an idea of what the actual trial was likely to look like:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mecd.gob.es/dam/jcr:a1b40405-5bbd-4a44-a031-41bb121702a3/transcripcion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*A first page in which the notary wrote the date, the names and charges of the members of the tribunal, the name of the accused and the accuser, the accusation, and the names of everyone present in the room during the trial.
*A second page with the accused's first statement about their innocence or culpability, and their general response and recollection of the facts. This part usually takes from a thick fluid paragraph to a couple of pages and are relatively formal, within the accused's education level, from which one can suspect that the accused had time to prepare it prior to either the trial or the declaration, and probably help from the defendant. This paragraph also shows the accused addressing every charge from the first page, by points, which shows that the accused must have been informed of the charges against them.
*A third section with the ''fiscal'''s name and the transcription of a speech in which they address the accused's statement, also by points, and presents their case regarding each one separately.
*A fourth section, usually dated on the next day or a couple of days after the fiscal's intervention, with the name of the "procurador"( defendant) and the transcription of a speech in which they address the fiscal's arguments, again by points and separately, and defend the accused regarding each one. 
*A fifth section with the tribunal's response to this. In the vast majority of cases, the response is to order the search and calling of certain individuals, as witnesses, or of some experts such as doctors to testify and ratify some parts of what has been said, and giving a date for the tribunal to come together again and examine the evidence. Usually, the fiscal and procurator can ask for the presence of some witnesses here too, as it is inferred by them showing up later, but that is not always specifically stated in the transcripts and may be done outside of trial.
*The next section is often dated sometime later. Each witness or expert is introduced by complete name, job, relationship to the victim if any, and relationship to the case.  The witness's testimony is not transcribed word by word like in previous cases but summarized by the notary, probably because it was not prepared and does not follow a coherent, consistent order and writing implements were rather expensive to waste. 
* A page in which the procurador(defendant) declared the questions he is going to make to (usually another) group of witnesses of his choice since he often states that "he has asked them to come"or "he has called them". The answers given by each witness follow, with each witness presented as in the previous section. These testimonies are also paraphrased and summarized but addressed by points, with the answer to each question paraphrased separately.
*The fiscal and the procurador require equal copies of the testimony of the witnesses and keep them, demanding that no copy is shown to anyone until the end of a period of usually six days in which the witnesses have the chance to call the tribunal again to change their mind or add something.
*A third meeting of the tribunal with a new date. The transcription of a new speech by the procurator stating his view of the declarations and wrapping the witnesses' testimony up from his perspective. 
*A similar intervention, usually far shorter, from the fiscal.
*The response from the tribunal, paraphrased, which could be to dictate the sentence, but often was to require either further clarification from the witness (restarting the procedure from the second step) or call for another type of proof (restarting the procedure from the sixth step). These steps would repeat cyclically in the documentation of the trial, through different meetings of the tribunal and different weeks, until the tribunal has reached a conclusion.
*A literal transcription of the verdict and sentence. If the accused has been accused of more than one thing the sentence usually comes by points too. It is not uncommon for some of the accusations to be dismissed along with the process and said the process to continue taking into account the remaining ones. While sentences of innocence could be given at any point in a trial for multiple crimes, sentences of culpability only appear once the trial is over and all investigations opened against the accused are closed.

Regarding the fairness of the trials, the structure of them was similar to modern trials and extremely advanced for the time. However, the  Inquisition was dependent on the political power of the King. The lack of separation of powers allows assuming questionable fairness for certain scenarios. The fairness of the Inquisitorial tribunals seemed to be among the best in early modern Europe when it came to the trial of laymen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Madden. "The Truth about the Spanish Inquisition." Crisis (october de 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"LA INQUISICIÓN ESPAÑOLA".José Martínez MillánAlianza Editorial Bolsillo(2010)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also testimonies by former prisoners that, if believed, suggest that said fairness was less than ideal when national or political interests were involved.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry (2011). La Inquisición Española. Una revisión histórica. pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to obtain a confession or information relevant to an investigation, the Inquisition made use of [[torture]], but not in a systematic way. It could only be applied when all other options, witnesses and experts had been used, the accused was found guilty or most likely guilty, and relevant information regarding accomplices or specific details were missing. It was applied mainly against those suspected of [[Judeization]] and [[Protestantism]] beginning in the 16th century, in other words "enemies of the state", since said crimes were usually thought to be associated with a larger organized network of either espionage or conspiracy with foreign powers. For example, Lea estimates that between 1575 and 1610 the court of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] tortured approximately a third of those processed for Protestant heresy.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Lea, III, p. 33, Cited in {{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=185}}. {{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=43}} finds the same statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; The recently opened Vatican Archives suggest even lower numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Madden. "The Truth about the Spanish Inquisition." Crisis (October de 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messori, Vittorio (2000). Leyendas Negras de la Iglesia. Editorial Planeta (this source is a Catholic apologist)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other periods, the proportions varied remarkably. Torture was always a means to obtain the confession of the accused, not a punishment itself.

=== Torture ===
[[File:Picard.jpg|thumb|Inquisition [[torture chamber]]. ''Mémoires Historiques'' (1716)]]

Torture was employed in all civil and religious trials in Europe. The Spanish Inquisition was no exception. Its main differentiation characteristic was that, as opposed to both civil trials and other inquisitions, it had very strict regulations regarding when, what, to whom, how many times, for how long and under what supervision it could be applied.&lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"&gt;Bethencourt, Francisco. La Inquisición En La Época Moderna: España, Portugal E Italia, Siglos Xv-xix. Madrid: Akal, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haliczer_79"&gt;Haliczer, Stephen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=crCQmS_85EEC&amp;dq Inquisition and society in the kingdom of Valencia, 1478-1834], p. 79, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamenop"&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish inquisition engaged in it far less often and with greater care than other courts.&lt;ref name="Haliczer_79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters, Edward pp. 92-93"&gt;by Peters, Edward, ''Inquisition'', Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, pp. 92-93, University of California Press (1989), {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the civil court, both Spanish and otherwise, there was no restriction regarding duration or any other point.

*'''When''': Torture was allowed only: ''"when sufficient proofs to confirm the culpability of the accused have been gathered by other means, and every other method of negotiation have been tried and exhausted''". It was stated by the inquisitorial rule that information obtained through torment was not reliable, and confession should only be extracted this way when all needed information was already known and proven. Confessions obtained through torture could not be used to convict or sentence anyone.
*'''What''': The Spanish Inquisition was prohibited to "''maim, mutilate, draw blood or cause any sort of permanent damage''" to the prisoner. Breaking bones was of course not allowed.&lt;ref name="Kamenop" /&gt; There was a closed list of the allowed torture methods. These were all tried and used in the civil courts all through Europe, and therefore known to be "safe" in this regard. Any other method, regardless of whether it was legal in the country or practiced in civil courts, was not allowed.
*'''Who''': Neither the elderly, the young, the sick or injured, or pregnant women could be subjected to torture. Torture of females was prohibited in all but the most extreme crimes and could not be performed by males.
*'''How many times''': Each accusation allowed for a different number of torment sessions on the same person (once the "when" condition of the culpability being supported by the strong external evidence was fulfilled). The number was dependent on how "harmful to society" the crime was. Counterfeit currency allowed for a maximum of two. The most serious offenses allowed for a maximum of eight.
*'''For how long''': "Torment" could be applied for a maximum of 15 minutes. The Roman Inquisition allowed for 30 minutes.
*'''Supervision''': The presence of a doctor was required at all times to ensure that no serious harm could result and to intervene in case of unexpected complications. It was also required for a doctor to certify that the prisoner was healthy enough to go through the torment without suffering harm.&lt;ref&gt;Crespo Vargas, Pablo L. La Inquisición Española Y Las Supersticiones En El Caribe Hispano. Madrid: Palibrio, 2011. pp120-130&lt;/ref&gt;

Per contrast, European civil trials from England to Italy and from Spain to Russia could use, and did use, torture without justification and for as long as they considered. So much so that there were serious tensions between the Inquisition and Philip III, since the Inquisitors complained that "those people sent to the prisons of the King blasphemed and accused themselves of heresy just to be sent under the Inquisitorial jurisdiction instead of the King's" and that was collapsing the Inquisition's tribunals. During the reign of Philip IV there were registered complaints of the Inquisitors about people who "Blasphemated, mostly in winter, just to be detained and fed inside the prison".  
Despite some popular accounts, modern historians state that torture was only ever used to confirm information or a confession, not for punitive reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The inside of a jail of the Spanish Inquisition, with a prie Wellcome V0041650.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of a jail of the Spanish Inquisition, with a priest supervising his scribe while men and women are suspended from pulleys, tortured on the rack or burnt with torches. Etching.]]

Rafael Sabatinni states that among the methods of [[torture]] allowed, and common in other secular and ecclesiastical tribunals, were ''garrucha'', ''toca'' and the ''potro''.,&lt;ref name="Kamenop" /&gt; even though those claims contradict both the Inquisitorial law and the claims made by Kamen. The application of the ''garrucha'', also known as the [[strappado]], consisted of suspending the victim from the ceiling by the wrists, which are tied behind the back. Sometimes weights were tied to the ankles, with a series of lifts and drops, during which the arms and legs suffered violent pulls and were sometimes dislocated.&lt;ref&gt;Sabatini, Rafael, ''Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition: A History'', p. 190, Kessinger Publishing (2003), {{ISBN|0-7661-3161-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The use of te ''toca''(cloth), also called ''interrogatorio mejorado del agua'' (improved [[waterboarding]]/improved water interrogation), is better documented. It consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim, and forcing them to [[waterboarding|ingest water]] spilled from a jar so that they had the impression of drowning.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, George Ryley, ''The History of Torture Throughout the Ages'', p. 172, Columbia University Press (2003) {{ISBN|0-7103-0837-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''potro'', the [[rack (torture)|rack]], in which the limbs were slowly pulled apart, was thought to be the instrument of torture used most frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Carrol. James, ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History'', p. 356, Houghton Mifflin Books (2002), {{ISBN|0-618-21908-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them all, the "submarino/ [[waterboarding]]" was by far the most commonly used, since it was cheap, and seen as "harmless and very safe" (safer for the victim than clothless waterboarding, hence the "improved" (''mejorado'') epithet).

The assertion that ''confessionem esse veram, non factam vi tormentorum'' (literally: '[a person's] confession is truth, not made by way of torture') sometimes follows a description of how, after torture had ended, the subject freely confessed to the offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward, ''Inquisition'', Dissent, Heterodoxy and the Medieval Inquisitional Office, p. 65, University of California Press (1989), {{ISBN|0-520-06630-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus confessions following torture were deemed to be made of the confessor's free will, and hence valid.

Once the process concluded, the inquisidores met with a representative of the bishop and with the ''consultores'' (consultants), experts in [[theology]] or [[Canon Law]] (but not necessarily clergy themselves), which was called the ''consulta de fe'' (faith consultation/religion check). The case was voted and sentence pronounced, which had to be unanimous. In case of discrepancies, the ''Suprema'' had to be informed.

=== Sentencing ===
The results of the trial could be the following:
# Although quite rare in actual practice, the defendant could be '''acquitted'''. Inquisitors did not wish to terminate the proceedings. If they did, and new evidence turned up later, they would be forced into reopening and re-presenting the old evidence.
# The trial could be '''suspended''', in which case the defendant, although under suspicion, went free (with the threat that the process could be continued at any time) or was held in long-term imprisonment until a trial commenced. When set free after a suspended trial it was considered a form of acquittal without specifying that the accusation had been erroneous.
# The defendant could be '''penanced'''. Since they were considered guilty, they had to publicly abjure their crimes (''de levi'' if it was a misdemeanor, and ''de vehementi'' if the crime were serious), and accept a public punishment. Among these were ''[[sanbenito]]'', exile, fines or even sentencing to service as oarsmen in royal [[galley]]s.
# The defendant could be '''reconciled'''. In addition to the public ceremony in which the condemned was reconciled with the Catholic Church, more severe punishments were used, among them long sentences to jail or the galleys, plus the confiscation of all property. Physical punishments, such as whipping, were also used.
# The most serious punishment was '''relaxation''' to the [[secular arm]]. The Inquisition had no power to actually kill the convict or determine the way in which they should die; that was a right of the King. [[Burning at the stake]] was a possibility, probably kept from the Papal Inquisition of Aragon, but a very uncommon one. This penalty was frequently applied to impenitent heretics and those who had relapsed. Execution was public. If the condemned repented, they were shown mercy by being [[garrote]]d before their corpse was burned; if not, they were burned alive.

Frequently, cases were judged ''in absentia'', and when the accused died before the trial finished, the condemned were burned in effigy.

The distribution of the punishments varied considerably over time. It is believed that sentences of death were enforced in the first stages within the long history of the Inquisition. According to García Cárcel, the court of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], one of the most active, employed the death penalty in 40% of the convicts{{clarify|date=April 2018}}&lt;!---It isn't very clear if it means 40% / 3% of all the convicts, of all the trialed, or if 40% of crimes were punished this way.---&gt; before 1530, but later that percentage dropped to 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Auto-da-fé'' ===
{{main|Auto-da-fé}}
[[File:Francisco rizi-auto de fe.jpg|thumb|Auto-da-fé, [[Plaza Mayor, Madrid|Plaza Mayor]] in Madrid, 1683]]

If the sentence was [[wikt:condemnatory|condemnatory]], this implied that the condemned had to participate in the ceremony of an ''auto de fe'' (more commonly known in English as an ''auto-da-fé'') that solemnized their return to the Church (in most cases), or punishment as an impenitent heretic. The ''autos-da-fé'' could be private (''auto particular'') or public (''auto publico'' or ''auto general'').

Although initially the public ''autos'' did not have any special solemnity nor sought a large attendance of spectators, with time they became solemn ceremonies, celebrated with large public crowds, amidst a festive atmosphere. The ''auto-da-fé'' eventually became a [[baroque]] spectacle, with staging meticulously calculated to cause the greatest effect among the spectators. The ''autos'' were conducted in a large public space (frequently in the largest plaza of the city), generally on holidays. The rituals related to the ''auto'' began the previous night (the "procession of the Green Cross") and sometimes lasted the whole day. The ''auto-da-fé'' frequently was taken to the canvas by painters: one of the better-known examples is the painting by [[Francesco Rizzi]] held by the [[Prado]] Museum in [[Madrid]] that represents the ''auto'' celebrated in the Plaza Mayor of Madrid on 30 June 1680. The last public ''auto-da-fé'' took place in 1691.

The ''auto-da-fé'' involved a Catholic Mass, prayer, a public procession of those found guilty, and a reading of their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Peters 1988: 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; They took place in public squares or esplanades and lasted several hours; ecclesiastical and civil authorities attended. Artistic representations of the ''auto-da-fé'' usually depict torture and the burning at the stake. However, this type of activity never took place during an ''auto-da-fé'', which was in essence a religious act. Torture was not administered after a trial concluded, and executions were always held after and separate from the ''auto-da-fé'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|pp=192–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in the minds and experiences of observers and those undergoing the confession and execution, the separation of the two might be experienced as merely a technicality.

[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|upright|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), Mexico City, 1601]]

The first recorded ''auto-da-fé'' was held in Paris in 1242, during the reign of Louis IX.&lt;ref&gt;Stavans 2005:xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Spanish ''auto-da-fé'' did not take place until 1481 in Seville; six of the men and women subjected to this first religious ritual were later executed. The Inquisition had limited power in Portugal, having been established in 1536 and officially lasting until 1821, although its influence was much weakened with the government of the Marquis of Pombal in the second half of the 18th century. ''Autos-da-fé'' also took place in Mexico, Brazil and Peru: contemporary historians of the Conquistadors such as Bernal Díaz del Castillo record them. They also took place in the Portuguese colony of Goa, India, following the establishment of Inquisition there in 1562–1563.

The arrival of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain slowed inquisitorial activity. In the first half of the 18th century, 111 were condemned to be burned in person, and 117 in effigy, most of them for [[Judaizers|judaizing]]. In the reign of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], there were 125 ''autos-da-fé'', while in the reigns of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] and [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] only 44.

During the 18th century, the Inquisition changed: Enlightenment ideas were the closest threat that had to be fought. The main figures of the Spanish Enlightenment were in favour of the abolition of the Inquisition, and many were processed by the Holy Office, among them [[Pablo de Olavide|Olavide]], in 1776; [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa|Iriarte]], in 1779; and [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos|Jovellanos]], in 1796; Jovellanos sent a report to Charles IV in which he indicated the inefficiency of the Inquisition's courts and the ignorance of those who operated them: "friars who take [the position] only to obtain gossip and exemption from choir; who are ignorant of foreign languages, who only know a little [[scholastic theology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el pensamiento ilustrado.'' Historia 16. Especial 10º Aniversario ''La Inquisición''; p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its new role, the Inquisition tried to accentuate its function of censoring publications but found that Charles III had secularized [[censorship]] procedures, and, on many occasions, the authorization of the [[Council of Castile]] hit the more intransigent position of the Inquisition. Since the Inquisition itself was an arm of the state, being within the Council of Castile, civil rather than ecclesiastical censorship usually prevailed. This loss of influence can also be explained because the foreign Enlightenment texts entered the peninsula through prominent members of the nobility or government,&lt;ref&gt;Members of the government and the Council of Castile, as well as other members close to the court, obtained special authorization for books purchased in France, the Low Countries or Germany to cross the border without inspection by members of the Holy Office. This practice grew beginning with the reign of Charles III.&lt;/ref&gt; influential people with whom it was very difficult to interfere. Thus, for example, [[Diderot's Encyclopedia]] entered Spain thanks to special licenses granted by the king.

After the [[French Revolution]], however, the Council of Castile, fearing that revolutionary ideas would penetrate Spain's borders, decided to reactivate the Holy Office that was directly charged with the persecution of French works. An Inquisition edict of December 1789, that received the full approval of Charles IV and [[José Moñino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|Floridablanca]], stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;having news that several books have been scattered and promoted in these kingdoms... that, without being contented with the simple narration events of a seditious nature... seem to form a theoretical and practical code of independence from the legitimate powers.... destroying in this way the political and social order... the reading of thirty and nine French works is prohibited, under fine...&lt;ref&gt;Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el pensamiento ilustrado.'' p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, inquisitorial activity was impossible in the face of the information avalanche that crossed the border; in 1792, "the multitude of seditious papers... does not allow formalizing the files against those who introduce them".

The fight from within against the Inquisition was almost always clandestine. The first texts that questioned the Inquisition and praised the ideas of [[Voltaire]] or [[Montesquieu]] appeared in 1759. After the suspension of pre-publication censorship on the part of the Council of Castile in 1785, the newspaper ''[[El Censor]]'' began the publication of protests against the activities of the Holy Office by means of a rationalist critique. [[Valentin de Foronda]] published ''[[Espíritu de los Mejores Diarios]]'', a plea in favour of freedom of expression that was avidly read in the salons. Also, in the same vein, [[Manuel de Aguirre]] wrote On Toleration in ''El Censor'', ''[[El Correo de los Ciegos]]'' and ''[[El Diario de Madrid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument presented in the periodicals and other works circulating in Spain were virtually exact copies of the reflections of Montesquieu or Rousseau, translated into Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Inquisition==
[[File:Penitenciado por la Inquisición.jpg|thumb|The [[Peruvian Inquisition]], based in Lima, ended in 1820.]]

During the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain]] (1788–1808), in spite of the fears that the [[French Revolution]] provoked, several events accelerated the decline of the Inquisition. The state stopped being a mere social organizer and began to worry about the well-being of the public. As a result, the land-holding power of the Church was reconsidered, in the ''[[señorío]]s'' and more generally in the accumulated wealth that had prevented social progress.&lt;ref&gt;Church properties, in general, and those of the Holy Office in particular, occupied large tracts of today's [[Castile and León]], [[Extremadura]] and [[Andalucia]]. The properties were given under feudal terms to farmers or to localities who used them as community property with many restrictions, owing a part of the rent, generally in cash, to the church.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the throne increased, under which [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers found better protection for their ideas. [[Manuel Godoy]] and [[Antonio Alcalá Galiano]] were openly hostile to an institution whose only role had been reduced to [[censorship]] and was the very embodiment of the Spanish [[Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition|Black Legend]], internationally, and was not suitable to the political interests of the moment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inquisition? Its old power no longer exists: the horrible authority that this bloodthirsty court had exerted in other times was reduced... the Holy Office had come to be a species of commission for book censorship, nothing more...&lt;ref&gt;Elorza, ''La Inquisición y el Pensamiento Ilustrado''. Historia 16. Especial 10º Aniversario ''La Inquisición''; pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Inquisition was first abolished during the domination of [[Napoleon]] and the reign of [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (1808–1812). In 1813, the liberal deputies of the [[Cortes of Cádiz]] also obtained its abolition,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Antonio Puigblanch]], ''La Inquisición sin máscara'', Cádiz, 1811–1813.&lt;/ref&gt; largely as a result of the Holy Office's condemnation of the popular revolt against French invasion. But the Inquisition was reconstituted when [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] recovered the throne on 1 July 1814. [[Juan Antonio Llorente]], who had been the Inquisition's general secretary in 1789, became a [[Afrancesado|Bonapartist]] and published a critical history in 1817 from his French exile, based on his privileged access to its archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly as a result of Llorente's criticisms, the Inquisition was once again temporarily abolished during the three-year Liberal interlude known as the [[Trienio liberal]], but still the old system had not yet had its last gasp. Later, during the period known as the [[Ominous Decade]], the Inquisition was not formally re-established,&lt;ref&gt;Historians have different interpretations. One argument is that during the Ominous Decade, the Inquisition was re-established- because of a statement made by [[King Alphonso]] upon a visit to the Vatican that he would reintroduce it if the occasion arose, but the Royal Decree that would have abolished the order of the Trienio Liberal was never approved, or at least, never published. The formal abolition under the regency of Maria Cristina was thus nothing more than a ratification of the abolition of 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; although, ''de facto'', it returned under the so-called Congregation of the Meetings of Faith, tolerated in the dioceses by King Ferdinand.  On 26 July 1826 the "Meetings of Faith" Congregation condemned and executed the school teacher [[Cayetano Ripoll]], who thus became the last person known to be executed by the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|pp=372-373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On that day, Ripoll was hanged in [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], for having taught [[deist]] principles.  This execution occurred against the backdrop of a European-wide scandal concerning the despotic attitudes still prevailing in Spain.  Finally, on 15 July 1834, the Spanish Inquisition was definitively abolished by a Royal Decree signed by regent [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies]], Ferdinand VII's liberal widow, during the minority of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and with the approval of the President of the Cabinet [[Francisco Martínez de la Rosa]]. (It is possible that something similar to the Inquisition acted during the 1833–1839 [[First Carlist War]], in the zones dominated by the Carlists, since one of the government measures praised by [[Conde de Molina Carlos Maria Isidro de Borbon]] was the re-implementation of the Inquisition to protect the Church). During the Carlist Wars it was the conservatives who fought the liberals who wanted to reduce the Church's power, amongst other reforms to liberalize the economy. It can be added that [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] is alleged to have stated that he would attempt to reintroduce it, possibly as a sop to Vatican approval of his coup.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The [[Alhambra Decree]] that had expelled the Jews was formally rescinded on 16 December 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/17/archives/1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-by-spain-1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-in.html 1492 Ban on Jews Is Voided by Spain]– ''The New York Times'', 17 December 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

===Confiscations===
It is unknown exactly how much wealth was confiscated from converted Jews and others tried by the Inquisition. Wealth confiscated in one year of persecution in the small town of Guadaloupe paid the costs of building a royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James Maxwell. Daily Life during the Spanish Inquisition. Greenwood Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-313-31667-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous records of the opinion of ordinary Spaniards of the time that "the Inquisition was devised simply to rob people". "They were burnt only for the money they had", a resident of Cuenca averred. "They burn only the well-off", said another. In 1504 an accused stated, "only the rich were burnt". In 1484 Catalina de Zamora was accused of asserting that "this Inquisition that the fathers are carrying out is as much for taking property from the conversos as for defending the faith. It is the goods that are the heretics." This saying passed into common usage in Spain. In 1524 a treasurer informed Charles V that his predecessor had received ten million ducats from the conversos, but the figure is unverified. In 1592 an inquisitor admitted that most of the fifty women he arrested were rich. In 1676, the Suprema claimed it had confiscated over 700,000 ducats for the royal treasury (which was paid money only after the Inquisition's own budget, amounting in one known case to only 5%). The property on Mallorca alone in 1678 was worth "well over 2,500,000 ducats".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|1998|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death tolls and sentenced===
[[File:Contemporary illustration of the Auto-da-fe held at Validolid Spain 21-05-1559..jpg|thumb|Contemporary illustration of the auto-da-fé of [[Valladolid]], in which fourteen Protestants were burned at the stake for their faith, on May 21, 1559]]
García Cárcel estimates that the total number prosecuted by the Inquisition throughout its history was approximately 150,000; applying the percentages of executions that appeared in the trials of 1560–1700—about 2%—the approximate total would be about 3,000 put to death. Nevertheless, some authors consider that the toll may have been higher, keeping in mind the data provided by Dedieu and García Cárcel for the tribunals of Toledo and Valencia, respectively, and estimate between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.&lt;ref name="Levack, Brian P. 1995"&gt;Data for executions for witchcraft: Levack, Brian P. (1995). The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe (Second Edition). London and New York: Longman, and see [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]] for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors disagree and estimate a max death toll between 1% and 5%, (depending on the time span used) combining all the processes the inquisition carried, both religious and non-religious ones.&lt;ref name="Bethencourt, Francisco 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eire, Carlos M. N. Reformations: The Early Modern World 1450-1650. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016 pp 640&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, this is significantly lower than the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe#Numbers of executions|number]] of people executed exclusively [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|for witchcraft in other parts of Europe]] during about the same time span as the Spanish Inquisition (estimated at c. 40,000–60,000).&lt;ref name="Levack, Brian P. 1995"/&gt; Other authors disagree with that statement though

Modern historians have begun to study the documentary records of the Inquisition. The archives of the Suprema, today held by the [[National Historical Archive (Spain)|National Historical Archive of Spain]] (Archivo Histórico Nacional), conserves the annual relations of all processes between 1540 and 1700. This material provides information for approximately 44,674 judgments. These 44,674 cases include 826 executions ''in persona'' and 778 ''in effigie'' (i.e. an effigy was burned). This material, however, is far from being complete—for example, the tribunal of Cuenca is entirely omitted, because no ''relaciones de causas'' from this tribunal have been found, and significant gaps concern some other tribunals (e.g., Valladolid). Many more cases not reported to the Suprema are known from the other sources (i.e., no ''relaciones de causas'' from Cuenca have been found, but its original records have been preserved), but were not included in Contreras-Henningsen's statistics for the methodological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;For full account see: Gustav Henningsen, ''The Database of the Spanish Inquisition. The relaciones de causas project revisited'', in: Heinz Mohnhaupt, Dieter Simon, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A_Sdchs7yAkC&amp;hl=pl Vorträge zur Justizforschung]'', Vittorio Klostermann, 1992, pp. 43-85.&lt;/ref&gt; William Monter estimates 1000 executions between 1530 and 1630 and 250 between 1630 and 1730.&lt;ref&gt;W. Monter, ''Frontiers of Heresy: The Spanish Inquisition from the Basque Lands to Sicily'', Cambridge 2003, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The secret archives of the Vatican regarding the Investigation have recently been disclosed, and are currently being revised. So far they support the lowest estimates given by historians for deaths and prosecution.

The archives of the Suprema only provide information about the processes which took place prior to 1560. To study the processes themselves, it is necessary to examine the archives of the local tribunals; however, the majority have been lost to the devastation of war, the ravages of time or other events. Some archives have survived including those of Toledo, where 12,000 were judged for offences related to heresy, mainly minor "blasphemy",  and those of Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dedieu, ''Los Cuatro Tiempos'', in Bartolomé Benassar, ''Inquisición Española: poder político y control social'', pp. 15-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|García Cárcel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; These indicate that the Inquisition was most active in the period between 1480 and 1530, and that during this period the percentage condemned to death was much more significant than in the years that followed. Modern estimates show approximately 2,000 executions ''in persona'' in the whole of Spain up to 1530.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse of power===
Author [[Toby Green]] notes that the great unchecked power given to inquisitors meant that they were "widely seen as above the law"&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"/&gt; and sometimes had motives for imprisoning and sometimes executing alleged offenders other than for the purpose of punishing religious nonconformity, mainly in Hispanoamerica and Iberoamerica.&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de las Indias, Seville, Santa Fe 228, Expediente 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green-2007-4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de las Indias, Seville, Santa Fe 228, Expediente 81A, n.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Green quotes a complaint by historian Manuel Barrios&lt;ref name="Green-2007-65"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; about one Inquisitor, [[Diego Rodriguez Lucero]], who in Cordoba in 1506 burned to death the husbands of two different women he then kept as mistresses. According to Barrios, &lt;blockquote&gt;the daughter of Diego Celemin was exceptionally beautiful, her parents and her husband did not want to give her to [Lucero], and so Lucero had the three of them burnt and now has a child by her, and he has kept for a long time in the [[Alcázar of Seville|alcazar]] as a mistress.&lt;ref name="Barrios-1991-58"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrios|first1=Manuel|title=El Tribunal de la Inquisicion en Andalucia: Seleccion de Textos y Documentos|date=1991|publisher=J.

Defenders of the Inquisition discrediting with Green are many and seem to be the growing trend in current scholarship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; These authors don't necessarily deny the abuses of power but classify them as politically instigated and comparable to those of any other law enforcement body of the period. Criticisms, usually indirect, have gone from the suspiciously sexual overtones or similarities of these accounts with unrelated older antisemitic accounts of kidnap and torture,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; to the clear proofs of control that the king had over the institution, to the sources used by Green,&lt;ref&gt;Contreras, Jaime y Gustav Henningsen (1986). “Forty-four thousand cases of the Spanish Inquisition (1540-1700): analysis of a historical data bank”, en Henningsen G., J. A. Tedeschi et al. (comps.), The Inquisition in early modern Europe: studies on sources and methods. Dekalb: Northern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or just by reaching completely different conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joseph (2006). The Spanish Inquisition: a history. New Haven, CT : Yale University Press; p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juan Antonio Llorente: Historia crítica de la Inquisición en España (tomo IV, p. 183). Madrid: Hiperión, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the context of Hispano America, that Green refers to often, was different from the Iberian context studied for many of those authors, due to the distance from the immediate executive power of the King, and deserves to be examined separately. Among those who do, there are also discrediting voices regarding the nature and extent of the Inquisition's abuses.&lt;ref&gt;''Las luchas por la memoria en América Latina.

==Historiography==
&lt;!--NOTE: This intro paragraph is a high-level summary of the content below. Please add specific new information to the main sub-sections below.--&gt;
How historians and commentators have viewed the Spanish Inquisition has changed over time and continues to be a source of controversy. Before and during the 19th century historical interest focused on who was being persecuted. In the early and mid 20th century, historians examined the specifics of what happened and how it influenced Spanish history. In the later 20th and 21st century, historians have re-examined how severe the Inquisition really was, calling into question some of the assumptions made earlier periods.

===19th to early 20th century scholarship===
Before the rise of professional historians in the 19th century, the Spanish Inquisition had largely been portrayed by Protestant scholars who saw it as the archetypal symbol of Catholic intolerance and ecclesiastical power.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; The Spanish Inquisition for them was largely associated with the persecution of Protestants, or inexplicably, of witches.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; [[William H. Prescott]] described the Inquisition as an "eye that never slumbered".  Despite of the existence of extensive documentation regarding the trials and procedures, and to the Inquisition's deep bureaucratization, none of these sources were studied outside of Spain, and Spanish scholars arguing against the predominant view were automatically dismissed. The 19th-century professional historians, including the Spanish scholar [[José Amador de los Ríos|Amador de los Ríos]], were the first to successfully challenge this perception in the international sphere and get foreign scholars to make eco of their discoveries. Said scholars would obtain international recognition and start a period of revision on the [[Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt;

At the start of the 20th century [[Henry Charles Lea]] published the groundbreaking ''History of the Inquisition in Spain''. This influential work describes the Spanish Inquisition as "an engine of immense power, constantly applied for the furtherance of obscurantism, the repression of thought, the exclusion of foreign ideas and the obstruction of progress."&lt;ref name=kagan&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/19/reviews/980419.19kagent.html "A Kinder, Gentler Inquisition"], by [[Richard Kagan]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'', 19 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Lea documented the Inquisition's methods and modes of operation in no uncertain terms, calling it "theocratic absolutism" at its worst.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; In the context of the polarization between Protestants and Catholics during the second half of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=leabio/&gt; some of Lea's contemporaries, as well as most modern scholars thought Lea's work had an [[anti-Catholic]] bias.&lt;ref name=leabio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/mss/lea/leabio.html/ |title=Henry Charles Lea Papers - Biographical Sketch |website=Univ. of Penn.-Penn Special Collections |accessdate=2007-04-18 |date=January 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/article3.html |title=A New Industry: The Inquisition |website=Catholic.net |accessdate=2007-04-18 |date=12 November 1996|last=Van Hove |first=Brian |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070405150258/http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/article3.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1920s, Jewish scholars picked up where Lea's work left off.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; They published [[Yitzhak Baer]]'s ''History of the Jews in Christian Spain'', [[Cecil Roth]]'s ''History of the Marranos'' and, after World War II, the work of [[Haim Beinart]], who for the first time published trial transcripts of cases involving conversos.

Contemporary historians who subscribe to the idea that the image of the Inquisition in historiography has been systematically deformed by the Black Legend include [[Edward Peters (scholar)|Edward Peters]], [[Philip Wayne Powell]], [[William S.Maltby]],  [[Richard Kagan]], [[Margaret R. Greer]], [[Helen Rawlings]], [[Ronnie Hsia]], [[Lu Ann Homza]], [[Stanley G. Payne]], [[Andrea Donofrio]], [[Irene Silverblatt]], [[Christopher Schmidt-Nowara]], [[Charles Gibson (historian)|Charles Gibson]], and [[Joseph Pérez]]. Contemporary historians who support the traditional view and deny the existence of a Black Legend include [[Toby Green]]. Contemporary historians who partially accept an impact of the Black Legend but deny other aspects of the hypothesis it include [[Henry Kamen]], [[David Nirenberg]] and [[Karen Armstrong]].

=== Revision after 1960 ===
{{Main|Historical revision of the Inquisition}}
The works of [[Julian Juderias|Juderias]] in (1913) and other Spanish scholars prior to him was mostly ignored by international scholarship until 1960.

One of the first books to build on them and internationally challenge the classical view was ''The Spanish Inquisition'' (1965) by [[Henry Kamen]]. Kamen argued that the Inquisition was not nearly as cruel or as powerful as commonly believed. The book was very influential and largely responsible for subsequent studies in the 1970s to try to quantify (from archival records) the Inquisition's activities from 1480 to 1834.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Jean-Pierre Dedieu, Los Cuatro Tiempos, in Bartolomé Benassar, Inquisición Española: poder político y control social, pp. 15-39 and {{harvp|García Cárcel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those studies showed there was an initial burst of activity against conversos suspected of relapsing into Judaism, and a mid-16th century pursuit of Protestants, but the Inquisition served principally as a forum Spaniards occasionally used to humiliate and punish people they did not like: blasphemers, bigamists, foreigners and, in Aragon, homosexuals and horse smugglers.&lt;ref name=kagan/&gt; Kamen went on to publish two more books in 1985 and 2006 that incorporated new findings, further supporting the view that the Inquisition was not as bad as once described by Lea and others. Along similar lines is [[Edward Peters (scholar)|Edward Peters]]'s ''Inquisition'' (1988).

One of the most important works about the inquisition´s relation to the Jewish conversos or New Christians is ''The Origins of the Inquisition in Fifteenth Century Spain'' (1995/2002) by [[Benzion Netanyahu]]. It challenges the view that most conversos were actually practicing Judaism in secret and were persecuted for their crypto-Judaism. Rather, according to Netanyahu, the persecution was fundamentally racial, and was a matter of envy of their success in Spanish society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/news-and-politics/38335/personal-history/ Benzion Netanyahu’s History]&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged multiple times, and with some reasonable divergences the majority of historians either align with religious causes or with merely cultural ones, with no significant racial element.&lt;ref&gt;Vicente Ángel Álvarez Palenzuela. ''Judíos y conversos en la España medieval. Estado de la cuestión'' (Jews and converts in medieval Spain. Estate of the matter). Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) eHumanista/Converso 4 (2015):156-191 [http://www.ehumanista.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.span.d7_eh/files/sitefiles/conversos/volume3/11%20ehumcon4.palenzuela.pdf It can be checked for free here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenging some of the claims of revisionist historians is [[Toby Green]] in ''Inquisition, the Reign of Fear'', who calls the claim by revisionists that torture was only rarely applied by inquisitors, a "worrying error of fact".&lt;ref name="Green-2007-10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Toby|title=Inquisition : the Reign of Fear|date=2007|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53724-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Thomas F. Madden]] has written about popular myths of the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/211193/real-inquisition-thomas-f-madden ''The Real Inquisition: investigating the popular myth''] by [[Thomas F. Madden]] ([[National Review]], 18 June 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
[[File:Francisco de Goya - Escena de Inquisición - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Inquisition Tribunal]] as illustrated by [[Francisco de Goya]]]]

The literature of the 18th century approaches the theme of the Inquisition from a critical point of view. In ''[[Candide]]'' by [[Voltaire]], the Inquisition appears as the epitome of intolerance and arbitrary justice in Europe.

During the [[Romanticism|Romantic Period]], the [[Gothic novel]], which was primarily a genre developed in Protestant countries, frequently associated Catholicism with terror and repression. This vision of the Spanish Inquisition appears in, among other works, ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796) by [[Matthew Gregory Lewis]] (set in Madrid during the Inquisition, but can be seen as commenting on the [[French Revolution]] and [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]]); ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'' (1820) by [[Charles Robert Maturin]] and ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' by [[Poland|Polish]] author [[Jan Potocki]].

Literature of the 19th century tends to focus on the element of torture employed by the Inquisition. In France, in the early 19th century, the [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Cornelia Bororquia, or the Victim of the Inquisition]]'', which has been attributed to Spaniard [[Luiz Gutiérrez]], and is based on the case of [[María de Bohórquez]], ferociously criticizes the Inquisition and its representatives. The Inquisition also appears in one of the chapters of the novel ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880) by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], which imagines an encounter between [[Jesus]] and the Inquisitor General. One of the best known stories of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]", explores along the same lines the use of torture by the Inquisition. [[File:Ф.Гойя. Из цикла Los Caprichos 1797-98.jpg|thumb|upright|''There was no remedy'', from ''[[Caprichos|Los Caprichos]]'', 1797–98, by Francisco de Goya.]] The novel [[Cornelia Bororquia]] was published in France, probably by a French writer under the false name of Luis Gutiérrez. The Inquisition, as portrayed by the Black legend, has a prominent role in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].

The Inquisition also appears in 20th-century literature. ''La Gesta del Marrano'', by the Argentine author [[Marcos Aguinis]], portrays the length of the Inquisition's arm to reach people in Argentina during the 16th and 17th centuries. The first book in [[Les Daniels]]' "Don Sebastian Vampire Chronicles", ''The Black Castle'' (1978), is set in 15th-century Spain and includes both descriptions of Inquisitorial questioning and an [[auto-da-fé]], as well as [[Tomás de Torquemada]] appearing in one chapter. The [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' shows the Inquisition targeting [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutants]] for "blasphemy". The character [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] also appears as the [[Grand Inquisitor]]. The [[Captain Alatriste]] novels by the Spanish writer [[Arturo Pérez-Reverte]] are set in the early 17th century. The second novel, ''Purity of Blood'', has the narrator being tortured by the Inquisition and describes an [[auto-da-fé]]. [[Carme Riera]]'s novella, published in 1994, ''[[Dins el Darrer Blau]]'' (''In the Last Blue'') is set during the repression of the ''chuetas'' (''conversos'' from [[Majorca]]) at the end of the 17th century. In 1998, the Spanish writer [[Miguel Delibes]] published the historical novel ''The Heretic'', about the Protestants of [[Valladolid]] and their repression by the Inquisition. [[Samuel Shellabarger]]'s ''[[Captain from Castile]]'' deals directly with the Spanish Inquisition during the first part of the novel.

In the novel [[Cathedral of the Sea|La Catedral del Mar]]  by [[Ildefonso Falcones]], published in 2006 and set in the 14th century, there are scenes of inquisition investigations in small towns and a great scene in Barcelona.

===Film===
* The 1947 epic ''[[Captain from Castile]]'' by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], starring [[Tyrone Power]], uses the Inquisition as the major plot point of the film. It tells how powerful families used its evils to ruin their rivals. The first part of the film shows this and the reach of the Inquisition reoccurs throughout this movie following [[Pedro De Vargas]] (played by Power) even to the 'New World'.
* The [[The History of the World Part 1#The Spanish Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition segment]] of the 1981 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[The History of the World Part 1]]'' is a comedic musical performance based on the activities of the first [[Inquisitor General]] of Spain, [[Tomás de Torquemada]].
* The film ''[[The Fountain]]'' (2006), by [[Darren Aronofsky]], features the Spanish Inquisition as part of a plot in 1500 when the Grand Inquisitor threatens Queen Isabella's life.
* ''[[Goya's Ghosts]]'' (2006) by [[Miloš Forman]] is set in Spain between 1792 and 1809 and focuses realistically on the role of the Inquisition and its end under Napoleon's rule.
* The film ''[[Assassin's Creed (film)|Assassin's Creed]]'' (2016) by [[Justin Kurzel]], starring [[Michael Fassbender]], is set in both modern times and Spain during the Inquisition. The film follows Callum Lynch (played by Fassbender) as he is forced to relive the memories of his ancestor, Aguilar de Nehra (also played by Fassbender), an Assassin during the Spanish Inquisition.
* ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]'' ([[Roger Corman]], 1961).
*''[[Akelarre]]'' (Pedro Olea, 1984), a film, about the [[Logroño]] trial of the [[Zugarramurdi witches]].
*[[Tomás de Torquemada]] is portrayed in ''[[1492: The Conquest of Paradise]]'' (1992)

===Theatre, music, television, and video games===

* The Grand Inquisitor of Spain plays a part in ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'' (1867), a play by [[Friedrich Schiller]] (which was the basis for the opera ''[[Don Carlos]]'' in five acts by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], in which the Inquisitor is also featured, and the third act is dedicated to an ''auto-da-fé'').
* In the ''[[Monty Python]]'' comedy team's [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition sketches]], an inept Inquisitor group repeatedly bursts into scenes after someone utters the words "I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition", screaming "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!" The Inquisition then uses ineffectual forms of [[torture]], including a dish-drying [[Rack (torture)|rack]], soft cushions and a comfy chair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf_Y4MbUCLY 'Spanish Inquisition' Compilation - Monty Python's Flying Circus]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spanish Inquisition features as a main plot line element of the 2009 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''.
*The video game ''[[Nicolas Eymerich]]'' features a cruel, bloodthirsty and torture hungry Inquisitor as the main character.
* The Universe of ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' borrows several elements and concepts of the Catholic church Imaginarium, including the notion of the Black Legend's ideal of a fanatic Inquisitors, for some of its troops in ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr]]''.
*The 1965 musical [[Man of La Mancha]] depicts a fictionalized account of author [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' run-in with Spanish authorities. The character of Cervantes produces a play-within-a-play of his unfinished manuscript, [[Don Quixote]], while he awaits sentencing by the Inquisition.

===Contemporary politics===

The Spanish Inquisition is a recurring trope that makes an occasional appearance in the British parliament, similar to calling something "nazi" to reject ideas seen as religiously authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbett's Parliamentary History of England: From the Norman, Volumen 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of Language==
[[Language]] is the most powerful and central tool in achieving our educational goal. When it comes for examining language, words are focal points and we begin our investigation of language [[structure]] by looking at words from four of the following perspectives:
* Their parts should be meaningful.
* Their sounds of [[syllables]] that make them up.
* The principles that organize them into [[phrases]] and sentences.
* The [[semantic]] relationships that link them in sets.
Its only through language, a person tries to express is thought , feelings, moods, aspiration which influence the ultimate and deepest foundation of the society.

=== Importance of language in the Modern World ===

English plays an important role in our present Educational system and also in our National life. it has become one of the common language and a person one who is fluent in speaking English can be a world citizen. India is a multi-lingual country were there are many languages spoken in different parts of our country. English language helps to communicate with ease .through structural approach we can learn English or any other language fluently. structural approach teaches to learn sentences in a systematic manner which involves the structure, sequencing and pattern arrangement of a words to make a proper and complete sentences with meaning. Today importance of English cannot be under estimated. It is a global language and it is the language of opportunities for the millions of youth around the world.

=== Maximum Use of the Foreign Language ===
The emphasis by structural approach on the teaching of the graded structures of a language means that the classroom should have the maximum foreign language environment. This is characteristic feature in structural approach. Where grammar-translation method is used, the classroom is characterized by two factors: 1) practice in reading and writing and 2) maximum use of mother-tongue. In reaction to these practices structural approach advocates methods which would include - a) practice in the speech-skills, not because reading and writing should be neglected (as would be the case in the direct method), but that the teaching of the graded structures can be better undertaken through aural-oral work.

==About Structural Approach==
The Structural Approach is a technique wherein the learner masters the pattern of sentence. Structures are the different arrangements of words in one accepted style or the other. It includes various modes in which clauses, phrases or word might be used. It is based on the assumptions that language can be best learnt through a scientific selection and grading of the structures or patterns of sentences and vocabulary.

==Definition==
This approach as Kripa K. Gautam states "is based on the belief that language consists of 'structures' and that the mastery of these structures is more important than the acquisition of vocabulary. Since structure is what is important and unique about a language, early practice should focus on mastery of [[phonological]] and grammatical structures rather than on mastery of vocabulary."
Kulkarni "emphasizes the teaching and learning of the basic items or materials that constitute the framework of language."
Whereas according to Yardi 'structures' as an "internal ordering of [[linguistic]] item", and further adds that structures may be defined as "device that we use to make signal, to convey meanings, and indicate relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guatam|first1=Kripa|title=Chapter 3 Methods and Approaches of English Language Teaching in India|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/20567/10/10_chapter%203.pdf|website=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
According to Menon and Patel the objectives of the new structural approach are as follows:-
* To lay the foundation of English by establishing through drill and repetition about 275 graded structures.
* To enable the children to attain mastery over an essential vocabulary of about 3000 root words for active use.
* To correlate the teaching of [[grammar]] and [[composition (language)|composition]] with the reading lesson.
* To teach the four fundamental skills, namely understanding, speaking, reading and writing in the order names.
* To lay proper emphasis on the aural- oral approach, activity methods and the condemnation of formal grammar for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=De|first1=Ardhendu|title=The Sturctural Approach To Teaching Of English: The Possible Grounds for Dissatisfaction|url=http://ardhendude.blogspot.in/2011/09/structural-approach-to-teaching-of.html|website=http://ardhendude.blogspot.in|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features of structural approach ==
The structural approach makes use of the following features for teaching the language:
* Word order - Word order or the pattern of form is very important in Language for e.g: 
a) Jo broke his toy

b) The toy broke Jo

sentence a) Jo broke his toy - makes proper sense. it shows the arrangement or pattern of words.
* The presence of function words:
Function words help in modifying meaning considered the following sentence -

for e.g:

a) I ate an ice cream.

b) I'm eating an ice cream.

c) I will eat an ice cream.

In the above given example, we can see the modified meaning.
* the use of few Inflections:
By adding an affix, the base form of the word can be altered.e.g:

a) In verbs: I play; he plays; I am playing ; I played

b) In nouns; One boy; two boys; one man

c) In adjective and adverb: Great - Greater - Greatest

== Principles of the structural approach ==

Prof. F.G.French has entitled the following principles underlying the structural approach:
# Importance of Framing Language Habits.
# Importance of Speech - The structural approach is based on the principle of effective used of speech.
# Importance pupil's activity.
# The Principles of Oral work - Oral work is the basis and all the rest are built up from it.
# Each language as its own Grammar - Instead of teaching Grammar of the target language and its structures are to be taught.{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}
# Creation of different types of meaningful situations by dramatization, facial expression, actions etc. Is stressed upon.
# One item of language is taught at one time.
# Mastery of structures is emphasized.

== Selection of structures ==
How should a teacher select the structure to teach the learner. This involves the selection of structures. In the structural approach mainly the focus will be on structures. The following principles should be kept in mind while selecting structures :
* '''Usefulness''' - the structures, which are more frequent in use should be introduced first
* '''Productivity''' - some if the structures are productive, other structures can be built upon. for e.g: we have two sentence pattern- a) Mr. Roy is here b) Here is Mr.Roy
the former pattern is productive because we can frame many sentences on the same pattern like - He is there etc.
* '''Simplicity''' - The simplicity of the structure depends upon the form and the meaning.
* '''Teach-ability''' - Items easy from teaching point of view.
* '''Frequency''' - The structures must be selected with a high frequency of occurrence.
* '''Range''' -  to know, in how many contexts it is applicable
* '''Coverage''' - A word covering a number of meanings For e.g: Meals
* '''Learnabiliy''' - teacher should focus on the items that are easy for students to learn should be taken first.

== Gradation of Structure ==
Structural approach upholds the teaching of English as a foreign language through the teaching of the structures of the language. The questions which structural approach attempts to answer primarily are: (1) should the structural items and sentence patterns to be graded? (2) how shall they be graded? and (3) what should be the fundamental principles of grading the structural items? through gradation of structure, we can get answers for the following Questions.

Gradation means grouping synonyms. In structural approach, gradation of structure can be taught by using the following patterns that should be taught at early stages:
# '''Grouping :-'''
a) Phonetic grouping - group according to sound. for example: cat, rat, mat etc.

b) Lexical grouping - grouping according to words used in same situation.

c) grammatical grouping - pattern of sentences similar should be taught together.

d) Semantic grouping - Words having similar meaning grouped together.

e) Structure Grouping - selecting items that are fit for each other.

2. '''Sequencing :-'''

a) Grammatical sequencing - it will tell that it follows which structure. e.g.: I was watching a movie. I was watching a movie with my friend.

b) Semantic sequencing - A word having different meanings e.g.: The ball is there, under the bed. There are many balls in the bag.

c) Lexical sequencing - It Tells which word follows which e.g.: sit-stand, come-go, high-low

3. '''Types of patterns of sentences:'''

there are different patterns of sentence. as follows below:

a) Two- part patterns like She goes (she / goes)

b) Three-part patterns e.g: He is reading (He / is / reading )

c) Four-part patterns e.g: Geetha went to school ( Geetha/went/to/school)

d) Patterns beginning with 'there', 'wh' type question e.g: There are five baskets in the rack. What is your name? 

e) Patterns of Command and Request e.g: come here, sit down , stand up etc.

f) Formal pattern - like Good Morning, Thank You etc.

4. '''Sentence Patterns'''

The structures may have the following pattern like:

a) Statement of Fact - mention simple facts e.g: Pinky gets up at 6 a.m. She takes bath. she eats her breakfast. she goes to school. ( subject-verb-object pattern )

b) Imperative sentence - Question form verb-subject-object pattern e.g: Did Pinky come to school today? has she taken her breakfast ?

c) Imperative sentence ( imply compliance) subject remains hidden. e.g.: (Pinky) Come here , Close the door , Bring your book etc.

5. '''Phrase Patterns'''

Sentence using phases are called Phrase pattern. e.g: That book is 'on the table'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''Swedish Institute in Rome''' ({{lang-sv|Svenska Institutet i Rom}}, {{lang-it|Istituto Svedese di studi classici a Roma}}) is a research institution that serves as the base for archaeological excavations and other scientific research in [[Italy]]. It also pursues academic instruction in [[archaeology]] and art sciences as well as arranging conferences with themes of interest to the institute. The Institute has at its disposal a building in central [[Rome]] with a relatively well-supplied library, archaeological laboratory and around twenty rooms and smaller apartments for the use of visiting researchers and holders of scholarships.

The institute was founded in 1925 by, among others, King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], then Crown Prince of [[Sweden]].

==Excavations==
The Institute has conducted several major excavations. Before [[World War II]], excavations were carried out on the [[Forum Romanum]] among other places, but since then most of them have taken place in southern [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isvroma.it/public/NEW/English/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=55 Istituto Svedese di studi classici a Roma - History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309011435/http://www.isvroma.it/public/New/English/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=55 |date=2017-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''German Academy of the Noble Arts of Architecture, Sculpture and Painting''''', or '''''Teutsche Academie''''', refers to a comprehensive dictionary of art by [[Joachim von Sandrart]] published in the late 17th century. The first version was published in 1675 and it included a compilation of artist biographies  that were later accompanied by illustrations by [[Richard Collin]] for a 1683 Latin edition by [[Christianus Rhodius]]. The list of portrait illustrations follows and is in page order. Most of the biographies were translated into German from earlier work by [[Karel van Mander]] and [[Cornelis de Bie]], but Sandrart had travelled extensively in Europe and added many original biographies of German-born artists to his list. The illustrated portraits of artists born before his time were mostly based on 17th-century engravings by [[Hieronymus Cock]] and [[Jan Meyssens]], many of which had also been re-published in De Bie's [[Het Gulden Cabinet]].

==About==
"Focusing on comedy and talk, ''The Bob &amp; Tom Show'' is a mash-up of news, sports, conversation, and interviews"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobandtom.com/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which airs new broadcasts every weekday morning live from 6 to 10 A.M. in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] (5–9 A.M. [[Central_Time_Zone|Central]]) or [[Broadcast_delay|tape-delayed]] on affiliated stations in other time zones.&lt;ref name="bobandtom.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobandtom.com/stations/|title=Stations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an additional weekday segment which airs between 10:00 and 10:20 A.M. ET only on [[flagship (radio)|home station]] [[WFBQ]]. As of February 13, 2017, the post-show segment airs only on select dates rather than daily.

Since January 31, 2011, ''The Bob &amp; Tom Show'' has aired on the [[American Forces Network]] as the morning show on AFN's Legacy Channel-The World's Classic Rock Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiosyndicationtalk.com/2010/11/16/american-forces-radio-net-adds-bob-tom/|title=American Forces Radio Net Adds Bob &amp; Tom|date=16 November 2010|publisher=radiosyndicationtalk.com|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bob &amp; Tom Show'' repurposes their live morning show as an overnight show called ''Bob &amp; Tom All Nighter''. ''All Nighter'' airs 12–5 A.M. on a few terrestrial affiliated stations and their streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.bobandtom.com/gen3/affiliates.htm|title=The Bob &amp; Tom Show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the show, live or pre-recorded comic songs and skits are often played, including many from a huge library of archived pieces. There are frequent impromptu "calls" from numerous characters voiced primarily by Steve Salge, Ron Sexton, and Dean Metcalf.

Several guests usually join the primary cast each day in the studio or via phone or satellite, including numerous comedians who tour nationally. The show has frequently featured up-and-coming comedians who went on to become household names, including [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Louis CK]], [[Jim Gaffigan]], [[Daniel Tosh]], [[George Lopez]], [[Brad Garrett]], [[Ron White]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/nuvo-at-25-before-they-were-comedy-stars/Content?oid=3077611|title=nuvo.net - Indy's Alternative Voice|first=|last=NUVO|website=NUVO}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tim Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PehGbmsOgc|title=Tim Allen on the BOB &amp; TOM Show in 1988|first=|last=The BOB &amp; TOM Show|date=31 July 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional athletes (including frequent guest [[Pat McAfee]] and, in past years, [[Peyton Manning]], [[Jeff Saturday]], [[Reggie Miller]], and numerous [[INDYCAR]] drivers), musicians, and actors from television and movies are also frequent ''Bob &amp; Tom'' guests. The show has occasionally talked with national politicians, although those interviews generally steer clear of controversial issues. Nationally known authors including frequent guest [[John Feinstein]] have also been featured.

The show introduced the free ''Bob &amp; Tom Show App'' for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in early 2016,&lt;ref name="bobandtom.com"/&gt; through which users may hear live streams of new broadcasts on weekday mornings through affiliate stations&lt;ref name="bobandtom.com1"/&gt; plus "B&amp;T 24/7," a continuous stream of "Best of ''Bob &amp; Tom''" shows. This marked the first time that a stream of broadcasts from the show's archive became available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at no charge to listeners. Previously, "B&amp;T 24/7" was available only to paid subscribers of the "VIP" feature at the show's web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://members.bobandtom.com/pcd/document?ikey=99001IGTZ|title=B&amp;T VIP|website=members.bobandtom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "B&amp;T 24/7" features segments recorded throughout the show's history, most featuring the original primary cast of Bob, Tom, Chick, and Kristi.

==History==
For most of ''The Bob &amp; Tom Show’s'' 35+ year history, the cast consisted of hosts [[Bob Kevoian]] and [[Tom Griswold]], sports commentator and [[Double act|comic foil]] [[Chick McGee]], news director [[Kristi Lee]], and producer Dean Metcalf. Kevoian and Griswold originally teamed up in the early 1980s at [[Petoskey, Michigan]] station [[WJML]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/lima-news/1999-09-09/page-35|title=Radio listeners can't get enough of BOB &amp; TOM SHOW|last=Harvey|first=Brad|date=9 September 1999|publisher=Lima News|pages=(on page 35)|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being lured to [[WFBQ]] "Q95" Indianapolis in 1983 to host what was initially a music-heavy morning show.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/bob-from-bob-and-tom-the-exit-interview/Content?oid=3653010|title=nuvo.net - Indy's Alternative Voice|first=|last=NUVO|website=NUVO}}&lt;/ref&gt; After McGee (in 1986) and Lee (in 1988) joined the show, the primary cast that listeners would know for decades simply as “Bob, Tom, Chick, and Kristi” was set.

As the show became more popular and successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/11165-bob-tom-keep-q95-on-a-roll-even-as-classic-rock-format-shows-age|title=Bob &amp; Tom keep Q95 on a roll even as classic-rock format shows age|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Patrick]], Dave Dugan, Whit Grayson, Steve Salge, and Ron Sexton joined the ''Bob &amp; Tom'' staff to voice dozens of recurring fictional and parody characters. Salge and Sexton, along with Metcalf, are still active today as voices of most of the show’s fictional characters and callers.

On January 5, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goerie.com/bob--tom-comedy-tour-plays-erie-on-friday|title='Bob &amp; Tom Comedy Tour' plays Erie on Friday|last=Richards|first=Dave|date=9 April 2014|publisher=Erie-Times News|accessdate=26 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203113217/http://www.goerie.com/bob--tom-comedy-tour-plays-erie-on-friday|archivedate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chick left ''The Bob &amp; Tom Show'' to become co-host of a show called ''Kevin &amp; McGee'' at [[KGB-FM]] in [[San Diego, CA|San Diego]], [[California]]. After six months in San Diego, McGee returned on July 10, 1995 to his former job on ''The Bob &amp; Tom Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/107418715/?terms=chick%2Bmcgee|title=Chick McGee back with WFBQ|date=July 12, 1995|publisher=Indianapolis Star|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Wilson (radio personality)|Dave Wilson]] filled in for Chick at first&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/106933596/|title=D-a-a-a-a-v-e Wilson replaces Chick McGee|date=January 6, 1995|publisher=Indianapolis Star|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then Gunner filled in for the rest of Chick's absence.

[[Steve Allee]] is the show's music director. He has co-produced more than 50 ''Bob &amp; Tom'' albums over the past 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steveallee.com/Steve-allee-bio.html|title=Steve Allee - biography|website=www.steveallee.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the show, Pat Carlini served as a fifth in-studio cast member, joining Bob, Tom, Chick, and Kristi during their second or third hour after Carlini completed her weather-casting and news anchor duties at [[WTHR]] television's morning news program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patcarlini.com/pats-bio/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the show was first syndicated in January 1995, Dave "Gunner" Gunn sometimes filled in for Bob, Tom, Chick, or Kristi when one of them was absent. Additionally, for several days in May 2016, Gunner filled in while Chick was on vacation, which was Gunner's first appearance during all-new broadcasts in years. Subsequently, Gunner occasionally joined the cast, both to "run the board" (operate the broadcast studio's main audio [[mixing console]], which Tom calls "master control") and to serve as an additional co-host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=GunnerRocks|author=Gunner|number=734698438781239296|date=23 May 2016|title=@bobandtom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunner served as the show's host during "Best of ''Bob &amp; Tom''" broadcasts when the primary cast was on vacation until the January 2017 debut of his sports-oriented morning show on sister station [[WNDE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/01/18/sports-talk-radio-indianapolis-fox-stuck-gunner-iheart-colts-pacers-flagrant-foul/96689304/|title=‘Flagrant Foul’ aims to wake up local sports radio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosting duties for "Best of" broadcasts have subsequently been handled by Christopher Geisen, formerly of [[WOFX-FM]] in Cincinnati, and the Kerrigan &amp; Christopher morning show at [[WTUE]] in Dayton, Ohio, and now a member of the show's staff.

On September 1, 2015, Bob and Tom were selected as inductees to the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]]. The induction ceremony took place on November 5, 2015, at the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] in downtown Chicago. During his induction speech, Bob announced his retirement effective at the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_YFS8dbV4k|title=Bob and Tom Accept their Induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame|first=|last=The BOB &amp; TOM Show|date=7 November 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He planned to spend retirement traveling with his wife, Becky.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Before Bob's retirement, [[Scott Potasnik]] ("P-taz") replaced Gunner as the fourth in-studio voice when Bob went on extended vacations or took Mondays off, and Potasnik remained an unofficial cast member for some time after Bob's retirement. Tom described "P-taz" as the show's "sex desk" correspondent and, after Bob's retirement, as its "fact checker." Potasnik's role with the show ended in early summer 2016.

During 2015 and 2016, the show frequently featured "guest hosts," usually comedians, as a fourth or fifth in-studio voice, sometimes for several days or weeks at a time. Josh Arnold served as a frequent guest host during spring and early summer of 2016 before being named a regular cast member on August 1, 2016.&lt;ref name="allaccess.com"/&gt;

[[Kristi Lee]] announced on January 11, 2016, that she, too, had left the show, having last appeared on December 17, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/2016/01/11/kevoian-griswold-bob-tom-indianapolis-q95-kristi-chick/78618738/|title=Kristi Lee exits 'The Bob &amp; Tom Show'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobandtom.com/2016/01/11/kristi-lee-exits-the-bob-tom-show/|title=Kristi Lee Exits the BOB &amp; TOM Show|date=11 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to the show on July 11, 2016, resuming her traditional news and commentary role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobandtom.com/2016/07/08/the-bob-tom-show-welcomes-kristi-lee-back-to-the-show/|title=The BOB &amp; TOM Show Welcomes Kristi Lee Back To The Show|date=July 8, 2016|publisher=The Bob and Tom Show|accessdate=July 8, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708154516/http://www.bobandtom.com/2016/07/08/the-bob-tom-show-welcomes-kristi-lee-back-to-the-show/|archivedate=July 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Kristi's absence, Carlini had re-joined ''The Bob &amp; Tom Show'' as news anchor (for all four hours each morning). After Kristi returned, Carlini appeared on a half-time basis for several days.

On November 17, 2016, Bob and Tom were reunited during their induction into the Indiana Broadcasters Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indianabroadcasters.org/iba-news/indiana-broadcasters-association-to-induct-five-history-making-broadcasters-into-richard-m-fairbanks-hall-of-fame/|title=Indiana Broadcasters Association to Induct Five History-Making Broadcasters into Richard M.

The "master control" seat, historically occupied by Bob, had been filled after his retirement mostly by ''Bob &amp; Tom'' staffers who did not speak on the air until Ace Cosby joined the show in 2017 as its in-studio engineer and occasional on-air contributor. Cosby joined ''Bob &amp; Tom'' flagship WFBQ in the early 1980s as an on-air personality and helped Kristi get her first job at the station. Tom refers to him as "the legendary Ace Cosby" as an homage to Cosby's 30 years of popularity with Indianapolis-area listeners and personal relationships with numerous rock musicians.&lt;ref&gt;https://kristileenews.com/the-legendary-ace-cosby/&lt;/ref&gt;

After Tom announced via social media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=bobandtom|author=The BOB &amp; TOM Show|number=938597256042897408|date=7 December 2017|title=A note from Tom:}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Finley, his four-year-old daughter with Kelly McCarthy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/12/07/bob-kevoian-helps-tom-griswold-during-family-health-crisis/930981001/|title=Bob steps up to mic to help former partner Tom on 'Bob &amp; Tom'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be undergoing surgery for the removal of a benign brain tumor, ''The Bob &amp; Tom Show'' announced that Bob would fill in for Tom during the show's regular broadcast on Friday, December 8, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=bobandtom|author=The BOB &amp; TOM Show|number=938815563555639297|date=7 December 2017|title=RT to spread the word that @bobkevoian is sitting in tomorrow morning!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=bobkevoian|author=Bob Kevoian|number=938801488062709766|date=7 December 2017|title=I'll be on the @bobandtom show tomorrow morning filling in for Tom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live shows==
The show's primary cast performed live on stage with guest comedians and live musicians at evening shows in venues around the country for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Later, they supported the [[Bob_and_Tom_Radio:_The_Comedy_Tour|''Friends of the Bob &amp; Tom Show Comedy Tour,'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobandtom.com/comedytour/|title=See the Friends of the BOB &amp; TOM Show Comedy Tour|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured many of their frequent guests and spawned [[Comedy Central]] broadcasts and a [[Bob_and_Tom_Radio:_The_Comedy_Tour|DVD recording]].

==Characters==
Many fictional characters and parodies of real-life people have sprung up during the show's history, some voiced by Bob Kevoian, Tom Griswold, Chick McGee, on-air producer Dean Metcalf, Steve Salge, and Ron Sexton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobandtom.com/pages/about |title=About the Show |date=2013 |work=Bob &amp; Tom Show website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208230251/http://www.bobandtom.com/pages/about |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sid Gurney (Whit Grayson)
*Bart McAllister (Dave Dugan)
*Captain Dave{{spaced ndash}}Captain of the Chum Dumpster (Steve Salge)
*Coach Ralph Fontaine (Ron Sexton)
*Kenny Tarmac (Ron Sexton)&amp;nbsp;– embodies that annoying traveling salesman on a flight with an overinflated sense of self-worth who feels the need to demonstrate to everyone how important he is by loudly calling someone just as the plane lands. He always uses airport abbreviations while referring to his locations to further illustrate just how busy and important he is. He always calls Bob and Tom when he lands, and he always gets another call while talking to them. On a few occasions, while talking to Bob and Tom, he will run into a big-time client, whom Kenny cannot remember by name. During this time, he puts Bob and Tom on hold, while he tries to use his "[[Zig Ziglar]] bag of tricks" to get the client to reveal his name, usually failing.
*Donnie Baker (played by Ron Sexton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Bob &amp; Tom Show|url=http://www.bobandtom.com/page.php?page_id=213|website=bobandtom.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)&amp;nbsp;–  regularly makes topical calls to the show and has a very authentic redneck accent. He relates anecdotes involving a good friend who had a semi-relevant experience, usually ending in a punch-line. Most of his calls are punctuated by a tagline like, "I swear to God" or "Look it up..." or "it's state law."  Sometimes, Donnie is corrected, or told to get off the phone by Randy, his work supervisor (voiced by Matt Thompson), after which he always yells, "Shut up Randy!" His calls usually come to an abrupt end, and always by him saying, "...I gotta go." Donnie also appears with his band as "Donnie Baker and the Pork Pistols".
*Mr. Obvious and the Caller (Chick McGee &amp; Dean Metcalf)&amp;nbsp;– A frequent skit subject on ''The Bob &amp; Tom Show'', Mr. Obvious is portrayed as a radio personality with his own show, ''The Mr. Obvious Show''. He gives obvious and simple advice about whatever problem the caller may have. The caller always seems to be the same person, and opens the conversation with "Hi, Mr. Obvious. Long time listener, first time caller." From there, the caller will describe his issue and give symptoms to help Mr. Obvious figure out his problem. Most of the time, the caller's issue is something that anyone else could figure out, but he cannot. Mr. Obvious is played by Chick McGee, and the caller is played by Dean Metcalf.

*[[Jack Bauer]] (from the TV series "[[24 (TV series)|24]]") (Steve Salge)

==TV program==
On November 3, 2008, [[WGN America]] began airing an hour-long TV show taken from the day's radio broadcast at Midnight ET Monday through Friday&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/wgn-america-add-bob-tom-lineup-109482|title=WGN America to Add Bob &amp; Tom to Lineup|last=Bachman|first=Katy|date=21 August 2008|publisher=AdWeek.com|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as of November 2009, it was moved to 2 a.m. ET). The program ended its run on WGN America on September 10, 2010, as part of an extensive revamp of the network's schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/radios-bob-tom-are-off-their-nightly-tv-show |title=Radio's Bob &amp; Tom are off their nightly TV show |date=September 21, 2010 |work=Radio-Info.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924080302/http://www.radio-info.com/news/radios-bob-tom-are-off-their-nightly-tv-show |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the deal, [[WTTV]] Indianapolis (another Tribune-owned station) would be the first to air the nightly one-hour telecast.

==Public service==
Over their career, the show has been actively involved in charitable work. Some of the albums they have produced since 1986 have been utilized to raise money for various charities. After the syndicated portion of their show ends at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern they typically devote up to a half-hour to further interviews, often about local events, bands, and charities.

In October, it has become tradition for Chick to get a [[prostate]] exam on the air to raise awareness for [[prostate cancer]]. Bob and Tom used to promote this exam as "Proctober";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/1773/it-won-t-hurt-a-bit-bob-and-tom-promote-prostate-c|title=It Won't Hurt A Bit: Bob and Tom Promote Prostate Cancer Screening|date=17 October 2005|publisher=AllAccess.com|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this exam is now "Rectember". The latest exam was held on September 6, 2011 with Gunner doing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobandtom.com/photo/view/gunner_s_exam/13377|title=Gunner's Exam - Photos - The Bob &amp; Tom Show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bob &amp; Tom Show'' has produced seven CDs for the USO to include in holiday care packages sent to troops stationed worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uso.org/program-partners.aspx|title=Corporate Partners|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob and Tom had a friendly wager with former [[Indianapolis Colts]] center [[Jeff Saturday]] that if he ever got a touchdown they would donate $5,000 to the charity of his choice. During the 2006–07 [[NFL]] season, they increased the wager to $10,000. They assumed that they were safe since [[offensive line]]men almost never score points in [[NFL]] games. In January 2007 in the AFC Championship game against the rival [[New England Patriots]], on a play near New England's goal line, [[Dominic Rhodes]] carried into the middle of the line and fumbled. Saturday fell on the ball in the end zone for the touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2007012101/2006/POST20/patriots@colts#tab=analyze|title=Watch New England Patriots vs. Indianapolis Colts [01/21/2007] - NFL.com|website=www.nfl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob and Tom made good on their wager and donated $10,000 total with $5,000 each going to People's Burn Foundation of Indiana and Kid's Voice of Indiana, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mike01s.wordpress.com/2007/01/25/jeff-saturday-earns-10k-for-favorite-charity/|title=Jeff Saturday earns $10K for favorite charity|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Wordpress.com|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/20261/bob-tom-pony-up|title=Bob &amp; Tom Pony Up|date=31 January 2007|publisher=AllAccess.com|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2014, Bob and Tom presented a comedy show as a tribute to the late [[Tim Wilson (comedian)|Tim Wilson]].  All proceeds went to help with the education of Tim's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andersonparamount.tix.com/Event.aspx?EventCode=649999|title=title|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Illuminator Art Collective''' was conceived of during the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement in [[New York City]] in 2011. Given an initial monetary grant by [[Ben Cohen (businessman)|Ben Cohen]], the group purchased and retrofit a cargo van to hold and maneuver a 12,000 lumen projector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679431/the-illuminator-the-occupy-wall-street-bat-signal-returns-with-a-batmobile |title=The Illuminator: The Occupy Wall Street Bat Signal Returns With A Batmobile |last1=Goldmark |first1=Alex |date=March 2, 2012 |website= Co.Exist|publisher=Fast Company |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the van is used by the collective to aid existing political movements. The group has worked with large political organizations such as [[Green Peace]] but typically assists grass roots movements in and around [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/multimedia/videos/Activists-Project-End-Coal-Around-Portland/ |title=Activists Project "End Coal" Around Portland! |date=November 5, 2013 |website= Greenpeace USA|publisher=Greenpeace |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity==
On November 17, 2012 '''The Illuminator''' projected the iconic [[We are the 99%|99%]] logo onto the [[Verizon]] building in Lower Manhattan as its first mission. It was meant to inspire protestors after they were evicted from [[Zuccoti Park]] and marched across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in clear view of the [[Verizon Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Paul |date=April 30, 2012 |title=Does Occupy signal the death of contemporary art? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17872666 |journal=BBC News Magazine |location=London |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also received notoriety for its projections on April 15, 2013 which consisted of messages of "solidarity" with the people of Boston after the [[Boston Marathon bombing]]. The projections were seen on the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/ny-loves-boston-light-projection-illuminator_n_3091931.html |title=

==Mission statement==
The group's website claims that the goal of the project is "To smash the myths of the information industry and allow people to find out for themselves what the 99% movement is fighting for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theilluminator.org/about |title=About The Illuminator |website=The Illuminator |accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a March, 2014 [[WNYC]] segment, members voiced concerns over [[late capitalism]] including political corruption and environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject=The Illuminator  |interviewer=Eric Molinsky |title=Forget the Bat Signal: This is a Protest |publisher=[[WNYC]] |location=New York |date=24 March 2014 |work=[[All Things Considered]] |accessdate=24 March 2014 |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/forget-bat-signal-this-is-a-protest/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles==
At least three members of the project have been taken in for questioning by the NYPD on more than one occasion. On February 8, 2013, an Illuminator was arrested after projecting a ballot box stuffed with dollar bills onto Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s apartment in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenchner|first1=Charles|title=My Recent Arrest While Driving the Illuminator Van|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/02/15/1187356/-My-Recent-Arrest-While-Driving-the-Illuminator-Van|website=Daily KOS|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two members were also arrested and charged with Illegal Advertising on September 9, 2014, though the charges were dropped soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Ben|title=NYPD Detains Activists for Anti-Koch Light Graffiti at the Met|url=http://news.artnet.com/art-world/nypd-detains-activists-for-anti-koch-light-graffiti-at-the-met-100321/|website=ArtNet|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Starving of Saqqara''' is the name given to a statue of suspected [[Prehistoric Egypt|Pre-dynastic Egyptian]] origins. The statue, of two nude beings (possible a male and female) with large skulls and thin bodies, seated, also has writing on the back of one of the figures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Starving of Saqqara sculpture|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/concordiauniversity/5934422523/|publisher=flickr|accessdate=4 October 2012|author=Concordia University|date=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has yet to be identified. Traces of dark pigment suggest that it was once painted.

Vincent and Olga Diniacopoulos, who amassed a large collection of antiquities, brought the work to Canada in the 1950s. The sculpture was exhibited in the 1950s at their family-owned Galerie Ars Classica on [[Sherbrooke Street]] in [[Montreal]]. The name [[Saqqara]] refers to the burial ground of [[Memphis, Egypt]]. How the name came to be attached to the artifact is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmll.concordia.ca/diniacopoulos/csi/|title=CSI Montreal: Concordia Sculpture Investigation|last=Concordia University|work=Diniacopoulos Antiquities Collection|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue has been at Concordia University since 1999. Experts from the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Brooklyn Museum]], the [[Israel Museum]] and the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] have all been consulted, without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/offbeat/story/2011/03/17/starving-of-saqqara-statue-concordia-mystery.html|title=Sculpture mystery baffles Concordia researchers|date=Mar 17, 2011|work=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The script has been determined to not be [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], or [[Syriac language|Syriac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/Experts+crack+Concordia+sculpture+riddle/4453206/story.html|title=Experts can't crack Concordia sculpture riddle|last=Curran|first=Peggy|date=March 17, 2011|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One expert, Clarence Epstein, suggests that it represents a pair of conquered captives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sott.net/articles/show/225917-Canadian-university-puts-ancient-mysterious-sculpture-on-display|title=Canadian university puts ancient, mysterious sculpture on display|last=Boswell|first=Randy|date=16 Mar 2011|work=The Vancouver Sun|publisher=Sott.net|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture was displayed to the public from March 16 to 18, 2011. It was viewable at the atrium of Concordia’s Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasthorizons.com/index.php/archives/03/2011/the-mystery-of-the-starving-of-saqqara|title=The mystery of 'The Starving of Saqqara'|date=March 16, 2011|work=Past Horizons|accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
