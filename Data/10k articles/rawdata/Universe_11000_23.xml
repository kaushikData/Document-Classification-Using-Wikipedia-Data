The '''1898 Fort Smith, Arkansas tornado''' was a [[tornado]] which struck the city of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]] during the night of Tuesday, January 11, 1898. It touched down about 100 miles to the southwest, and struck the city around midnight, killing 55 people and injuring 113. The twister nearly destroyed the city's newly constructed [[Fort Smith High School]] that opened in fall 1897.

It is tied for the deadliest tornado ever to strike the state of Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/alltorns/worstts.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514002740/http://www.tornadoproject.com/alltorns/worstts.htm |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both tornadoes (1898, 1949) were estimated to be rated F4 on the [[Fujita scale]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ericsweatherlibrary.com/f4f5/f4-f5-tornadoes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grazulis |first=Thomas P. |authorlink=Thomas P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12569">In [[automobile]]s, a '''42-volt electrical system''' was an electrical power standard proposed in the late 1990s. It was intended to allow more powerful electrically-driven accessories, and lighter automobile [[wiring harness]]es. [[Electric motor]]s were proposed to be used for [[power steering]] or other systems, providing more compact installations and eliminating the weight of [[Belt (mechanical)|drive belt]]s or large wires for [[Electric current|high-current]] loads. 

The proposed new standard was more than triple the voltage of existing "12&amp;nbsp;volt" systems.   The higher voltage was selected to provide greater power capacity for wiring and devices on one hand, and to stay under the 50 volt limit used as a guideline for [[electric shock]] hazard. The European auto manufacturer [[Daimler-Benz]] proposed a ''42V'' brand name for the conversion.

Although many manufacturers were predicting a switch to 36-volt (lithium ion battery) / 42-volt (charging voltage) electrical systems, the changeover has not occurred, and the plans appear to have been canceled.&lt;ref name="wha"/&gt; The availability of higher-efficiency motors, new wiring techniques and digital controls, and a focus on [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid vehicle systems]] that use high-voltage starter/generators has largely eliminated the push for switching the main automotive voltages.&lt;ref name="wha"/&gt; Applications that once were thought to require higher voltages, such as electrical power steering, have now been achieved with 12&amp;nbsp;volt systems.&lt;ref name="wha"/&gt;  42-volt electrical components are now used in only a few automotive applications, since [[incandescent light bulb]]s work well at 12&amp;nbsp;volts and switching of a 42-volt circuit is more difficult.&lt;ref name="wha"&gt;{{cite web

== History ==

=== USA – Consortium on Advanced Automotive Electrical and Electronic Systems ===
The [[SAE International|SAE]] discussed an increased automobile standard voltage as early as 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  |url = http://lees-web.mit.edu/public/In_the_News/Electrical+Rebuilder%27s+Exchange.pdf

In 1994, at the initiative of [[Daimler-Benz]], the first "Workshop on Advanced Architectures for Automotive Electrical Distribution Systems" was held at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems (MIT/LEES) in [[Cambridge (Massachusetts)|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] USA. with the aim of defining the architecture for a future automotive electrical system. From the outset, the participants in this workshop included suppliers as well as the automobile companies [[Daimler-Benz]], [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]].

In September 1995, various electrical systems architectures were compared at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] using the tool "MAESTrO", and in December 1995, in the "Conclusions" of this study, a future voltage level of approximately {{nowrap|40 V}} was defined.

In early 1996, the "Consortium on Advanced Automotive Electrical and Electronic Systems" was set up. At the ensuing workshop in March 1996, the future nominal voltage of 42 V was confirmed.

In August 1996, IEEE Spectrum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/advanced-cars/automotive-electrical-systems-circa-2005 |title=Automotive Electrical Systems Circa 2005 |accessdate=2011-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506160211/http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/advanced-cars/automotive-electrical-systems-circa-2005 |archivedate=May 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published the paper "Automotive electrical systems circa 2005".

On the occasion of the October 1996 Convergence in Detroit, Professor John G. Kassakian (MIT) gave a talk entitled "The Future of Automotive Electrical Systems" as part of the "IEEE Workshop on Automotive Power- Electronics".

On March 24, 1997, [[Daimler-Benz]] presented the MIT with a "Draft Specification of a Dual Voltage Vehicle Electrical Power System 42V/14V".

=== Europe ===
At the same time as the activities in the USA, in 1994, again at the initiative of [[Daimler-Benz]], the former SICAN GmbH held its first "Forum Bordnetz" (Vehicle Electrical System Forum) in [[Hanover]] for German automobile companies. Here too, suppliers were invited to participate at a very early stage, together with all European vehicle manufacturers.

On February 15, 1996, the introductory paper "Bordnetzarchitektur im Jahr 2005" (Automotive electrical system architecture for the year 2005) was agreed, and on June 4, 1996, [[BMW]] presented the "Tabelle heutiger und zukünftiger Verbraucher im Kfz" (Table of present and future loads in the motor vehicle) and the "42V/14V-Bordnetz" (42V/14V PowerNet).

On September 13, 1996, at the 7th International Technical Meeting for Vehicle Electronics in [[Baden-Baden]], considerable interest was raised by the paper "Neue Bordnetz- Architektur und Konsequenzen" (New Automotive Electrical System Architecture and Consequences), presented by Dr. Richard D. Tabors (MIT).

On March 6, 1997, [[BMW]] presented the "Spezifikationsentwurf für das Zwei-Spannungsbordnetz 42V/14V" (Draft Specification of a Dual Voltage Vehicle Electrical Power System 42V/14V) in Hanover.

The work at SICAN GmbH was given decisive impetus by the cooperation between [[BMW]] and [[Daimler-Benz]], as witnessed in their joint definition of the European "Load List 2005" and the jointly authored "Draft Specification of a Dual Voltage Vehicle Electrical Power System 42V/14V".

In 2011, several German car makers agreed on a 48V on-board electric power supply network supplementing the current 12V network and introduced the "Combo plug", a common power plug for DC charging electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Christoph|last=Hammerschmidt|url=http://www.eenewsautomotive.com/news/german-carmakers-agree-48v-board-supply-charging-plug|title=German carmakers agree on 48V on-board supply, charging plug|work=eeNews Automotive|date=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, this [[48-volt electrical system]] has been applied in production vehicles such as [[Porsche]] and [[Bentley]] SUVs, and [[Volvo]] and [[Audi]] plan to use the 48-volt standard in 2019 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/business/electric-cars-48-volts.html|title=To Power the Future, Carmakers Flip on 48-Volt Systems|first=Norman|last=Mayersohn|date=February 8, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of voltage ==
Six-cell [[lead-acid batteries]] produce around 12.6&amp;nbsp;volts while discharging, and their corresponding automotive [[alternator]]s are designed to produce 13.5 to {{nowrap|14.5 volts}} during charging.&lt;ref name="wha"/&gt; {{nowrap|42 volts}} is an approximation of the output of the new standard's charging system.&lt;ref name="sae"/&gt; The present nominally {{nowrap|12 V}} automotive electrical system usually operates around {{nowrap|13.8 volts,}} so {{nowrap|14 V}} is descriptive. Literature on {{nowrap|42 volt}} electrical systems often refers to systems powered with a 6-cell lead-acid battery as nominally {{nowrap|14 volts.}}  Depending on operating conditions, the vehicle electrical system voltage today can vary between {{nowrap|6.5 and 16 V,}} with a varying degree of ripple superimposed on this value. 

After extensive preparatory work, resulting in the "List of Loads in the Automobile of the Year 2005", various automotive electrical system architectures were compared using the tool "MAESTrO" ({{nowrap|12 V,}} {{nowrap|12 V/24 V DC,}} {{nowrap|12 V/48 V DC}} and {{nowrap|12 V/60 V AC}}) in the September 1995 workshop at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT/LEES). The finding of this study was that the highest possible direct voltage was the best alternative.

The limiting factor for direct voltages is a shock-hazard protection limit of {{nowrap|60 V,}} which must not be exceeded even during voltage fluctuations caused by extreme conditions. This limit eliminates the option of an automotive electrical system with a nominal battery voltage of {{nowrap|48 V,}} because at low temperatures the charging voltage of the battery can attain {{nowrap|60 V.}} Also, the price, weight and volume of batteries are influenced by the number of cells, which must therefore be kept to a minimum. 

New battery technologies for automotive applications would not have been available at affordable costs for the {{nowrap|42 V/14 V}} PowerNet. [[Lead–acid battery|Lead-acid batteries]] are low-priced and have a very "compliant" charging/discharging characteristic. Therefore, lead-acid batteries would have been used optimised for energy and service life at the lower voltage and optimised for power at the higher voltage.

Another important criterion for a new architecture was that it should allow gradual conversion of loads to the higher voltage system as required. 

In a {{nowrap|42 V/14 V}} system, the {{nowrap|14 V}} branch should have been freed of higher-power loads and should operate within much narrower limits.

Power electronics is becoming increasingly important in the automotive sphere and will be a decisive factor in the price of future vehicles. This criterion was therefore especially important when selecting the most suitable higher voltage level. Despite the considerable upward trend of power electronics in automotive applications, its share of the market will decline, because growth rates in other market segments are even higher. For that reason alone, a specific manufacturing technology for automotive use is inconceivable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In intensive discussions with the major semiconductor manufacturers, a voltage of approximately {{nowrap|40 V}} was found to be advantageous. Many arguments are summarised in the paper "Intelligente Leistungshalbleiter für zukünftige Kfz-Bordnetze"&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartdata.usbid.com/datasheets/usbid/2000/2000-q2/anps023d.pdf Intelligente Leistungshalbleiter für zukünftige Kfz-Bordnetze]&lt;/ref&gt; ("Intelligent Power Semiconductors for Future Automotive Electrical Systems"&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinabaike.com/FileUploadDir/autoelectronics/OtherFile/Intelligent_Power_Semiconductors.pdf Intelligent Power Semiconductors for Future Automotive Electrical Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;) presented by the former Siemens Semiconductors (now [[Infineon]]) at the 17th "Elektronik im Kraftfahrzeug" (In-Car Electronics) conference on June 3/4, 1997 in Munich.

Other arguments for a higher voltage included the reduction of weight in the wiring system, improved stability, and reduced [[voltage drop]]. With three times the voltage, thick conductors can be reduced to a third of the cross-section, and at the same time the relative voltage drop can also be reduced to a third. For the same cross-section, the relative voltage drop is now no more than one ninth. The voltage level resulting from these arguments was so close to three times the present voltage that {{nowrap|42 V}} became the automatic choice for the second voltage level.

'''Alia Royal Jordanian Flight 600''' was a scheduled passenger flight from [[Queen Alia International Airport]], Jordan to [[Seeb International Airport]], Muscat, Oman, via [[Doha International Airport]] in Qatar. On 13 March 1979 it was being operated by a [[Boeing 727-2D3]] jet airliner [[Aircraft registration|registered]] in Jordan as ''JY-ADU'' when, while carrying out a missed approach to Runway 34 at Doha at night, it flew into a thunderstorm, causing the aircraft to drop {{convert|750|ft}} into the ground.&lt;ref name="caa" /&gt; Sixty-four people were on board; of the 15 crew four died and two were seriously injured and 41 passengers were killed and six seriously injured; the aircraft was destroyed.&lt;ref name="caa" /&gt;

==Investigation==
The accident was due to the encounter with a downburst related to the thunderstorm and the effects of which exceeded the performance capability of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="caa" /&gt;

==Aircraft==
The aircraft was a three-engined [[Boeing 727-2D3]] jet airliner registered ''JY-ADU'' with Boeing line number 1061, it first flew on 26 July 1974 in the United States and was delivered to Alia Royal Jordanian on 14 August 1974.&lt;ref name="jet" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4221">[[File:Chilean arriero.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A muleteer loading a [[pack horse]] in [[Zona Sur|southern Chile]]]]

A '''muleteer''', or more informally a '''muleskinner'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mule+skinner |title=Mule skinner &amp;#124; Define Mule skinner at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-es|arriero}}; {{lang-ca|traginer}}) is a person who transports goods using [[pack animal]]s, especially [[mule]]s. In South America, muleskinners transport [[coffee]], [[maize|maize (corn)]], [[cork (material)|cork]], [[wheat]] and myriad other items.  They remain common in the [[Paisa Region]] ([[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and the [[Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis]]) of [[Colombia]].  In [[California]], muleteers work out of [[pack station]]s.  In Europe, there are still muleteers in the south of [[Portugal]] and the southwest of [[Spain]], in the cork producing area.  Their role is now limited to transporting the cork with their mules, out of the Mediterranean oak forest to more accessible routes, where modern means of transport are available.

==Names and etymology==
The English word ''muleteer'' comes from the [[French language|French]] ''muletier'', from [[Old French]], from ''mulet'', diminutive of ''mul'', [[mule]].  The term ''muleskinner'' means someone who can "skin", or outsmart, a mule.

The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''arriero'' is derived from the verb ''arrear'', which means to urge [[cattle]] or other stock to walk.   The verb itself is derived from ''arre'', which is the call used to cry out to animals for this purpose.  In English, an ''arriero'' is one type of muleteer, a [[wrangler (profession)|wrangler]] of pack animals.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

The [[Catalan language|Catalan]] word ''traginer'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''tragīnare'', a variant of ''tragĕre'' which means "to transport".

[[File:Nebel Voyage 31 Arrieros.jpg|thumb|''Arrieros'' (1836) by [[Carl Nebel]];  three Mexican muleteers attempting to move a heavily loaded mule]]
==Outfits==
Typical muleteer outfits vary from country to country:

*''[[Carriel]]'': Leather bag traditionally made of [[Coypu|nutria]] leather. It is used to carry personal goods and money. It has become an element of the Colombian fashion.
*''[[Espadrilles]]''  (''alpargatas'') : Sandals made of [[fique]] (natural fiber obtained of [[furcraea]] plants and leather.
*[[Machete]]
*[[Poncho]]: Rectangular piece of fabric, usually white with linear embroidery, that is used to protect the face and neck from the cold weather.
*''[[Ruana]]'': Square wool garment, larger than the poncho, with a hole in the middle for the head. It covers the torso.
*Straw [[hat]] (''sombrero aguadeño'')
*''Tapapinche'': Leather [[apron]].

==In popular culture==
The fictional [[Juan Valdez]], brand representative of the ''[[Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia]]'', is an archetypal muleteer carrying coffee sacks with his mule.

In [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s second [[Border Trilogy]] novel, ''The Crossing'', Billy's wolf upsets the muleteers' burros, which wreaks substantial havoc before Billy moves on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCarthy,  Cormack|title=The Crossing|pages=24–25 (Book Index 5)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Mule Skinner Blues]]" is a country music song first recorded in 1930 by Jimmy Rodgers, which has inspired many subsequent variations.

The 1964 Broadway musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' features a band of muleteers as one of the primary [[Antagonist|antagonists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">'''Boeing Laser Avenger''' is an [[infrared]] [[laser]] system (with power levels somewhere in the tens of kilowatts range)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16489-truckmounted-laser-shoots-down-spy-drone.html Truck-mounted laser shoots down spy drone - tech - 27 January 2009 - New Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; mounted on an '''[[AN/TWQ-1 Avenger]] combat vehicle''' developed by Boeing Combat Systems in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[Alabama]].

Laser Avenger integrates a directed energy weapon together with the [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] weapons of the Avenger [[air defense system]].

==History==
'''Jan 2009''' - "If funded by the Pentagon, the Laser Avenger could be available within a year," said Boeing spokesman Marc Selinger. Boeing has so far funded the project itself.

'''Dec 2008''' - Testing at [[White Sands Missile Range]], N.M., Laser Avenger succeeded in its principal test objectives by targeting and tracking 3 small [[UAV]]s (flying against the complex backdrop of mountains and desert). It also shot down one of the UAVs from an operationally relevant range. This marks the first time a combat vehicle has used a laser to shoot down a UAV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2009/q1/090126a_nr.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118031351/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2009/q1/090126a_nr.html |archivedate=2010-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the overall counter-UAV demonstration, Boeing also successfully test-fired a lightweight 25mm machine gun from the Laser Avenger platform to potentially further the hybrid directed energy/kinetic energy capability against UAV threats.

Representatives of the [[U.S. Army]]'s Cruise [[Missile Defense]] Systems project office observed the tests.

Gary Fitzmire, vice president and program director of Boeing Directed Energy Systems has stated "Small UAVs armed with explosives or equipped with surveillance sensors are a growing threat on the battlefield. Laser Avenger, unlike a conventional weapon, can fire its laser beam without creating missile exhaust or gun flashes that would reveal its position. As a result, Laser Avenger can neutralize these UAV threats while keeping our troops safe."

'''September 2007''' - Boeing successfully tested a 1&amp;nbsp;kW solid state laser weapon mounted on a converted Avenger anti aircraft vehicle in [[Redstone Arsenal]], Alabama. The laser successfully destroyed several unexploded mortar shells from a safe distance and was also able to destroy two unmanned aerial vehicles (which were on the ground).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefutureofthings.com/news/1051/boeing-tests-avenger-solid-state-laser-weapon.html Boeing Tests Avenger Solid State Laser Weapon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201034925/http://thefutureofthings.com/news/1051/boeing-tests-avenger-solid-state-laser-weapon.html |date=February 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; thermodynamic, electronic, and mechanical properties. In particular, the binding energies of these interactions vary widely. Bonding in solids can be of mixed or intermediate kinds, however, hence not all solids have the typical properties of a particular class, and some can be described as [[#Solids of intermediate kinds|intermediate forms]].

==Basic classes of solids==

===Network covalent solids===
{{See also|Network solid}}

A network covalent solid consists of atoms held together by a network of [[covalent bonds]] (pairs of electrons shared between atoms of similar [[electronegativity]]), and hence can be regarded as a single, large molecule. The classic example is [[diamond]]; other examples include [[silicon]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0V03kNbKHs Properties of Period 3 Elements]. youtube&lt;/ref&gt; [[quartz]] and [[graphite]].

==== Properties ====

* High [[strength of materials|strength]]
* High [[elastic modulus]]
* High  [[melting point]]
* [[Brittle]]

Their strength, stiffness, and high melting points are consequences of the strength and stiffness of the [[covalent bonds]] that hold them together. They are also characteristically brittle because the directional nature of covalent bonds strongly resists the shearing motions associated with plastic flow, and are, in effect, broken when shear occurs. This property results in brittleness for reasons studied in the field of [[fracture mechanics]]. Network covalent solids vary from insulating to semiconducting in their behavior, depending on the [[band gap]] of the material.

===Ionic solids===

A standard [[Ionic compound|ionic solid]] consists of atoms held together by [[ionic bond]]s, that is by the electrostatic attraction of opposite charges (the result of transferring electrons from atoms with lower electronegativity to atoms with higher electronegativity). Among the ionic solids are compounds formed by alkali and alkaline earth metals in combination with halogens; a classic example is table salt, [[sodium chloride]].

Ionic solids are typically of intermediate strength and extremely brittle. Melting points are typically moderately high, but some combinations of molecular cations and anions yield an [[ionic liquid]] with a freezing point below room temperature.  Vapour pressures in all instances are extraordinarily low; this is a consequence of the large energy required to move a bare charge (or charge pair) from an ionic medium into free space.

===Metallic solids===

[[Metals|Metallic solids]] are held together by a high density of shared, delocalized electrons, resulting in [[metallic bond]]ing. Classic examples are metals such as [[copper]] and [[aluminum]], but some materials are metals in an electronic sense but have negligible metallic bonding in a mechanical or thermodynamic sense (see [[#Solids of intermediate kinds|intermediate forms]]). Metallic solids have, by definition, no band gap at the [[Fermi level]] and hence are conducting.

Solids with purely metallic bonding are characteristically ductile and, in their pure forms, have low strength; melting points can be very low (''e.g.,'' [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] melts at 234&amp;nbsp;K (−39&amp;nbsp;°C). These properties are consequences of the non-directional and non-polar nature of metallic bonding, which allows atoms (and planes of atoms in a crystal lattice) to move past one another without disrupting their bonding interactions. Metals can be strengthened by introducing crystal defects (for example, by [[alloy]]ing) that interfere with the motion of [[dislocations]] that mediate plastic deformation. Further, some transition metals exhibit directional bonding in addition to metallic bonding; this increases shear strength and reduces ductility, imparting some of the characteristics of a covalent solid (an [[#Metallic to network covalent|intermediate case]] below).

===Molecular solids===

A classic [[molecular solid]] consists of small, non-polar covalent molecules, and is held together by London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces); a classic example is [[paraffin wax]]. These forces are weak, resulting in pairwise interatomic binding energies on the order of 1/100 those of covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds. Binding energies tend to increase with increasing molecular size and polarity (see [[#Solids of intermediate kinds|intermediate forms]]).

Solids that are composed of small, weakly bound molecules are mechanically weak and have low melting points; an extreme case is solid molecular hydrogen, which melts at 14&amp;nbsp;K (−259&amp;nbsp;°C). The non-directional nature of dispersion forces typically allows easy plastic deformation, as planes of molecules can slide over one another without seriously disrupting their attractive interactions. Molecular solids are typically insulators with large band gaps.

==Solids of intermediate kinds==

The four classes of solids permit six pairwise intermediate forms:

===Ionic to network covalent===

Covalent and ionic bonding form a continuum, with ionic character increasing with increasing difference in the electronegativity of the participating atoms. Covalent bonding corresponds to sharing of a pair of electrons between two atoms of essentially equal electronegativity (for example, C–C and C–H bonds in aliphatic hydrocarbons). As bonds become more polar, they become increasingly ionic in character. Metal oxides vary along the iono-covalent spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/0882751031000116142|title=Iono-Covalent Character of the Metal–Oxygen Bonds in Oxides: A Comparison of Experimental and Theoretical Data|year=2004|last1=Lenglet|first1=M.|journal=Active and Passive Electronic Components|volume=27|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Si–O bonds in quartz, for example, are polar yet largely covalent, and are considered to be of mixed character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0040-6031(01)00452-X|title=Molecular dynamics simulation of oxides with ionic–covalent bonds|year=2001|last1=Belashchenko|first1=D.K|last2=Ostrovski|first2=O.I|journal=Thermochimica Acta|volume=372|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metallic to network covalent===

What is in most respects a purely covalent structure can support metallic delocalization of electrons; metallic [[carbon nanotubes]] are one example. Transition metals and intermetallic compounds based on transition metals can exhibit mixed metallic and covalent bonding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2006.10.010|title=Environmental dependence of bonding: A challenge for modelling of intermetallics and fusion materials|year=2007|last1=Nguyenmanh|first1=D|last2=Vitek|first2=V|last3=Horsfield|first3=A|journal=Progress in Materials Science|volume=52|issue=2–3|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in high shear strength, low ductility, and elevated melting points; a classic example is [[tungsten]].

===Molecular to network covalent===

Materials can be intermediate between molecular and network covalent solids either because of the intermediate organization of their covalent bonds, or because the bonds themselves are of an intermediate kind.

'''Intermediate organization of covalent bonds:'''

Regarding the organization of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, [[paraffin wax]], is a member of a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with [[high-density polyethylene]] at the long-chain end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, [[Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene#Fiber applications|the resulting fibers]] rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from [[Cross-linked polyethylene]], to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous carbon, diamond-like carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.

'''Intermediate kinds of bonding:'''

A solid with extensive hydrogen bonding will be considered a molecular solid, yet [[Hydrogen bond#Bonding|strong hydrogen bonds]] can have a significant degree of covalent character. As noted above, covalent and ionic bonds form a continuum between shared and transferred electrons; covalent and weak bonds form a continuum between shared and unshared electrons. In addition, molecules can be polar, or have polar groups, and the resulting regions of positive and negative charge can interact to produce electrostatic bonding resembling that in ionic solids.

===Molecular to ionic===

A large molecule with an ionized group is technically an ion, but its behavior may be largely the result of non-ionic interactions. For example, [[sodium stearate]] (the main constituent of traditional soaps) consists entirely of ions, yet it is a soft material quite unlike a typical ionic solid. There is a continuum between ionic solids and molecular solids with little ionic character in their bonding.

===Metallic to molecular===

Metallic solids are bound by a high density of shared, delocalized electrons. Although weakly bound molecular components are incompatible with strong metallic bonding, low densities of shared, delocalized electrons can impart varying degrees of metallic bonding and conductivity overlaid on discrete, covalently bonded molecular units, especially in reduced-dimensional systems. Examples include [[charge transfer complex]]es.

===Metallic to ionic===

The charged components that make up ionic solids cannot exist in the high-density sea of delocalized electrons characteristic of strong metallic bonding. Some molecular salts, however, feature both ionic bonding among molecules and substantial [[Charge transfer complex#Electrical conductivity|one-dimensional conductivity]], indicating a degree of metallic bonding among structural components along the axis of conductivity. Examples include [[tetrathiafulvalene]] salts.

==History==
[[Alkali metal]] borohydrides were first described in 1940 by [[Hermann Irving Schlesinger]] and [[Herbert C. Brown]]. They synthesized lithium borohydride (LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) from [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlesinger|first1=H.

Current methods involve reduction of [[trimethyl borate]] with sodium hydride.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Structure==
In the borohydride anion and most of its modifications, boron has a [[tetrahedral]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reactivity of the B−H bonds depends on the other ligands.  Electron-releasing ethyl groups as in triethylborohydride render the B−H center highly nucleophilic.  In contrast, cyanoborohydride is a weaker reductant owing to the electron-withdrawing cyano substituent.  The countercation also influences the reducing power of the reagent.

==Uses==
Sodium borohydride is the borohydride that is produced on the largest scale industrially, estimated at 5000 tons/y in 2002. The main use is for the reduction of sulfur dioxide to give [[sodium dithionite]]:
:NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  8&amp;nbsp;NaOH  +  8&amp;nbsp;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   4&amp;nbsp;Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaBO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  6&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Dithionite is used to bleach wood pulp.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Sodium borohydride is also used to reduce aldehydes and ketones in the production of pharmaceuticals including [[chloramphenicol]], [[thiophenicol]], [[vitamin A]], [[atropine]], and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], as well as many flavorings and aromas.

===Potential applications===
Because of their high hydrogen content, borohydride complexes and salts have been of interest in the context of [[hydrogen storage]].&lt;ref name="HydrogenStore"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/dt/c3dt33048f|title=M[Y(BH4)4] and M2Li[Y(BH4)6−xClx] (M = Rb, Cs): new borohydride derivatives of yttrium and their hydrogen storage properties|first1=Tomasz|last1=Jaroń|first2=Wojciech|last2=Wegner|first3=Wojciech|last3=Grochala|date=17 August 2018|publisher=|journal=Dalton Transactions|volume=42|issue=19|pages=6886|accessdate=17 August 2018|doi=10.1039/C3DT33048F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reminiscent of related work on [[ammonia borane]], challenges are associated with slow kinetics and low yields of hydrogen as well as problems with regeneration of the parent borohydrides.

==Coordination complexes==

In its [[coordination complex]]es, the borohydride ion is bound to the metal by means of one to three bridging hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marks|first1=T. J.|last2=Kolb|first2=J. R.|title=Borohydride|journal=Chem. Rev.|date=1977|volume=77|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Makheav/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Besora|first1=M.|last2=Lledós|first2=A.|title=Coordination Modes and Hydride Exchange Dynamics in Transition Metal Tetrahydroborate Complexes|journal=Structure and Bonding|date=2008|volume=130|page=149–202|doi=10.1007/430_2007_076}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most such compounds, the {{chem|BH|4|-}} ligand is [[denticity|bidentate]]. Some [[homoleptic]] borohydride complexes are volatile. One example is [[uranium borohydride]].

Metal borohydride complexes can often be prepared by a simple salt elimination reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franz|first=H.|last2=Fusstetter|first2=H.|last3=Nöth|first3=H.|title=Borohydride|journal=Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem.|date=1976|volume=427|page=97–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4&amp;nbsp;LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + [[diethyl ether|Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] (solvent) → Ti(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) + 4&amp;nbsp;LiCl

===Decomposition===
Some metal tetrahydroborates transform on heating to give metal [[boride]]s. When the borohydride complex is volatile, this decomposition pathway is the basis of [[chemical vapor deposition]], a way of depositing thin films of metal borides.&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=J. A.|last2=Gozum|first2=J. E.|last3=Pollina|first3=D. M.|last4=Girolami|first4=G. S.|title=Titanium, Zirconium, and Hafnium tetrahydroborates as "tailored" CVD precursors for metal diboride thin films|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|date=1988|volume=110|page=1643–1644|doi=10.1021/ja00213a058}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[zirconium]] and [[hafnium]] diborides, ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, can be prepared through CVD of the tetrahydroborates Zr(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Hf(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt;

M(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → MB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 5&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

Metal diborides find uses as coatings because of their hardness, high melting point, strength, resistance to wear and corrosion, and good electrical conductivity.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt;

In [[chemistry]], the '''burn rate''' (or burning rate) is a measure of the linear [[combustion]] rate of a compound or substance such as a candle or a [[solid propellant]]. It is measured in length over time, such as "mm/second" or "inches/second". Among the variables affecting burn rate are pressure and temperature. Burn rate is an important parameter especially in the area of [[propellants]] because it determines the rate at which exhaust gases are generated from the burning propellant which in turn decides the rate of flow through the nozzle. The thrust generated in the rocket of missile depends on this rate of flow. Thus Knowing quantitatively the burning rate of a propellant, and how it changes under various conditions, is of fundamental importance in the successful design of a solid rocket motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocket Propulsion|url=http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm|website=www.braeuing.us|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Burning rate is also relevant in case of liquid propellants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Shiqing|last2=Thynell|first2=Stefan|title=Decomposition and Combustion of Ionic Liquid Compound Synthesized from N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethylethylenediamine and Nitric Acid|journal=Ionic Liquids: Science and Applications.|date=January 1, 2012|page=51-66|doi=10.1021/bk-2012-1117}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Measurement==
One device for measuring burning rate is a V shaped metal channel about 1–2 feet long wherein a sample is placed, with a cross-sectional dimension of approximately 6&amp;nbsp;mm or 1/4". The sample is ignited on one end and time is measured until the flame front gets to the other end. Burn rate (typically expressed in 'mm/s' or 'in/s') is the sample length over time at a given pressure and temperature. For solid fuel propellant, the most common method of measuring burn rate is the Crawford Type Strand Burning Rate Bomb System&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ditusa.com/strand_burner.php Crawford Burner System (Strand Burner) for Testing Burn Rate&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the [[Crawford Burner]] or Strand Burner), as described in MIL-STD-286C.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0100-0299/MIL-STD-286C_8618/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterization ==
A substance is characterized through burn rate vs pressure chart and burn rate vs temperature chart.
* Higher burn rate than the speed of sound in the material (usually several km/s): "detonation"
* A few meters per second: "deflagration"
* A few centimeters per second: "burn" or "smolder"
* 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm/s to 100&amp;nbsp;mm/s: "decomposing rapidly" to characterize it.

However, there is difference in opinion in differentiating the three in absence of firm numbers at given [[pressure]] or [[temperature]].

'''Cegedel S.A.''' (until 17 May 1997 the '''Compagnie Grand-Ducale d'Électricité du Luxembourg''' ({{lang-en|Grand Ducal Electricity Company of Luxembourg}})), was a [[Luxembourg]] company that [[Electricity distribution|distributed]] [[Electrical power industry|electricity]].  It operated under a [[Concession (contract)|concession]] written into the law under which it was formed, and distributed 70% of the electricity used in the country, amounting to 6,616 [[Watt-hour|GWh]].&lt;ref name="Présentation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cegedel.lu/cegedel/cegedel-sa/profil/presentation.html |title=Présentation |accessdate=2007-08-24 |publisher=Cegedel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807022331/http://www.cegedel.lu/cegedel/cegedel-sa/profil/presentation.html |archivedate=7 August 2007 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Luxembourg owned one-third of the company, which made it the largest single [[shareholder]],&lt;ref name="Présentation"/&gt; followed by the 30.4% stake held by [[Luxempart-Energie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxempart.lu/index.php?luxempart_participations_index |title=Principales participations |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2007-08-24 |publisher=[[Luxempart]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705190608/http://www.luxempart.lu/index.php?luxempart_participations_index |archivedate=5 July 2007 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with smaller stakes held by [[Société Nationale de Crédit et d'Investissement|SNCI]] (12%) and [[Electrabel]] (8%).&lt;ref name="Présentation"/&gt;  Shares of the company were listed on the [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]], of which it was one of the ten (and one of the seven Luxembourg-based) members of the main [[Stock market index|index]], the [[LuxX Index]]

The '''Cobblestone Path''' is a historic pathway along the east side of the [[Bardstown Historic District]] of [[Bardstown, Kentucky]], passing by eight acres of land.&lt;ref name="OHP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourhistoricplaces.com/Kentucky/Bardstown/CobblestonePath.html|title=Cobblestone Path|publisher=Our Historic Places|accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once longer, due to various construction it now remains between Flaget Avenue and Broadway, directly across from the Bardstown [[Civil War Museum (Bardstown)|Civil War Museum]].  Because it was always considered part of the city's street system, the Cobblestone Path is owned by the City of Bardstown, even though it now serves only pedestrian traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Hall p.7-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cobblestone Path was built in 1785.&lt;ref name="OHP" /&gt;  The path was built by the citizens of Bardstown.  Non-minister men between the ages of 16 and 50 were forced by law to help build it and the other roads, or be forced to pay a fine of $1.25 a day when they were assigned to work, but didn't.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbs p.11&lt;/ref&gt; It served as the main entryway to the town of Bardstown from 1785 to 1825, including the [[Wilderness Road]].  It was due to this importance that both the Kentucky legislature and the [[United States Congress]] paid for its improvements prior to 1800.&lt;ref name="Hall p.8-1"&gt;Hall p.8–1&lt;/ref&gt;  It was briefly part of the [[Louisville and Nashville Turnpike]] as well.  With the building of the turnpikes to [[Bloomfield, Kentucky]] and [[Springfield, Kentucky]], the pathway was reduced to walkers and equestrians.&lt;ref&gt;Hall p.8-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cobblestone Path lies on top of a bluff created by Stewart's Creek Towne Branch's deep canyon, the other side of which rests [[My Old Kentucky Home State Park]].  The remaining path is {{convert|350|ft|m}} long and varies in width from twenty-eight feet to twelve feet.  The [[dolomite]] [[limestone]] used to cobble the pathway are not uniformly shaped, and range from six to ten inches (254&amp;nbsp;mm)  thick.  Natural outcroppings of limestone and even a limestone boulder lie beside the path, some of which may serve as a [[Bench (furniture)|bench]].  The top portion of the path was long a popular picnic spot from the 1870s to 1900, and gained the name Lovers Leap.  Less than thirty feet below the Leap is a small dry [[cave]] almost impossible to gain access to.&lt;ref&gt;Hall p.7-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Erosion has always been a threat to the path, with few cobblestones remaining at the bottom of the path.  During the 1920s and 1930s, Mrs. Ernest Fulton planted many flowers along the path, and did her best to fight the erosion.  As a result, the path has bush [[honeysuckle]], [[evergreen]]s, [[jonquil (genus)|jonquil]]s, and a spruce tree.  With this and the natural undergrowth, [[vine]]s, and native hardwoods, the path is essentially a tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;Hall p.7-4&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 1989 the Cobblestone Path was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], due to its importance in the history of transportation to Kentucky.&lt;ref name="OHP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall p.8-1"/&gt;

A '''consumer unit''' is a type of [[distribution board]] (a component of an electrical power system within which an electrical power feed provides supply to [[Series and parallel circuits|subsidiary circuits]]).

== UK ==
The [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]] defines a Consumer Unit, also known as a consumer control unit or electricity control unit, as "a particular type of distribution board comprising a type-tested co-ordinated assembly for the control and distribution of electrical energy, principally in domestic premises, incorporating manual means of double-pole isolation on the incoming circuit(s) and an assembly of one or more fuses, circuit breakers, residual current operated devices or signalling and other devices proven during the type-test of the assembly as suitable for use."&lt;ref&gt;IET Wiring Regulations Seventeenth Edition - British Standard BS7671:2008, Part 2 Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

In the UK, there are four main types of Consumer Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerunitworld.co.uk/choosing-a-consumer-unit-343-c.asp|title=Choosing a Consumer Unit|last=|first=|date=September 2017|website=www.consumerunitworld.co.uk|archive-url=https://www.consumerunitworld.co.uk/choosing-a-consumer-unit-343-c.asp|archive-date=10 July 2018|dead-url=|access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 

* Main Switch Consumer Unit - Offers highest degree of circuit separation as all circuits must be protected from earth leakage independently. This can also be an expensive solution as it necessarily uses RCBOs instead of MCBs 
* Dual RCD Consumer Unit - Offers a cost effective solution to meet 17th Edition Regulations by protecting two banks of circuits from earth leakage through the use of two RCDs. 
* High Integrity Consumer Unit - Usually used in larger properties with greater numbers of circuits, this type of consumer unit offers good circuit separation through the use of two or more RCDs whilst allowing for the independent use of RCBOs. Usually this type of consumer unit also allows for fully flexible configuration, meaning there is no restriction on the number of RCBOs used.  
* RCD Incomer Consumer Unit. Less common than the other types, an RCD incomer does not use a main switch. They are usually used as a sub-board to a main distribution panel. 

Modern consumer units usually use [[DIN-rail]] mount breakers. The rail and the shape of the front opening are standardized but the [[busbar]] arrangements are not. Therefore mixing of brands should generally be avoided and, where unavoidable, care should be taken to ensure that the breaker chosen is a good fit for the busbars. 

Generally a "split load" arrangement is used with some circuits protected by the RCD and others not.

The box pictured top-right is a "Wylex standard" fitted with rewirable fuses. These boxes can also be fitted with cartridge fuses or miniature [[circuit breaker]]s (MCBs). This type of consumer unit was very popular in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] until 2001 when wiring regulations mandated [[residual current device]] (RCD) protection for sockets that could "reasonably be expected to" supply outdoor equipment (BS7671:2001, {{ISBN|0-86341-373-0}}). There were a number of similar designs from other manufacturers but the Wylex ones are by far the most commonly encountered and the only ones for which fuseholders/breakers are still commonly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google search on UK availability of Modern breakers for older consumer units|url=http://www.screwfix.com/p/wylex-32a-sp-type-b-curve-mcb/87979|publisher=Screwfix|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manufacturers have added innovative features such as [[CPN Cudis]] who have added a [[LED]] strip light to their 'Lumo' consumer unit to enhance visibility in dark locations such as under staircases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovative Bury company recognised with three award nominations|url=http://www.burytimes.co.uk/news/business/11608891.Innovative_Bury_company_recognised_with_three_award_nominations/|website=www.burytimes.co.uk|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RCD protection types ===

[[File:RCD Protection Consumer Dual Split-Load.jpg|thumb|RCD Protection Consumer Dual Split-Load]]

With the introduction of the recent (BS 7671:2008 incorporating amendment no 1: 2011) 17th Edition IET Wiring Regulations consumer units in the UK must provide RCD protection to all cables embedded in walls excepting high integrity circuits such as those for burglar alarms or smoke alarms.

Consumer units have different methods of protecting circuits. A dual split-load consumer unit can be arranged as follows:

RCD 1

*Upstairs Lights,
*Downstairs Ring Final,
*Garage Sockets,
*Cooker

RCD 2

*Downstairs Lights,
*Upstairs Sockets,
*Shower,
*Heating,

By alternating the circuits like this, power will always be present on one floor if either RCD trips out.

Another way to protect circuits under the 17th Edition IET Wiring Regulations is by fitting Residual Current Circuit Breaker With Overload (RCBOs) to every circuit although this can be a very costly method.

Some older systems such as those that use MK or old MEM Consumer Units that had one fuse per spur, so for instance:

*Upstairs Lights Fuse 1
*Upstairs Sockets Fuse 2
*Downstairs Lights Fuse 3
*Downstairs Sockets Fuse 4
etc..

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10010">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[differential topology]], the '''double tangent bundle''' or the '''second tangent bundle''' refers to the [[tangent bundle]] {{nowrap|(''TTM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TTM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM'')}} of the total space ''TM'' of the [[tangent bundle]] {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} of a [[differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]] ''M''
.&lt;ref&gt;J.M.Lee, ''Introduction to Smooth Manifolds'', Springer-Verlag, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; A note on notation: in this article, we denote projection maps by their domains, e.g., ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TTM''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''TTM'' → ''TM''. Some authors index these maps by their ranges instead, so for them, that map would be written ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The second tangent bundle arises in the study of [[Connection (vector bundle)|connections]] and second order ordinary differential equations, i.e., [[spray (mathematics)|(semi)spray structures]] on smooth manifolds, and it is not to be confused with the [[jet bundle|second order jet bundle]].

== Secondary vector bundle structure and canonical flip ==

Since {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} is a vector bundle on its own right, its tangent bundle has the [[secondary vector bundle structure]] {{nowrap|(''TTM'',(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM''),}} where {{nowrap|(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;:''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TM''}} is the push-forward of the canonical projection {{nowrap|''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&amp;rarr;''M''.}}
In the following we denote

:&lt;math&gt;
\xi = \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_x\in T_xM, \qquad X = X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_x\in T_xM
&lt;/math&gt;

and apply the associated coordinate system

:&lt;math&gt;
\xi \mapsto (x^1,\ldots,x^n,\xi^1,\ldots,\xi^n)
&lt;/math&gt;

on ''TM''. Then the fibre of the secondary vector bundle structure at ''X''&amp;isin;''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;
(\pi_{TM})^{-1}_*(X) = \Big\{ \ X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_\xi + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial\xi^k}\Big|_\xi
\ \Big| \ \xi\in T_xM \ , \ Y^1,\ldots,Y^n\in\R \ \Big\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The double tangent bundle is a [[double vector bundle]].

The '''canonical flip'''&lt;ref&gt;P.Michor. ''Topics in Differential Geometry,'' American Mathematical Society, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a smooth involution ''j'':''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' that exchanges these vector space structures
in the sense that it is a vector bundle isomorphism between {{nowrap|(''TTM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TTM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM'')}} and {{nowrap|(''TTM'',(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM'').}} In the associated coordinates on ''TM'' it reads as

:&lt;math&gt;
j\Big(X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_\xi + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}\Big|_\xi\Big)
= \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_X + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}\Big|_X.
&lt;/math&gt;

The canonical flip has the property that for any ''f'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; ''M'', 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial f} {{\partial t} {\partial s}} = j \circ \frac {\partial f} {{\partial s} {\partial t}}
&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''s'' and ''t'' are coordinates of the standard basis of '''R''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Note that both partial derivatives are functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to ''TTM''.

This property can, in fact, be used to give an intrinsic definition of the canonical flip.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fisher and H. Turner Laquer, Second Order Tangent Vectors in Riemannian Geometry, J. Korean Math. Soc. 36 (1999), No. 5, pp. 959-1008&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there is a submersion
''p'': J&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,M) &amp;rarr; ''TTM'' given by 
:&lt;math&gt;
p([f])=\frac {\partial f} {{\partial t} {\partial s}} (0,0)
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' can be defined in the space of two-jets at zero because only depends on ''f'' up to order two at zero. We consider the application:
:&lt;math&gt;
J: J^2_0(\mathbb{R}^2,M) \to J^2_0(\mathbb{R}^2,M) \quad / \quad J([f])=[f \circ \alpha]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;alpha;(''s'',''t'')= (''t'',''s''). Then ''J'' is compatible with the projection ''p'' and induces the canonical flip on the quotient ''TTM''.

== Canonical tensor fields on the tangent bundle==

As for any [[vector bundle]], the tangent spaces {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')}} of the fibres ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' of the tangent bundle {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} can be identified with the fibres ''T''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' themselves. Formally this is achieved though the '''vertical lift''', which is a natural vector space isomorphism
{{nowrap|vl&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt;:''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''&amp;rarr;''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')}} defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
(\operatorname{vl}_\xi X)[f]:=\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}f(x,\xi+tX), \qquad f\in C^\infty(TM).
&lt;/math&gt;

The vertical lift can also be seen as a natural vector bundle isomorphism
{{nowrap|vl:(&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''TM''&amp;rarr;''VTM''}}
from the pullback bundle of {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} over {{nowrap|''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&amp;rarr;''M''}} onto the vertical tangent bundle

:&lt;math&gt;
VTM:=\operatorname{Ker}(\pi_{TM})_* \subset TTM.
&lt;/math&gt;

The vertical lift lets us define the '''canonical vector field'''

:&lt;math&gt;
V:TM\to TTM; \qquad V_\xi := \operatorname{vl}_\xi\xi,
&lt;/math&gt;

which is smooth in the slit tangent bundle ''TM''\0. The canonical vector field can be also defined as the infinitesimal generator of the Lie-group action

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb R\times (TM\setminus 0) \to TM\setminus 0; \qquad (t,\xi) \mapsto e^t\xi.
&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the canonical vector field, which can be defined for any vector bundle, the '''canonical endomorphism'''

:&lt;math&gt;
J:TTM\to TTM; \qquad J_\xi X := \operatorname{vl}_\xi(\pi_{TM})_*X, \qquad X\in T_\xi TM
&lt;/math&gt;

is special to the tangent bundle. The canonical endomorphism ''J'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Ran}(J)=\operatorname{Ker}(J)=VTM, \qquad \mathcal L_VJ= -J, \qquad J[X,Y]=J[JX,Y]+J[X,JY],
&lt;/math&gt;

and it is also known as the '''tangent structure''' for the following reason. If (''E'',''p'',''M'') is any vector bundle
with the canonical vector field ''V'' and a (1,1)-tensor field ''J'' that satisfies the properties listed above, with ''VE'' in place of ''VTM'', then the vector bundle (''E'',''p'',''M'') is isomorphic to the tangent bundle {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} of the base manifold, and ''J'' corresponds to the tangent structure of ''TM'' in this isomorphism.

There is also a stronger result of this kind &lt;ref&gt;D.S.Goel, ''Almost Tangent Structures'', Kodai Math.Sem.Rep. '''26''' (1975), 187-193.&lt;/ref&gt; which states that if ''N'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold and if there exists a (1,1)-tensor field ''J'' on ''N'' that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Ran}(J)=\operatorname{Ker}(J), \qquad J[X,Y]=J[JX,Y]+J[X,JY],
&lt;/math&gt;

then ''N'' is diffeomorphic to an open set of the total space of a tangent bundle of some ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'', and ''J'' corresponds to the tangent structure of ''TM'' in this diffeomorphism.

In any associated coordinate system on ''TM'' the canonical vector field and the canonical endomorphism have the coordinate representations

:&lt;math&gt;
V = \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}, \qquad J = dx^k\otimes\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== (Semi)spray structures ==

A [[Spray (mathematics)|Semispray structure]] on a smooth manifold ''M'' is by definition a smooth vector field ''H'' on ''TM''&amp;nbsp;\0 such that ''JH''=''V''. An equivalent definition is that ''j''(''H'')=''H'', where ''j'':''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' is the canonical flip. A semispray ''H'' is a [[Spray (mathematics)|spray]], if in addition, [''V'',''H'']=''H''.

Spray and semispray structures are invariant versions of second order ordinary differential equations on ''M''. The difference between spray and semispray structures is that the solution curves of sprays are invariant in positive [[Parametrization|reparametrizations]]{{jargon-inline|reason=What makes a reparametrization positive?|date=September 2015}} as point sets on ''M'', whereas solution curves of semisprays typically are not.

== Nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds ==

The canonical flip makes it possible to define nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds as follows. Let
:&lt;math&gt;
T(TM\setminus 0) = H(TM\setminus 0) \oplus V(TM\setminus 0)
&lt;/math&gt;
be an [[Ehresmann connection]] on the slit tangent bundle ''TM''/0 and consider the mapping
:&lt;math&gt;
D:(TM\setminus 0)\times \Gamma(TM) \to TM; \quad D_XY :=  (\kappa\circ j)(Y_*X),
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' is the push-forward, ''j'':''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' is the canonical flip and &amp;kappa;:''T''(''TM''/0)&amp;rarr;''TM''/0 is the connector map. The mapping ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is a derivation in the module &amp;Gamma;&amp;nbsp;(''TM'') of smooth vector fields on ''M'' in the sense that

* &lt;math&gt;D_X(\alpha Y + \beta Z) = \alpha D_XY + \beta D_XZ, \qquad \alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;D_X(fY) = X[f]Y + f D_XY, \qquad \qquad \qquad f\in C^\infty(M)&lt;/math&gt;.

Any mapping ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; with these properties is called a '''(nonlinear) covariant derivative'''
&lt;ref&gt;I.Bucataru, R.Miron, ''Finsler-Lagrange Geometry'', Editura Academiei Române, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; on ''M''.
The term ''nonlinear'' refers to the fact that this kind of covariant derivative ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; on is not necessarily linear with respect to the direction ''X''&amp;isin;''TM''/0 of the differentiation.

Looking at the local representations one can confirm that the Ehresmann connections on (''TM''/0,&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;''TM''/0&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'') and nonlinear covariant derivatives on ''M'' are in one-to-one correspondence. Furthermore, if ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is linear in ''X'', then the Ehresmann connection is linear in the [[secondary vector bundle structure]], and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; coincides with its linear covariant derivative.

'''ENGIE Brasil''' formerly '''Tractebel Energia''' is a major [[Brazil]]ian utility company, headquartered in [[Florianópolis]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. It is one of the largest private [[electricity]] producers in Brazil. Its 11 plants, six of them [[hydroelectric]] and the remainder thermal, have an installed capacity of 6,977 MW in operations ave an installed capacity of around 9,000 MW. ENGIE Brasil's major shareholder is [[ENGIE]], the Paris-based utility company.

The company originated as Gerasul, short for Centrais Geradoras do Sul do Brasil SA ('Power plants of the South of Brazil' in English) which was sold to Tractebel by Brazil's Eletrosul in 1998. Gerasul held Eletrosul's power generation assets in the southern Brazilian states of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and [[Mato Grosso do Sul]]. Gerasul changed its name to Tractebel Energia in 2002.

ENGIE owns around 68% of ENGIE Brasil stocks, which is traded on [[BM&amp;F Bovespa|B3]], the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3216">'''Electroceramics''' is a class of [[ceramic]] materials used primarily for their electrical properties.

While ceramics have traditionally been admired and used for their mechanical, thermal and chemical stability, their unique [[electrical]], [[optical]] and [[magnetic]] properties have become of increasing importance in many key technologies including communications, energy conversion and storage, electronics and automation. Such materials are now classified under ''electroceramics'', as distinguished from other functional ceramics such as advanced structural ceramics.

Historically, developments in the various subclasses of electroceramics have paralleled the growth of new technologies. Examples include: [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectrics]] - high dielectric [[capacitor]]s, non-volatile memories; [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]]s - data and information storage; solid electrolytes - energy storage and conversion; [[piezoelectric]]s - sonar; semiconducting oxides - environmental monitoring.  Recent advances in these areas are described in the [https://www.springer.com/10832 Journal of Electroceramics].

==Dielectric ceramics==
[[Dielectric]] materials used for construction of ceramic [[practical capacitors|capacitors]] include: [[zirconium barium titanate]], [[strontium titanate]] (ST), [[calcium titanate]] (CT), [[magnesium titanate]] (MT), [[calcium magnesium titanate]] (CMT), [[zinc titanate]] (ZT), [[lanthanum titanate]] (TLT), and [[neodymium titanate]] (TNT), [[barium zirconate]] (BZ), [[calcium zirconate]] (CZ), [[lead magnesium niobate]] (PMN), [[lead zinc niobate]] (PZN), [[lithium niobate]] (LN), [[barium stannate]] (BS), [[calcium stannate]] (CS), [[magnesium aluminium silicate]], [[magnesium silicate]], [[barium tantalate]], [[titanium dioxide]], [[niobium oxide]], [[zirconia]], [[silica]], [[sapphire]], [[beryllium oxide]], and [[zirconium tin titanate]]

Some piezoelectric materials can be used as well; the [[EIA Class 2 dielectric]]s are based on mixtures rich on [[barium titanate]]. In turn, [[EIA Class 1 dielectric]]s contain little or no barium titanate.

==Electronically conductive ceramics==
[[Indium tin oxide]] (ITO), lanthanum-doped strontium titanate (SLT), yttrium-doped strontium titanate (SYT)

==Fast ion conductor ceramics==
[[Yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ), gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC), lanthanum strontium gallate magnesite(LSGM), beta alumina, beta" alumina

==Piezoelectric and ferroelectric ceramics==
Commercially used piezoceramic is primarily [[lead zirconate titanate]] (PZT). [[Barium titanate]] (BT), [[strontium titanate]] (ST), [[quartz]], 
and others are also used.

See [[:Category:Piezoelectric materials]].

==Magnetic ceramics==
[[Ferrite (magnet)|Ferrites]] including [[iron(III) oxide]] and [[strontium carbonate]] display magnetic properties. [[Lanthanum strontium manganite]] exhibits [[colossal magnetoresistance]].

[[Image:Ferrimagnetic ordering.svg|thumb|Ferrimagnetic ordering]]
In [[physics]], a '''ferrimagnetic''' material is one that has populations of atoms with opposing [[magnetic moment]]s, as in [[antiferromagnetism]]; however, in ferrimagnetic materials, the opposing moments are unequal and a [[spontaneous magnetization]] remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spaldin|first=Nicola A.|authorlink=Nicola Spaldin|chapter=9. Ferrimagnetism|title=Magnetic materials : fundamentals and applications|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521886697|pages=113&amp;ndash;129|edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This happens when the populations consist of different materials or [[ion]]s (such as Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;).

Ferrimagnetism is exhibited by [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] and magnetic [[garnet]]s. The oldest known magnetic substance, [[magnetite]] (iron(II,III) oxide; [[Iron|Fe]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), is a ferrimagnet; it was originally classified as a ferromagnet before [[Louis Néel|Néel]]'s discovery of ferrimagnetism and antiferromagnetism in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;L. Néel, ''Propriétées magnétiques des ferrites; Férrimagnétisme et antiferromagnétisme'', Annales de Physique (Paris) 3, 137–198 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

Known ferrimagnetic materials include YIG ([[yttrium iron garnet]]), cubic ferrites composed of [[iron oxide]]s and other elements such as [[aluminum]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[manganese]] and [[zinc]], hexagonal ferrites such as PbFe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; and BaFe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[pyrrhotite]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, C. and Dutrow, B., Mineral Science, 23rd ed., Wiley, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of temperature==
[[Image:Ferrimagnetism - magnetic moment as a function of temperature.svg|thumb|right|185px|➀ Below the magnetization compensation point, ferrimagnetic material is magnetic. ➁ At the compensation point, the magnetic components cancel each other and the total magnetic moment is zero. ➂ Above the [[Curie temperature|Curie point]], the material loses magnetism.]]

Ferrimagnetic materials are like [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]] in that they hold a spontaneous magnetization below the [[Curie temperature]] and show no magnetic order (are [[paramagnetic]]) above this temperature.  However, there is sometimes a temperature ''below'' the Curie temperature, at which the two opposing moments are equal, resulting in a net [[magnetic moment]] of zero; this is called the ''magnetization compensation point''.  This compensation point is observed easily in [[garnet]]s and [[rare-earth]]–[[transition-metal]] alloys (RE-TM). Furthermore, ferrimagnets may also have an ''angular-momentum compensation point'', at which the net [[angular momentum]] vanishes. This compensation point is a crucial point for achieving high speed [[magnetization reversal]] in magnetic memory devices.&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Stanciu, A. V. Kimel, F. Hansteen, A. Tsukamoto, A. Itoh, A. Kirilyuk, and Th. Rasing, ''Ultrafast spin dynamics across compensation points in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo: The role of angular momentum compensation'', Phys. Rev. B 73, 220402(R) (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
Ferrimagnetic materials have high [[resistivity]] and have [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] properties. The [[Magnetic anisotropy|anisotropy]] is actually induced by an external applied field. When this applied field aligns with the magnetic dipoles, it causes a net magnetic dipole moment and causes the magnetic dipoles to [[Precession|precess]] at a frequency controlled by the applied field, called ''[[Larmor precession|Larmor]]'' or ''[[Larmor precession|precession frequency]]''. As a particular example, a [[microwave]] signal [[circular polarization|circularly polarized]] in the same direction as this precession strongly interacts with the [[magnetic moment|magnetic dipole moments]]; when it is polarized in the opposite direction, the interaction is very low. When the interaction is strong, the microwave signal can pass through the material. This directional property is used in the construction of microwave devices like [[isolator (microwave)|isolators]], [[circulator]]s and [[gyrator]]s. Ferrimagnetic materials are also used to produce [[optical isolator]]s and [[optical circulator|circulators]]. Ferrimagnetic minerals in various rock types are used to study ancient geomagnetic properties of Earth and other planets. That field of study is known as [[paleomagnetism]].

== Molecular ferrimagnets ==

Ferrimagnetism can also occur in [[molecular magnets]].  A classic example is a dodecanuclear [[manganese]] [[molecule]] with an effective spin ''S'' = 10 derived from antiferromagnetic interaction on Mn(IV) metal centres with Mn(III) and Mn(II) metal centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sessoli|first=Roberta|author2=Tsai, Hui Lien  |author3=Schake, Ann R.  |author4=Wang, Sheyi |author5=Vincent, John B. |author6=Folting, Kirsten |author7=Gatteschi, Dante |author8=Christou, George |author9= Hendrickson, David N.  |year=1993|title= High-spin molecules: [Mn&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CR)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]|journal=J.

[[File:Stc-stilo5porte-ant02.jpg|250px|thumb|Fiat Stilo (five door)]]
The '''Fiat Stilo''' (Type 192) is a [[small family car]] available as a three door and a five door [[hatchback]], as well as an [[stationwagon|estate]] ('''Fiat Stilo MultiWagon'''), produced by the [[Italy|Italian]] automaker [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]]. The Stilo three door and five door were launched in November 2001, at the [[Bologna Motor Show]], to replace the [[Fiat Bravo/Brava]], with the Stilo MultiWagon following in January 2003. 

The [[Fiat Bravo (2007)|Fiat Bravo]] was the successor of the Stilo in most markets, however, the five door Stilo continued to be manufactured in [[Brazil]] until December 2010, when it was replaced by the Bravo. The Stilo came in third place in the [[European Car of the Year]] awards for 2002, behind the [[Peugeot 307]] and [[Renault Laguna]].

==Overview==
The Stilo's styling received mixed reviews, with many journalists and enthusiasts criticising it as being too bland and too [[Germany|German]] looking, as the styling of the preceding Bravo and Brava had been criticised for being too "Italian". Critics also attacked the car's excessive weight and its semi independent rear [[torsion beam suspension]] / [[twist-beam rear suspension]], however, this was the same system used by the market leading [[Volkswagen Golf]] of the time. 

Some saw the torsion beam as a step backwards from the acclaimed fully [[independent rear suspension]] used in the Bravo/Brava and Fiat Coupe. However, when pushed the Stilo resists understeer, although arguably its soft spring and damper rates dull the experience. 

The engine range, particularly the 1.2 litre petrol, was also generally criticised for being underpowered. However the 1.6 version is the last iteration of the old [[Fiat 128 SOHC engine]] which provided strong performance. The car's [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] was also seen as poor for its class, a result of the car's weight. Another point of criticism was the Selespeed gearbox fitted to the Abarth version, this was seen as too slow in its reactions and particularly inappropriate for this high powered version. Nevertheless, the car won praise for its high levels of grip (aided by the unusually wide tires) and its brakes. 

In the United Kingdom, different trim levels available were: Active, Active Aircon, Blue, Dynamic, Sporting, Abarth, GT, Prestigio, Xbox limited edition, Michael Schumacher and the Schumacher GP, with general modifications by British car specialists, [[Prodrive]].

The Stilo was the second car worldwide to use the [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] Column-Drive Electric Power Assisted Steering (EPS) technology after the [[Fiat_Punto#Second_generation_.281999.E2.80.932010.29|second generation Fiat Punto]], later introduced on the 2003 [[Nissan Micra]] and [[Renault Mégane]]. As the model range aged, the range of available options was reduced. 

The Stilo was originally offered in some markets with a radar assisted cruise control option; it included sensors in the front bumper and rear of the car to adjust the speed of the car according to other vehicles' speed.{{cn|date=March 2018}} This was soon{{when|date=March 2018}} dropped as it became apparent that interference was creating undesired results.{{cn|date=March 2018}} 

A keyless entry, named 'Easy Go', push button start, similar in function to [[Citroën]]'s, [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s and [[Mini (marque)|BMW Mini]]'s systems, was also an available option. For MY2006 in September 2005, the Stilo was updated with a new front grille, different seat fabric, a relocation of the electric mirror controls from the window control console to just behind the gear stick. 

The entry models also had the centre arm rest removed (which when in the downward position prevented comfortable use of the handbrake as in the [[Audi A3]]) and the deletion of the rear air vent.

The Stilo was ultimately a sales disappointment. An extensive advertising campaign using Formula 1 stars [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Rubens Barrichello]] did little to aid the car's sales. In October 2013, ''[[The Economist]]'' placed the Stilo into the report on ''Europe's Biggest Loss Making Cars''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/09/daily-chart-18 |title=Daily Chart. Europe's biggest loss making cars |publisher=The Economist | date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, the 1242&amp;nbsp;cc engine was dropped in favour of the Punto's 1.4 L unit, increasing the car's power to 95&amp;nbsp;bhp (71&amp;nbsp;kW), again combined with the six-speed gearbox. Also, the tail lights were altered, and the Abarth version gained a [[manual transmission|manual]] gearbox, instead of the ''Selespeed''.

==Motorsport==
A Group N version of the car was developed by [[Abarth]] to compete in the single make trophy called [[Trofeo Stilo Abarth]], held in Italy from 2002 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=championship&amp;ctype=itammf |title=Italian Fiat One-Make Trophies |publisher=RallyBase.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was revealed in November 2001, at the Bologna Motor Show. 

It was derived from the Stilo 1.8 16v version, with the engine power increased from {{Convert|133|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|157|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/newmodels_stiloabarthrally.html |title=New models: Fiat Stilo Abarth Rally |publisher=italiaspeed.com |date=2001-11-30 |accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the 2003 season to {{Convert|180|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatpress.com/press/detail/6669 |title=Fiat Stilo Abarth Rally - technical specifications |publisher=fiatpress.com|date=2003-10-28 |accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar competition was held in the United Kingdom from 2004 to 2005, called the Fiat Stilo Rally Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2005/motor_show/autosport/fiat_cup/1701.html |title=Motor shows |publisher=italiaspeed.com |date=2005-01-17 |accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, a junior team backed up by Fiat UK competed in the [[Wales Rally GB]] of the [[World Rally Championship]] with group A cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/rally/rally_2004/rally_gb/09/stilo/2109.html |title=Racing news |publisher=italiaspeed.com |date=2004-09-22 |accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&amp;rallyid=400 |title=60th Wales Rally of Great Britain |publisher=RallyBase.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year two other cars took part in the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&amp;rallyid=416 |title=61st Wales Rally GB |publisher=RallyBase.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stilo cars have also been present in the [[Andros Trophy]] during the last years.

==Marketing==

===South America===
Only available in the five door hatchback version, the Stilo was launched in [[South America]] in 2003, being assembled in [[Brazil]]. The engines were the Family I GM engines 1.8 L with eight valve (103&amp;nbsp;hp) and 16 valve (122&amp;nbsp;hp) versions, and a 2.4 twenty valve version (170&amp;nbsp;hp) for the Abarth model as well. For export, the chosen engines were the Italian made 1.8 16v VIS engine with {{convert|133|hp|abbr=on}} and the 1.9 JTD Diesel of {{convert|115|hp|abbr=on}} specially for [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Chile]]. (Chile did not get the JTD, but was the only country in the region to receive the Italian three door version, and the MultiWagon version.)

A Schumacher special edition of the Stilo was added in 2004 and lasted until 2006; contrary to the European version, which was based on the three door version and equipped with the 2.4 twenty valve engine, the Brazilian was only available with five doors and the Family I GM 1.8 16v engine with {{convert|122|hp|abbr=on}}. In 2006, the Stilo gained a GM sourced flexible engine capable of using petrol and ethanol (1.8 8v with {{convert|110|hp|abbr=on}} on petrol and {{convert|114|hp|abbr=on}} with ethanol) and the 1.8 16v engine was retired.

In the Americas, the Stilo was partially replaced by the new Bravo in the end of 2010, when it will be built in Brazil; from 2007 on the Italian import is available in [[Chile]] and [[Venezuela]].

Fiat Automóveis introduced a facelifted Stilo in the end of January 2008, in which the [[Dualogic]] manual robotized gearbox was released, being available to every version with the 1.8 8v Flex engine, which now produces {{convert|112|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} (petrol) or {{convert|114|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} when using ethanol as fuel.&lt;ref name="italiaspeed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/new_models/2008/fiat/stilo_2008/2801.html|title=New Model — Fiat Stilo Flex (2008)|date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2008-01-29|work=italiaspeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car also got minor cosmetic changes to front grille, bonnet, side bumpers and to the taillights, in order to end its production cycle, which is expected to happen in 2010.

For the MY2009, Fiat withdrew the Abarth version from the Brazilian market;&lt;ref name="blogauto.com.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogauto.com.br/fim-de-linha-para-o-stilo-abarth/|title=Fim de linha para o Stilo Abarth?|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2009-03-05|work=blogauto.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; the version wasn't available in other markets anymore.

For the MY2010, Fiat do Brasil launched a "basic features" versión called ''Attractive'', still with the 1.8 8v Flex engine. This version marks the confirmation that the new Bravo is coming, with the Stilo Attractive as the only version.

In March 2010, Brazil's Justice Ministry fined Fiat three million Reais (US$ 1.7 million) for failing to recall its Stilo without ABS brakes to fix a rear wheel problem that may have caused thirty accidents and eight deaths. Fiat denied any wrongdoing, saying that the rear wheel problem was not the cause of the accidents, but rather caused by them.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=adH0fT4k6Tlw|title=Brazil fines Fiat, orders Stilo recall after deaths|accessdate=2010-03-10|work=bloomberg.com|date=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Glashow resonance''', put forward by [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon L. Glashow]] in 1959, is the resonant formation of the [[W boson]] in antineutrino-electron collisions: {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron-}} → {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}.&lt;ref&gt;S. L. Glashow, Phys. Rev. 118 (1960) 316-317.&lt;/ref&gt; The threshold antineutrino energy for this process (for the electron at rest in the laboratory frame) is 6.3 [[electronvolt|PeV]]. This process is considered for the detection and studies of high-energy cosmic neutrinos at the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|IceCube experiment]], at the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES neutrino telescope]], and at the [[KM3NeT| KM3NeT neutrino telescope]].

The '''green economy''' is defined as an [[economy]] that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities, and that aims for [[sustainable development]] without [[environmental degradation|degrading the environment]]. It is closely related with [[ecological economics]], but has a more politically applied focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/AboutGEI/WhatisGEI/tabid/29784/Default.aspx|title=-- United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - Error page --|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]] Green Economy Report argues "that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognising global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive."&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of [[natural capital]] and [[ecological services]] as having economic value (''see [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] and [[Bank of Natural Capital]]'') and a [[full cost accounting]] regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1150 Runnals, D. (2011) “Environment and economy: joined at the hip or just strange bedfellows?”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''4''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Sticker and [[ecolabel]] practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a [[globalizing]] economy.

== "Green" economists and economics ==
"Green economics" is loosely defined as any theory of [[economics]] by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after [[Lynn Margulis]]).  A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist.  Proponents of [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]], the [[environmental movement]], [[peace movement]], [[Green politics]], [[green anarchism]] and [[anti-globalization]] movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to [[mainstream economics]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of [[Green parties]] which are formally organized and claim the capital-G "Green" term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of "'green economists"' who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy, [[biomimicry]] and a fuller accounting for [[biodiversity]].  (''see [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and [[Bank of Natural Capital]] for a layperson's presentation of these.''){{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools.  For instance, it is regarded as [[classical economics]] where the traditional land is generalized to [[natural capital]] and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as [[canal]]s). Or, it is viewed as [[Marxist economics]] with nature represented as a form of [[Lumpenproletariat]], an exploited base of non-human workers providing [[surplus value]] to the human economy, or as a branch of [[neoclassical economics]] in which the [[price of life]] for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

An increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of [[natural capital]] and [[full cost accounting]] under the banner 'green economy' could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of "green economics".  As of 2010 the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions (notably the [[World Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11642538|title=World Bank to lead economic push on nature protection|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Monetary Fund]] (via its "Green Fund" initiative) responsible for global [[monetary policy]] have stated a clear intention to move towards [[biodiversity]] valuation and a more official and universal [[biodiversity finance]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
Taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the [[Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that "based on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$ 1.05 to US$ 2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation." &lt;ref name="unep.org"/&gt;

The [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) representing global business defines green economy as “an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in a mutually reinforcing fashion while supporting progress on social development”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/green-economy-roadmap|title=Green Economy Roadmap|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505222844/http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/green-economy-roadmap/|archivedate=5 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncsd2012.org/content/documents/528Green%20Economy%20Guidebook_100912_FINAL.pdf UNDESA, (2012). A guidebook to the Green Economy.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127180157/http://uncsd2012.org/content/documents/528Green%20Economy%20Guidebook_100912_FINAL.pdf |date=2013-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the ICC published the Green Economy Roadmap, containing contributions from experts from around the globe brought together in a two-year consultation process. The Roadmap represents a comprehensive and multidisciplinary effort to clarify and frame the concept of “green economy”. It highlights the essential role of business in bringing solutions to common global challenges. It sets out the following 10 conditions which relate to business/intra-industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy:

* Open and competitive markets
* Metrics, accounting, and reporting
* Finance and investment
* Awareness
* Life cycle approach
* Resource efficiency and decoupling
* Employment
* Education and skills
* Governance and partnership
* Integrated policy and decision-making

==Ecological measurements==
Measuring economic output and progress is done through the use of [[Index (economics)|economic index]] indicators. Green indices emerged from the need to measure human ecological impact, efficiency sectors like transport, energy, buildings and tourism, as well as the investment flows targeted to areas like renewable energy and cleantech innovation. 
# 2010 - 2016 Global Green Economy Index™ (GGEI),&lt;ref name="ggei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dualcitizeninc.com/GGEI-2016.pdf |title=2016 Global Green Economy Index |publisher=Dual Citizen LLC |date=19 September 2016 |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by consultancy Dual Citizen LLC is in its 5th edition. It measures the green economic performance and perceptions of it in 80 countries and 50 cities along four main dimensions of leadership &amp; climate change, efficiency sectors, markets &amp; investment and the environment.
# 2009 - 2012 Green City Index &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/en/greencityindex.htm|title=Home - English - Siemens Global Website|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global study commissioned by [[Siemens]]
# 2009 - 2013 [[Circles of Sustainability]] project scored 5 cities in 5 separate countries.

[[Ecological footprint]] measurements are a way to gauge anthropogenic impact and are another standard used by municipal governments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcm.ca/Documents/reports/Ecological_Footprints_of_Canadian_Municipalities_and_Regions_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green energy issues ==
Green economies require [[green energy]] generation based on [[renewable energy]] to replace  [[fossil fuels]] as well as [[energy conservation]] and [[efficient energy use]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

There is justification for [[market failure]] to respond to [[environmental protection]] and [[climate protection]] needs with the excuse that high [[external costs]] and high initial costs for research, development, and marketing of [[green energy]] sources and green products prevents firms from voluntarily reducing their ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;(Reinhardt, 1999; King and Lenox, 2002; Wagner, 203; Wagner, et al., 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The green economy may need government subsidies as market incentives to motivate firms to invest and produce green products and services. The [[German Renewable Energy Act]], legislations of many other [[member states of the European Union]] and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], all provide such market incentives.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, other experts&lt;ref&gt;[[Amory Lovins]], [[Hunter Lovins]], and [[Paul Hawken]], authors of ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]'', and [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] and Shel Horowitz, authors of ''Guerrilla Marketing Goes Green''&lt;/ref&gt; argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.

== Criticisms ==

A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity|price mechanisms to protect nature]], arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy "will spur even greater convergence of [[corporate power]] and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5296|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108015332/http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5296|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 January 2012|title=New Report: Who Will Control the Green Economy? - ETC Group|author=|date=8 January 2012|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, ''Towards a Green Economy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/greeneconomyreport/tabid/29846/default.aspx |title=Green Economy - Green Economy Report |publisher=UNEP |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while well-intentioned "ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/report/green-economy-wolf-sheeps-clothing|title=The Green Economy: the Wolf in Sheep’s clothing|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for [[UNCTAD]] also says that the focus on Green Economy and "green growth" in particular, "based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate
change" and "may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can
bring about a U-turn of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/osgdp2011d5_en.pdf U.Hoffmann (2011), "Some reflections on climate change, green growth illusions and development space"]&lt;/ref&gt; Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clivespash.org/fgml.pdf Spash, C.L. 2007.

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}

'''Inertia''' is the resistance, of any physical [[physical body|object]], to any change in its [[velocity]]. This includes changes to the object's [[speed]], or [[Relative direction|direction]] of motion. 

An aspect of this property is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at a constant speed, when no forces are upon them—and this aspect in particular is also called inertia.

The principle of inertia is one of the fundamental principles in [[classical physics]] that are still used today to describe the motion of objects and how they are affected by the applied [[force]]s on them. 

Inertia comes from the Latin word, ''iners'', meaning idle, sluggish. Inertia is one of the primary manifestations of [[mass]], which is a quantitative property of [[physical system]]s. [[Isaac Newton]] defined inertia as his first law in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', which states: &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Motte's English translation:{{Citation| last = Newton| first = Isaac| title = Newton's Principia : the mathematical principles of natural philosophy| publisher = Daniel Adee| year = 1846| location = New York| url = https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich| pages= 72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The ''vis insita'', or innate force of matter, is a power of resisting by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to preserve its present state, whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a straight line.&lt;!--There is a citation in the text immediately preceding the quote.--&gt;}}

In common usage, the term "inertia" may refer to an object's "amount of resistance to change in velocity" (which is quantified by its mass), or sometimes to its [[momentum]], depending on the context.  The term "inertia" is more properly understood as shorthand for "the principle of inertia" as described by Newton in his [[Newton's laws of motion|First Law of Motion]]: an object not subject to any net external force moves at a constant velocity. Thus, an object will continue moving at its current [[velocity]] until some force causes its speed or direction to change.

On the surface of the Earth, inertia is often masked by the effects of [[friction]] and [[Drag (physics)|air resistance]], both of which tend to decrease the speed of moving objects (commonly to the point of rest), and [[Gravitation|gravity]]. This misled the philosopher [[Aristotle]] to believe that objects would move only as long as force was applied to them:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =  Aristotle: Minor works| title = ''Mechanical Problems'' (''Mechanica'')| publisher =  Loeb Classical Library Cambridge (Mass.) and London| year = 1936| location = [[University of Chicago Library]]| url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Aristotle/Mechanica*.html | pages= 407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pages 2 to 4, Section 1.1, "Skating", Chapter 1, "Things that Move", Louis Bloomfield, Professor of Physics at the [[University of Virginia]], ''How Everything Works: Making Physics Out of the Ordinary'', John Wiley &amp; Sons (2007), hardcover, {{ISBN|978-0-471-74817-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...it [body] stops when the force which is pushing the travelling object has no longer power to push it along...}}

==History and development of the concept==

===Early understanding of motion===
Prior to the [[Renaissance]], the most generally accepted theory of motion in [[Western philosophy]] was based on [[Aristotle]]  who around about 335 BC to 322 BC said that, in the absence of an external motive power, all objects (on Earth) would come to rest and that moving objects only continue to move so long as there is a power inducing them to do so. Aristotle explained the continued motion of projectiles, which are separated from their projector, by the action of the surrounding medium, which continues to move the projectile in some way.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'', 8.10, 267a1–21; [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8ph/ Aristotle, ''Physics'', trans. by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129111002/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8ph/ |date=2007-01-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle concluded that such violent motion in a void was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'', 4.8, 214b29–215a24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its general acceptance, Aristotle's concept of motion was disputed on several occasions by notable philosophers over nearly two [[millennia]]. For example, [[Lucretius]] (following, presumably, [[Epicurus]]) stated that the "default state" of matter was motion, not stasis.&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ''On the Nature of Things'' (London: Penguin, 1988), pp. 60–65&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 6th century, [[John Philoponus]] criticized the inconsistency between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where the medium keeps projectiles going, and his discussion of the void, where the medium would hinder a body's motion. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of a surrounding medium, but by some property imparted to the object when it was set in motion. Although this was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for a power to keep a body in motion, it proved a fundamental step in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sorabji|first=Richard|title=Matter, space and motion : theories in antiquity and their sequel|date=1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=978-0801421945|edition=1st |pages=227&amp;mdash;228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.1 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=John Philoponus |date=8 June 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Darling_2006&gt;{{Cite book | last = Darling  | first = David  | title = Gravity's arc: the story of gravity, from Aristotle to Einstein and beyond  | publisher = John Wiley and Sons  | date = 2006  | pages =  17, 50 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nh3zEV_2N4EC&amp;pg=PA50 | isbn = 978-0-471-71989-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This view was strongly opposed by [[Averroes]] and by many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers who supported Aristotle. However, this view did not go unchallenged in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]], where Philoponus did have several supporters who further developed his ideas.

===Theory of impetus===
{{Main|Theory of impetus}}
{{See also|Conatus}}

In the 14th century, [[Jean Buridan]] rejected the notion that a motion-generating property, which he named ''impetus'', dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Buridan: Quaestiones on Aristotle's Physics (quoted at [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105959/http://brahms.phy.vanderbilt.edu/a203/impetus_theory.html Impetus Theory])&lt;/ref&gt; Buridan also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also believed that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects (such as celestial bodies) to move in a circle.

Buridan's thought was followed up by his pupil [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]] (1316–1390) and the [[Oxford Calculators]], who performed various experiments that further undermined the classical, Aristotelian view. Their work in turn was elaborated by [[Nicole Oresme]] who pioneered the practice of demonstrating laws of motion in the form of graphs.

Shortly before Galileo's theory of inertia, [[Giambattista Benedetti]] modified the growing theory of impetus to involve linear motion alone:

{{quote|"…[Any] portion of corporeal matter which moves by itself when an impetus has been impressed on it by any external motive force has a natural tendency to move on a rectilinear, not a curved, path."&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Benedetti, selection from ''Speculationum'', in [[Stillman Drake]] and I. E. Drabkin, ''Mechanics in Sixteenth Century Italy'' [[University of Wisconsin Press]], 1969, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Benedetti cites the motion of a rock in a sling as an example of the inherent linear motion of objects, forced into circular motion.

===Classical inertia===
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|250px|Galileo Galilei]]
The principle of inertia which originated with Aristotle for "motions in a void" states that an object tends to resist a change in motion. According to Newton, an object will stay at rest or stay in motion (i.e. "maintain its velocity") unless acted on by a net external force, whether it results from [[gravity]], [[friction]], contact, or some other force. The Aristotelian division of motion into mundane and celestial became increasingly problematic in the face of the conclusions of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in the 16th century, who argued that the earth (and everything on it) was in fact never "at rest", but was actually in constant motion around the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Copernicus, [http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Copernicus.html ''The Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres''], 1543&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo]], in his further development of the [[Copernican model]], recognized these problems with the then-accepted nature of motion and, at least partially as a result, included a restatement of Aristotle's description of motion in a void as a basic physical principle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A body moving on a level surface will continue in the same direction at a constant speed unless disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed analysis concerning this issue, see Alan Chalmers article "Galliean Relativity and Galileo's Relativity", in ''Correspondence, Invariance and Heuristics: Essays in Hounour of Heinz Post'', eds. Steven French and Harmke Kamminga, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1991, {{ISBN|0792320859}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galileo writes that "all external impediments removed, a heavy body on a spherical surface concentric with the earth will maintain itself in that state in which it has been; if placed in movement towards the west (for example), it will maintain itself in that movement."&lt;ref&gt;Drake, S. ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'', Doubleday Anchor, New York, 1957, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; This notion which is termed "circular inertia" or "horizontal circular inertia" by historians of science, is a precursor to, but distinct from, Newton's notion of rectilinear inertia.&lt;ref&gt;See Alan Chalmers article "Galliean Relativity and Galileo's Relativity", in ''Correspondence, Invariance and Heuristics: Essays in Hounour of Heinz Post'', eds. Steven French and Harmke Kamminga, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1991, pp. 199–200, {{ISBN|0792320859}}. Chalmers does not, however, believe that Galileo's physics had a general principle of inertia, circular or otherwise.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dijksterhuis E.J. ''The Mechanisation of the World Picture'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1961, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  For Galileo, a motion is "[[horizontal and vertical|horizontal]]" if it does not carry the moving body towards or away from the centre of the earth, and for him, "a ship, for instance, having once received some impetus through the tranquil sea, would move continually around our globe without ever stopping."&lt;ref&gt;Galileo, ''Letters on Sunspots'', 1613 quoted in Drake, S. ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'', Doubleday Anchor, New York, 1957, pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Newtonian mechanics, if a projectile on a smooth spherical planet is given an initial horizontal impetus, it will not remain on the surface of the earth. Various curves are possible depending on the initial speed and the height of launch. See Harris Benson ''University Physics'', New York 1991, page 268. If constrained to remain on the surface, by being sandwiched, say, in between two concentric spheres, it will follow a great circle on the surface of the earth, i.e. will only maintain a westerly direction if fired along the equator. See "Using great circles" [http://www.physics.oregonstate.edu/~mcintyre/COURSES/ph429_S06/slides.pdf Using great circles]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also worth noting that Galileo later (in 1632) concluded that based on this initial premise of inertia, it is impossible to tell the difference between a moving object and a stationary one without some outside reference to compare it against.&lt;ref&gt;Galileo, ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', 1632 ([http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Galileo.html full text]).&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation ultimately came to be the basis for [[Einstein]] to develop the theory of [[Special Relativity]].

The first physicist to completely break away from the Aristotelian model of motion was [[Isaac Beeckman]] in 1614.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = van Berkel| first = Klaas| title = Isaac Beeckman on Matter and Motion: Mechanical Philosophy in the Making| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| year = 2013| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D3WTX-23UVEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| pages= 105–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts of inertia in Galileo's writings would later come to be refined, modified and codified by [[Isaac Newton]] as the first of his [[Newton's laws of motion|Laws of Motion]] (first published in Newton's work, ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', in 1687):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unless acted upon by a net unbalanced force, an object will maintain a constant velocity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that "velocity" in this context is defined as a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], thus Newton's "constant velocity" implies both constant speed and constant direction (and also includes the case of zero speed, or no motion).  Since initial publication, Newton's Laws of Motion (and by inclusion, this first law) have come to form the basis for the branch of [[physics]] known as [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/8.01t/www/coursedocs/current/guide.htm|title=Classical Mechanics: MIT 8.01 Course Notes|last=Dourmaskin|first=Peter|date=December 2013|website=MIT Physics 8.01|publisher=|access-date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "inertia" was first introduced by [[Johannes Kepler]] in his ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]''&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Nolan (ed.), ''The Cambridge Descartes Lexicon'', Cambridge University Press, 2016, "Inertia."&lt;/ref&gt; (published in three parts from 1617–1621); however, the meaning of Kepler's term (which he derived from the Latin word for "idleness" or "laziness") was not quite the same as its modern interpretation.  Kepler defined inertia only in terms of a resistance to movement, once again based on the presumption that rest was a natural state which did not need explanation.  It was not until the later work of Galileo and Newton unified rest and motion in one principle that the term "inertia" could be applied to these concepts as it is today.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Nevertheless, despite defining the concept so elegantly in his laws of motion, even Newton did not actually use the term "inertia" to refer to his First Law.  In fact, Newton originally viewed the phenomenon he described in his First Law of Motion as being caused by "innate forces" inherent in matter, which resisted any acceleration. Given this perspective, and borrowing from Kepler, Newton attributed the term "inertia" to mean "the innate force possessed by an object which resists changes in motion"; thus, Newton defined "inertia" to mean the cause of the phenomenon, rather than the phenomenon itself. However, Newton's original ideas of "innate resistive force" were ultimately problematic for a variety of reasons, and thus most physicists no longer think in these terms. As no alternate mechanism has been readily accepted, and it is now generally accepted that there may not be one which we can know, the term "inertia" has come to mean simply the phenomenon itself, rather than any inherent mechanism. Thus, ultimately, "inertia" in modern classical physics has come to be a name for the same phenomenon described by Newton's First Law of Motion, and the two concepts are now considered to be equivalent.

===Relativity===
[[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], as proposed in his 1905 paper entitled "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" was built on the understanding of inertia and [[inertial reference frames]] developed by Galileo and Newton. While this revolutionary theory did significantly change the meaning of many Newtonian concepts such as [[mass]], [[energy]], and [[distance]], Einstein's concept of inertia remained unchanged from Newton's original meaning (in fact, the entire theory was based on Newton's definition of inertia). However, this resulted in a limitation inherent in special relativity: the [[principle of relativity]] could only apply to reference frames that were ''inertial'' in nature (meaning when no acceleration was present). In an attempt to address this limitation, Einstein proceeded to develop his [[general theory of relativity]] ("The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity," 1916), which ultimately provided a unified theory for both ''inertial'' and ''noninertial'' (accelerated) reference frames. However, in order to accomplish this, in general relativity, Einstein found it necessary to redefine several fundamental concepts (such as gravity) in terms of a new concept of "curvature" of [[space-time]], instead of the more traditional system of forces understood by Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Engel English Translation:{{Citation| last = Einstein| first = Albert| title = The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity| publisher = Princeton University Press| year = 1997| location = New Jersey| url = http://hermes.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Einstein_GRelativity_1916.pdf| pages = 57| accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this redefinition, Einstein also redefined the concept of "inertia" in terms of [[geodesic deviation]] instead, with some subtle but significant additional implications. The result of this is that, according to general relativity, inertia is the gravitational coupling between matter and spacetime.

When dealing with very large scales, the traditional Newtonian idea of "inertia" does not actually apply and cannot necessarily be relied upon. Luckily, for sufficiently small regions of spacetime, the special theory can be used and ''inertia'' still means the same (and works the same) as in the classical model.{{Dubious|date=August 2012}}

Another profound conclusion of the theory of special relativity—perhaps the most well known—was that energy and mass are not separate things but are, in fact, interchangeable. But this new relationship also carried with it new implications for the concept of inertia. The logical conclusion of special relativity was that if mass exhibits the principle of inertia, then inertia must also apply to energy. This theory, and subsequent experiments confirming some of its conclusions, have also served to radically expand the meaning of inertia to apply more widely and to include inertia of energy.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Interpretations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}

===Mass and inertia===
[[File:01.Опит на Тисанди.ogv|thumb|280px|Suspended weight showing inertia. The weight is suspended on a string, and has another string hanging from it. If the string is pulled quickly, only the bottom string is detached, and the weight remains hanging because of its inability to react in time (its inertness). If the same bottom string is pulled more slowly, the entire assembly falls down.]]

[[Physicists]] and [[mathematicians]] appear to be less inclined to use the popular concept of inertia as "a tendency to maintain momentum" and instead favor the mathematically useful definition of inertia as the measure of a body's resistance to changes in velocity or simply a body's inertial mass.

This was clear at the beginning of the 20th century, before the advent of the [[theory of relativity]]. Mass, ''m'', denoted something like an amount of substance or quantity of matter. At the same time, mass was the quantitative measure of inertia of a body.

The mass of a body determines the momentum, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, of the body at given velocity, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;; it is a proportionality factor in the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;p = mv&lt;/math&gt;

The factor ''m'' is referred to as [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]].

But mass, as related to the "inertia" of a body, can also be defined by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;F = ma,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is the force, ''m'' is the inertial mass, and ''a'' is the acceleration.

By this formula, the greater its mass, the less a body accelerates under a given force. The masses defined by the above formulas are equal because the latter formula is a consequence of the former, if mass does not depend on time and velocity. Thus, "mass is the quantitative or numerical measure of a body’s inertia, that is of its resistance to being accelerated".

This meaning of a ''body's inertia'' therefore is altered from the popular meaning as "a tendency to maintain momentum" to a description of the measure of how difficult it is to change the velocity of a body, but it is consistent with the fact that motion in one reference frame can disappear in another, so it is the change in velocity that is important.

===Inertial mass===
{{anchor|gravitational mass}}
There is no measurable difference between gravitational mass and inertial mass. The gravitational mass is defined by the quantity of gravitational field material a mass possesses, including its energy. The "inertial mass" (relativistic mass) is a function of the acceleration a mass has undergone and its resultant speed. A mass that has been accelerated to speeds close to the speed of light has its "relativistic mass" increased, and that is why the magnetic field strength in particle accelerators must be increased to force the mass's path to curve. In practice, "inertial mass" is normally taken to be "invariant mass" and so is identical to gravitational mass without the energy component.

Gravitational mass is measured by comparing the force of gravity of an unknown mass to the force of [[gravity]] of a known mass. This is typically done with some sort of balance. Equal masses will match on a balance because the gravitational field applies to them equally, producing identical weight. This assumption breaks down near supermassive objects such as black holes and neutron stars due to [[tidal force|tidal effects]]. It also breaks down in weightless environments, because no matter what objects are compared, it will yield a balanced reading.

Inertial mass is found by applying a known net force to an unknown mass, measuring the resulting acceleration, and applying Newton's Second Law, &lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;. This gives an accurate value for mass, limited only by the accuracy of the measurements. When astronauts need to be measured in the weightlessness of free fall, they actually find their inertial mass in a special chair called a body mass measurement device (BMMD).

At high speeds, and especially near the speed of light (&lt;math&gt;c=2.99792458 \cdot 10^8\,\mathrm{m/s}&lt;/math&gt;), inertial mass can be determined by measuring the magnetic field strength and the curvature of the path of an electrically-charged mass such as an electron.

No physical difference has been found between gravitational and inertial mass in a given inertial frame. In experimental measurements, the two always agree within the margin of error for the experiment. [[Einstein]] used the fact that gravitational and inertial mass were equal to begin his [[general theory of relativity]], in which he postulated that gravitational mass was the same as inertial mass, and that the acceleration of gravity is a result of a "valley" or slope in the [[space-time continuum]] that masses "fell down". [[Dennis Sciama]] later showed that the reaction force produced by the combined gravity of all matter in the universe upon an accelerating object is mathematically equal to the object's inertia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.fullerton.edu/~jimw/general/inertia/index.htm The Origin of Inertia]&lt;/ref&gt; but this would only be a workable physical explanation if, by some mechanism, the gravitational effects operated instantaneously.

At any non-zero speed, relativistic mass always exceeds gravitational mass. If the mass is made to travel close to the speed of light, its "inertial mass" (relativistic) as observed from a stationary frame would be very great while its gravitational mass would remain at its rest value, but the gravitational effect of the extra energy would exactly balance the measured increase in inertial mass.

===Inertial frames===
In a location such as a steadily moving railway carriage, a dropped ball (as seen by an observer in the carriage) would behave as it would if it were dropped in a stationary carriage. The ball would simply descend vertically. It is possible to ignore the motion of the carriage by defining it as an [[inertial frame]].  In a moving but non-accelerating frame, the ball behaves normally because the train and its contents continue to move at a constant velocity.  Before being dropped, the ball was traveling with the train at the same speed, and the ball's inertia ensured that it continued to move in the same speed and direction as the train, even while dropping. Note that, here, it is inertia which ensured that, not its mass.

In an [[inertial frame]], all the observers in uniform (non-accelerating) motion will observe the same laws of physics. However, observers in another inertial frame can make a simple, and intuitively obvious, transformation (the [[Galilean transformation]]), to convert their observations. Thus, an observer from outside the moving train could deduce that the dropped ball within the carriage fell vertically downwards.

However, in reference frames which are experiencing acceleration ([[non-inertial reference frame]]s), objects appear to be affected by [[fictitious force]]s. For example, if the railway carriage were accelerating, the ball would not fall vertically within the carriage but would appear to an observer to be deflected because the carriage and the ball would not be traveling at the same speed while the ball was falling. Other examples of fictitious forces occur in rotating frames such as the earth.  For example, a missile at the North Pole could be aimed directly at a location and fired southwards.  An observer would see it apparently deflected away from its target by a force (the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis force]]), but in reality, the southerly target has moved because earth has rotated while the missile is in flight. Because the earth is rotating, a useful inertial frame of reference is defined by the stars, which only move imperceptibly during most observations. Newton's first law of motion is known as the principle of inertia.

In summary, the principle of inertia is intimately linked with the principles of [[conservation of energy]] and [[Momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]].

==Rotational inertia==
Another form of inertia is ''rotational inertia'' (→ [[moment of inertia]]), the property that a rotating rigid body maintains its state of uniform [[rotation]]al motion.  Its [[angular momentum]] is unchanged, unless an external [[torque]] is applied; this is also called conservation of angular momentum.  Rotational inertia depends on the object remaining structurally intact as a rigid body, and also has practical consequences. For example, a [[gyroscope]] uses the property that it resists any change in the axis of rotation.

A gas or liquid in a container will also resist changes in rotational rate.

'''Joseph Black''' (16 April 1728 – 6 December 1799) was a Scottish physician and chemist, known for his discoveries of [[magnesium]], [[latent heat]], [[specific heat]], and [[carbon dioxide]]. He was Professor of Anatomy and Chemistry at the [[University of Glasgow]] for 10 years from 1756, and then Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1766, teaching and lecturing there for more than 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{DSB|first=Henry|last=Guerlac|title=Black, Joseph|volume=2|pages=173–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[chemistry]] buildings at both the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow are named after Black.

==Early life and education==
Black was born in [[Bordeaux]], France, the sixth of the 12 children of Margaret Gordon (''d''. 1747) and John Black. His mother was from an [[Aberdeenshire]] family that had connections with the wine business and his father was from [[Belfast]], Ireland and worked as a factor in the [[Wine|wine trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lenard |first=Philipp |title=Great Men of Science |year=1950 |publisher=G. Bell and Sons |location=London |page=129 |isbn=0-8369-1614-X}} (Translated from the second German edition.)&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at home until the age of 12, after which he attended grammar school in Belfast. In 1746 at the age of 18 he entered the [[University of Glasgow]], studying there for four years before spending another four at the [[University of Edinburgh]], furthering his medical studies. During his studies he wrote a doctorate thesis on the treatment of [[kidney stones]] with the salt [[magnesium carbonate]].&lt;ref name="Modinos2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonis Modinos|title=From Aristotle to Schrödinger: The Curiosity of Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KaUngEACAAJ|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-00749-6|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Chemical Principles===
Like most 18th-century experimentalists, Black's conceptualisation of chemistry was based on five 'principles' of matter: Water, Salt, Earth, Fire and Metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School, 1750-1800|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014/John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_London_Routledge_2008_._Click_on_the_FILES_link_below_to_download_the_entire_book}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added the principle of 'Air' when his experiments definitely confirmed the presence of carbon dioxide, which he called 'fixed air'.  Black's research  was guided by questions relating to how the  'principles' combined with each other in various different forms and mixtures.  He used the term 'affinity' to describe the force that held such combinations together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=How to See a Diagram: A Visual Anthropology of Chemical Affinity|journal=Osiris|date=2014|volume=29|pages=178–196|doi=10.1086/678093|url=https://www.academia.edu/4588508/How_to_See_a_Diagram_A_Visual_Anthropology_of_Chemical_Affinity_Osiris_2014_178-196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career he used a variety of diagrams and formulas to teach his University of Edinburgh students how to manipulate 'affinity' through different kinds of experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=Useful Pictures: Joseph Black and the Graphic Culture of Experimentation|journal=in Robert G.

===Analytical balance===
[[File:BalanceMineralPachuca.JPG|thumb|A precision analytical balance]]
In about 1750, while still a student, Black developed the [[analytical balance]] based on a light-weight beam balanced on a wedge-shaped [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]]. Each arm carried a pan on which the sample or standard weights was placed. It far exceeded the accuracy of any other balance of the time and became an important scientific instrument in most chemistry laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Equal Arm Analytical Balances | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/balances/index.html | accessdate = 8 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latent heat===
[[File:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|thumb|The world's first '''ice-calorimeter''', used in the winter of 1782–83, by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], to determine the heat evolved in various [[chemical change]]s, calculations which were based on Joseph Black's prior discovery of [[latent heat]].]]

In 1757, Black was appointed [[Regius Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics, Glasgow|Regius Professor of the Practice of Medicine]] at the [[University of Glasgow]].

In 1761 he deduced that the application of heat to [[ice]] at its melting point does not cause a rise in temperature of the ice/water mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of water in the mixture. Additionally, Black observed that the application of heat to boiling water does not result in a rise in temperature of a water/steam mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of steam. From these observations, he concluded that the heat applied must have combined with the ice particles and boiling water and become [[latent heat|latent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black, Joseph|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of latent heat marks the beginning of [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ogg, David | title = Europe of the Ancien Regime: 1715–1783 | year = 1965 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row| pages = 117 and 283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black's theory of latent heat was one of his more-important scientific contributions, and one on which his scientific fame chiefly rests. He also showed that different substances have different [[specific heat]]s.

The theory ultimately proved important not only in the development of abstract science but in the development of the [[steam engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ogg, David | title = Europe of the Ancien Regime: 1715–1783 | year = 1965 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = | page = 283 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latent heat of water is large compared with many other liquids, so giving impetus to [[James Watt]]'s attempts to improve the efficiency of the steam engine invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]]. Black and Watt became friends after meeting around 1757 while both were at [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]]. Black provided significant financing and other support for Watt's early research in steam power.

===Carbon dioxide===
Black also explored the properties of a gas produced in various reactions. He found that [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called "fixed air." He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and did not support either flame or animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of [[Lime (material)|lime]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]), it would precipitate calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that [[carbon dioxide]] is produced by animal [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[microbial]] [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].

==Professorship==
In 1766, treading in the footsteps of his friend and former teacher at the University of Glasgow, Black succeeded [[William Cullen]] as Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh (Cullen had moved to Edinburgh in 1755). His position at Glasgow University was filled by [[Alexander Stevenson (physician)|Alexander Stevenson]].&lt;ref&gt;Medical and Philosophical Commentaries 1792&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point he gave up research and devoted himself exclusively to teaching. In this he was  successful with audience attendance at his lectures increasing from year to year for more than thirty years. His lectures had a powerful effect in popularising chemistry and attendance at them even came to be a fashionable amusement.

Black was widely recognised as one of the most popular lecturers at the University. His chemistry course regularly attracted an exceptionally high number of students, with many attending two or three times. In addition to regularly introducing cutting-edge topics and meticulously selecting visually impressive experiments, Black employed a wide array of successful teaching tools that made chemistry accessible to his students (many of whom were as young as 14 years old).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=How to See a Diagram: A Visual Anthropology of Chemical Affinity|journal=Osiris|date=2014|pages=178–196|doi=10.1086/678093|url=https://www.academia.edu/4588508/How_to_See_a_Diagram_A_Visual_Anthropology_of_Chemical_Affinity_Osiris_2014_178-196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='Useful Pictures: Joseph Black and the Graphic Culture of Experimentation', in Robert G.

On 17 November 1783 he became one of the founders of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From 1788 to 1790 he was President of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/library-archives/sibbald-library-blog/college-fellows-curing-scurvy-and-discovering-nitrogen|title=College Fellows: curing scurvy and discovering nitrogen|publisher= Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh|access-date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the revision committee for the editions of the college's [[Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia|Pharmacopoeia Edinburgensis]] of 1774, 1783, and 1794. Black was appointed principal physician to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in Scotland.

Black's research and teaching were reduced as a result of poor health. From 1793 his health declined further and he gradually withdrew from his teaching duties. In 1795, Charles Hope was appointed his [[coadjutor]] in his professorship, and in 1797 he lectured for the last time.

==Personal life ==
[[File:Joseph Black's grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard.jpg|thumb|Joseph Black's grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard]]
Black was a member of [[The Poker Club]] and associated with [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], and the literati of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. He was also close to pioneering geologist [[James Hutton]].

In 1773 he is listed as living on College Wynd on the south side of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office directory 1773&lt;/ref&gt;

Black never married. He died peacefully at his home in Edinburgh in 1799 at the age of 71 and is buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]. The large monument lies in the sealed section to the south-west known as the [[Covenanter's Prison]].

In 2011, scientific equipment believed to belong to Black was discovered during an archaeological dig at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/dig-finds-treasured-tools-of-leading-18th-century-scientist-1-1714838 |title=Dig finds treasured tools of leading 18th century scientist |work=The Scotsman |date=28 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418123942/http://www.scotsman.com/news/dig-finds-treasured-tools-of-leading-18th-century-scientist-1-1714838 |archivedate=18 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:joukowsky transform.svg|thumb|right|350px|Example of a Joukowsky transform. The circle above is transformed into the Joukowsky airfoil below.]]

In [[applied mathematics]], the '''Joukowsky transform''', named after [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] (who published it in 1910),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Joukowsky | first=N.E. | authorlink=Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky | title=Über die Konturen der Tragflächen der Drachenflieger | journal=Zeitschrift für Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt | year=1910 | volume=1 | pages=281–284 and (1912) '''3''': 81–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[conformal map]] historically used to understand some principles of [[airfoil]] design.

The transform is

: &lt;math&gt; z=\zeta+\frac{1}{\zeta},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; z=x+iy &lt;/math&gt; is a [[complex number|complex variable]] in the new space and &lt;math&gt; \zeta=\chi + i \eta &lt;/math&gt; is a complex variable in the original space.
This transform is also called the '''Joukowsky transformation''', the '''Joukowski transform''', the '''Zhukovsky transform''' and other variations.

In [[aerodynamics]], the transform is used to solve for the two-dimensional [[potential flow]] around a class of airfoils known as Joukowsky airfoils.  A '''Joukowsky airfoil''' is generated in the [[complex plane]] (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-plane) by applying the Joukowsky transform to a circle in the &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;-plane.  The coordinates of the centre of the circle are variables, and varying them modifies the shape of the resulting airfoil.  The circle encloses the point &lt;math&gt;\zeta=-1&lt;/math&gt; (where the derivative is zero) and intersects the point &lt;math&gt;\zeta=1.&lt;/math&gt; This can be achieved for any allowable centre position &lt;math&gt;\mu_x + i\mu_y&lt;/math&gt; by varying the radius of the circle.

Joukowsky airfoils have a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]] at their [[trailing edge]]. A closely related conformal mapping, the '''Kármán–Trefftz transform''', generates the much broader class of Kármán–Trefftz airfoils by controlling the trailing edge angle. When a trailing edge angle of zero is specified, the Kármán–Trefftz transform reduces to the Joukowsky transform.

==General Joukowsky transform==
The Joukowsky transform of any complex number &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  z &amp;= x + iy = \zeta + \frac{1}{\zeta}
\\
    &amp;= \chi + i \eta + \frac{1}{\chi + i \eta}
\\
    &amp;= \chi + i \eta + \frac{(\chi - i \eta)}{\chi^2 + \eta^2}
\\
    &amp;= \frac{\chi (\chi^2 + \eta^2 + 1)}{\chi^2 + \eta^2} + i\frac{\eta (\chi^2 + \eta^2 - 1)}{\chi^2 + \eta^2}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

So the real (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) and imaginary (&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) components are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  x &amp;= \frac{\chi (\chi^2 + \eta^2 + 1)}{\chi^2 + \eta^2},
\\
  y &amp;= \frac{\eta (\chi^2 + \eta^2 - 1)}{\chi^2 + \eta^2}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Sample Joukowsky airfoil===
The transformation of all complex numbers on the unit circle is a special case.

:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta| = \sqrt{\chi^2 + \eta^2} = 1, \quad \text{which gives} \quad \chi^2 + \eta^2 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

So the real component becomes &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\chi (1 + 1)}{1} = 2\chi&lt;/math&gt;
and the imaginary component becomes &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{\eta (1 - 1)}{1} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the complex unit circle maps to a flat plate on the real-number line from −2 to +2.

Transformation from other circles make a wide range of airfoil shapes.

==Velocity field and circulation for the Joukowsky airfoil==

The solution to [[potential flow around a circular cylinder]] is [[analytic function|analytic]] and well known.  It is the superposition of [[uniform flow]], a [[doublet (potential flow)|doublet]], and a [[vortex]].

The complex conjugate velocity &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{W}= \widetilde{u}_x - i \widetilde{u}_y,&lt;/math&gt; around the circle in the &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;-plane is

: &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{W}=V_\infty e^{-i \alpha} + \frac{i \Gamma}{2 \pi (\zeta -\mu)} - \frac{V_\infty R^2 e^{i \alpha}}{(\zeta-\mu)^2}, &lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\mu=\mu_x+i \mu_y&lt;/math&gt; is the complex coordinate of the centre of the circle
*&lt;math&gt;V_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the [[uniform flow|freestream velocity]] of the fluid
*&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angle of attack]] of the airfoil with respect to the freestream flow
*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the circle, calculated using &lt;math&gt;R=\sqrt{(1-\mu_x)^2+\mu_y^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]], found using the [[Kutta condition]], which reduces in this case to

:: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=4\pi V_\infty R \sin \left(\ \alpha + \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{\mu_y}{R} \right)\right). &lt;/math&gt;

The complex velocity &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; around the airfoil in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-plane is, according to the rules of conformal mapping and using the Joukowsky transformation:

: &lt;math&gt;W=\frac{\widetilde{W}}{\frac{dz}{d\zeta}} =\frac{\tilde{W}}{1-\frac{1}{\zeta^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;W=u_x - i u_y,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_y&lt;/math&gt; the velocity components in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; directions, respectively (&lt;math&gt;z=x+iy,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; real-valued).
From this velocity, other properties of interest of the flow, such as the [[coefficient of pressure]] and [[lift (force)|lift]] per unit of span can be calculated.

A Joukowsky airfoil has a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]] at the trailing edge.

The transformation is named after [[Russia]]n scientist [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]].  His name has historically been romanized in a number of ways, thus the variation in spelling of the transform.

[[File:Karman Trefftz transform.svg|thumb|300px|right|Example of a Kármán–Trefftz transform. The circle above in the &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;-plane is transformed into the Kármán–Trefftz airfoil below, in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-plane. The parameters used are: &lt;math&gt;\mu_x=-0.08,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mu_y=+0.08&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n=1.94.&lt;/math&gt; Note that the airfoil in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-plane has been normalised using the [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] length.]]
The '''Kármán–Trefftz transform''' is a conformal map closely related to the Joukowsky transform.  While a Joukowsky airfoil has a cusped trailing edge, a '''Kármán–Trefftz airfoil'''—which is the result of the transform of a circle in the &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;-plane to the physical &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-plane, analogue to the definition of the Joukowsky airfoil—has a non-zero angle at the trailing edge, between the upper and lower airfoil surface.  The Kármán–Trefftz transform therefore requires an additional parameter: the trailing-edge angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha.&lt;/math&gt; This transform is equal to:&lt;ref name=MT&gt;{{Cite book | first=Louis M. | last=Milne-Thomson | authorlink=L. M. Milne-Thomson | title=Theoretical aerodynamics | edition=4th | publisher=Dover Publ. | year=1973 | isbn=0-486-61980-X | pages=128–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 
  z = nb \frac{(\zeta+b)^n+(\zeta-b)^n}{(\zeta+b)^n-(\zeta-b)^n},

&lt;/math&gt;  {{pad|8em}} (A)

where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a real constant which determines the positions where &lt;math&gt;dz/d\zeta=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is slightly smaller than 2.  The angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; between the [[tangent]]s of the upper and lower airfoil surface, at the trailing edge is related to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by:&lt;ref name=MT/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 2\pi\, -\, n\pi \quad \text{ and } \quad n=2-\frac{\alpha}{\pi}.&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative &lt;math&gt;dz/d\zeta&lt;/math&gt;, required to compute the velocity field, is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{dz}{d\zeta} = \frac{4n^2}{\zeta^2-1} \frac{\left(1+\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^n \left(1-\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^n}
                                                  {\left[ \left(1+\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^n - \left(1-\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^n \right]^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Background===

First, add and subtract two from the Joukowsky transform, as given above:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  z + 2 &amp;= \zeta + 2 + \frac{1}{\zeta}\, = \frac{1}{\zeta} \left( \zeta + 1 \right)^2, \\
  z - 2 &amp;= \zeta - 2 + \frac{1}{\zeta}\, = \frac{1}{\zeta} \left( \zeta - 1 \right)^2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing the left and right hand sides gives:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{z-2}{z+2} = \left( \frac{\zeta-1}{\zeta+1} \right)^2. 
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[right hand side]] contains (as a factor) the simple second-power law from [[potential flow]] theory, applied at the trailing edge near &lt;math&gt;\zeta=+1.&lt;/math&gt; From conformal mapping theory this quadratic map is known to change a half plane in the &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;-space into potential flow around a semi-infinite straight line. Further, values of the power less than two will result in flow around a finite angle. So, by changing the power in the Joukowsky transform—to a value slightly less than two—the result is a finite angle instead of a cusp. Replacing 2 by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the previous equation gives:&lt;ref name=MT/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{z-n}{z+n} = \left( \frac{\zeta-1}{\zeta+1} \right)^n, 
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the Kármán–Trefftz transform. Solving for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; gives it in the form of equation (A).

==Symmetrical Joukowsky airfoils==
In 1943 [[Hsue-shen Tsien]] published a transform of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; into a symmetrical airfoil that depends on parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and angle of inclination &lt;math&gt;\alpha:&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Hsue-shen |last=Tsien |author-link=Hsue-shen Tsien |year=1943 |title=Symmetrical Joukowsky airfoils in shear flow |journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics |volume=1 |pages=130–248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z = e^{i \alpha} \left(\zeta - \epsilon + \frac{1}{\zeta - \epsilon} + \frac{2 \epsilon^2}{a + \epsilon}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; yields a flat plate when zero, and a circle when infinite; thus it corresponds to the thickness of the airfoil.

A '''lightsaber''' is a fictional energy sword featured in the [[Star Wars universe|''Star Wars'' universe]]. A typical lightsaber is depicted as a luminescent blade of magnetically contained plasma about {{convert|3|feet|cm}} in length emitted from a metal [[hilt]] around {{convert|10.5|inch|cm}} in length.&lt;ref name="proparchives.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proparchives.com/science-fiction/science-fiction-1970s/star-wars-a-new-hope/star-wars-a-new-hope-prop-light-sabre|via=proparchives.com|title=''Star Wars A New Hope'' prop light sabre|date=December 21, 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827103808/http://www.proparchives.com/science-fiction/science-fiction-1970s/star-wars-a-new-hope/star-wars-a-new-hope-prop-light-sabre|archive-date=August 27, 2012|dead-url=yes|accessdate=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lightsaber is the [[signature weapon]] of the [[Jedi]] Order and their [[Sith]] counterparts, both of whom can use them for [[melee combat]], or to deflect [[Blaster (Star Wars)|blaster]] bolts. Its distinct appearance was created using [[rotoscoping]] for the [[original trilogy (Star Wars)|original films]], and with [[visual effects|digital effects]] for the [[prequel trilogy (Star Wars)|prequel]] and [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel]] trilogies. The lightsaber first appeared in the original [[1977 in film|1977]] film ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'' and has since appeared in every ''Star Wars'' movie, with at least one lightsaber [[duel]] occurring in each main film installments. In 2008, a survey of approximately 2,000 film fans found it to be the most popular weapon in film history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author = Sophie Borland | title = Lightsabre wins the battle of movie weapons | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = January 21, 2008 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1576154/Lightsabre-wins-the-battle-of-movie-weapons.html | accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teHu8Njm5HE|title=Game Theory: ''Star Wars'' Lightsaber Vs ''Halo'' Energy Sword|first=|last=The Game Theorists|date=31 January 2016|publisher=|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its most prominent showing, the lightsaber's energy blade can cut, burn, and melt through most substances with little resistance. It leaves [[cauterization|cauterized]] wounds in flesh, but can be deflected by another lightsaber blade, or by [[energy shield]]s. The blade has even been used as a tool to weld metal substances. Other times, the lightsaber has been shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic saber-proof materials have been introduced in the ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Expanded Universe]]''. An active lightsaber gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. Bringing the blade into contact with another lightsaber's blade produces a loud crackle.

==Conceptual origin==
There are several literary precedents in science fiction for a "[[sword]]" of pure energy that can cut through anything, notably:[[File:Analog_magazine_cover_art_showing_a_lightsaber.jpg|thumb|upright|Gordon R.

It was reprinted in one of Donald A. Wollheim's well-known and widely read science fiction anthologies, ''Swordsmen in the Sky'', Ace Books 79276, 1964, and thus readily available to the science fiction reader community of the 1960s and 1970s.

In use the wire is unspooled to the desired length and made rigid by a "stasis field".

===Prop construction===
{{quote box | quote=Covered with millions of tiny glass beads, [Scotchlite] has the property of reflecting light directly back to its source. It's the same material used for reflective road signs [and lightsaber props]. | source=''—Special Effects: An Introduction to Movie Magic''&lt;ref name="Special Effects"/&gt;| align=right | width=25% }}
For the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' film, the [[Theatrical property|film prop]] [[hilt]]s were constructed by [[John Stears]] from old Graflex [[press camera]] [[flash (photography)|flash]] battery packs and other pieces of hardware. The full sized sword props were designed to appear ignited onscreen, by later creating an "in-camera" glowing effect in post-production. The blade is a three-sided rod which was coated with a [[Retroreflective sheeting|Scotchlite]] [[retroreflector]] array, the same sort used for [[Cat's eye (road)|highway signs]].&lt;ref name="Special Effects"&gt;{{cite book | title=Special Effects: An Introduction to Movie Magic | first=Ron | last=Miller | location=Minneapolis | publisher=Twenty-first Century Books | date=2006 | oclc=60419490 | isbn=9780761329183 | page=89 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTIMIDNIVg8C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;d | quote=...a material called Scotchlite. Covered with millions of tiny glass beads, it has the property of reflecting light directly back to its source. It's the same material used for reflective road signs (and the glowing light sabers in ''Star Wars'', which were sticks wrapped in Scotchlite).}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lamp was positioned to the side of the taking camera and reflected towards the subject through 45-degree angled glass so that the sword would appear to glow from the camera's point of view.

Set Decorator [[Roger Christian (filmmaker)|Roger Christian]] found the handles for the [[Graflex]] Flash Gun in a photography shop in [[Great Marlborough Street]], in London's [[West End of London|West End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the lightsaber was born|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio/must_see/42369174/star-wars-set-decorator-tells-how-lightsaber-was-born|accessdate=20 December 2017|publisher=BBC|date=15 December 2017|type=video interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with [[Cyanoacrylate|cyanoacrylate glue]]. Adding a few "[[greeble]]s" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. [[George Lucas]] decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where ''Star Wars'' filming began.&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Insider magazine issue No 98 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]/[[Darth Vader]] duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.

=== Visual effects ===
Korean [[animator]] [[Nelson Shin]], who was working for an American company at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a [[rotoscope]], an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look "a little shaky" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an [[optical printer]], making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a [[degaussing|degausser]] sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an [[X-Acto|X-Acto knife]] to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Interview with Nelson Shin| publisher = [[CNN]]|date = November 9, 2007 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/10/18/talkasia.nelsonshin/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
The lightsaber [[sound effect]] was developed by sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] as a combination of the hum of idling [[Movie projector#Automation and the rise of the multiplex|interlock motors]] in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless [[microphone]]. Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as he was looking for a buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum.&lt;ref name="Burttlaserdisc"&gt;{{citation|author=[[Burtt, Benn]]|title=[[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#Laserdisc editions|Star Wars Trilogy: The Definitive Collection]] |publisher=[[Lucasfilm]] |quote=...the microphone passed right behind the picture tube and as it did, this particular microphone produced an unusual hum. It picked up a transmission from the television set and a signal was induced into its sound reproducing mechanism, and that was a great buzz, actually. So I took that buzz and recorded it with the projector motor sound and that fifty-fifty kind of combination of those two sounds became the basic Lightsaber tone."|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pitch changes of lightsaber movement were produced by playing the basic lightsaber tone on a loudspeaker and recording it on a moving microphone, generating [[Doppler shift]] to mimic a moving sound source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why We Still Love Star Wars: Lightsaber 101|work=[[Parade magazine]]|date=December 3, 2017|pages=9|quote=The lightsaber wooshing sounds are created by waving a microphone in front of a speaker playing humming and buzzing noises.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction==
Lightsabers were present in the earliest drafts as mundane laser weapons that were used alongside laser guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lucas |first=George |authorlink=George Lucas|title=The Star Wars, story synopsis |date=May 1973 |quote=An alarm sounds.

An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lucas |first=George |title=[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]] |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of a lightsaber's power is a '''kyber crystal'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1601340/what-are-kyber-crystals-and-why-are-they-important-to-star-wars |title=What Are Kyber Crystals, And Why Are They Important To ''Star Wars''? |publisher=CinemaBlend |first=Eric |last=Eisenberg |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crystals are also the power source of the [[Death Star]]'s superlaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/death-star-superlaser|title=Death Star Superlaser|publisher=StarWars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/video/star-wars-the-clone-wars-story-reel-a-death-on-utapau|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Story Reel: A Death on Utapau - Star Wars: The Clone Wars|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
Lightsabers are depicted as hand-built as part of a Jedi's or Sith's training regimen. Each lightsaber is unique, though some may bear resemblance to others, especially if there is a connection between the builders. The first film appearance of the dual-bladed lightsaber (introduced in ''[[Tales of the Jedi]]'') was in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'', wielded by [[Darth Maul]]. The video game ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed|The Force Unleashed]]'' introduced two other variants: a lightsaber pike (a lightsaber with a shorter blade but a long handle, resembling a spear) and a [[Tonfa]]-style lightsaber with right-angle hilt.

The [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] adds several lightsaber types, including short&lt;ref name="KOTOR1"&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]] |developer=[[BioWare]] |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |date=November 19, 2003 |platform=PC }}&lt;/ref&gt; and dual-phase (adjustable length) weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Anderson |first=Kevin J. |authorlink=Kevin J. Anderson |title=[[Dark Apprentice]] |publisher=[[Bantam Spectra]] |series=[[The Jedi Academy Trilogy]] |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Foster |first=Alan Dean |authorlink=Alan Dean Foster |title=[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]] |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', [[Ezra Bridger]]'s original lightsaber is a hybrid that features a fully functional [[blaster pistol]] built into the handle. [[Kylo Ren]], from ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', uses a lightsaber that features two [[crossguard|crosshilt]] blades, giving it the appearance of a [[greatsword]].

Some parts of the expanded universe contain depictions of a "lightwhip", which consists of energized tendrils that can slice or grip.

===Colors===

Lightsabers depicted in the first two released films, ''A New Hope'' and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', had blades that were colored either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). [[Luke Skywalker]]'s new lightsaber in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters, but it was ultimately colored green in the film. This was done so it would better stand out against the blue sky of [[Tatooine]] in outdoor scenes, and this color change is also reflected in the film's re-release posters. [[Mace Windu]]'s purple-bladed lightsaber, as first seen in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', was requested by the actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as a way to make his character stand out among other Jedi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubyo5eZz_Jc|title=Samuel L. Jackson's Purple Light Sabre - ''The Graham Norton Show'': Series 13 Episode 13|first=|last=BBC|date=28 June 2013|publisher=[[BBC One]]|via=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's favorite color is purple, and he frequently requests that the characters he plays use an item of that color. [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|''The Clone Wars'']] showed the guardians of the Jedi Temple wielding yellow-bladed lightsabers, and introduced the "Darksaber", which uniquely features a thin white outline around a black blade.

In the storyline, the builder of a lightsaber chooses the kyber crystal within it, which in turn determines the blade's color. The book ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'' and the comic series ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith'' reveal red blades to be an exception; to create a red blade, dark side users remove the crystal from a defeated Jedi's lightsaber and concentrate force energy on it to break its connection to the light side, a process known as "bleeding". The process can also be reversed, as shown in ''Ahsoka'' when the titular character does so to a pair of crystals taken from an Inquisitor; she uses them in a pair of white-bladed lightsabers.

A multitude of [[visible spectrum]] blade colors appeared in the Expanded Universe and in other ''Star Wars'' products. The original [[Kenner Star Wars action figures|Kenner figure]] of Luke Skywalker in his Tatooine costume from ''Star Wars'' was released with a yellow-bladed lightsaber. While no lightsaber blade colors beside blue, green or red appeared in the films before ''Attack of the Clones'', they have appeared in several computer games, which sometimes allow for player-customized colors. The ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Knights of the Old Republic]]'' video game series included yellow and silver options, for example.

===Choreography===
The technical lightsaber choreography for the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy was developed by [[Hollywood]] sword-master [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]]. Anderson personally trained [[Mark Hamill]] (Luke Skywalker) and, in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', performed all the stunts as [[Darth Vader]] during the lightsaber duels wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the trilogy was highlighted in the film ''[[Reclaiming the Blade]]'' where he shared his experiences as a fencer developing the lightsaber techniques for the three original movies.

The lightsaber duels in the ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy were specifically choreographed by stunt-coordinator [[Nick Gillard]] to be miniature "stories". For these films, Gillard was the primary sword instructor for [[Liam Neeson]] ([[Qui-Gon Jinn]]), [[Ewan McGregor]] (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and [[Hayden Christensen]] (Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader) among other actors. His goal in choreographing the action for ''The Phantom Menace'' was to create stunts that flow from the story; "You can't just think, 'I'm a [[stunt coordinator]], I'm going to make a big stunt happen'," Gillard said. "It's all about making it tie in nicely with the film so that you don't notice the stunts."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In writing the prequel trilogy, George Lucas said he wanted the lightsaber combat to be "reminiscent of what had been done in the previous films but also something that was more energized. We'd seen old men, young boys, and characters who were half-droid, but we'd never seen a Jedi in his prime. I wanted to do that with a fight that was faster and more dynamic – and we were able to pull that off."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bouzereau| first = Laurent| last2 = Duncan| first2 = Jody| title = Star Wars: The Making of Episode I: The Phantom Menace| place=New York| publisher = Ballantine Publ. Group| year = 1999| edition = Hardcover| isbn =0-345-43111-1}}, page 99&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gillard (who would later go on to perform a cameo role in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/videogames/story/creating_the_lightsaber_battles_in_rots_game_91961.asp |title=Creating the Lightsaber Battles in ROTS Game |publisher=TheForce.Net |date=May 4, 2005 |accessdate=2010-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101949/http://www.theforce.net/videogames/story/creating_the_lightsaber_battles_in_rots_game_91961.asp |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), various lightsaber combat styles were devised for the prequels and intended to further [[Characterization|characterize]] their practitioners.

{{quote|I developed different styles for the characters, and gave each of them a flaw or a bonus. So with Obi-Wan Kenobi, for instance, he's got a very business-like style – when he was younger he could border on the flashy and might twirl his lightsaber a bit, because he was taught by Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon was brash, that rubbed off on Obi-Wan and Obi-Wan then taught Anakin, who was way too old to learn anyway... I think the style really worked well. The Jedi style of fighting is an amalgamation of all the great [[swordsmanship|swordfighting]] styles. Melding them together is the difficult part – to move from a [[Kendo]] style to, say, [[rapier]] requires a complete change in body and feet movement, and this must look effortless. The style moves seamlessly between the different disciplines, but remains technically correct throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desiringhayden.net/pressarchive/?p=426|title=March-Interview with stunt co-ordinator Nick Gillard (Mr. Optimism)|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For ''The Phantom Menace'', Gillard set out certain styles and faults for the saber-wielding characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/videogames/story/Nick_Gillard_Talks_ROTS_Game_92147.asp |publisher=[[TheForce.Net]] |title=Nick Gillard Talks ROTS Game |date=May 8, 2005 |accessdate=2008-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207005209/http://www.theforce.net/videogames/story/Nick_Gillard_Talks_ROTS_Game_92147.asp |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the Jedi's use of such "a short-range weapon" meant "they would have to be very good at it"; combining a variety of disciplines from various sword fighting styles to martial arts "with a touch of tennis and tree chopping", he created the style seen in the ''Episode I'' lightsaber battles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/me1/6.html Episode I Video: Prime of the Jedi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701224021/http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/bts/me1/6.html |date=2008-07-01 }} -(part of the "Making Episode I" series).&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''The Force Awakens'', director [[J. J. Abrams]] decided to approach the choreography similarly to how it was done in the original trilogy. Abrams stated that the prequel trilogy choreography was "increasingly spectacular and stylised, almost like dance choreography", but that was not what they really wanted to go for the new films.&lt;ref Name="Star Wars News Net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwarsnewsnet.com/2015/11/new-revelations-from-empires-new-issue-on-the-force-awakens.html|title=New Revelations From Empire’s New Issue on The Force Awakens|first=Viral|last=Hide|work=starwarsnewsnet.com|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine, "When you look at ''Star Wars'' and ''Empire'', they are very different lightsaber battles, but for me they felt more powerful because they were not quite as slick. I was hoping to go for something much more primitive, aggressive and rougher, a throwback to the kind of heart-stopping lightsaber fights I remembered being so enthralled by as a kid."&lt;ref name="Star Wars News Net"/&gt;

===Merchandise===
Since the release of the first film, replicas of lightsabers have been a popular piece of ''Star Wars'' merchandise, ranging from inexpensive plastic toys to the "Force FX" series from Master Replicas, deluxe replicas which use LED lighted tubes and sound effects to create a close audio-visual representation of what is seen on screen. [[Disneyland]] in California sells lightsaber-themed [[churro]]s outside its ''[[Star Tours]]'' attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/food/Star-Wars-Lightsaber-Churros-Disneyland-43518052|title=Disneyland Now Has Sparkly Lightsaber Churros, and We Need Them ASAP|first=Victoria|last=Messina|publisher=[[PopSugar]]|date=May 9, 2017|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attractions===
The ''[[Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple]]'' is a live show where children are selected to learn the teachings of the [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]], [[the Force]], and the basics of Lightsaber combat to become [[Jedi|Padawan learners]]. The show is present at the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebels]] stage at Disney's Hollywood Studios and at the [[Tomorrowland Terrace]] at Disneyland.

===Parodies===
In the ''[[Spaceballs]]'' film by [[Mel Brooks]], "the Schwartz" is a play on "[[the Force]]", from ''Star Wars''. The lightsabers emanating from the Schwartz-rings held in front of the [[crotch]] are [[phallic]] symbols.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Margolick]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/17/us/law-at-the-bar-more-lawyers-are-less-happy-at-their-work-a-survey-finds.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 "LAW: AT THE BAR; More lawyers are less happy at their work, a survey finds",] ''[[New York Times]]'', August 17, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Kaplan, [http://www.newsweek.com/id/120995 "Requiem for a law firm"], ''[[Newsweek]]'', January 7, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily Bryson York, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Writers'+rights:+L.A.+attorney+Alan+Schwartz+has+represented+Truman...-a0151055272 "Writers' rights: L.A. attorney Alan Schwartz has represented Truman Capote and Mel Brooks"], ''[[Los Angeles Business Journal]]'', August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon series ''[[Futurama]]'' features many lightsaber-style weapons, notably expanding batons used by police. The batons glow and "whoosh" with a lightsaber's distinctive hum, but merely slap victims when used, as if they are plastic toys. In Jim Butcher's ''[[The Dresden Files|Dresden Files]]'' novel series, medical examiner and ''Star Wars'' fan [[Waldo Butters]] wields one of the three holy Swords of the Cross, which re-fashions itself into a lightsaber upon accepting him as its owner.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Games===
With the advent of [[motion controller|motion-controlled]] [[video games]], the opportunity to physically wield a lightsaber in a video game became a reality. In the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], there were several [[Star Wars video games|''Star Wars'' video games]] available on the [[Wii]] (''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Lightsaber Duels]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]'') and one on the [[Xbox 360]] (''[[Kinect Star Wars]]'') that utilized motion controls to wield a lightsaber through arm gestures. ''Unleashed'' and ''Duels'', both developed by [[Krome Studios]], have more precise control of the lightsaber, allowing players to swing it in any of five different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the [[Wii Remote]], while ''Kinect'' takes advantage of [[Kinect#Kinect for Xbox 360 (2010)|the eponymous, camera-based motion controller]] to grant the player a more fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the lightsaber.  

Prior to the seventh generation, there were also a few earlier ''Star Wars'' games that used gesture-based control to simulate lightsaber combat, such as the two bonus levels of the [[arcade game]] ''[[Star Wars Trilogy Arcade|Star Wars Trilogy]]'', where the player controls Luke Skywalker as he wields his lightsaber against [[Boba Fett]] and Darth Vader in ''Return of the Jedi'' by pushing a joystick in one of eight directions to follow on-screen offensive and defensive cues,&lt;ref name="SWTA overview at AllGame"&gt;{{allgame | 15820 | first=Christopher Michael | last=Baker | accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[TV game]] released around the release of ''Revenge of the Sith'', titled ''Star Wars: Saga Edition - Lightsaber Battle Game'', in which the player swings a lightsaber-shaped controller to deflect blaster bolts from infantry (such as [[battle droids]] and [[clone troopers]]) and duel against characters from across the saga.

By the time [[Disney]] purchased Lucasfilm, new technological advances made [[augmented reality]] possible, leading to the creation of some more notable motion-controlled lightsaber video games that took advantage of that feature. One of them came in the form of a special activity mode in the official ''Star Wars'' fan app on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in which players use their smartphone's motion sensors to practice and master blaster deflection with a training droid (which appears on the phone's rear camera), similar to the deflection training exercises featured aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' in ''A New Hope'', while progressing through the ranks of the Jedi or Sith order. Another is in ''Star Wars: Jedi Challenges'', which works with a Lenovo Mirage AR headset, a tracking sensor and a dedicated lightsaber controller that launched in December 2017. One of the multiple game modes available in ''Challenges'', which was jointly developed by Disney and [[Lenovo]], enables players to confront ''Star Wars'' villains in lightsaber duels, such as Darth Maul and Kylo Ren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/31/star-wars-jedi-challenges-augmented-reality-game-launches-with-lenovo-mirage-headset.html|title=Lenovo, Disney launch ''Star Wars'' Jedi aurgmented reality game that lets you use a real lightsaber|first=Arjun|last=Kharpal|date=August 31, 2017|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Long ton''',&lt;ref name=USseaLift&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/glossary.htm |title=Definitions, Tonnages and Equivalents |work=Military Sealift Fleet Support Command Ships |accessdate=11 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525000000/http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/glossary.htm |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''imperial ton''' or '''displacement ton''',&lt;ref name=USseaLift/&gt;&lt;ref name = DicDotCom&gt;Dictionary.com - ''"a unit for measuring the displacement of a vessel, equal to a long ton of 2240 pounds (1016 kg) or 35 cu. ft. (1 cu. m) of seawater."''&lt;/ref&gt; is the name for the unit called the "[[ton]]" in the [[avoirdupois]] system of weights or [[Imperial unit|Imperial]] system of measurements. It was standardised in the thirteenth century and is used in the [[United Kingdom]] and several other [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth of Nations]] countries alongside the [[mass]]-based [[International System of Units|metric]] [[tonne]] defined in 1799.

It is not to be confused with the ''[[short ton]]'' a unit of weight equal to {{convert|2000|lb|kg|5|lk=on}} used in the United States, and in Canada before [[metrication]], also referred to simply as a "ton".

==Unit definition==
A long ton is defined as exactly 2,240 pounds. The long ton arises from the traditional British measurement system: A long ton is 20 [[hundredweight]] (cwt), each of which is 8 [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (1 stone = 14 pounds). Thus a long ton is 20 × 8 × 14&amp;nbsp;lb = 2,240&amp;nbsp;lb.

==Unit equivalences==

A long ton, also called the '''''weight ton''' (W/T)'',&lt;ref name=USseaLift/&gt; '''''imperial ton,''''' or '''''displacement ton,''''' is equal to:
* {{convert|2240|lb|kg|sigfig=4|disp=or}} or {{convert|2240|lb|MT|sigfig=4|disp=output only|abbr=off}}
* 12% more than the 2,000 pounds of the North American [[short ton]]
* the weight of {{convert|35|ft3}} of salt water with a density of {{convert|64|lb/ft3}}&lt;ref name=USseaLift/&gt;

It has some limited use in the United States, most commonly in measuring the [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] of [[ship]]s, the volume-to-carrying-weight of fuels and in trade of [[wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bale]]d commodities&lt;ref name=USseaLift/&gt; and bulk goods like elemental [[sulfur]]. The long ton was the unit prescribed for [[warship]]s by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922—for example [[battleship]]s were limited to a displacement of {{convert|35000|LT|t ST}}.

To comply with the practices of the European Union, the British Imperial ton was explicitly excluded from use for trade by the United Kingdom's [[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures Act]] of 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/72/contents legislation.gov.uk: Weights and Measures Act 1985] Retrieved 17 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Weights, Measures, and Units, edited by Donald Fenna, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ponds on the Ocean, ICESCAPE.jpg|thumb|300px|right|As ice melts, the liquid water collects in depressions on the surface and deepens them, forming these melt ponds in the [[Arctic]]. These fresh water ponds are separated from the salty sea below and around it, until breaks in the ice merge the two.]]

'''Melt ponds''' are pools of open water that form on [[sea ice]] in the warmer months of spring and summer.  The ponds are also found on [[glacier|glacial]] ice and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]].  Ponds of melted water can also develop under the ice.

Melt ponds are usually darker than the surrounding ice, and their distribution and size is highly variable.  They absorb [[solar radiation]] rather than reflecting it as ice does and, thereby, have a significant influence on [[Earth's radiation balance]].  This differential, which had not been scientifically investigated until recently, has a large effect on the rate of ice melting and the extent of ice cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientists use Satellite to "Pond-er" Melted Arctic Ice |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=2 October 2003 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0918meltwater.html |accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melt ponds can melt through to the ocean's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crrel.usace.army.mil/sid/perovich/SHEBAice/meltpond.htm |title=Melt ponds |work= |accessdate=1 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817050130/http://www.crrel.usace.army.mil/sid/perovich/SHEBAice/meltpond.htm |archivedate=17 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seawater]] entering the pond increases the melt rate because the salty water of the ocean is warmer than the fresh water of the pond. The increase in salinity also depresses the water's [[freezing point]].

Water from melt ponds over land surface can run into [[crevasse]]s or [[Moulin (geology)|moulins]] – tubes leading under ice sheets or glaciers – turning into [[meltwater]]. The water may reach the underlying rock. The effect is an increase in the rate of ice flow to the oceans, as the fluid behaves like a [[lubricant]] in the [[basal sliding]] of glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17607 |title=Melt Ponds on Greenland's Ice Cap |work= |accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of melt ponds==
{{see also|Glacial motion}}

The effects of melt ponds are diverse (this subsection refers to melt ponds on ice sheets and ice shelves). Research by Ted Scambos, of the [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]], has supported the melt water fracturing theory that suggests the melting process associated with melt ponds has a substantial effect on [[Ice shelf#Ice shelf disruption|ice shelf disintegration]].

"Quakes ranged from six to 15 per year from 1993 to 2002, then jumped to 20 in 2003, 23 in 2004, and 32 in the first 10 months of 2005."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8889.html Glacial earthquakes rock Greenland ice sheet] 12:36 24 March 2006, NewScientist.com news service&lt;/ref&gt; Ponding in the extreme is lakes and lakes in association with glaciers are examined in the particular case of the [[Missoula Floods]].

'''''Money For Nothing''''' is a British television programme hosted by Sarah Moore, Jay Blades and Ethan-James Osborne that airs on [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvkev.co.uk/content/money-nothing-show-was-unsalvageable|title=Money For Nothing: this show was unsalvageable|author=Kevin O'Sullivan|publisher= tvkev.co.uk|date=20 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903073829/http://www.tvkev.co.uk/content/money-nothing-show-was-unsalvageable|archivedate = 3 September 2017|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077nzdc|title=Money for Nothing - BBC One|website=BBC|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The premise of the programme is to take items that other people have disposed of and which the presenter rescues from council refuse collection sites. With the help of a designer they are turned into desirable items, which are then sold. Any profit made is then returned to the individual(s) who disposed of the item originally. The show voice-over is provided by comedian and writer [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]]. ''Celebrity Money for Nothing'' is a related program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frielkeanfilms.com/?page=productions/celebrity-money-for-nothing|title=Celebrity Money for Nothing|website=Friel Kean Films|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular designers and craftspeople include: Norman Wilkinson, Rupert Blanchard, Forge Creative (Josh Kennard &amp; Oliver "Oli" Milne), Sarah Peterson, Neil Wragg, Ray Clarke, Daniel Health, Mark 'Horse' Philips, Bex Simon, The Rag and Bone Man, Guy Trench.

The '''November 2012 nor'easter''' was a powerful [[nor'easter]] that brought significant early season snow to the [[Northeastern United States]]. Many of the areas hit by the storm had been affected by [[Hurricane Sandy]] days before, which further complicated recovery efforts.

==Meteorological history==
A mid-level [[Shortwave (meteorology)|shortwave]] over the [[Midwestern United States]] was moving eastward on November&amp;nbsp;6, just four days after [[Hurricane Sandy]] dissipated, toward a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] over the [[Southeastern United States]], and into an area with abundant moisture and favorable conditions from the [[jet stream]]. The combination was favorable for a [[nor'easter]] to form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Krekeler |agency=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center |date=November 6, 2012 |title=Short Range Forecast Discussion |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C0oC5ZLJ?url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd&amp;version=3&amp;fmt=reg |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November&amp;nbsp;7, a strong [[low pressure area]] developed along the coast of [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Kong |agency=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center |date=November 7, 2012 |title=Short Range Forecast Discussion |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C0nX3BcX?url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, there was an area of cold air inland the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] and [[New England]] that would allow the precipitation to fall as snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Otto |agency=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center |date=November 7, 2012 |title=Short Range Forecast Discussion |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C0noo5lG?url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd&amp;version=2&amp;fmt=reg |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By November&amp;nbsp;8, the system drifting to the northeast, located about {{convert|90|mi|km|abbr=on}} south-southeast of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], with a front extending northeastward to Nova Scotia. Its large circulation dropped rain and snow across the northeastern United States.&lt;ref name="hpc1"&gt;{{cite report|author=Krekeler |date=November 8, 2012 |title=Storm Summary Number 1 for Early Season Nor'easter |publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/storm7/stormsum_1.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C1o51YlE?url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some areas within NYC, got close to a foot of snow across Western Long Island, including Eastern Queens County in a narrow snow band that set up because of the coastal front. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NYC Area Weather |date=November 8, 2012 |title=November 7, 2012 storm summary |url=http://www.nycareaweather.com/2012/11/nov-7-2012-storm-summary/ |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Before the nor'easter struck, officials recommended residents in low-lying areas of New York City to evacuate,&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt; and portions of [[Islip, New York]] were under a mandatory evacuation.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt; There were also voluntary evacuations in [[Milford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Singer|date=November 7, 2012|title=Nor'easter brings new snow, wind to Conn.|newspaper=Boston Globe|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url=http://www.boston.com/news/weather/2012/11/07/nor-easter-brings-new-snow-wind-conn/aG6OGdqwDCcnsaXMOc2PjL/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the [[Long Island Expressway]] was closed during the storm, and the [[Long Island Rail Road]] shut down. Airlines canceled over 1,300&amp;nbsp;flights in or out of New York airports. Parks in New York City were closed, and construction was halted.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |publisher=Fox News |date=November 7, 2012 |title=Nor'easter bears down on Sandy-battered NYC and New Jersey |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/weather/2012/11/07/sandy-battered-nyc-and-nj-prepare-for-noreaster/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C0meN5qP?url=http://www.foxnews.com/weather/2012/11/07/sandy-battered-nyc-and-nj-prepare-for-noreaster/ |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nassau County, New York]], more than 140&amp;nbsp;trucks put sand and salt on roads.&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite news|author=William Murphy|author2=Ellen Yan|date=November 7, 2012|title=Nor'easter wreaks havoc on LI roads, rails|publisher=News Day|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/weather/nor-easter-wreaks-havoc-on-li-roads-rails-1.4197141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools were closed in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="boston"/&gt; Due to sufficiently cool air and steady snowfall, the [[National Weather Service]] issued a winter storm warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |agency=Mount Holly, New Jersey National Weather Service |date=November 7, 2012 |title=Area Forecast Discussion |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |url=http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C0oZEfT4?url=http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=PHI&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=9&amp;glossary=0&amp;highlight=off |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:November 2012 nor'easter, Ashford, CT.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Snowfall during the November 2012 nor'easter in [[Ashford, Connecticut]]]]
Across New Jersey and New York, the storm dropped rain and snow in areas that sustained significant damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]] about ten days prior.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt; Snowfall spread from New Jersey to Maine, peaking at {{convert|13.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} in [[Clintonville, Connecticut]], and the highest associated rainfall total was {{convert|2.28|in|cm|abbr=on}} near [[Kingston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="hpc1"/&gt; Snowfall in [[Central Park]] reached {{convert|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="hpc1"/&gt; which broke the daily record and also the record for the earliest date of more than {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} at the location. Daily snowfall records were also broken in [[Newark, New Jersey]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] with totals of {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite news |author=Miguel Llanos |author2=Ian Johnston |newspaper=NBC News |date=November 8, 2012 |title=Record snow, new power outages as storm slams Northeast |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/08/15016190-record-snow-new-power-outages-as-storm-slams-northeast?lite&amp; |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C1q0sXJM?url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/08/15016190-record-snow-new-power-outages-as-storm-slams-northeast?lite&amp; |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nor'easter also produced strong winds that peaked at {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="hpc1"/&gt; High winds downed trees that were weakened by Sandy, some of which fell onto power lines. About 50,000&amp;nbsp;people lost power in the two states who had previously lost power after the hurricane. Along the coast, the storm produced {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} waves,&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt; and coastal roads were flooded.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt; There were two traffic deaths in Connecticut that were related to the storm.&lt;ref name="boston"/&gt;

On November 8 as of 9 a.m. EST, around 715,000 eastern U.S. homes and businesses were without power. This is an increase of nearly 43,000 from 12 hours earlier, due the effects of the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some 715,000 without power Thurs after nor'easter, Sandy: Government|url=https://news.yahoo.com/715-000-without-power-thurs-noreaster-sandy-government-154706691.html|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 167,000&amp;nbsp;power outages in New Jersey alone, and at least 50,000 on Long Island.&lt;ref name="nbc"/&gt;

At 6 a.m. EST on November 9, about 265,000 New Jersey homes and businesses were without power because of Sandy and the nor'easter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power outages continue to plague N.J. in wake of Sandy, nor'easter|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/power_outages_continue_to_plag.html|publisher=NJ1|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Winter storm naming in the United States}}

[[The Weather Channel]] dubbed this storm as "''Winter Storm Athena''," but this name was rejected by the [[National Weather Service]].&lt;ref name="just say no"&gt;{{cite news|title=National Weather Service: Just say no to Athena|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/national-weather-service-just-say-no-to-athena/2012/11/07/2eee7154-28e8-11e2-bab2-eda299503684_blog.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=November 7, 2012 |first=Jason|last=Samenow|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the naming system, the [[National Weather Service]] announced on November 7, 2012 that it would not recognize the Weather Channel's names for winter storms, stating in a press release that "it does not use the name of winter storms in its products."&lt;ref name="just say no"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weather Channel names nor'easter, National Weather Service says not so fast |url=http://www.foxnews.com/weather/2012/11/07/weather-channel-names-noreaster-national-weather-service-says-not-so-fast/|publisher=FNC|accessdate=November 7, 2012|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winter Storm Athena Forecast Impacts|url=http://www.weather.com/news/weather-winter/noreaster-post-sandy-20121105|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''orphan source''' is a self-contained [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] source that is no longer under proper regulatory control.

The United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] defines an orphan source more exactly as:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/materials/miau/miau-reg-initiatives/orphan.html |title=NRC: Orphan Sources |publisher=Nrc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a sealed source of radioactive material contained in a small volume—but not radioactively contaminated soils and bulk metals—in any one or more of the following conditions

*In an uncontrolled condition that requires removal to protect public health and safety from a radiological threat
*Controlled or uncontrolled, but for which a responsible party cannot be readily identified
*Controlled, but the material's continued security cannot be assured. If held by a licensee, the licensee has few or no options for, or is incapable of providing for, the safe disposition of the material
*In the possession of a person, not licensed to possess the material, who did not seek to possess the material
*In the possession of a State radiological protection program for the sole purpose of mitigating a radiological threat because the orphan source is in one of the conditions described in one of the first four bullets and for which the State does not have a means to provide for the material's appropriate disposition&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Orphan source incidents==
Most known orphan sources were, generally, small radioactive sources produced legitimately under governmental regulation and put into service for [[radiography]], generating electricity in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, medical [[radiotherapy]] or [[irradiation]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} These sources were then "abandoned, lost, misplaced or stolen" and so no longer subject to proper regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irlgov.ie/committees-29/c-environment/20030923-J/Page1.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041001154250/http://www.irlgov.ie/committees-29/c-environment/20030923-J/Page1.htm |date=October 1, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in different incidents, various orphan sources have been:
* 1984 - [[Morocco]] - A source was lost during radiography and taken home by other people who initially failed to recognize the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1984MOR1.html |title=Casablanca orphaned source, 1984 |publisher=Johnstonsarchive.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1987 - Praça Cívica, Brazil - A caesium-137 based teletherapy unit left behind at Goiânia’s Instituto Goiano de Radioterapia (IGR)[3]. This is one of the most disastrous orphan source incidents, the event is known as the [[Goiânia accident]].
* 1996 - [[Gilan]], Iran - A source was temporarily lost during radiography at a power plant and found by an unsuspecting worker who put the source in his chest pocket for about 90 minutes. 1 person was severely injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1996IRAN1.html |title=Gilan orphaned source, 1996 |publisher=Johnstonsarchive.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997 - [[Tbilisi]], Georgia -  The Lilo Training Center had multiple sources dating back to Soviet era military activity; 11 were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1997GEO1.html |title=Lilo orphaned sources, 1996-1997 |publisher=Johnstonsarchive.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1999 - [[Kingisepp]], [[Leningrad Oblast]], Russia - Stolen from an [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator|RTG]] in a Russian lighthouse and then recovered 50 kilometres away at a bus station &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1999RUS2.html |title=Kingisepp orphaned source, 1999 |publisher=Johnstonsarchive.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1999 - [[Istanbul]], Turkey -  A source was sold to a junkyard for its [[lead]] container in the city of İkitelli &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/1999/01/09/haber/hab00a.html |title=Nükleer ihmal |publisher=Milliyet.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2000 - Thailand - A defunct [[cobalt therapy]] machine was sold to a metal junkyard in [[Samut Prakan radiation accident|Samut Prakan]], leading to three deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull47-2/47202006163.pdf |title=IAEA Bulletin Volume 47, No.2 - Reducing the Risk from Radioactive Sources |publisher=Iaea.org |date= |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2000 - [[Egypt]] - A source was taken home by an unsuspecting person near [[Mit Halfa]], 15&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Cairo]] [[Qalyubia Governorate|Qaluobiya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/2000EGY1.html |title=Meet Halfa orphaned source, 2000 |publisher=Johnstonsarchive.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2001 - [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] - Three woodcutters in northern Georgia found two Soviet-era [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator|RTG elements]] near the [[Inguri River]] containing [[Strontium-90]] and became sick from the high levels of radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-hunt-for-hot-stuff-76764125/?all |title=The Hunt for Hot Stuff |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=March 2003 |accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 300 orphan sources had been discovered in the country by 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/radioactive-sources-recovered-georgia |title=Radioactive Sources Recovered in Georgia |publisher=IAEA.org |date=2006-07-27 |accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a team from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] and Georgian government found two containing Caesium-137 in the Racha region. One of the sources had been kept in a home, and another in an abandoned factory used as storage by farmers. 
* 2008 - [[Karachi]], Pakistan - An orphan source was discovered within the vicinity of the OGDCL (Oil &amp; Gas Development Company Limited). Two containers were found buried which were suspected to be left over from Soviet oil drilling operations before the OGDCL took over in late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baqir Sajjad Syed |url=http://www.dawn.com/2008/07/11/top7.htm |title=Containers found with radioactive material |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission''' ('''PAEC'''; [[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|ادارہ جوہری توانائی پاکستان}}) is an [[:Category:Pakistan federal departments and agencies|independent]] [[Government of Pakistan|governmental authority]] and a [[Science and technology in Pakistan|scientific]] research institution, concerned with research and development of [[nuclear power]], promotion of [[Atomic physics|nuclear science]], [[energy conservation]] and the peaceful usage of [[nuclear technology]].&lt;ref name="IAEA publications, PAEC direct"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tahir|first1=Abdul Ghaffar|title=IAEA presentation on nuclear power by PAEC|url=http://www.iaea.org/NuclearPower/Downloadable/Meetings/2013/2013-10-01-10-04-TM-NPE/2.3.pakistan.pdf|publisher=IAEA publications, PAEC direct|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australian Safeguards Office"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ASO|title=Nuclear Power in Pakistan|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-O-S/Pakistan/|publisher=Australian Safeguards Office|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its establishment in 1956, the PAEC has overseen the extensive development of nuclear infrastructure to support the economical uplift of Pakistan by founding institutions that focus on development on [[food irradiation]] and on [[Nuclear medicine in Pakistan|nuclear medicine]] radiation therapy for [[cancer]] treatment.&lt;ref name="PAEC Medical DIvision"&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff|title=Biomedical engineering at PAEC|url=http://www.paec.gov.pk/Medical/|publisher=PAEC Medical DIvision|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PAEC BIO Division"&gt;{{cite web|last1=et. al. staff developer|title=Agriculture and Biotechnology|url=http://www.paec.gov.pk/Agriculture/|publisher=PAEC BIO Division|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PAEC organizes conferences and directs research at the country's leading universities.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission "&gt;{{cite web

===Early history===
{{Main article|Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Project-706|Chagai-I|Chagai-II}}
[[File:Chaghi Monument.JPG|thumbnail|Chaghi Monument, Islamabad Pakistan]]
Following the [[Partition of India|partition]] of [[British Indian Empire]] by the United Kingdom in 1947, Pakistan emerged as a Muslim-dominated state.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications Co."/&gt; The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|turbulent]] nature of its emergence critically influenced the scientific development of the country.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications Co."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chakma|first1=Bhumitra|title=Pakistan's nuclear weapons|date=2009|publisher=Routledge Publications Co.|location=New York, [u.s.a]|isbn=1134132549|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTbOO0gVgR0C&amp;pg=PA11 |accessdate=5 November 2014|language=|format=google books|chapter=Phase I: 1954-71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the [[Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (PCSIR) in 1951 began Pakistan's research on physical sciences.&lt;ref name="Croom Helm"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kapur|first1=Ashok|title=Pakistan's nuclear development|date=1987|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|isbn=0709931018|pages=258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtMNAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Pakistan%27s+Nuclear+Development+ashol&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3OhZVPq6I8SbigKG4IGwCg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1953, U.S. President [[Dwight D.

===Studies on expansion of nuclear power===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in Pakistan}}

As of current, the PAEC is held responsible for design preparation and proper operational function of the commercial [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear power plants]]. The PAEC provides lobby at the governmental level for the safe usage of the nuclear power sources; though the [[Nuclear safety and security|safety regulations]] and protections of the nuclear power facilities are managed by the [[Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority|Nuclear Regulatory Authority]] (PNRA). Providing the policy guidance to the government, PAEC's studies envisions setting up power plants energy production with a capacity of ~8800[[Megawatt|MW]] by 2030.&lt;ref name="The Nation, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=APP|title=PAEC to produce 8800MW by 2030|url=http://nation.com.pk/business/24-Jan-2013/paec-to-produce-8800mw-by-2030|accessdate=7 November 2014|agency=The Nation|publisher=The Nation, 2013|date=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pyrrhulina''''' is a genus of freshwater fishes found in [[tropical]] [[South America]]. Several of these species are popular [[aquarium]] fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = [[Günther Sterba]] | encyclopedia = The Aquarist's Encyclopaedia |title= Pyrrhulina |year= 1983 |publisher= Edition Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pyrrhulina'' is closely related to ''[[Copeina]]'' and ''[[Copella (genus)|Copella]]'', although it is distinguished from the former by having only one row of teeth (''Copeina'' spp. have two). When the genus ''Copella'' was established, many species were removed from the genus ''Pyrrhulina'' and placed there, because differences in the [[Maxilla#In other animals|maxillary bones]] in the males had been detected. ''Copella'' species are slimmer and more elongated than those species that remained in the genus ''Pyrrhulina''.

Tillerson's tenure as Secretary of State lasted 405 days, one of the [[List of United States Secretaries of State#List of Secretaries of State by time in office|shortest tenures in modern history]]. Tillerson is the shortest-serving Secretary since [[Lawrence Eagleburger]], who served during the last month of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]]'s term. Excluding Secretaries whose tenures were ended by the arrival of a new presidential administration, Tillerson is the shortest-serving Secretary since 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/13/rex-tillerson-outlasted-15-other-secretaries-of-state-but-only-one-who-left-under-duress/|title=Rex Tillerson outlasted 15 other secretaries of state — but only one who left under duress|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=March 13, 2018|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to long-time diplomat [[Aaron David Miller]], Tillerson is also the only Secretary of State since at least 1945 to have been fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/13/opinions/tillerson-firing-makes-head-explode-opinion-miller/index.html|title=Longtime diplomat: Tillerson's public firing makes my head explode|last=Miller|first=Aaron David|publisher=CNN|date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, ''Politico'' reported that Tillerson's major foreign policy positions include "urging the United States to stay in the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] and the [[Paris Agreement|Paris climate accord]], taking a hard line on Russia, advocating negotiations and dialogue to defuse the mounting crisis with North Korea, advocating for continued U.S. adherence to the [[Iran nuclear deal framework|Iran nuclear deal]], taking a neutral position in [[Qatar–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict|the dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia]], and reassuring jittery allies, from South Korea and Japan to our NATO partners, that America still has their back".&lt;ref&gt;Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky, "Should Rex Tillerson Resign?", [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/01/should-rex-tillerson-resign-215664 ''Politico''  October 1, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia and Saudi Arabia ===
In 2014, Tillerson expressed opposition to the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] in response to the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] at an Exxon shareholder meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/586ae5c0-487c-11e4-ad19-00144feab7de|title=Subscribe to read|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the meeting "We do not support sanctions, generally, because we don't find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensively and that's a very hard thing to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2016/12/06/exxon-ceo-tillerson-secretary-of-state.html|title=How Exxon CEO Tillerson feels about sanctions (and other Secretary-related matters)|publisher=Biz Journals|date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Tillerson said that the US should have deployed military units to neighboring states next to Russia in a more "muscular" response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Lee |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-friend-sanctions-foe-tillerson-gets-hearing-081213134--election.html |title=Trump's pick for top diplomat takes tough line on Moscow|work=Yahoo|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/11/rex-tillerson-us-response-russia-crimea-seizure-wa/ |title=Rex Tillerson: U.S. response to Russia Crimea seizure was 'weak'|work=Washington Times |date=January 11, 2017|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Tillerson said that Russia's annexation of Crimea was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/11/rex-tillerson-us-response-russia-crimea-seizure-wa/ Rex Tillerson takes tough line on Russian hacking in tense hearing]".

During his Secretary of State confirmation hearings, [[Marco Rubio]] asked Tillerson if he would label [[Saudi Arabia]] as a "human rights violator". Tillerson declined to do so, saying: "When you designate someone or label someone, is that the most effective way to have progress be able to be made in Saudi Arabia or any other country?"&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/live-updates/trump-white-house/confirmation-hearings-trump-speaks-and-vote-a-rama-analysis-and-updates/tillerson-saudi-arabia-isnt-a-human-rights-violator/ Tillerson won't label Saudi Arabia a human rights violator]".

''The Intercept''. January 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate change and carbon tax ===
Tillerson announced in 2009 that ExxonMobil favored a [[carbon tax]] as "the most efficient means of [[Carbon pricing|reflecting the cost of carbon]] in all economic decisions—from investments made by companies to fuel their requirements to the product choices made by consumers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energyfactor.exxonmobil.com/corporate-citizenship-sustainability/exxonmobil-and-the-carbon-tax|title=ExxonMobil and the carbon tax|publisher=ExxonMobil.com|date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, less than two months before his nomination as Secretary of State, he reaffirmed that ExxonMobil believed a carbon tax would be "the best policy of those being considered. Replacing the hodge-podge of current, largely ineffective regulations with a revenue-neutral carbon tax would ensure a uniform and predictable cost of carbon across the economy ... allow market forces to drive solutions ... maximize transparency, reduce administrative complexity, promote global participation and easily adjust" to new knowledge in climate science and in the policy consequences of various courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |title=The Path Forward in Today's Energy Environment |first=Rex |last=Tillerson |event=37th Annual Oil and Money Conference |location=London, England |date=October 19, 2016 |url=http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/news-and-updates/speeches/the-path-forward-in-todays-energy-environment |access-date=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''The New York Times'' suggested that ExxonMobil's embrace of a carbon tax in October 2009 may have simply been an effort to avoid [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] legislation that was then being considered by the U.S. Congress as an alternative method of [[carbon pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=John |title=Tillerson Led Exxon's Shift on Climate Change; Some Say 'It Was All P.R.' |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 28, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/business/energy-environment/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-exxon.html?_r=0 |access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Time'' magazine article in December 2016 asserted that since Tillerson announced his company's preference for a carbon tax, ExxonMobil "has not made a carbon tax a focus of its massive lobbying efforts and has supported a number of candidates and organizations that oppose measures to tackle the [climate change] issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Worland |first=Justin |title=What Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State Would Mean for Climate Change |newspaper=Time |date=December 14, 2016 |url=http://time.com/4598499/rex-tillerson-donald-trump-exxon-mobil-climate-change/?xid=homepage |access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Tillerson said that while he acknowledged that humans were affecting the climate through greenhouse gas emissions to some degree, it was not yet clear "to what extent and therefore what can you do about it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg76003/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg76003.pdf|title=THE EXXONMOBIL-XTO MERGER: IMPACT ON U.S. ENERGY MARKETS |publisher=Gpo.gov |accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|date=August 19, 2016|title=Exxon Mobil Fraud Inquiry Said to Focus More on Future Than Past|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/science/exxon-mobil-fraud-inquiry-said-to-focus-more-on-future-than-past.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Tillerson stated, "The world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schlanger|first=Zoe|title=Is Exxon Waiting for the Paris Climate Agreement to Fail?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/exxon-shareholders-climate-change-paris-agreement-463592|newspaper=[[Newsweek]]|date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) ===
[[File:President Xi Jinping Greets Secretary Tillerson (33139050550).jpg|thumb|Tillerson with [[China]]'s President [[Xi Jinping]] before their meeting in Beijing, March 19, 2017]]
In 2013, Tillerson outlined his support for the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP), stating at the Global Security Forum: "One of the most promising developments on this front is the ongoing effort for the Trans-Pacific Partnership ... The 11 nations that have been working to lower trade barriers and end protectionist policies under this partnership are a diverse mix of developed and developing economies. But all of them understand the value of open markets to growth and progress for every nation."&lt;ref&gt;Betsy Woodruff, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/12/12/trump-s-sec-of-state-favorite-rex-tillerson-praised-tpp.html "Trump's Secretary of State Favorite Rex Tillerson Praised TPP"], December 12, 2016, ''The Daily Beast''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free trade ===
Speaking in March 2007 at a [[Council on Foreign Relations]] event, Tillerson said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Should the United States seek so-called energy independence in an elusive effort to insulate this country from the impact of world events on the economy, or should Americans pursue the path of international engagement, seeking ways to better compete within the global market for energy? Like [[Members of the Council on Foreign Relations#Notable historical members|the Council's founders]], I believe we must choose the course of greater international engagement&amp;nbsp;... The central reality is this: The global free market for energy provides the most effective means of achieving U.S. energy security by promoting resource development, enabling diversification, multiplying our supply channels, encouraging efficiency, and spurring innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Denning|first=Liam|title=Mr. Exxon Goes to Washington (Maybe)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-12-07/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-what-it-would-mean|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Government regulation ===
In 2012 in an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Tillerson expressed his impatience with government regulation, stating "there are a thousand ways you can be told 'no' in this country."&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite news|last=Coll|first=Steve|title=Gusher: The Power of ExxonMobil|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/09/gusher|work=The New Yorker|date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
In September 2013, Tillerson wrote an [[op-ed]] piece in ''The Wall Street Journal'' defending [[Common Core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tillerson|first=Rex|title=How to Stop the Drop in American Education|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324747104579024892381188288|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republican campaign fundraising and donations ===
According to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], Tillerson has made tens of thousands of dollars of political donations to Republican groups and candidates.&lt;ref name="ssnbc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Andrea|title=Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil Expected to Be Named Trump's Secretary of State: Sources|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/rex-tillerson-exxon-mobile-expected-be-named-trump-s-secretary-n694371?cid=eml_nbn_20161210|publisher=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=December 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FEC records, he gave a total of $468,970 in contributions to Republican candidates and committees from 2000 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rex Tillerson Political Campaign Contributions|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/rex-tillerson.asp?cycle=16|website=Campaign Money|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samsung Heavy Industries''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 삼성중공업) is one of the largest [[shipbuilder]]s in the world and one of the "Big Three" shipbuilders of South Korea (including [[Hyundai Heavy Industries|Hyundai]] and [[Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering|Daewoo]]). Goeje (in [[Gyeongsangnam-do]]) is one  of the largest shipyards in the world, having 3 dry docks, and 5 floating docks. A core subsidiary of the [[Samsung Group]], South Korea's largest [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], SHI's main focus is on the engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning and the delivery of: transportation ships for the commercial industry, topsides modules, drilling and floating production units for the oil and gas sector, [[gantry crane]]s for fabrication yards, digital instrumentaton and control devices for ships, and other construction and engineering services.

SHI operates manufacturing facilities at home and abroad, including ship block fabrication factories in [[Ningbo]] and [[Rongcheng, Shandong|Rongcheng]], China. The Geoje Shipyard in particular, SHI's largest shipyard in South Korea, boasts the highest dock turnover rate in the world. The largest of the three docks, Dock No. 3, is {{convert|640|m|ft}} long, {{convert|97.5|m|ft}} wide, and {{convert|13|m|ft}} deep. Mostly ultra-large ships are built at this dock, having the world's highest production efficiency with yearly dock turnover rate of 10 and the launch of 30 ships per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shi.samsung.co.kr/eng/company/06_01.asp|title=::: Samsung Heavy Industries :::|website=www.shi.samsung.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SHI specializes in the building of high added-value and special purpose vessels, including [[LNG]] carriers, off-shore related vessels, oil drilling ships, FPSO/FSO's, ultra Large container ships and Arctic shuttle tankers. In recent times SHI has concentrated on LNG tankers and drillships.

== History ==
Samsung Heavy Industries was established in 1974, when the company's Changwon plant was opened. SHI soon purchased Woojin, followed by the construction of Geoje shipbuilding facilities and merger with Daesung Heavy Industries.

Samsung Shipbuilding and Daesung Heavy Industries were merged under Samsung Heavy Industries in 1983. Since then, it has put efforts in the introduction of new technologies and development of products, while expanding the business area into heavy equipment and construction.

Since the 21st century, SHI began to build LNG and large passenger ships in earnest, and exported shipbuilding technologies to the United States.  Samsung Heavy Industries decided to advance into the cruise ship market, the last remaining stronghold of EU shipbuilders. The company stated entering the undertaking was necessary to maintain its number one position in the global shipbuilding market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SHI Opens an Era of Cruise Shipbuilding in Korea|url=http://www.shi.samsung.co.kr/Eng/pr/news_view.aspx?Page=2&amp;Seq=764&amp;mac=f3adec1bf288896a0c9d440b2b8b531b|accessdate=11 January 2015|publisher=Samsung Heavy Industries|date=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, SHI was contracted to build a new residential cruise ship named [[Utopia (cruise ship)|Utopia]], which will be the largest passenger ship ever assembled in Asia. The ship will test the waters by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/01/asia-biggest-cruise-ship-lifestyle-travel-samsung.html?feed=rss_asia|title=A Cruise That Never Ends|work=Forbes|date=1 December 2009|accessdate=1 March 2010|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120918111443/http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/01/asia-biggest-cruise-ship-lifestyle-travel-samsung.html?feed=rss_asia|archivedate=18 September 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Power Grid of Japan as of 2008.png|right|thumb|Location of Shin Shinano and Japan's two utility frequencies]]

{{nihongo|'''Shin Shinano'''|新信濃変電所|Shin Shinano Hendensho}} is the designation of a [[Back-to-back connection#Power transmission|back-to-back]] [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) facility in [[Japan]] which forms one of four [[frequency changer|frequency converter stations]] that link Japan's western and eastern power grids.  The other three stations are at [[Higashi-Shimizu Frequency Converter|Higashi-Shimizu]], [[Minami-Fukumitsu]] and [[Sakuma Dam#HVDC frequency converter|Sakuma Dam]].

==Converter equipment==
The HVDC back-to-back facility Shin Shinano uses line-commutated [[thyristor]] converters.   The station houses two converters, one of which opened in December 1977,&lt;ref&gt;Compendium of HVDC schemes, [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987, pp100&amp;ndash;103.&lt;/ref&gt; the other in 1992.  The original 1977 converter was one of the first thyristor-based HVDC schemes to be put into operation in the world and used oil-insulated, oil-cooled outdoor [[thyristor valve]]s supplied by [[Hitachi]] (60&amp;nbsp;Hz end) and [[Toshiba]] (50&amp;nbsp;Hz end). A special workshop was provided on the site, in which valve maintenance (for example replacing failed thyristors) could be carried out under clean conditions in order to avoid contamination of the oil. 

The 1992 converter uses more conventional air-insulated, water-cooled thyristor valves.  In 2008 the original 1977 converter was decommissioned and replaced by a third converter, similar in design to the 1992 converter but using [[thyristor#Light triggered thyristor|Light-Triggered Thyristors]].

The Shin-Shinano link operates with a dc link voltage of 125 kV for each converter. The station was initially rated at 300&amp;nbsp;MW. In 1992, with the addition of the second 300&amp;nbsp;MW converter, the maximum transferable power was uprated to 600&amp;nbsp;MW.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4107">'''Solar–hydrogen energy cycle''' is an energy cycle where a [[solar energy|solar]] powered [[electrolyzer]] is used to convert water to [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. Hydrogen and oxygen produced thus are stored to be used by a [[fuel cell]] to produce electricity when no sunlight is available.&lt;ref name=lab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schatzlab.org/projects/real_world/schatz_solar.html|title=Schatz Solar Hydrogen Project|publisher=schatzlab.org|accessdate=2011-06-18|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working==
[[Photovoltaic panel]]s convert sunlight to electricity. In this cycle, the excess electricity produced after consumption by devices connected to the system, is used to power an [[electrolyzer]]. The electrolyzer converts water into hydrogen and oxygen, which is stored. This hydrogen is used up by a [[fuel cell]] to produce electricity, which can power the devices when sunlight is unavailable.&lt;ref name=lab/&gt;

==Features==
The Solar–Hydrogen energy cycle can be incorporated using [[Thin film solar cell#Organic solar cells|organic thin film solar cell]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakato|first1=Y.|last2=Jia|first2=G.|last3=Ishida|first3=M.|last4=Morisawa|first4=K.|last5=Fujitani|first5=M.|last6=Hinogami|first6=R.|last7=Yae|first7=S. |date=10 June 1998 |title=Efficient Solar-to-Chemical Conversion by One Chip of n-Type Silicon with Surface Asymmetry|journal=Electrochem.

==Use of hydrogen iodide==
An [[aqueous solution]] of [[hydrogen iodide]] has been proposed as an alternative to water as a fuel that can be used in this cycle. Splitting of hydrogen iodide is easier than splitting water as its [[Gibbs free energy change|Gibbs energy change]] for decomposition is lesser. Hence silicon photoelectrodes can decompose hydrogen iodide into hydrogen and iodine without any external bias.&lt;ref name=spie/&gt;

==Advantages==
* This cycle is pollution free as the only effluent from this cycle is pure water.&lt;ref name=lab/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5865">If an aircraft in flight suffers a disturbance in pitch that causes an increase (or decrease) in [[angle of attack]], it is desirable that the aerodynamic forces on the aircraft cause a decrease (or increase) in angle of attack so that the disturbance does not cause a continuous increase (or decrease) in angle of attack.  This is [[longitudinal static stability]].

''Static margin'' is a concept used to characterize the static longitudinal stability and controllability of aircraft and missiles.

In aircraft analysis, static margin is defined as the distance between the center of gravity and the neutral point of the aircraft, expressed as a percentage of the mean aerodynamic chord of the wing.  The greater this distance and the narrower the wing, the more stable the aircraft.  Conventionally, the neutral point is aft of the c.g., although in rare cases (computer controlled fighter aircraft) it may be forward of the c.g., i.e. slightly unstable, to obtain quickness of response in combat.  Too great longitudinal stability makes the aircraft "stiff" in pitch, resulting in such undesirable features as difficulty in obtaining the necessary stalled nose-up pitch when landing.

The position of the neutral point is found by taking the algebraic net moment of all horizontal surfaces, measured from the nose of the aircraft, in the same manner as the c.g. is determined, i.e. the sum of all such moments divided by their total area.  The stabilizer and elevator dominate this result, but it is necessary to account for all surfaces such as fuselage, landing gear, prop-normal, etc.  It is also necessary to take account of the center of pressure of the wing, which can move a good deal fore and aft as angle of attack of a flat-bottom wing section (Clark Y) changes, or not at all in the case of self-stabilizing sections such as the M6.

The neutral point in conventional aircraft is a short distance behind the c.g. ("The feathers of the arrow must be at the back"); but in unconventional aircraft such as canards and those with dual-wings, such as the Quickie, this will not be so.  The overall rule stated above must hold, i.e. the neutral point must be aft of the c.g., wherever that may be. 

The position of the center of gravity is determined by factors such as the positions of  loads, e.g. passengers, fuel, weapons, etc.; whether such loads can vary, e.g. presence or absence of luggage, ammunition, etc.; and how fuel is consumed during flight.  Additional information regarding the usual position of the neutral point aft of the center of gravity is at  [[longitudinal static stability]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_02/textonly/fo01txt.html Effect of CG on handling of swept-wing airplanes]&lt;/ref&gt; (For an aircraft this may be described as positive static margin.)  The response of an aircraft or missile to an angular disturbance such as a [[Tait-Bryan angles|pitch]] disturbance is determined by its static margin.

In missile analysis, static margin is defined as the distance between the center of gravity and the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]].  Missiles are symmetric vehicles and if they have airfoils they too are symmetric.  

For missiles, positive static margin implies that the complete vehicle makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position.  If the [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] is behind the center of gravity then the moment will be restoring.  For missiles with symmetric airfoils, the neutral point and the center of pressure are coincident and the term neutral point is not used.

== Relationship to aircraft and missile stability and control==
* If the center of gravity (CG) of an aircraft is forward of the neutral point, or the CG of a missile is forward of the center of pressure, the vehicle will respond to a disturbance by producing an aerodynamic moment that returns the [[angle of attack]] of the vehicle towards the angle that existed prior to the disturbance.
* If the CG of an aircraft is behind the neutral point, or the CG of a missile is behind the center of pressure, the vehicle will respond to a disturbance by producing an aerodynamic moment that continues to drive the angle of attack of the vehicle further away from the starting position. 

The first condition above is positive static stability.  In missile analysis this is described as positive static margin.  (In aircraft analysis it may be described as negative static margin.)&lt;br /&gt;
The second condition above is negative static stability.  In missile analysis this is defined as negative static margin.  (In aircraft analysis it may be described as positive static margin.)  

Depending on the static margin, humans may not be able to use control inputs to the elevators to control the pitch of the vehicle.  Typically, computer based [[autopilot]]s are required to control the vehicle when it has negative static stability - usually described as negative static margin.

The purpose of the reduced stability (low static margin) is to make an aircraft more responsive to pilot inputs.  An aircraft with a large static margin will be very stable and slow to respond to the pilot inputs.  The amount of static margin is an important factor in determining the handling qualities of an aircraft.  For an unguided rocket, the vehicle must have a large positive static margin so the rocket shows minimum tendency to diverge from the direction of flight given to it at launch.  In contrast, guided missiles usually have a negative static margin for increased maneuverability.

'''''The Fallbrook Story''''' (1952) is a short subject film that told the story of a water rights battle between the citizens of the [[Fallbrook, California]] area and the federal government.

The government wanted to have exclusive rights to the water from the Santa Margarita river for the use of adjacent [[Camp Pendleton]], a [[U.S. Marine Corps]] base, in conflict with the established use by local ranchers. At the time film director [[Frank Capra]] served on the Board of the local water agency, the Fallbrook Public Utilities District ("FPUD"). He produced the short film (without on screen credit) to tell the story from the ranchers perspective, leading to front page publicity from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. As a result, the federal government subsequently withdrew their claim on exclusive use of the water. The film was introduced on camera by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. A copy of the 16mm film is in the archives of the Fallbrook Historical Society.

'''Triuranium octoxide''' (U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is a compound of [[uranium]]. It is present as an olive green to black, odorless solid. It is one of the more popular forms of [[yellowcake]] and is shipped between mills and refineries in this form.

U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; has potential long-term stability in a [[deep geological repository|geologic environment]]. In the presence of [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[uranium dioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[oxidized]] to U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas [[uranium trioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) loses oxygen at temperatures above 500&amp;nbsp;°C and is [[Redox|reduced]] to U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. The compound can be produced by any one of three primary chemical conversion processes, involving either [[uranium tetrafluoride]] (UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[uranyl fluoride]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as intermediates. It is generally considered to be the more attractive form for disposal purposes because, under normal environmental conditions, U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the most kinetically and thermodynamically stable forms of uranium. Its particle density is 8.3 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Triuranium octoxide is converted to [[uranium hexafluoride]] for the purpose of [[uranium enrichment]].

==Solid state structure==
The solid is a layered structure where the layers are bridged by [[oxygen]] atoms, each layer contains uranium atoms which are in different coordination environments.

===Bond valence study===
Using a 6Å x 6Å x 6Å box with the uranium atom in the centre, the bond valence calculation was performed for both U1 and U2 in solid.&lt;ref&gt;http://radchem.nevada.edu/classes/rdch710/files/uranium.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was found, using the parameters for U(VI), that the calculated oxidation states for U1 and U2 are 5.11 and 5.10. Using the parameters for U(IV), the calculated oxidation states are 5.78 and 5.77 for U1 and U2, respectively. These studies suggests that all the uranium atoms have the same oxidation state, so that the oxidation states are disordered through the lattice.

'''''Vidas Secas''''' (Pre-Reform spelling: ''Vidas Sêcas'', literally "Dry Lives"; translated into English as ''Barren Lives'') is a novel by twentieth-century [[Brazil]]ian writer [[Graciliano Ramos]], written in [[1938 in literature|1938]]. It tells the cyclical story of a family of five: Fabiano, the father; Sinhá Vitória, the mother; two sons (just called boys) and their dog called Baleia ([[whale]] in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) in the poverty stricken and arid [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Brazilian northeast]]. One of the distinguishing characteristics of the book is that it is written in said cyclical manner, making it possible to read the first chapter as a continuation of the last chapter, reflecting the [[cycle of poverty]] and desolation in the [[Sertão]]. Another distinguishing characteristic is that the [[dog]] Baleia is considered the most sensible and human character.

It is often considered amongst the most important works in [[Brazilian literature]], with a "dry", concise style of writing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Film==
{{main|Vidas Secas (film)}}
''Vidas Secas'' was adapted into a highly praised film by [[Nelson Pereira dos Santos]], in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;[http://imdb.com/title/tt0057654/ Vidas Secas (1963)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and would become a landmark for the [[Cinema Novo]] movement.

}}'''Yang Shiming''' or '''Shih-Ming Yang''' ({{zh|c=|s=杨世铭|t=楊世銘|p=Yáng Shìmíng|w=Yang Shih-Ming}}) was a Chinese [[thermodynamicist]], who was a pioneer in heat transfer in mainland [[China]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1995|title=Professor Shi-Ming Yang on his 70th birthday|url=|journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer|volume=38 |issue=13|pages=2331–2332|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yang was a standing member of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Society of Engineering [[Thermophysics]] and vice chairman of the National Educational Advisory Committee on [[Thermal engineering|Thermal Engineering]]. He had also served on the editorial board of the ''Journal of Engineering Thermophysics'' since 1980, the honorary editorial advisory board of the ''International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer'' since 1982, and the executive committee as well as the Scientific Council of the International Centre of Heat and Mass Transfer since 1987.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thermofluid.xjtu.edu.cn/show.asp?id=543732|title=国际著名传热学专家，中国传热学科创始人之一，杨世铭先生仙逝 (in Chinese)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://me.sjtu.edu.cn/News/showDetail.aspx?tid=1505|title=杨世铭教授简介 (in Chinese)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Life and education ==
Yang fled to [[Shanghai]] at age 12. The CPC influenced he when studying at a high school, hence he joined in the party in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsxq.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1069/63115.htm|title=杨世铭：我国传热学教学的开拓者之一 (in Chinese)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yang was enrolled at [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] in 1942. There was a hiatus in his undergraduate life, he backed to the university in 1946 and received his BS degree from there in 1948. Meantime, he successively served as a teacher at a technical school and an engineer at a rubber factory. Afterwards, he received his MS degree from [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Institute of Technology]] in 1950. Then he became a graduate student with Professor [[Max Jakob]]'s guidance and obtained his Ph. D. degree from [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==
Upon the request of Jakob, Yang joined the Heat Transfer Laboratory of IIT before he returned to Shanghai at the end of 1953. Their concerted effort revealed the Jakob number.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Yang began to teach at Jiao Tong University since 1956, he followed the university's westward moving to Xi'an in the next year. During 1958–85, he was in charge of the thermal engineering section of Xi'an Jiaotong University as an associate professor and then a professor.

Bereavement of wife led to Yang's return to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where he continued his work until retirement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Yang made a great contribution to the Chinese thermodynamics education. The textbook ''Heat Transfer'', which he edited, received the National Excellent Textbook Award in 1988.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Family ==
Yang's wife died in the 1980s. They had a daughter and a son.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
