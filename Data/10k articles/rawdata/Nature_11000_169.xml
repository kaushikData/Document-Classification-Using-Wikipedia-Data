'''{{mp|2010 WC|9}}''', unofficially designated {{mp|ZJ99C60}}, is a sub-kilometer [[Near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately {{convert|100|m||abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter. First observed for eleven days by the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] in 2010, the asteroid was recovered in May 2018 during its sub-lunar close encounter with Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; 

== First observation and recovery ==

{{mp|2010 WC|9}} was first observed by astronomers with the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] on 30 November 2010 with a 1-day [[observation arc]]&lt;ref name="MPEC2010-X07" /&gt; and was observed through 10 December 2010.&lt;ref name="MPS358671" /&gt; By 10 December 2010 the asteroid was more than 24 million kilometers from Earth&lt;ref name="MPEC2010-X07"/&gt; at [[apparent magnitude]] 21.8&lt;ref name="MPC-object"/&gt; and was becoming too faint to be practical to track.

The preliminary 10-day observation arc generated a [[Confidence region|line of variation]] roughly 15 million km long&lt;!-- dummy edit; can be deleted. --&gt; for May 2018 that did not intersect Earth's orbit and thus was not a 2018 impact threat.&lt;ref name=Sentry2016 /&gt; The 10-day observation arc showed the asteroid would pass about {{convert|0.026|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth around late 14 May 2018. The asteroid was recovered on 8 May 2018 when it was 8 million kilometers from Earth and given the temporary NEOCP designation ZJ99C60.&lt;ref name="projectpluto" /&gt; It was removed from the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] on 10 May 2018&lt;ref name=removed/&gt; and is not an impact threat for the next 100 years or more. The asteroid now has a secure 7-year observation arc.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==
{{mp|2010 WC|9}} is an [[Apollo asteroid]], the largest dynamical group of [[near-Earth object]]s with nearly 10,000 known members. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.78–1.4&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 13 months (409 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.08&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.28 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 18[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

Using an [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] of 23 March 2018, the object had a [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] with Earth of {{convert |0.00138 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}, or 0.55 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] (LD).&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

}}

On 15 May 2018, 22:05 [[Universal Time|UT]], the asteroid approached Earth at just over 0.5&amp;nbsp;LD, the closest approach of this asteroid in nearly 300 years.&lt;ref name="EarthSky" /&gt;. It was expected to reach [[apparent magnitude]] +11 at closest approach,&lt;ref name="NEODyS2018" /&gt; bright enough to be seen in a small telescope if you have a custom [[ephemeris]] for your location. At closest approach, it was best seen from the Southern hemisphere such as South Africa and southern South America. The asteroid passed Earth going {{convert|12.81|km/s|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

This was the third closest approach ever observed by an asteroid with [[Absolute_magnitude#Solar_System_bodies_(H)|absolute magnitude]] (H) brighter than 24.&lt;ref name="MPC-closelist" /&gt;
{{Large near earth asteroid flybys 1LD}}

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Diameter ===

As the asteroid has not been directly resolved by telescope, its diameter can only be estimated based on the distance and brightness. Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, it is estimated to measure between 60–130 meters in diameter, for an [[absolute magnitude]] of 23.5,&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; and an assumed [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.04–0.20.&lt;ref name="EarthSky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="h" /&gt; 

== Numbering and naming ==

As of 2018, this [[minor planet]] has neither been numbered nor [[List of named minor planets (alphabetical)|named]] by the [[Minor Planet Center]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

{{Redirect|Acis||ACIS (disambiguation)}}[[File:Guillemot - Acis and Galatea, 1827.jpg|thumb|''The Loves of Acis and Galatea'' by Alexandre Charles Guillemot (1827)]]
{{Greek myth (sea)}}
'''Acis and Galatea''' is a story from [[Greek mythology]] that originally appeared in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. The story tells of the love between the mortal Acis and the [[Nereid]] (sea-nymph) Galatea; when the jealous [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] kills Acis, Galatea transforms her lover into an immortal river spirit. The episode was made the subject of poems, operas, paintings, and statues in the [[Renaissance]] and after.

==Mythology==
Galatea (Γαλάτεια; "she who is milk-white"), daughter of [[Nereus]] and [[Doris (mythology)|Doris]], was a sea-nymph anciently attested in the work of both [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]], where she is described as the fairest and most beloved of the 50 [[Nereids]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]''; Homer, ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' she appears as the beloved of Acis, the son of [[Faunus]] and the [[naiad|river-nymph]] Symaethis, daughter of the River [[Simeto|Symaethus]]. When a  jealous rival, the Sicilian [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]], killed him with a boulder, Galatea then turned his blood into the Sicilian River [[Acireale|Acis]], of which he became the spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' [http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/Metamorph13.htm#_Toc64105850 xiii.750-68].&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the tale occurs nowhere earlier and may be a fiction invented by Ovid, "suggested by the manner in which the little river springs forth from under a rock".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link = Leonhard Schmitz  | contribution = Acis  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 13  | place = Boston, MA  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0022.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Athenaeus]], ca 200 CE,&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''Deipnosophistae'' [http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus1.html#6 1.6e]&lt;/ref&gt; the story was first concocted by [[Philoxenus of Cythera]] as a political satire against the Sicilian tyrant [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]], whose favourite concubine, Galatea, shared her name with the nymph. Others claim the story was invented to explain the presence of a shrine dedicated to Galatea on Mount Etna.&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast on Theocritus' ''Idyll VI'' quoting the historian Duris and the poet Philoxenus of Cythera&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary and operatic===

During [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] times the story emerged once more as a popular theme. In Spain, [[Luis de Góngora y Argote]] wrote the much-admired narrative poem, ''Fábula de [[Polifemo]] y Galatea'', published in 1627. It is particularly noted for its depiction of landscape and for the sensual description of the love of Acis and Galatea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Selected Poems of Luis de Góngora|work=University of Chicago|year=2008|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=M73JAsBiFxoC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=Polyphemus%20poem&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q=Polyphemus%20poem&amp;f=false|page=176ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written in homage to an earlier and rather shorter narrative with the same title by Luis Carillo y Sotomayor (1611)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblioteca-antologica.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/CARRILLO-DE-SOTOMAYOR-F%C3%A1bula-de-Acis-y-Galatea-YA.pdf|format=PDF|title=Selected Poems of Luis de Góngora|website=biblioteca-antologica.org|access-date=2013-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512224721/http://www.biblioteca-antologica.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/CARRILLO-DE-SOTOMAYOR-F%C3%A1bula-de-Acis-y-Galatea-YA.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was also given operatic treatment in the very popular [[zarzuela]] of [[Antoni Lliteres Carrió]] (1708). The atmosphere here is lighter and enlivened by the inclusion of the clowns Momo and Tisbe.

In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] devoted his opera [[Acis et Galatée]] (1686) to their love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/r/DG%2BArchiv/E4534972|title=Presto Classical - Lully: Acis et Galatée - DG Archiv: E4534972 (download) - Buy online|work=prestoclassical.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described by him as a pastoral-heroic work, it depicts a love triangle between the three main characters - Acis, Galatea, and Poliphème. Poliphème murders Acis out of jealousy, but Acis is revived and turned into a river by [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]. In Italy [[Giovanni Bononcini]]'s one-act opera ''Polifemo'' followed in 1703.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVaNW5ib6N8|title=Martina Bovet: Dove sei, dove t&amp;#39;ascondi; G. B.

Written in Italian, Polifemo's deep bass solo ''Fra l'ombre e gl'orrori'' (From horrid shades) establishes his character from the start.&lt;ref name="youtube2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c82JE9GK8I|title=Aci, Galatea e Polifemo - Fra l&amp;#39;ombre e gl&amp;#39;orrori - YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Handel's move to England, he gave the story a new treatment in his [[pastoral]] opera ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' with an English libretto provided by [[John Gay]].&lt;ref&gt;The text is on the [http://opera.stanford.edu/iu/libretti/acis.htm Stanford University site] and there is a complete performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vew-CeKW-SU YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially composed in 1718, the work went through many revisions and was later to be given updated orchestrations by both [[Mozart]] and [[Mendelssohn]]. As a pastoral work where Polyphemus plays only a minor, though decisive part, it largely centres on the two lovers. In Austria later in the century, [[Joseph Haydn]] composed ''Acide e Galatea'' (1763).&lt;ref&gt;Brief excerpts at [http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/126417.html Classical Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; Designed for an imperial wedding, it was given a happier ending centred on the transformation scene after the murder of Acis as the pair declare their undying love.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Green, "Representing the Aristocracy", in ''Haydn and his world'', Princeton University 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=omPuBn8pTFUC&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;ots=1GDMhp5YXs&amp;dq=Acide%20e%20Galatea%20%22Haydn%22&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q=Acide%20e%20Galatea%20%22Haydn%22&amp;f=false pp.167-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;Paintings featuring Acis and Galatea can be grouped according to their themes. Most notably the story takes place within a pastoral landscape in which the figures are almost incidental. This is particularly so in Nicolas Poussin's ''Landscape with Polyphemus'' (1649)([[Hermitage Museum]]) and [[Claude Lorrain]]'s seaside landscape ([[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden]]) of 1657, in both of which the lovers play a minor part in the foreground. In an earlier painting by Poussin ([[National Gallery of Ireland]], 1630) the couple is among several embracing figures in the foreground, shielded from view of Polyphemus, who is playing his flute higher up the slope.

In all of these Polyphemus is somewhere in the background, but many others feature Galatea alone, as in [[Perino del Vaga]]'s painting of her being drawn by sea beasts over the waves while riding on a seashell.&lt;ref&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yKTcOgwlx0U/TxqpsTcifiI/AAAAAAAALN4/D5PDymRH16k/s1600/Galatea.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, though, the nymph is carried through the sea by adoring attendants in paintings generally titled ''The Triumph of Galatea'', of which the most renowned treatment is by [[Galatea (Raphael)|Raphael]]. In general these follow the 3rd-century description given of such a painting by [[Philostratus the Younger]] in his ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/PhilostratusElder2B.html#18 2.18], translation by Arthur Fairbanks, (Loeb 1931)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The nymph sports on the peaceful sea, driving a team of four dolphins yoked together and working in harmony; and maiden-daughters of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], Galatea's servants, guide them, curving them in if they try to do anything mischievous or contrary to the rein. She holds over her heads against the wind a light scarf of sea-purple to provide a shade for herself and a sail for her chariot, and from it a kind of radiance falls upon her forehead and her head, though no white more charming than the bloom on her cheek; her hair is not tossed by the breeze, for it is so moist that it is proof against the wind. And lo, her right elbow stands out and her white forearm is bent back, while she rests her fingers on her delicate shoulder, and her arms are gently rounded, and her breasts project, nor yet is beauty lacking in her thigh. Her foot, with the graceful part that ends in it, is painted as on the sea and it lightly touches the water as if it were the rudder guiding her chariot. Her eyes are wonderful, for they have a kind of distant look that travels as far as the sea extends.}}
In those cases where the rejected lover Polyphemus appears somewhere ashore, the division between them is emphasised by their being identified with their respective elements, sea, and land. Typical examples of this were painted by [[Francois Perrier (painter)|Francois Perrier]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wga.hu/art/p/perrier/acisgala.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Lanfranco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artclon.com/paintings/galatea-and-polyphemus_29085.html|title=Giovanni Lanfranco Galatea and Polyphemus Painting Reproduction On Artclon For Sale - Buy Art Reproductions Galatea and Polyphemus|work=artclon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]].

Sensual portrayals of the lovers embracing in a landscape were provided by French painters especially, as in those by [[Charles de La Fosse]] (c. 1700), [[Jean-François de Troy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/jean-francois-de-troy-acis-and-galatea-4684830-details.aspx?intObjectID=4684830|title=Jean-François de Troy (Paris 1679-1752 Rome)|author=Christie?s|work=christies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexandre Charles Guillemot (1827).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-athenaeum.org/art/full.php?ID=22030|title=The Athenaeum - The Loves of Acis and Galatea (Alexandre Charles Guillemot - )|work=the-athenaeum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyphemus lurks in the background of these and in the example by De Troy his presence plainly distresses Galatea. Other French examples by [[Antoine Jean Gros]] (1833)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonzasheila.com/art/archives/feb06/09.html|title=Acis And Galatea by AntoineJean Gros, 1833.

They anticipate the tragic moment when he looms menacingly over the pair, having discovered the truth they have tried to conceal. The threat is as apparent in [[Jean-Francois de Troy]]'s softly outlined 18th-century vision&lt;ref name="tribe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribes.tribe.net/b9b544af-89e5-4aa7-8dec-c917f83c3bd7/photos/ce5f648c-2c00-4f13-9147-55c24bbbbc1b|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202200306/http://tribes.tribe.net/b9b544af-89e5-4aa7-8dec-c917f83c3bd7/photos/ce5f648c-2c00-4f13-9147-55c24bbbbc1b |archive-date=2014-02-02 |dead-url=yes|title=polyphemus and Acis and Galatea.gif - tribe.net|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in [[Odilon Redon]]'s almost Surrealist painting of 1900. The brooding atmosphere in these suggests the violent action which is to follow. That had been portrayed in earlier paintings of Polyphemus casting a rock at the fleeing lovers, such as those by [[Annibale Carracci]],&lt;ref name="wga"&gt;http://www.wga.hu/art/c/carracci/annibale/farnese/farnese4.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; {{Interlanguage link multi|Auger Lucas|fr}}&lt;ref name="gouv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0640/m507704_02-014751_p.jpg|title=Wave/image/joconde/0640/m507704_02-014751_p|publisher=culture.gouv.fr|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carle van Loo]].&lt;ref name="1st-art-gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1st-art-gallery.com/%28after%29-Loo,-Carle-Van/Polyphemus-Attacking-Acis-And-Galatea.html|title=Polyphemus attacking Acis and Galatea (after) Loo, Carle van &amp;#124; Oil Painting Reproduction &amp;#124; 1st-Art-Gallery.com|publisher=1st-art-gallery.com|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Statues of Galatea, sometimes in the company of Acis, began to be made in Europe from the 17th century. There is a fanciful description of a fountain that incorporates them both in [[John Barclay (poet)|John Barclay]]'s Latin novel ''Argenis'', dating from 1621:
{{quote|Being drawn to the top of the fountain, the water passed through many pipes in various forms, then falling into the cistern beneath, it boiled with the force of its falling and waxed green like the sea. In the midst whereof, Galatea, as in the sea, bewailed her newly dead Acis, who lay on the shore, and as if he now began to be dissolved into a river, he sent forth two streams, one at his mouth, the other at his wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Barkley |title=Argenis (Mark Riley and Dorothy Pritchard Huber's translation) |location=Assen NL |year= 2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ySgLF4nkmAC&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=fountain%20Galatea%20-Pygmalion&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=fountain%20Galatea%20-Pygmalion&amp;f=false |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
An actual statue by a pool in the public gardens of [[Acireale]], the Sicilian town where the transformation of Acis is supposed to have taken place, is less ingenious. He lies beneath the boulder that has killed him while Galatea crouches to one side, an arm raised to heaven in supplication.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kThEbQGMmBk/TzGUDIvSurI/AAAAAAABC0g/I-28O8ANL4I/s1600/Marble+statue+in+the+garden+publics+of+Acireale,+Sicily+-+Tutt%27Art@.jpg|title=-kThEbQGMmBk/TzGUDIvSurI/AAAAAAABC0g/I-28O8ANL4I/s1600/Marble+statue+in+the+garden+publics+of+Acireale,+Sicily+-+Tutt%27Art@&lt;/ref&gt;

French sculptors have also been responsible for some memorable statues. There are a pair by [[Jean-Baptiste Tuby]] in the Bosquet des Dômes in the [[Gardens of Versailles|Versailles]] gardens. Acis leans on a rock, casually playing the flute, as the half-clad Galatea comes upon him with hands lifted in surprise (1667–75). A similar gesture is displayed in the statue of her alone in the fountain to the right of the great staircase at [[Chantilly, Oise#Château de Chantilly|Château de Chantilly]]. The lovers are portrayed together as part of the Medici Fountain in the [[Luxembourg Garden]] in Paris. Designed by [[Auguste Ottin]] in 1866, the marble group embrace inside a grotto while above them is crouched a huge Polyphemus in weathered bronze, peering down in jealousy.

Many other statues feature Galatea alone, but there is a complication. Some time after the Renaissance, the same name was given to [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]'s animated statue and one has to distinguish between representations of her and of the nymph Galatea. One pointer is given by the introduction of features mentioned in the description of the nymph by Philostratus that is quoted above. These include one hand raised and holding a billowing scarf; sea imagery, including shells, dolphins and tritons; and often the fact that the statue is incorporated into a fountain. In the work by Gabriel de Grupello in the castle park at [[Schwetzingen]], the triton at Galatea's feet holds up a garland threaded with shells and pearls. The Galatea in the grounds of [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in Russia has sea pearls threaded into her hair. There is also a statue of her by [[Nicola Michetti]] that forms part of the cascade at the [[Peterhof Palace]] in [[St Petersburg]].

The nymph reclines on a large shell carried by tritons in the 18th-century fountain at the Villa Borromeo Visconti Litta in [[Milan]]. It is on the back of a dolphin that she reclines in the statue by the 19th-century Italian sculptor Leopoldo Ansiglioni (1832–1894). There are two versions of this, one at the centre of a fish pool in the East House of the [[University of Greenwich]]'s Winter Gardens,&lt;ref name="flickr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/50780708@N02/8368854354/lightbox|title=Galatea &amp;#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing!|publisher=flickr.com|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a later copy installed at [[Hearst Castle]] in California.&lt;ref name="pbase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/rgardner/image/87228231|title=Hearst Castle Statue - Galatea on a Dolphin by Leopoldo Ansiglioni photo - Rich Gardner photos at pbase.com|publisher=pbase.com|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, one of the arms bent back to support her head is encircled by the dolphin's tail. There is also a German fountain by [[Karl Friedrich Moest]] now installed in [[Karlsruhe]] in which Galatea sits on the back of a triton. Over her head she balances the huge shell from which the water pours. Another statue was erected at the head of an impressive cascade in [[Stuttgart]]'s Eugenplatz.&lt;ref&gt;http://img.marcopolo.de/api/content/images/0/20/5n/hk/yzph/photo-1606191.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; A work of Otto Rieth (1858–1911) dating from 1890, it features the nymph crowned with seaweed and surging up from the dolphin and young [[cupid#Cupid and dolphins|cupids]] playing at her feet.

In the applied arts, three-dimensional representations of Raphael's triumph theme were often incorporated into artifacts for aristocratic use and were painted on [[Maiolica|majolica]] ware.

The '''Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol''' (AWG-KP) is one of the two negotiating tracks established under the [[Bali Road Map]] at the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]'s 13th Conference of the Parties ([[COP13]]) in Bali in 2007. The other one is the [[Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action]] (AWG-LCA).

== Origin of Crabtree effect in yeast ==
Approximately 100 million years ago (mya), within the yeast lineage there was a [[whole genome duplication]] (WGD).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Kenneth H.|title=Origin of the Yeast Whole-Genome Duplication|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002221|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=13|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002221|pmc=4529243|pmid=26252643|pages=e1002221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A majority of Crabtree-positive yeasts are post-WGD yeasts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  It was believed that the WGD was a mechanism for the development of Crabtree effect in these species due to the duplication of [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH) encoding genes and hexose transporters.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, recent evidence has shown that aerobic fermentation originated before the WGD and evolved as a multi-step process, potentially aided by the WGD.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The origin of aerobic fermentation, or the first step, in ''Saccharomyces'' crabtree-positive yeasts likely occurred in the interval between the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions, horizontal transfer of anaerobic DHODase (encoded by URA1 with bacteria), and the loss of respiratory chain Complex I.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A more pronounced Crabtree effect, the second step, likely occurred near the time of the WGD event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Later evolutionary events that aided in the evolution of aerobic fermentation are better understood and outlined in the Genomic basis of the crabtree effect section.

=== Driving forces ===
It is believed that a major driving force in the origin of aerobic fermentation was its simultaneous origin with modern fruit (~125 mya).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  These fruit provided an abundance of simple sugar food source for microbial communities, including both yeast and bacteria.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Bacteria, at that time, were able to produce biomass at a faster rate than the yeast.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Producing a toxic compound, like ethanol, can slow the growth of bacteria, allowing the yeast to be more competitive.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, the yeast still had to use a portion of the sugar it consumes to produce ethanol.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Crabtree-positive yeasts also have increased glycolytic flow, or increased uptake of glucose and conversion to pyruvate, which compensates for using a portion of the glucose to produce ethanol rather than biomass.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Therefore, it is believed that the original driving force was to kill competitors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  This is supported by research that determined the kinetic behavior of the ancestral ADH protein, which was found to be optimized to make ethanol, rather than consume it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further evolutionary events in the development of aerobic fermentation likely increased the efficiency of this lifestyle, including increased tolerance to ethanol and the repression of the respiratory pathway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In high sugar environments, ''S. cerevisiae'' outcompetes and dominants all other yeast species, except its closest relative ''[[Saccharomyces paradoxus]]''.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The ability of ''S. cerevisiae'' to dominate in high sugar environments evolved more recently than aerobic fermentation and is dependent on the type of high-sugar environment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Other yeasts' growth is dependent on the pH and nutrients of the high-sugar environment.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Kathryn M.|last2=Liu|first2=Ping|last3=Fay|first3=Justin C.|date=2015-08-01|title=Evolution of ecological dominance of yeast species in high-sugar environments|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12707/abstract|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=69|issue=8|pages=2079–2093|doi=10.1111/evo.12707|issn=1558-5646|pmc=4751874|pmid=26087012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genomic basis of the crabtree effect ==
The genomic basis of the crabtree effect is still being investigated, and its evolution likely involved multiple successive molecular steps that increased the efficiency of the lifestyle.

=== Expansion of hexose transporter genes ===
[[Glucose transporter|Hexose transporters]] (HXT) are a group of proteins that are largely responsible for the uptake of glucose in yeast.  In ''S. cerevisiae'', 20 ''HXT'' genes have been identified and 17 encode for glucose transporters (''HXT1-HXT17''), ''GAL2'' encodes for a galactose transporter, and ''SNF3'' and ''RGT2'' encode for glucose sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boles|first=E.|last2=Hollenberg|first2=C. P.|date=1997-08-01|title=The molecular genetics of hexose transport in yeasts|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=21|issue=1|pages=85–111|issn=0168-6445|pmid=9299703|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.1997.tb00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of glucose sensor genes have remained mostly consistent through the budding yeast lineage, however glucose sensors are absent from ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]''.  ''Sch. pombe'' is a Crabtree-positive yeast, which developed aerobic fermentation independently from ''Saccharomyces'' lineage, and detects glucose via the cAMP-signaling pathway.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The number of transporter genes vary significantly between yeast species and has continually increased during the evolution of the ''S. cerevisiae'' lineage.  Most of the transporter genes have been generated by tandem duplication, rather than from the WGD.  ''Sch. pombe'' also has a high number of transporter genes compared to its close relatives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Glucose uptake is believed to be a major rate-limiting step in glycolysis and replacing ''S. cerevisiae''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''HXT1-17'' genes with a single chimera ''HXT'' gene results in decreased ethanol production or fully respiratory metabolism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Thus, having an efficient glucose uptake system appears to be essential to ability of aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  There is a significant positive correlation between the number of hexose transporter genes and the efficiency of ethanol production.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== CNV in glycolysis genes ===
[[File:Ethanol Fermentation english.png|thumb|A scheme of transformation of glucose to alcohol by alcoholic fermentation.]]
After a WGD, one of the duplicated gene pair is often lost through fractionation; less than 10% of WGD gene pairs have remained in ''S. cerevisiae'' genome.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  A little over half of WGD gene pairs in the [[glycolysis]] reaction pathway were retained in post-WGD species, significantly higher than the overall retention rate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  This has been associated with an increased ability to metabolize glucose into pyruvate, or higher rate of glycolysis.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  After glycolysis, pyruvate can either be further broken down by [[pyruvate decarboxylase]] (Pdc) or [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] (Pdh).  The kinetics of the enzymes are such that when pyruvate concentrations are high, due to a high rate of glycolysis, there is increased flux through Pdc and thus the fermentation pathway.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The WGD is believed to have played a beneficial role in the evolution of the Crabtree effect in post-WGD species partially due to this increase in copy number of glycolysis genes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== CNV in fermentation genes ===
The fermentation reaction only involves two steps.  Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde by Pdc and then acetaldehyde is converted to ethanol by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (Adh).  There is no significant increase in the number of ''Pdc'' genes in Crabtree-positive compared to Crabtree-negative species and no correlation between number of ''Pdc'' genes and efficiency of fermentation.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55013-3_5|title=Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Genetics of Yeast Carbon Metabolism|last=Lin|first=Zhenguo|last2=Li|first2=Wen-Hsiung|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642550126|editor-last=Piškur|editor-first=Jure|pages=97–120|language=en|editor-last2=Compagno|editor-first2=Concetta}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are five ''Adh'' genes in ''S. cerevisiae''.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Adh1 is the major enzyme responsible for catalyzing the fermentation step from acetaldehyde to ethanol.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Adh2 catalyzes the reverse reaction, consuming ethanol and converting it to acetaldehyde.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The ancestral, or original, Adh had a similar function as Adh1 and after a duplication in this gene, Adh2 evolved a lower K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; for ethanol.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Adh2 is believed to have increased yeast species' tolerance for ethanol and allowed Crabtree-positive species to consume the ethanol they produced after depleting sugars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  However, Adh2 and consumption of ethanol is not essential for aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  ''Sch. pombe'' and other Crabtree positive species do not have the ''ADH2''  gene and consumes ethanol very poorly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Differential expression ===
In Crabtree-negative species, respiration related genes are highly expressed in the presence of oxygen.  However, when ''S. cerevisiae'' is grown on glucose in aerobic conditions, respiration-related gene expression is repressed.  Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins expression is only induced under environmental stress conditions, specifically low glucose availability.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Genes involving mitochondrial energy generation and phosphorylation oxidation, which are involved in respiration, have the largest expression difference between aerobic fermentative yeast species and respiratory species.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  In a comparative analysis between ''Sch. pombe'' and ''S. cerevisiae'', both of which evolved aerobic fermentation independently, the expression pattern of these two fermentative yeasts were more similar to each other than a respiratory yeast, ''C. albicans''.  However, ''S. cerevisiae'' is evolutionarily closer to ''C. albicans''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Regulatory rewiring was likely important in the evolution of aerobic fermentation in both lineages.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Domestication and aerobic fermentation ==
[[File:Wine Grapes with dusting that contains yeast.jpg|thumb|A close up picture of ripening wine grapes. The light white "dusting" is a film that also contains wild yeasts.]]
Aerobic fermentation is also essential for multiple industries, resulting in human domestication of several yeast strains.  Beer and other alcoholic beverages, throughout human history, have played a significant role in society through drinking rituals, providing nutrition, medicine, and uncontaminated water.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legras|first=Jean-Luc|last2=Merdinoglu|first2=Didier|last3=Cornuet|first3=Jean-Marie|last4=Karst|first4=Francis|date=2007-05-01|title=Bread, beer and wine: Saccharomyces cerevisiae diversity reflects human history|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=16|issue=10|pages=2091–2102|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03266.x|issn=0962-1083|pmid=17498234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the domestication process, organisms shift from natural environments that are more variable and complex to simple and stable environments with a constant substrate. This often favors specialization adaptations in domesticated microbes, associated with relaxed selection for non-useful genes in alternative metabolic strategies or pathogenicity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Domestication might be partially responsible for the traits that promote aerobic fermentation in industrial species.  Introgression and HGT is common in ''Saccharomyces'' domesticated strains.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Many commercial wine strains have significant portions of their DNA derived from HGT of non-''Saccharomyces'' species.  HGT and introgression are less common in nature than is seen during domestication pressures.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  For example, the important industrial yeast strain ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'', is an interspecies hybrid of ''S. cerevisiae'' and the cold tolerant ''[[Saccharomyces eubayanus|S. eubayanus]].''&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;  This hybrid is commonly used in lager-brewing, which requires slow, low temperature fermentation.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;

== Aerobic fermentation in non-yeast species ==

=== Plants ===
Alcoholic fermentation is often used by plants in anaerobic conditions to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and regenerate [[NAD+|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to allow for glycolysis to continue.  For most plant tissues, fermentation only occurs in anaerobic conditions, but there are a few exceptions.  In the pollen of [[maize]] (''Zea mays'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadege|first=Million|last2=Dupuis|first2=Isabelle|last3=Kuhlemeier|first3=Cris|date=1999-08-01|title=Ethanolic fermentation: new functions for an old pathway|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138599014508|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=4|issue=8|pages=320–325|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(99)01450-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tobacco]] (''Nicotiana tabacum'' &amp; ''Nicotiana plumbaginifolia''), the fermentation enzyme ADH is abundant, regardless of the oxygen level.  In tobacco pollen, PDC is also highly expressed in this tissue and transcript levels are not influenced by oxygen concentration.  Tobacco pollen, similar to Crabtree-positive yeast, perform high levels of fermentation dependent on the sugar supply, and not oxygen availability.  In these tissues, respiration and alcoholic fermentation occur simultaneously with high sugar availability.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadege|first=M.|last2=Kuhlemeier|first2=C.|date=1997-10-01|title=Aerobic fermentation during tobacco pollen development|journal=Plant Molecular Biology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=343–354|issn=0167-4412|pmid=9349258|doi=10.1023/A:1005837112653}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermentation produces the toxic acetaldehyde and ethanol, that can build up in large quantities during pollen development.  It has been hypothesized that acetaldehyde is a pollen factor that causes [[cytoplasmic male sterility]].  Cytoplasmic male sterility is a trait observed in maize, tobacco and other plants in which there is an inability to produce viable pollen.  It is believed that this trait might be due to the expression of the fermentation genes, ADH and PDC, a lot earlier on in pollen development than normal and the accumulation of toxic aldehyde.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Trypanosomatids ===
When grown in glucose-rich media, [[Trypanosomatida|trypanosomatid]] parasites degrade glucose via aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In this group, this phenomenon is not a pre-adaptation to/or remnant of anaerobic life, shown through their inability to survive in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  It is believed that this phenomenon developed due to the capacity for a high glycolytic flux and the high glucose concentrations of their natural environment.  The mechanism for repression of respiration in these conditions is not yet known.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bringaud|first=Frédéric|last2=Rivière|first2=Loïc|last3=Coustou|first3=Virginie|date=2006-09-01|title=Energy metabolism of trypanosomatids: Adaptation to available carbon sources|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166685106001150|journal=Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology|volume=149|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''E. coli'' mutant ===
A couple ''Escherichia coli'' mutant strains have been bioengineered to ferment glucose under aerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One group developed the ECOM3 (''E. coli'' cytochrome oxidase mutant) strain by removing three terminal cytochrome oxidases (cydAB, cyoABCD, and cbdAB) to reduce oxygen uptake.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  After 60 days of adaptive evolution on glucose media, the strain displayed a mixed phenotype.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In aerobic conditions, some populations' fermentation solely produced lactate, while others did mixed-acid fermentation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;[[File:Warburgh Effect.gif|thumb|Myc and HIF-1 regulate glucose metabolism and stimulate the Warburg effect.]]

=== Tumor cells ===
One of the hallmarks of cancer is altered metabolism or deregulating cellular energetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanahan|first=Douglas|date=4 March 2011|title=Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411001279|journal=Cell|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013|pmid=21376230|access-date=|volume=144|pages=646–674}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cancers cells often have reprogrammed their glucose metabolism to perform lactic acid fermentation, in the presence of oxygen, rather than send the pyruvate made through glycolysis to the mitochondria. This is referred to as the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]], and is associated with high consumption of glucose and a high rate of glycolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warburg|first=Prof Otto|date=1925-03-01|title=über den Stoffwechsel der Carcinomzelle|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01726151|journal=Klinische Wochenschrift|language=de|volume=4|issue=12|pages=534–536|doi=10.1007/BF01726151|issn=0023-2173}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ATP production in these cancer cells is often only through the process of glycolysis and pyruvate is broken down by the fermentation process in the cell's cytoplasm.  This phenomenon is often seen as counterintuitive, since cancer cells have higher energy demands due to the continued proliferation and respiration produces significantly more ATP than glycolysis alone (fermentation produces no additional ATP).  Typically, there is an up-regulation in glucose transporters and enzymes in the glycolysis pathway (also seen in yeast).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz-Ruiz|first=Rodrigo|last2=Rigoulet|first2=Michel|last3=Devin|first3=Anne|title=The Warburg and Crabtree effects: On the origin of cancer cell energy metabolism and of yeast glucose repression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005272810006869|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics|volume=1807|issue=6|pages=568–576|doi=10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many parallel aspects of aerobic fermentation in tumor cells that are also seen in Crabtree-positive yeasts. Further research into the evolution of aerobic fermentation in yeast such as ''S. cerevisiae'' can be a useful model for understanding aerobic fermentation in tumor cells.  This has a potential for better understanding cancer and cancer treatments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''''Bratschen''''' are weathering products that occur as a result of [[Frost weathering|frost]] and aeolian [[corrasion]] almost exclusively on the calc-[[schist]]s of the Upper Slate Mantle (''Obere Schieferhülle'') in the [[High Tauern]] mountains of Austria. The term is German but is used untranslated in English sources.&lt;ref&gt;For example here: [http://www.summitpost.org/kendlspitze/151085 ''Kendlspitze''] at www.summitpost.org. Retrieved 12 Dec 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be the equivalent of the New Zealand climbers' term 'weet-bix' for a rock that disintegrates easily and so is difficult to climb on.

The calc-schist, that appears blue-gray when freshly broken, weathers to a yellow to brown colour and flakes off on the surface to form ''bratschen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=H. P.

These form steep (up to 40°), rocky, almost unvegetated mountainsides with an odd and rough-textured surface, caused by wind erosion. ''Bratschen'' are found on the mountains such as the [[Fuscherkarkopf]], the [[Großer Bärenkopf (Glockner Group)|Großer Bärenkopf]], the [[Kitzsteinhorn]], the Schwerteck or on the – eponymous – [[Bratschenkopf|Bratschenköpfen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14335">'''Cap and dividend''' is a [[market economy|market-based]] [[trading system]] which retains the original capping method of [[cap and trade]], but also includes compensation for energy consumers. This [[Financial compensation|compensation]] is to offset the cost of products produced by companies that raise prices to [[consumer]]s as a result of this [[policy]].&lt;ref name="cap1"&gt;{{cite journal |first=James K. |last=Boyce |date = August 2009| accessdate=2010-11-30 |title=Cap and Dividend: A State-By-State Analysis |url= http://www.progressive-economics.org/papers/CAP_DIVIDEND_states.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process begins with some governments setting aggregate pollution quotas (e.g., for carbon emissions) and selling pollution permits to the public respectively.  Polluters are required to buy those credits to match their pollution outputs. Some of the cost producers pay for pollution will result in higher costs for consumers, who as citizens are additionally faced with the environmental costs of the pollution. Under the cap and dividend system, public revenues raised from the sale of pollution credits is rebated to citizens or to consumers as a subsidy for increasing efficiency.&lt;ref name="cap2"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Barnes |accessdate=2010-11-30 |title=How cap and dividend works |url= http://www.capanddividend.org/?q=readfirst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The goal of this type of pseudo-tax is to reduce carbon emission rates. This is similar to the cap-and-trade system, with the main difference being that citizens receive dividend payments financed from [[economic rent|pollution rents]] that are publicly captured, as opposed to leaving the value of pollution [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]] to become financialized as private assets.&lt;ref name="cap3"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter. |last=Barnes |date = December 2008| accessdate=2010-11-30 |title=Cap and Dividend, Not Trade: Making Polluters Pay |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=cap-and-divident-not-trade}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dividend payments can also finance the addition of incentives designed to encourage consumers to increase energy efficiency, whereas cap-and-trade does not directly involve the consumer. The Healthy Climate Trust Fund is the agency in the U.S. government who are overseeing the cap-and-dividend policy. They will accomplish this by collecting and distributing the funds from the capping process.&lt;ref name="cap1"/&gt;

==Definitions==
'''''Provided are convenient definitions pertaining to cap-and-dividend:'''''
* '''Cap-and-Dividend:''' &lt;blockquote&gt;Cap-and-[[dividend]] is an approach to reducing [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions. The concept is simple: a limit or cap is placed on greenhouse gases from certain sources; these sources are required to obtain permits to cover their greenhouse gas emissions and dividends from the sale of the permits are returned directly to consumers through rebates or tax credits to compensate for increased energy costs. The cap is typically placed on 'upstream' sources – like fossil fuel suppliers – to cover the carbon content of the fuels they distribute. Some limited trading may be allowed, but typically only among covered sources.&lt;ref name="cap5"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Agricultural Cultural Market Working Group |last=(ACMWG) |year = 2009 | accessdate=2010-11-30 |title=Cap-and-Dividend and Agriculture |url= http://www.agcarbonmarkets.com/documents/ACMWG%20White%20Paper_Cap-and-Dividend%20and%20Ag_Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The history of the cap and trade system is very recent; it was created and is especially relevant in the political world recently.

===Creation===
Little is known about the origin of the idea, but most likely the idea came from multiple sources as an answer to the problems of cap and trade. It was popularized by American entrepreneur [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] and such groups as [[On the Commons]], a network group which promotes environmental, community-related solutions.&lt;ref name="cap6"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=de Place |date=5 June 2009| accessdate=30 Nov 2010 |title=Van Hollen's Cap and Dividend |url= http://daily.sightline.org/daily_score/archive/2009/05/06/van-hollens-cap-and-dividend | publisher= [[Sightline Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Van Hollen Cap and Dividend Bill, 2009===
[[Chris Van Hollen]] (D-Md.) put a bill before Congress on April 1, 2009, pertaining to carbon reductions and including the cap and dividend system. The cosponsors of the bill were Rep [[Earl Blumenauer]] [OR-3], Rep [[Lloyd Doggett]] [TX-25], Rep [[Mike Thompson (California politician)|Mike Thompson]] [CA-1], Rep [[Lynn C. Woolsey]] [CA-6].&lt;ref name="cap10"&gt;{{cite journal |first=House of|last=Representatives |date = 2009-04-21| accessdate=2010-12-09 |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status, 111th Congress (2009 - 2010), H.R.1862 |url= http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d111:2:./temp/~bdm3ar:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;%7C/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS;c=111|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The goals of the Cap and Dividend Act of 2009 are as follows:'''
* ''Set robust, scientifically driven emissions reductions targets at 25 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 85 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 for covered emissions.''
* ''Place an upstream compliance obligation on the first seller of [[fossil fuels]] into the U.S. market.''
* ''Auction 100 percent of carbon permits.''
* ''Include Border Adjustment provisions to protect U.S. manufacturers of carbon-intensive goods from imports of carbon-intensive goods originating in countries without comparable climate legislation and assistance for U.S. exporters of carbon-intensive goods to compete effectively in the international marketplace with carbon-intensive goods originating in countries without comparable climate legislation.''
* ''Return 100% of auction proceeds in the form of a monthly Consumer Dividend to every lawful resident of the United States with a valid Social Security number.''&lt;ref name="cap7"&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Hollen Introduces the Cap and Dividend Act of 2009|url=http://vanhollen.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=142911|website=archive.is|accessdate=8 February 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212013946/http://vanhollen.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=142911|archivedate=12 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This bill looked to create the Healthy Climate Trust Fund, the potential agency for managing and distributing dividend funds.&lt;ref name="cap10"/&gt;

The status of the bill included a referral to [[House Ways and Means Committee]] on 4/1/2009, then a referral to [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]] also on 4/1/2009, and then on 4/2/2009 a referral to the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Environment]]. The bill was reviewed by the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Environment]] but it didn't pass as an Act.&lt;ref name="cap10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1862 (111th): Cap and Dividend Act of 2009|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1862|website=GovTrack|publisher=Civic Impulse|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Van Hollen again tried to introduce a Cap and Dividend bill in July 2014, but it did not pass as an Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trout|first1=Kelly|title=Congressman Chris Van Hollen introduces innovative bill to fight climate change while aiding middle class Americans|url=http://chesapeakeclimate.org/press-releases/congressman-chris-van-hollen-introduces-innovative-bill-to-fight-climate-change-while-aiding-middle-class-americans/|publisher=Chesapeake Climate Action Network|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1027 (114th): Healthy Climate and Family Security Act of 2015|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr1027|website=GovTrack|publisher=Civic Impulse|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOP elder statesmen call on Trump, 2017===
Several elder statesmen of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Grand Old Party (GOP)]], namely former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretaries of State]] [[James Baker]] and [[George Shultz]] and former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Paulson|Hank Paulson]], co-authored a report with [[Ted Halstead#Climate Leadership Council|Ted Halstead of Climate Leadership Council]]; and economists [[Martin Feldstein]] and [[Greg Mankiw]]; calling upon [[President Trump]] to introduce cap and dividend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[James Baker|Baker]]|first1=James|last2=[[George Schultz|Schultz]]|first2=George|title=A Conservative Answer to Climate Change|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-conservative-answer-to-climate-change-1486512334|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milman|first1=Oliver|title=Republican elders call for new national carbon tax to replace federal regulations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/08/republican-national-carbon-tax-climate-change|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Martin Feldstein|Feldstein]]|first1=Martin|last2=[[Greg Mankiw|Mankiw]]|first2=Greg|last3=[[Ted Halstead|Halstead]]|first3=Ted|title=A Conservative Case for Climate Action|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/opinion/a-conservative-case-for-climate-action.html|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crooks|first1=Ed|title=Republican Grandees Make Case for US Emissions Tax|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d8c2ff78-edcf-11e6-ba01-119a44939bb6|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The Financial Times]]|publisher=[[The Nikkei]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mankiw was interviewed about the use of a carbon tax in the 2016 [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] documentary ''[[Before the Flood (film)|Before the Flood]]''.

==Economy==
Cap and dividend, like cap and trade, would have had a direct impact on the [[economy]]. With a policy like this it will affect not only the major companies that will be taxed but also every household through a chain reaction of product price increases. There will be variations on how much of an impact this policy would have on different geographical areas based on population and how industrialized the area is.&lt;ref name="cap9"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Barnes | accessdate=2010-12-03 |title=How Cap and Dividend Works |url=http://www.capanddividend.org/?q=readfirst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on companies===
Caps will be placed on carbon emissions and every company that use carbon-based fuel to produce some sort of product will have to buy carbon permits. In the cap and dividend policy, every company will have to buy a carbon permit and this differs from the cap and trade policy because there will be no permits given away for free.&lt;ref name="cap1"/&gt; The permits, collected by the government, will then be used to account for the dividends given back to the people. However, because of the permits' cost, the companies will be forced to raise the prices of their products so they can still make profit.&lt;ref name="cap1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cap8"&gt;{{cite journal |first=James K. |last=Boyce |date = 1 November 2007| accessdate=8 February 2017 |title=Cap and Dividend: How to Curb Global Warming While Protecting the Incomes of American Families |url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/peri_workingpapers/108/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price increase will be felt by all customers of these various products.

===Effect on households===
The cost of everything made using carbon-based fuels will increase and will be felt by everyone. However, the people most affected by the price increases are the people emitting more carbon. For example: Someone that drives a Hummer is going to have to buy more gas, which the price is increased as well, than a family that drives a fuel-efficient car.&lt;ref name="cap9"/&gt; Every month the government will automatically send a dividend to offset the cost of the high prices. The people that conserve the most and produced the least amount of carbon emissions will get a bigger dividend than a person who has been producing a large amount of carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="cap1"/&gt;

==Comparison to Cap and Dividend and other Policies==
There have been numerous ideas and attempts to reduce the amount of carbon emissions. Policies have been proposed and rejected. One of the policies that has been actually used is known as the cap and trade system. It is currently being used in Europe and has influenced the people living there.&lt;ref name="cap3"/&gt;

There are several differences between cap and trade and cap and dividend that ultimately define each of them. A cap is placed on carbon emissions and green house gas (GHG) emissions in both policies. Based on the caps there are carbon emission permits that give the companies the ability to produce more carbon emissions then the cap would permit. These permits are auctioned off to different companies. In the cap and trade system only a set amount are auctioned off and the rest are given away for free. In the cap and dividend system all the permits are auctioned off. In both systems the cost of buying the permits will increase the price of the product made by the companies; oil, electric, and products that make carbon emissions. The thought process behind this is to dissuade the purchase of mass quantities of these products i.e. less carbon/GHG emissions.&lt;ref name="cap3"/&gt; While the cap and trade system uses the high prices to control the amount of carbon emissions they do not provide a good incentive to limit carbon emission. Cap and dividend uses the dividends to reward the people that conserve the most. This will benefit the poor the most because of their living situations and this is found to be a problem with lots of people critiquing the policy.&lt;ref name="cap10"/&gt;

'''Compensatory growth''', known as '''catch-up growth''' and '''compensatory gain''', is an accelerated growth of an organism following a period of slowed development, particularly as a result of [[nutrient]] deprivation.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David E.

An organism can recover to normal weight without additional time.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; Sometimes when the nutrient restriction is severe, the growth period is extended to reach the normal weight.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; If the nutrient restriction is severe enough, the organism may have permanent [[stunted growth]] where it does not ever reach normal weight.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; Usually in animals, complete recovery from [[carbohydrate]] and [[protein]] restriction occurs.&lt;ref name="fundamentals of modern agriculture"/&gt;

In animals, [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] and [[Homeorhesis|homeorhetic]] processes are involved in the abnormally high growth rates.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; Homeostatic processes usually affect compensatory growth in the short term, whereas homeorhetic processes usually have a long-term effect.&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt;

The exact biological mechanisms for compensatory growth are poorly understood, though it is clear that in some animals the [[endocrine system]] is involved in the [[metabolism]] and nutrient partitioning in the tissues.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. G. Scanes|title=Biology of growth of domestic animals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4Qau0BMeoIC&amp;pg=PA352|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=24 April 2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-2906-7|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
First, during nutrient starvation, a reduction of [[Basal animal metabolic rate|basal metabolism]] takes place.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"/&gt; The gut tissues are the first tissues to be reduced in weight and activity.&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"/&gt; Then, during the realimentation (re-feeding) phase, an increase in feeding enables more dietary protein and energy to be contributed for tissue growth instead of basal metabolism.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; The gut tissues are the first to increase in weight, followed by muscle tissue and finally adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"/&gt;

==Studies of growth in anorexic human patients==
[[Anorexia nervosa]] can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth, pubertal maturation or prior to attaining peak bone mass.&lt;ref name="medical"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0968(200003)8:2&lt;170::AID-ERV338&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y|title=Medical complications of anorexia nervosa in children and young adolescents|year=2000|last1=Nicholls|first1=Dasha|last2=Stanhope|first2=Richard|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=8|issue=2|pages=170–180}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotropins in patients with anorexia nervosa has been frequently documented.&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt; In some cases, especially where onset is pre-pubertal, physical consequences such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually fully reversible.&lt;ref name="CG9FullGuideline"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health|year=2004 |title=Core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of anorexia nervosa are not significant and/or if the illness is accompanied with delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may negate the deleterious effects of undernutrition on stature by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls.&lt;ref name="pediatrics"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Factors affecting compensatory growth==
In 1960, Wilson and Osborne outlined six factors that could affect compensatory growth in a review article.&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; The importance of each, some, or all of these factors is not well understood.&lt;ref name="fundamentals of modern agriculture"/&gt; These factors are as follows:&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fundamentals of modern agriculture"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;
*  The nature of the restricted diet
*  The degree of severity of undernutrition
*  The duration of the period of undernutrition
*  The stage of development at the commencement of undernutrition
*  The relative rate of maturity of the species
*  The pattern of re-alimenation

Animal factors that can affect compensatory growth may include the maturity level and fat proportion of the animal at the time of nutrient deprivation, the genotype, the gender, and the metabolic changes.&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt; The stage of development of the animal when the nutrient restriction occurs greatly affects its body composition.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt;

'''''Flaminio Costa v ENEL''''' (1964) Case 6/64 was a [[landmark decision]] of the [[European Court of Justice]] which established the [[supremacy (European Union law)|primacy]] of [[European Union law]] (then Community law) over the laws of its [[Member state of the European Union|member states]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Hilf, Meinhard (2012). Costa v. ENEL case, in Wolfrum, Rudiger (ed.): ''The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 824.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Mr. Costa was an Italian citizen who had owned shares in an electricity company, Edisonvolta, and opposed the nationalisation of the [[electricity sector in Italy]]. He asked to two lower courts in Milano (two different ''Giudice Conciliatore'') to ascertain that the real creditor of his electricity bill (a relatively small amount of money, 1,925 [[Italian lira|lire]]) was the nationalised company, Edisonvolta, and not the newly established state company, [[Enel]]. He argued that the nationalisation of the electricity industry violated the [[Treaty of Rome]] and the [[Italian Constitution]]. The first ''Giudice Conciliatore'' of Milan referred the case to the [[Italian Constitutional Court]] and the second ''Giudice Conciliatore'' referred it to the [[European Court of Justice]].

The Italian Constitution Court gave judgement in March 1964, ruling that while the Italian Constitution allowed for the limitation of sovereignty for international organisation like the European Economic Community, it did not upset that normal rule of [[statutory interpretation]] that where two statutes conflict the subsequent one prevails (''[[Implied repeal|lex posterior derogat legi anteriori/priori]]''). As a result the Treaty of Rome which was incorporated into Italian law in 1958 could not prevail over the electricity nationalisation law which was enacted in 1962.&lt;ref name="evol"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last=Craig |editor2-first=Gráinne |editor2-last=de Búrca |first1=Bruno |last1=de Witte |work=The Evolution of EU Law |title=Direct Effect, Primacy, and the Nature of the Legal Order |isbn=978-0-19-959296-8|publisher=Oxford University Press |place=Oxford |year=2011 |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the decision of the constitutional court, the Italian government submitted to the ECJ that the Italian court's request for a [[preliminary ruling]] from the ECJ was inadmissible on the grounds that as the Italian court was not empowered to set aside the national law in question, a preliminary ruling would not serve any valid purpose.

==Judgment==
The ECJ held the Treaty of Rome rule on an undistorted market was one on which the Commission alone could challenge the Italian government. As an individual, Costa had no standing to challenge the decision because that Treaty provision had no direct effect. However, Costa could raise a point of EC law against a national government in legal proceeding before the courts in that Member State: EC law would not be effective if Costa could not challenge national law on the basis of its alleged incompatibility with EC law.&lt;ref&gt;Case 6/64 Costa v ENEL [1964] ECR 595&lt;/ref&gt;


{{Cquote|As opposed to other international treaties, the Treaty instituting the E.E.C. has created its own order which was integrated with the national order of the member-States the moment the Treaty came into force; as such, it is binding upon them. In fact, by creating a Community of unlimited duration, having its own institutions, its own personality and its own capacity in law, apart from having international standing and more particularly, real powers resulting from a limitation of competence or a transfer of powers from the States to the Community, the member-States, albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves. The reception, within the laws of each member-State, of provisions having a Community source, and more particularly of the terms and of the spirit of the Treaty, has as a corollary the impossibility, for the member-State, to give preference to a unilateral and subsequent measure against a legal order accepted by them on a basis of reciprocity.

[...]

It follows from all these observations that the law stemming from the treaty, an independent source of law, could not, because of its special and original nature, be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed, without being deprived of its character as community law and without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Case 6/64 Costa v ENEL [1964] ECR 593&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Significance==
This case is additional confirmation that under Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) a court has an obligation to refer cases that have reached the highest point of appeal in their respective country if there is a question of the application of EU Law. Costa had reached its highest point of appeal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25091">An '''ecological network''' is a representation of the [[biological interaction|biotic interactions]] in an [[ecosystem]], in which species (nodes) are connected by pairwise interactions (links).  These interactions can be [[trophic web|trophic]] or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]].  Ecological networks are used to describe and compare the structures of real ecosystems, while network models are used to investigate the effects of network structure on properties such as [[ecosystem stability]].

== Properties ==
Historically, research into ecological networks developed from descriptions of trophic relationships in aquatic [[food web]]s; however, recent work has expanded to look at other food webs as well as webs of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]]s. Results of this work have identified several important properties of ecological networks.

'''[[Complexity]]''' ([linkage density): the average number of links per species.  Explaining the observed high levels of complexity in ecosystems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Berlow | first2 = E.L. | last3 = Dunne | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Barabasi | first4 = A.L. | last5 = Martinez | first5 = N.D. | year = 2002 | title = Two degrees of separation in complex food webs | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 12913–12916 | doi=10.1073/pnas.192448799| pmc = 130559 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9912913W }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been one of the main challenges and motivations for ecological network analysis, since early theory predicted that complexity should lead to instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimm | first1 = S.L. | year = 1984 | title = The complexity and stability of ecosystems | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 307 | issue = | pages = 321–326 | doi=10.1038/307321a0| bibcode = 1984Natur.307..321P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Connectivity (graph theory)|Connectance]]''': the proportion of possible links between species that are realized (links/species&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  In food webs, the level of connectance is related to the statistical distribution of the links per species.  The distribution of links changes from (partial) [[power-law]] to exponential to [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniform]] as the level of connectance increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunne | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Williams | first2 = R.J. | last3 = Martinez | first3 = N.D. | year = 2002 | title = Food-web structure and network theory: The role of connectance and size | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 12917–12922 | doi=10.1073/pnas.192407699 | pmid=12235364 | pmc=130560| bibcode = 2002PNAS...9912917D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The observed values of connectance in empirical food webs appear to be accountable for by constraints on an organisms diet breadth driven by [[optimal foraging]] behaviour.This links the structure of these ecological networks to the behaviour of individual organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beckerman | first1 = A.P. | last2 = Petchey | first2 = O.L. | last3 = Warren | first3 = P.H. | year = 2006 | title = Foraging biology predicts food web complexity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 13745–13749 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0603039103 | pmid=16954193 | pmc=1560085| bibcode = 2006PNAS..10313745B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Degree distribution]]''': the degree distribution of an ecological network is the cumulative distribution for the number of links each species has. The degree distributions of food webs have been found to display the same universal functional form. The degree distribution can be split into its two component parts, links to a species' prey (aka. in degree) and links to a species' predators (aka- out degree). Both the in degree and out degree distributions display their own universal functional forms. As there is a faster decay of the out-degree distribution than the in degree distribution we can expect that on average in a food web a species will have more in links than out links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stouffer | first1 = D.B. | year = 2010 | title = Scaling from individuals to networks in food webs | url = | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 44–51 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01644.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Clustering coefficient|Clustering]]''': the proportion of species that are directly linked to a focal species.  A focal species in the middle of a cluster may be a [[keystone species]], and its loss could have large effects on the network.

'''Compartmentalization''': the division of the network into relatively independent sub-networks.  Some ecological networks have been observed to be compartmentalized by body size&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid-Araya | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Schmid | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Robertson | first3 = A. | last4 = Winterbottom | first4 = J. | last5 = Gjerlov | first5 = C. | last6 = Hildrew | first6 = A.G. | year = 2002 | title = Connectance in stream food webs | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 1056–1062 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2656.2002.00668.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reuman | first1 = D.C. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = J.E. | year = 2004 | title = Trophic links' length and slope in the Tuesday Lake food web with species' body mass and numerical abundance | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 852–866 | doi=10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00856.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by spatial location.&lt;ref name="krause03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krause | first1 = A.E. | last2 = Frank | first2 = K.A. | last3 = Mason | first3 = D.M. | last4 = Ulanowicz | first4 = R.E. | last5 = Taylor | first5 = W.W. | year = 2003 | title = Compartments revealed in food-web structure | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 426 | issue = | pages = 282–285 | doi=10.1038/nature02115 | pmid=14628050| bibcode = 2003Natur.426..282K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also exists which suggests that compartmentilization in food webs appears to result from patterns of species' diet contiguity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guimera | first1 = R. | last2 = Stouffer | first2 = D.B. | last3 = Sales-Pardo | first3 = M. | last4 = Leicht | first4 = E.A. | last5 = Newman | first5 = M.E.J. | last6 = Ameral | first6 = L.A.N. | year = 2010 | title = Origin of compartmentalization in food webs | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 2941–2951 | doi=10.1890/09-1175.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adaptive foraging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nuwagaba | first1 = S. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = F. | last3 = Hui | first3 = C. | year = 2015 | title = A hybrid behavioural rule of adaptation and drift explains the emergent architecture of antagonistic networks | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 282 | issue = 1807 | pages = 20150320 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.0320 | pmid=25925104 | pmc=4424652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Nestedness]]''': the degree to which species with few links have a sub-set of the links of other species, rather than a different set of links.  In highly nested networks, [[guild (ecology)|guilds]] of species that share an [[ecological niche]] contain both generalists (species with many links) and specialists (species with few links, all shared with the generalists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Domínguez-García V, Muñoz MA |year=2013 |title=Factors Determining Nestedness in Complex Networks |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |pages=e74025 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0074025|bibcode=2013PLoSO...874025J }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In mutualistic networks, nestedness is often asymmetrical, with specialists of one guild linked to the generalists of the partner guild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bascompte | first1 = J. | last2 = Jordano | first2 = P. | last3 = Melian | first3 = C.J. | last4 = Olesen | first4 = J.M. | year = 2003 | title = The nested assembly of plant-animal mutualistic networks | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 9383–9387 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1633576100 | pmid=12881488 | pmc=170927| bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.9383B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of nestedness is determined not by species features but overall network depictors (e.g. network size and connectance) and can be predicted by a dynamic adaptive model with species rewiring to maximize individual fitness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = F. | last2 = Hui | first2 = C. | last3 = Terblanche | first3 = J.S. | year = 2011 | title = An interaction switch predicts the nested architecture of mutualistic networks | url = | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 797–803 | doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01647.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the fitness of the whole community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suweis | first1 = S. | last2 = Simini | first2 = F. | last3 = Banavar | first3 = J | last4 = Maritan | first4 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Emergence of structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 500 | issue = | pages = 449–452 | doi=10.1038/nature12438 | pmid=23969462| arxiv = 1308.4807 | bibcode = 2013Natur.500..449S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Network motif]]''': Motifs are unique sub-graphs composed of n-nodes found embedded in a network. For instance there exist thirteen unique motif structures containing three species, some of these correspond to familiar interaction modules studied by population ecologists such as [[food chains]], [[apparent competition]], or [[intraguild predation]]. Studies investigating motif structures of ecological networks, by examining patterns of under/over representation of certain motifs compared to a random graph, have found that food webs have particular motif structures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stouffer | first1 = D.B. | last2 = Sales-Pardo | first2 = Camacho | last3 = Jiang | first3 = W. | last4 = Ameral | first4 = L.A.N. | year = 2007 | title = Evidence for the existence of a robust pattern of prey selection in food webs | url = | journal = Proc.

== Stability ==
The relationship between ecosystem complexity and stability is a major topic of interest in [[ecology]].  Use of ecological networks makes it possible to analyze the effects of the network properties described above on the stability of an ecosystem.  Ecosystem complexity was once thought to reduce stability by enabling the effects of disturbances, such as species loss or species invasion, to spread and amplify through the network.  However, other characteristics of network structure have been identified that reduce the spread of indirect effects and thus enhance ecosystem stability.&lt;ref&gt;Suweis, S., Grilli, J., Banavar, J. R., Allesina, S., &amp; Maritan, A. (2015) Effect of localization on the stability of mutualistic ecological networks. "Nature Communications", 6&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between complexity and stability can even be inverted in food webs with sufficient trophic coherence, so that increases in biodiversity would make a community more stable rather than less.&lt;ref name="johnson2014"/&gt;

The nested structure of mutualisitic networks was shown to promote the capacity of species to persist under increasingly harsh circumstances. Most likely, because the nested structure of mutualistic networks helps species to indirectly support each other when circumstances are harsh. This indirect facilitation helps species to survive, but it also means that under harsh circumstances one species cannot survive without the support of the other. As circumstances become increasingly harsh, a tipping point may therefore be passed at which the populations of a large number of species may collapse simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Lever_et_al&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lever | first1 = J.

== Other applications ==
Additional applications of ecological networks include exploration of how the community context affects pairwise interactions.  The community of species in an ecosystem is expected to affect both the ecological interaction and [[coevolution]] of pairs of species.  Related, spatial applications are being developed for studying [[metapopulation]]s, [[epidemiology]], and the [[co-operation (evolution)|evolution of cooperation]].  In these cases, networks of habitat patches (metapopulations) or individuals (epidemiology, social behavior), make it possible to explore the effects of spatial heterogeneity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">The '''F region''' of the [[ionosphere]] is home to the F layer of ionization, also called the '''Appleton–Barnett layer''', after the English physicist [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]] and New Zealander [[Miles Aylmer Fulton Barnett|Miles Barnett]]. As with other ionospheric sectors, 'layer' implies a concentration of [[plasma (physics)]], while 'region' is the volume that contains the said layer. The F region contains ionized gases at a height of around 150–800&amp;nbsp;km above sea level, placing it in the Earth’s [[thermosphere]], a hot region in the upper [[atmosphere]], and also in the [[heterosphere]], where chemical composition varies with height. Generally speaking, the F region has the highest concentration of free [[electrons]] and [[ions]] anywhere in the atmosphere. It may be thought of as comprising two layers, the F1-and F2-layers.

The F-region is located directly above the [[E region]] (formerly the Kennelly-Heaviside layer) and below the [[protonosphere]]. It acts as a dependable reflector of HF radio signals as it is not affected by atmospheric conditions, although its ionic composition varies with the sunspot cycle. It reflects normal-incident frequencies at or below the [[critical frequency]] (approximately 10&amp;nbsp;MHz) and partially absorbs waves of higher frequency.

==F1 and F2 layers==
The F1 layer is the lower sector of the F layer and exists from about 150 to 220&amp;nbsp;km above the surface of the Earth and only during daylight hours. It is composed of a mixture of molecular [[ions]] O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and atomic ions O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kamide2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kamide|first1=Yohsuke|last2=Chian|first2=Abraham C.-L.|title=Handbook of the solar-terrestrial environment|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-46315-3|page=199|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the F1 region, atomic oxygen becomes the dominant constituent because lighter particles tend to occupy higher altitudes above the [[turbopause]] (at ~100&amp;nbsp;km). This atomic oxygen provides the O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; atomic ions that make up the F2 layer.
The F1 layer has approximately 5 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; e/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (free electrons per cubic centimeter) at noontime and minimum [[sunspot]] activity, and increases to roughly 2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; e/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; during maximum sunspot activity. The density falls off to below 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; e/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at night.
* The F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; layer merges into the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer at night.
* Though fairly regular in its characteristics, it is not observable everywhere or on all days. The principal [[reflecting layer]] during the summer for paths of 2,000 to 3,500&amp;nbsp;km is the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; layer. However, this depends upon the frequency of a propagating signal. The E layer electron density and resultant MUF, [[maximum usable frequency]], during high solar activity periods can refract and thus block signals of up to about 15&amp;nbsp;MHz from reaching the F1 and F2 regions, with the result that distances are much shorter than possible with refractions from the F1 and F2 regions. But extremely low radiation-angle signals (lower than about 6&amp;nbsp;degrees) can reach distances of 3000&amp;nbsp;km via E&amp;nbsp;region refractions.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Weiss, ''Ionospheric Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas for the QRP DXer'', Milliwatt QRP Books, 2011, pp. 1-16, 1-22 to 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer exists from about 220 to 800&amp;nbsp;km above the surface of the Earth. The F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer is the principal reflecting layer for HF [[telecommunication|communications]] during both day and night. The horizon-limited distance for one-[[hop (telecommunications)|hop]] F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[radio propagation|propagation]] is usually around 4,000&amp;nbsp;km. The F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer has about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; e/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. However, variations are usually large, irregular, and particularly pronounced during magnetic storms. The F layer behaviour is dominated by the complex thermospheric winds.

==Usage in radio communication==
Critical F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer frequencies are the ones that will not go through the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer.&lt;ref name="spacew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacew.com/www/fof2.html|title=Near-Real-Time F2-Layer Critical Frequency Map|publisher=spacew.com|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Electronics of Radio|author=Rutledge, D.|date=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521646451|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=203BJeFu5qQC|pages=2–237|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dipmeter and its probe coils.jpg|thumb|250px|A dipmeter and several accessory probe coils. (Mitamusenkenkyūsho 三田無線研究所株式会社 DELICA DMC-230S2)]]
[[File:Heathkit GD-1B Grid Dip Meters.agr.jpg|thumb|Two [[Heathkit]] Grid Dip Meters with a set of tuning coils.]]
'''Grid dip oscillator''' ('''GDO'''), also called '''grid dip meter''', '''dip meter''', '''dipmeter''', or just '''dipper''', is a [[measuring instrument]] to measure [[resonant frequency]] of [[radio frequency]] circuits. It measures the amount of absorption of a [[high frequency]] inductively coupled magnetic field by nearby objects.  It is an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] whose amplitude changes when near a resonant circuit which is tuned to the frequency the oscillator generates.    At the heart of the instrument is a tunable [[LC circuit]] with a coil that serves as a loose inductive coupling to the measured LC [[resonant circuit]].  Resonance is indicated by a dip in the meter indicator on the device, usually based on a [[microammeter]].

== History ==
Grid dip oscillators were first developed in the 1920s, and were built with [[vacuum tube]]s.  The devices measured the value of the tube's [[control grid|grid]] current.  Modern grid dip oscillators are [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices and are more versatile.  Solid-state versions of the grid dip oscillator are sometimes called '''gate dip oscillators''' or '''emitter dip oscillators''' in reference to the parts of the [[semiconductor]] whose current is being measured instead of the grid current on a vacuum tube.

== Principle of operation ==
[[Image:Gate-dip-oscillator-schematic.png|thumb|left|Oscillator portion of the schematic]]
Central to the circuit is a [[variable frequency oscillator]] with interchangeable coil and [[tuning capacitor]]s (ganged) as shown. When the oscillator's coil is in the vicinity of another resonant circuit, the pair behaves as a low Q [[transformer]], especially if the respective resonant frequencies match; this affects the frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the GDO, which is sensed in any of several ways, the simplest of which is to attach an [[ammeter]].&lt;ref name="historical_schematic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jumpjet.info/Pioneering-Wireless/eJournals/RCA/1961-12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218143022/http://www.jumpjet.info/Pioneering-Wireless/eJournals/RCA/1961-12.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different types of haze that can occur in materials:
*'''Reflection haze''' occurs when light is reflected from the surface of a material.
*'''Transmission haze''' occurs when light passes through a material.

The measurement and control of both types during manufacture is essential to ensure optimum quality, acceptability and suitability for  purpose of the product.
For instance, in automotive manufacturing, a high quality reflective appearance is desirable with low reflection haze and high contrast whilst in packaging clear, low haze, highly transmissive films are required so that the contents, foods etc., can be clearly observed.

== Reflection Haze ==


&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Haze example.jpg|400px|Two panels exhibiting haze]] --&gt;


'''Reflection Haze''' is an [[optical]] phenomenon usually associated with high [[Gloss (optics)|gloss]] surfaces, it is a common surface problem that can affect appearance quality.  The reflection from an ideal high gloss surface should be clear and radiant, however due to imperfections in the surface caused by microscopic structures or textures (≈ 0.01mm wavelength) the reflection can appear milky or hazy reducing the quality of its overall appearance.
            
Causes of this could be due to a number of factors –
                                                               
* Poor dispersion
* Method of applying the coating
* Variations in drying, curing or baking
* Types of materials used in the formulation
* Polishing or abrasion





A high gloss surface with haze exhibits a milky finish with low reflective contrast- reflected highlights and lowlights are less pronounced.
On surfaces with haze, halos are visible around the reflections of strong light sources.

==Measurement==

Measurement of reflection haze is primarily defined under three International test standards:

'''ASTM E430''' &lt;ref&gt;ASTM E430-2011 Standard Test Methods for Measurement of Gloss of High-Gloss Surfaces by Abridged Goniophotometry&lt;/ref&gt;
comprising three test methods:

Test method A specifies a 30° angle for specular gloss measurement, 28° or 32° for narrow-angle reﬂection haze measurement and 25° or 35° for wide-angle reﬂection haze measurement.

Test method B specifies a 20° angle for specular gloss measurement and 18.1° and 21.9° for narrow-angle reﬂection haze measurement.

Test method C specifies a 30° angle for specular gloss measurement, 28° or 32° for narrow-angle reﬂection haze measurement and 15° wide-angle reﬂection haze measurement.

'''ASTM D4039''' &lt;ref&gt;ASTM D4039–09(2015) Standard Test Method for Reflection Haze of High-Gloss Surfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

Test method specifies gloss measurements to be made at 20° and 60°, the haze index is then calculated as the difference between the 60° and 20° measurements.

'''ISO 13803''' &lt;ref&gt;ISO 13803:2014 (Paints and varnishes – Determination of haze on paint films at 20 degrees)&lt;/ref&gt;

Test method specifies a 20° angle for specular gloss measurement and 18.1° and 21.9° for narrow-angle reﬂection haze measurement.

All test methods specify that measurements should be made with visible light according to CIE spectral luminous efficiency function V(λ) in the CIE 1931 standard observer and CIE standard illuminant C.

As most commercially available glossmeters have gloss measurement angles of 20°, 60° and 85° haze measurement is incorporated at either 20° (ISO 13803 / ASTM E430 method B) or at 20° and 60° ( ASTM D4039). There are however some manufacturers that offer glossmeters with measurement angles of 30° and haze measurement in accordance with ASTM E430 Method A and C but are fewer in number, therefore for the purposes of detailing haze measurement theory only the first three methods will be included.


'''ISO 13803 / ASTM E430 method B'''

Both test methods measure specular gloss and haze together at 20° that means light is transmitted and received at an equal but opposite angle of 20°. 





Specular gloss is measured over an angular range that is limited by aperture dimensions as defined in ASTM Test Method D523. The angular measurement range for this at 20° is ±0.9° (19.1° - 20.9°). For haze measurement additional sensors are used either side of this range at 18.1° and 21.9° to measure the intensity of the scattered light. Both solid colours and those containing metallics can be measured using this method provided haze compensation is used (as detailed later).

'''ASTM D4039'''

This method can only be used on nonmetallic materials having a 60° specular gloss value greater than 70 in accordance with ASTM Test Method D523 / ISO 2813. Haze Index is calculated from gloss measurements made at 20 and 60 degrees as the difference between the two measurements (HI = G60-G20).





As measurements of specular gloss depend largely on the refractive index of the material being measured 20° gloss will change more noticeably than 60° gloss, therefore as haze index is calculated using these two measurements it too will be affected by the refractive index of the material. Evaluations of reflection haze using this test method are therefore confined to samples of roughly the same refractive index.


'''Haze compensation'''

It is important to note that the colour (luminous reflectance) of a material can greatly influence the measurement of reflection haze. As colour and haze are both components of scattered light (diffuse reflectance) they must be separated so that only the haze value is quantified; this is also true for metallics or coatings containing metallic pigments where a higher scattering exists.





As test method ASTM D4039 is only suitable for nonmetallic materials of more or less the same refractive index separation of the colour and haze components is not detailed. Haze index calculations and measurements using this test method will therefore produce higher haze results on brighter coloured materials than darker with the same level of haze present. The chart below shows these differences for various colours:-


[[File:Haze Comp - Uncomp 001.tif|400px|Graph showing the effects of haze compensation]]



Both ISO 13803 and ASTM E430 method B require a separate measurement of luminous reﬂectance, Y, to calculate compensated haze. The tri-stimulus value Y gives a measure of the lightness of the material as defined in ISO 7724-2 requiring a 45°/0° geometry to be used with standard illuminant C and 2° observer (although it is mentioned that slightly different conditions will not result in significant errors). Luminous reflectance measurements, Y, are required on both the sample material and a reference white; ISO 13803 details the use of a BaSO4 standard - Barium sulphate, a white crystalline solid having a white opaque appearance and high density as this material is a good substitute for a perfectly reflecting diffusor as defined under ISO 7724-2.

Compensated haze can then be calculated as -

H Comp = H Linear – Y Sample / Y BaSO4


Using the ISO / ASTM method therefore to measure luminous reflectance produces a reliable measurement of Y for non-metallic surfaces as the diffuse component is lambertian, i.e. it is equal in amplitude at all angles in relation to the sample surface. 


[[File:Using a diode array for haze measurement rhopoint.jpg|400px|Light reflections within a coating]]

However for metallic coatings and those containing speciality pigments, as the particles within the coating reflect the light directionally around the specular angle, little or no metallic reflection is present at the angle at which the luminosity is measured, therefore these types of coatings have an unexpectedly high haze reading.  Using a measurement angle which is closer to the region adjacent to the haze angle has proven successful in providing compatible readings on solid colours and also compensating for directional reflection from metallic coatings and speciality pigments


== Applications ==


Generally measurement of reflection haze is confined to high gloss paints and coatings and highly polished metals. Although there has been some degree of success using this measurement method for films it has proven unreliable due to variability caused by changes in the film thickness (internal refraction variations) and the background colour on which the film sample is placed. Generally haze measurement of films is performed using a transmission type hazemeter as described hereafter.


== Transmission Haze ==

'''Light and transparent materials'''


[[File:Lightmat.jpg|300px|light and transparent materials]]


When light strikes the surface of a transparent material the following interactions occur –


•	Light is reflected from the front surface of the material

•	Some light is refracted within the material (depending on thickness) and reflected from the second surface 

•	Light passes through the material at an angle which is determined by the refractive index of the material and the angle of illumination.


The light that passes through the transparent material can be affected by irregularities within it; these can include poorly dispersed particles, contaminants (i.e. dust particles) and/or air spaces. This causes the light to scatter in different directions from the normal the degree of which being related to the size and number of irregularities present. Small irregularities cause the light to scatter, or diffuse, in all directions whilst large ones cause the light to be scattered forward in a narrow cone shape. These two types of scattering behaviour are known as Wide Angle Scattering, which causes haze due to the loss of transmissive contrast, and Narrow Angle Scattering a measure of clarity or the “see through quality” of the material based on a reduction of sharpness.
  

These factors are therefore important for defining the transmitting properties of a transparent material-


'''Transmission''' – The amount of light that passes through the material without being scattered

'''Haze''' –  The amount of light that is subject to Wide Angle Scattering (At an angle greater than 2.5° from normal (ASTM D1003))

'''Clarity''' – The amount of light that is subject to Narrow Area Scattering (At an angle less than 2.5° from normal)

== Measurement ==


Measurement of these factors is defined in two International test standards-


'''ASTM D1003''' &lt;ref&gt;ASTM ASTM D1003 Standard Test Method for Haze and Luminous Transmittance of Transparent Plastics&lt;/ref&gt; – Comprising two test methods –

Procedure A – using a Hazemeter

Procedure B – using a Spectrophotometer


'''BS EN ISO 13468 Parts 1 and 2''' &lt;ref&gt;BS EN ISO 13468 Plastics -- Determination of the total luminous transmittance of transparent materials&lt;/ref&gt;

Part 1 – Using a single beam Hazemeter

Part 2 – Using a dual beam Hazemeter


The test methods specify the use of a Hazemeter as shown below -


[[File:Rhopoint transmission hazemeter drawing.jpg|426x426px|Transmission Haze Diagram]]


A collimated beam of light from a light source (ASTM D1003 - Illuminant C, BS EN ISO 13468 Parts 1 and 2 - Illuminant D65 ) passes through a sample mounted on the entrance port of an integrating sphere. 

The light, which is uniformly distributed by a matte white highly reflective coating on the sphere walls, is measured by a photodetector positioned at 90° from the entrance port. A baffle mounted between the photodetector and the entrance port prevents direct exposure from the port.

The exit port immediately opposite the entrance port contains a light trap to absorb all light from the light source when no sample is present. A shutter in this exit port coated with the same coating as the sphere walls allows the port to be opened and closed as required. 

Total transmittance is measured with the exit port closed.

Transmittance haze is measured with the exit port open. 

Commercially available Hazemeters of this type perform both measurements automatically, the only operator interaction being the placement of the sample material on the measurement (entrance) port of the device.

The '''Hubble Space Telescope''' ('''HST''') is a [[space observatory|space telescope]] that was launched into [[low Earth orbit]] in 1990&lt;!-- Full date, which shuttle, etc. is in infobox &amp; later in the article. See discussions on talk page and its archives about omission of these details. --&gt; and remains in operation. Although not the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2|first space telescope]], Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for [[astronomy]]. The HST is named after the [[astronomer]] [[Edwin Hubble]] and is one of NASA's [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]], along with the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]], the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_NASA_Great_Observatories_PS.html |title=NASA's Great Observatories |publisher=NASA |last=Canright |first=Shelley |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a {{convert|2.4|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} mirror, Hubble's four main instruments observe in the [[near ultraviolet]], [[visible spectrum|visible]], and [[near infrared]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]].  Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of [[Earth's atmosphere]] allows it to take extremely high-resolution images, with substantially lower [[background (astronomy)|background]] light than ground-based telescopes. Hubble has recorded some of the most detailed [[visible spectrum|visible light]] images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time.  Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in [[astrophysics]], such as accurately [[Hubble's law#Using Hubble space telescope data|determining the rate of expansion of the universe]].

The HST was built by the United States space agency [[NASA]], with contributions from the [[European Space Agency]].  The [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] controls the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/ |title=Hubble Essentials |website=Hubblesite.org |access-date=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923. Hubble was funded in the 1970s, with a proposed launch in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]] (1986). When finally launched in 1990, Hubble's main mirror was found to have [[spherical aberration]], compromising the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a [[STS-61|servicing mission]] in 1993.

Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by [[astronaut]]s.  After launch by {{OV|Discovery}} in 1990, five subsequent Space Shuttle missions repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments.  The fifth mission was initially canceled on safety grounds following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] (2003). However, after spirited public discussion, NASA administrator [[Michael D. Griffin|Mike Griffin]] approved the [[STS-125|fifth servicing mission]], completed in 2009. The telescope is operating {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, and could last until 2030–2040.&lt;ref name="cbsnews20130530"/&gt; Its scientific successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST), is scheduled for launch in March 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-completes-webb-telescope-review-commits-to-launch-in-early-2021 |title=NASA Completes Webb Telescope Review, Commits to Launch in Early 2021 |publisher=NASA |date=June 27, 2018 |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, [[Hermann Oberth]]—considered a father of modern rocketry, along with [[Robert H. Goddard]] and [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]—published ''{{lang|de|Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen}}'' ("The Rocket into Planetary Space"), which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled into Earth orbit by a rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen |last=Oberth |first=Hermann |publisher=R. Oldenbourg-Verlay |page=85 |date=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced back as far as 1946, to the [[astronomer]] [[Lyman Spitzer]]'s paper "Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory".&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Lyman Jr., "Report to Project Rand: Astronomical Advantages of an Extra-Terrestrial Observatory", reprinted in [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol5/ExploreUnknown.pdf ''NASA SP-2001-4407: Exploring the Unknown''], Chapter 3, Document III-1, p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he discussed the two main advantages that a space-based observatory would have over ground-based telescopes. First, the [[angular resolution]] (the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only by [[Diffraction-limited system|diffraction]], rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes stars to twinkle, known to astronomers as [[astronomical seeing|seeing]]. At that time ground-based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0.5–1.0&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s, compared to a theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of about 0.05&amp;nbsp;arcsec for a telescope with a [[mirror]] {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. Second, a space-based telescope could observe [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] light, which are strongly absorbed by the [[atmosphere]].

Spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope. In 1962, a report by the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] recommended the development of a [[space telescope]] as part of the [[Human spaceflight|space program]], and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/spitzer.shtml |title=About Lyman Spitzer, Jr |publisher=Caltech |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327091202/http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/spitzer.shtml |archivedate=March 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following [[World War II]], as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in [[rocket]] technology. The first ultraviolet [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of the [[Sun]] was obtained in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solar Ultraviolet Spectrum to 88 Kilometers |author=Baum, WA |display-authors=4 |author2=Johnson, FS |author3=Oberly, JJ |author4=Rockwood, CC |author5=Strain, CV |author6=Tousey, R. |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=70 |pages=781–782 |date=November 1946 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.70.781 |publisher=American Physical Society |issue=9–10 |bibcode=1946PhRv...70..781B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) launched the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] (OSO) to obtain UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/oso1.html |title=The First Orbiting Solar Observatory |date=June 26, 2003 |work=heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center |accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Ariel 1|orbiting solar telescope]] was launched in 1962 by the United Kingdom as part of the [[Ariel programme|Ariel space program]], and in 1966 NASA launched the first [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory]] (OAO) mission. OAO-1's battery failed after three days, terminating the mission. It was followed by [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2|OAO-2]], which carried out ultraviolet observations of [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] from its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/oao |title=OAO |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916121848/http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/oao |archivedate=September 16, 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OSO and OAO missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy, and in 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based [[reflecting telescope]] with a mirror {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for manned maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable [[Space Shuttle]] indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|p=32}}

=== Quest for funding ===
The continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, [[public spending]] cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|pp=33-34}}

In response a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers met [[United States House of Representatives|congressmen]] and [[United States Senate|senators]] in person, and large scale letter-writing campaigns were organized. The National Academy of Sciences published a report emphasizing the need for a space telescope, and eventually the Senate agreed to half of the budget that had originally been approved by Congress.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|p=34}}

The funding issues led to something of a reduction in the scale of the project, with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3&amp;nbsp;m to 2.4&amp;nbsp;m, both to cut costs&lt;ref name="gander"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Geoff |title=The telescope: its history, technology, and future |date=2007 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-12979-7 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware. A proposed precursor {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped, and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the [[European Space Agency]]. ESA agreed to provide funding and supply one of the first generation instruments for the telescope, as well as the [[solar cell]]s that would power it, and staff to work on the telescope in the United States, in return for European astronomers being guaranteed at least 15% of the observing time on the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;"Memorandum of Understanding Between The European Space Agency and The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration", reprinted in [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol5/ExploreUnknown.pdf ''NASA SP-2001-4407: Exploring the Unknown''], Chapter 3, Document III-29, p. 671.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress eventually approved funding of {{US$|36 million}} for 1978, and the design of the LST began in earnest, aiming for a launch date of 1983.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|p=34}} In 1983 the telescope was named after [[Edwin Hubble]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/hubble/chron.html |last=Okolski |first=Gabriel |title=A Chronology of the Hubble Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; who made one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century when he discovered that the [[universe]] is [[expanding universe|expanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubble.nasa.gov/overview/conception-part1.php |title=The Path to Hubble Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524211736/http://hubble.nasa.gov/overview/conception-part1.php |archivedate=May 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and engineering ===
[[File:Hubble mirror polishing.jpg|thumb|Grinding of Hubble's primary mirror at Perkin-Elmer, March 1979]]

Once the Space Telescope project had been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|pp=487-488}} MSFC commissioned the optics company [[PerkinElmer|Perkin-Elmer]] to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope. [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=489}}

=== Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) ===
Optically, the HST is a [[Cassegrain reflector]] of [[Ritchey–Chrétien telescope|Ritchey–Chrétien design]], as are most large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, is known for good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes that are hard to fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an [[accuracy]] of about a tenth of the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]], but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be [[diffraction-limited system|diffraction limited]] to take full advantage of the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of {{convert|10|nm|uin |abbr=off|lk=on|sigfig=1|sp=us}}, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light.&lt;ref name="ScienceSPF"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/249/4970/735.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hubble: The Case of the Single-Point Failure |journal=Science Magazine |first=MM |last=Waldrop |date=August 17, 1990 |volume=249 |issue=4970 |pages=735–736 |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |doi=10.1126/science.249.4970.735 |bibcode=1990Sci...249..735W}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15&amp;nbsp;°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.&lt;ref name="IR"/&gt;

[[File:Hubble backup mirror.jpg|thumb|left|The backup mirror, by Kodak; its inner support structure can be seen because it is not coated with a reflective surface]]

Perkin-Elmer intended to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated [[Computer-aided manufacturing|computer-controlled polishing machines]] to grind the mirror to the required shape.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=489}} However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to [[Kodak]] to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques.{{sfn|Allen|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|1990|pp=3-4}} (The team of Kodak and [[Itek]] also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused [[#Flawed mirror|such problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDF1731F93BA15754C0A966958260 |title=Losing Bid Offered 2 Tests on Hubble |agency=Associated Press |date=July 28, 1990 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Hubble Space Telescope Stand-in Gets Starring Role |date=September 21, 2001 |url=http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/news-release/releases/2001/h01-185.htm |author=Goddard Space Flight Center |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226075115/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/news-release/releases/2001/h01-185.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Backup Mirror, Hubble Space Telescope |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A20010288000 |publisher=National Air and Space Museum |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102124612/http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A20010288000 |archive-date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Itek mirror built as part of the effort is now used in the 2.4&amp;nbsp;m telescope at the [[Magdalena Ridge Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |author=Magdalena Ridge Observatory |title=2.4m Observatory Technical Note |date=January 1, 2008 |url=http://www.mro.nmt.edu/data/2.4m/doc-public/OTN-Overview.pdf |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |page=2 |version=1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror began in 1979, starting with a blank manufactured by [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]] from their ultra-low expansion [[glass]]. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates, each {{convert|1|in|mm|spell=in}} thick, sandwiching a [[honeycomb]] lattice. Perkin-Elmer simulated [[microgravity]] by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Design and fabrication of the NASA 2.4-meter space telescope |first1=Daniel J. |last1=McCarthy |first2=Terence A. |last2=Facey |work=Proc.

Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=496}} The mirror was completed by the end of 1981; it was washed using {{convert|2400|USgal|L}} of hot, [[deionized water]] and then received a reflective coating of {{convert|65|nm|uin |abbr=on|adj=mid|-thick}} [[aluminium|aluminum]] and a protective coating of {{convert|25|nm|uin |abbr=on|adj=mid|-thick}} [[magnesium fluoride]].&lt;ref name="IR"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Performance of HST as an Infrared Telescope |first1=M. |last1=Robberto |first2=A. |display-authors=4 |last2=Sivaramakrishnan |first3=J.

[[File:Early stages of Hubble construction.jpg|thumb|The OTA, metering truss, and secondary baffle are visible in this image of Hubble during early construction.]]

Doubts continued to be expressed about Perkin-Elmer's competence on a project of this importance, as their budget and timescale for producing the rest of the OTA continued to inflate. In response to a schedule described as "unsettled and changing daily", NASA postponed the launch date of the telescope until April 1985. Perkin-Elmer's schedules continued to slip at a rate of about one month per quarter, and at times delays reached one day for each day of work. NASA was forced to postpone the launch date until March and then September 1986. By this time, the total project budget had risen to {{US$|1.175 billion}}.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=504}}

=== Spacecraft systems ===
The spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight into the darkness of Earth's [[shadow]], which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of [[multi-layer insulation]] keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell in which the telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a [[carbon fiber reinforced polymer|graphite-epoxy]] frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/service/gallery/fact_sheets/spacesci/hst3-01/hubble_space_telescope_systems.htm |title=Hubble Space Telescope Systems |publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030317035553/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/service/gallery/fact_sheets/spacesci/hst3-01/hubble_space_telescope_systems.htm |archivedate=March 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because graphite composites are [[hygroscopic]], there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.&lt;ref&gt;Ghitelman, David (1987). ''The Space Telescope''. New York: Michael Friedman Publishing. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

While construction of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the construction of the OTA, Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer of 1985, construction of the spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said that Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=508}}

=== Computer systems and data processing ===
[[Image:DF-224.jpg|thumb|DF-224 in Hubble, before it was replaced in 1999]]

The two initial, primary computers on the HST were the 1.25&amp;nbsp;MHz [[DF-224]] system, built by Rockwell Autonetics, which contained three redundant CPUs, and two redundant [[NSSC-1]] (NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer, Model 1) systems, developed by Westinghouse and GSFC using [[diode–transistor logic]] (DTL).

When launched, the HST carried five scientific instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC), Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS), High Speed Photometer (HSP), Faint Object Camera (FOC) and the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS). WF/PC was a high-resolution imaging device primarily intended for optical observations. It was built by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], and incorporated a set of 48 [[filter (optics)|filters]] isolating [[spectral line]]s of particular astrophysical interest. The instrument contained eight [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) chips divided between two cameras, each using four CCDs.  Each CCD has a resolution of 0.64 megapixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/nuts_.and._bolts/instruments/wfpc2/ |title=WFPC2 |publisher=STScI |accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "wide field camera" (WFC) covered a large angular field at the expense of resolution, while the "planetary camera" (PC) took images at a longer effective [[focal length]] than the WF chips, giving it a greater magnification.&lt;ref name="CP-2244"&gt;{{cite techreport |title=The Space Telescope Observatory |number=CP-2244 |institution=NASA |first=Donald NB (ed) |last=Hall |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19820025420 |date=1982}} 40 MB PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHRS was a [[spectrograph]] designed to operate in the ultraviolet. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve a [[spectral resolution]] of 90,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brandt, JC |date=1994 |title=The Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph: Instrument, goals, and science results |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=106 |pages=890–908 |bibcode=1994PASP..106..890B |doi=10.1086/133457 |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=4 |author2=Heap, SR |author3=Beaver, EA |author4=Boggess, A |author5=Carpenter, KG |author6=Ebbets, DC |author7=Hutchings, JB |author8=Jura, M |author9=Leckrone, DS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS, which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble. Rather than CCDs these three instruments used [[photon]]-counting [[digicon]]s as their detectors. The FOC was constructed by ESA, while the [[University of California, San Diego]], and [[Martin Marietta Corporation]] built the FOS.&lt;ref name="CP-2244"/&gt;

The final instrument was the HSP, designed and built at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. It was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of [[variable star]]s and other astronomical objects varying in brightness. It could take up to 100,000 measurements per second with a [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] accuracy of about 2% or better.&lt;ref&gt;Bless, RC; Walter, LE; White RL (1992).

HST's guidance system can also be used as a scientific instrument. Its three [[Fine Guidance Sensor]]s (FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but can also be used to carry out extremely accurate [[astrometry]]; measurements accurate to within 0.0003&amp;nbsp;arcseconds have been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Benedict, G.

{{Main|Space Telescope Science Institute}}

The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. STScI is operated by the [[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy]] (AURA) and is physically located in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] on the Homewood campus of [[Johns Hopkins University]], one of the 39 US universities and seven international affiliates that make up the AURA consortium. STScI was established in 1981&lt;ref name="Edmondson1997"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEurac1jvsAC&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;pg=PA244 |title=AURA and Its US National Observatories |publisher=Cambridge University Press |first=Frank K. |last=Edmondson |page=244 |date=1997 |isbn=9780521553452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aura-astronomy.org/about.asp |title=About AURA |publisher=AURA |accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists wanted it to be based in an [[academia|academic]] establishment.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|pp=486-487}}&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Nancy Grace.

Chapter 3, p. 536.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility]] (ST-ECF), established at [[Garching bei München]] near [[Munich]] in 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre.

One rather complex task that falls to STScI is scheduling observations for the telescope.&lt;ref name="Team Hubble"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/team_hubble/ |title=Team Hubble |publisher=STScI |accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubble is in a low-Earth orbit to enable servicing missions, but this means that most astronomical targets are [[occultation|occulted]] by the Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit. Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] due to elevated [[radiation]] levels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), Moon and Earth. The solar avoidance angle is about 50°, to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs, and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments. If the FGSs are turned off, however, the Moon and Earth can be observed. Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat-fields for the WFPC1 instrument. There is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), at roughly 90° to the plane of Hubble's orbit, in which targets are not [[occultation|occulted]] for long periods. Due to the [[precession]] of the orbit, the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks. Because the [[wikt:Limb|limb]] of the Earth is always within about 30° of regions within the CVZ, the brightness of scattered [[earthshine]] may be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations.

Hubble orbits in [[low Earth orbit]] at an altitude of approximately {{convert|540|km|sp=us}} and an inclination of 28.5°.&lt;ref name="heavens-above" /&gt; The position along its orbit changes over time in a way that is not accurately predictable. The density of the upper atmosphere varies according to many factors, and this means that Hubble's predicted position for six weeks' time could be in error by up to {{convert|4000|km|abbr=on}}. Observation schedules are typically finalized only a few days in advance, as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance that the target would be unobservable by the time it was due to be observed.{{sfn|Strolger|Rose|2017|p=46}}

Engineering support for HST is provided by NASA and contractor personnel at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], {{convert|48|km|abbr=on}} south of the STScI. Hubble's operation is monitored 24&amp;nbsp;hours per day by four teams of flight controllers who make up Hubble's Flight Operations Team.&lt;ref name="Team Hubble" /&gt;

=== ''Challenger'' disaster, delays, and eventual launch ===
[[File:STS-31 Hubble launch roll and pitch.jpg|thumb|upright|[[STS-31]] lifts off, carrying Hubble into orbit.]]
[[File:1990 s31 IMAX view of HST release.jpg|thumb|Hubble being deployed from ''Discovery'' in 1990.]]

By early 1986, the planned launch date of October that year looked feasible, but the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' accident]] brought the U.S. space program to a halt, grounding the Space Shuttle fleet and forcing the launch of Hubble to be postponed for several years. The telescope had to be kept in a clean room, powered up and purged with nitrogen, until a launch could be rescheduled. This costly situation (about {{US$|6 million}} per month) pushed the overall costs of the project even higher. This delay did allow time for engineers to perform extensive tests, swap out a possibly failure-prone battery, and make other improvements.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|p=371}} Furthermore, the ground software needed to control Hubble was not ready in 1986, and was barely ready by the 1990 launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Telescope Is Set to Peer at Space and Time |first=John |last=Wilford |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D6153AF93AA35757C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |date=April 9, 1990 |accessdate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, following the resumption of shuttle flights in 1988, the launch of the telescope was scheduled for 1990. On April 24, 1990, {{OV|Discovery}} successfully launched the telescope into its planned orbit during the [[STS-31]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-31/mission-sts-31.html |title=STS-31 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its original total cost estimate of about {{US$|400 million}}, the telescope cost about {{US$|4.7 billion}} by the time of its launch. Hubble's cumulative costs were estimated to be about {{US$|10 billion}} in 2010, twenty years after launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL.pdf |title=James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) Final Report |page=32 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of Hubble instruments ==
Hubble accommodates five science instruments at a given time, plus the [[Fine Guidance Sensor]]s, which are mainly used for aiming the telescope but are occasionally used for science ([[astrometry]]). Early instruments were replaced with more advanced ones during the Shuttle servicing missions. COSTAR was strictly a corrective optics device rather than a true science instrument, but occupied one of the five instrument bays.

Since the final servicing mission in 2009, the four active instruments have been ACS, COS, STIS and WFC3. NICMOS is kept in hibernation, but may be revived if WFC3 were to fail in the future.
* [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] (ACS; 2002–present)
* [[Cosmic Origins Spectrograph]] (COS; 2009–present)
* [[Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement]] (COSTAR; 1993–2009)
* [[Faint Object Camera]] (FOC; 1990–2002)
* [[Faint Object Spectrograph]] (FOS; 1990–1997)
* [[Fine Guidance Sensor]] (FGS; 1990–present)
* [[Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph]] (GHRS/HRS; 1990–1997)
* [[High Speed Photometer]] (HSP; 1990–1993)
* [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS; 1997–present, hibernating since 2008)
* [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] (STIS; 1997–present (non-operative 2004–2009))
* [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera]] (WFPC; 1990–1993)
* [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] (WFPC2; 1993–2009)
* [[Wide Field Camera 3]] (WFC3; 2009–present)

Of the former instruments, three (COSTAR, FOS and WFPC2) are displayed in the Smithsonian [[National Air and Space Museum]]. The FOC is in the Dornier museum, Germany. The HSP is in the Space Place at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. The first WFPC was dismantled, and some components were then re-used in WFC3. The current location of GHRS is unclear.

== Flawed mirror ==
[[File:Hubble PSF with flawed optics.jpg|thumb|An extract from a [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera|WF/PC]] image shows the light from a star spread over a wide area instead of being concentrated on a few pixels.]]

Within weeks of the launch of the telescope, the returned images indicated a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of [[point source]]s spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having a [[point spread function]] (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1&amp;nbsp;arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The imaging performance of the Hubble Space Telescope |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |first1=Christopher J. |last1=Burrows |first2=Jon A. |display-authors=4 |last2=Holtzman |first3=S.

Analysis of the flawed images showed that the cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been polished to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about {{convert|10|nm|uin |abbr=on|sigfig=1}},&lt;ref name="ScienceSPF"/&gt; at the perimeter it was too flat by about {{convert|2200|nm|um uin |abbr=off|lk=on|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Servicing Mission 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/hubble/missions/sm1.html |title=Servicing Mission 1 |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 28, 2016 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420202154/http://hubble.nasa.gov/missions/sm1.php |archive-date=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe [[spherical aberration]], a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror [[focus (optics)|focuses]] on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|p=375}}

The effect of the mirror flaw on scientific observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out-of-focus halo severely reduced the usefulness of the telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|p=375}} NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a [[white elephant]]. For instance, in the 1991 comedy ''[[The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear]]'', Hubble was pictured with ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'', and the [[Edsel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102510/ |title=The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, during the first three years of the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodwin, Irwin |date=1994 |title=Hubble repair improves vision and helps restore NASA's image |journal=Physics Today |volume=47 |issue=3 |page=42 |author2=Cioffi, Denis F. |doi=10.1063/1.2808434 |bibcode=1994PhT....47c..42G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated [[image processing]] techniques such as [[deconvolution]].{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|pp=514-515}}

=== Origin of the problem ===
[[File:Hubble Images of M100 Before and After Mirror Repair - GPN-2002-000064.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The core of spiral galaxy [[Messier 100|M100]], imaged with Hubble before and after corrective optics.]]

A commission headed by [[Lew Allen]], director of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], was established to determine how the error could have arisen. The Allen Commission found that a reflective [[null corrector]], a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped non-spherical mirror, had been incorrectly assembled—one lens was out of position by {{convert|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Allen|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|1990|p=7-1|ps=: The spacing of the field lens in the corrector was to have been done by laser measurements off the end of an invar bar. Instead of illuminating the end of the bar, however, the laser in fact was reflected from a worn spot on a black-anodized metal cap placed over the end of the bar to isolate its center (visible through a hole in the cap). The technician who performed the test noted an unexpected gap between the field lens and its supporting structure in the corrector and filled it in with an ordinary metal washer.}}  During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror, [[Perkin-Elmer]] analyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors.  However, for the final manufacturing step ([[figuring]]), they switched to the custom-built reflective null corrector, designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances. The incorrect assembly of the device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape.  A few final tests, using the conventional null correctors, correctly reported [[spherical aberration]].  But these results were dismissed, thus missing the opportunity to catch the error, because the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=512|ps=: "the firm's optical operations personnel dismissed the evidence as itself flawed. They believed the other two null correctors were less accurate than the reflective null corrector and so could not verify its reliability. Since they assumed the perfection of the mirror and reflective null corrector, they rejected falsifying information from independent tests, believed no problems existed, and reported only good news."}}

The commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.{{sfn|Allen|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|1990|p=10-1}}

=== Design of a solution ===
[[File:Hs-2009-25-e-full jpg.jpg|thumb|upright|Some of the Carina nebula by WFC3]]

The design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993. While Kodak had ground a back-up mirror for Hubble, it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit, and too expensive and time-consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit. Instead, the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense, to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission, effectively acting as "[[Glasses|spectacles]]" to correct the spherical aberration.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric (1994). ''The Hubble Wars; Astrophysics Meets Astropolitics in the Two-Billion-Dollar Struggle Over the Hubble Space Telescope.'' Harper Collins. {{ISBN|0-06-017114-6}}, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Popular Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lQEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;pg=PA72 |date=October 1990 |title=The Trouble with Hubble |first=Arthur |last=Fisher |page=100 |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step was a precise characterization of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the [[conic constant]] of the mirror as built was {{val|−1.01390|0.0002|fmt=none}}, instead of the intended {{val|−1.00230|fmt=none}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Image inversion analysis of the HST OTA (Hubble Space Telescope Optical Telescope Assembly), phase A |publisher=TRW, Inc.

[[File:Feustel moving COSTAR.jpg|thumb|left|COSTAR being removed in 2009]]

Because of the way the HST's instruments were designed, two different sets of correctors were required. The design of the [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]], already planned to replace the existing WF/PC, included relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) chips making up its two cameras.  An inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel the aberration of the primary. However, the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be figured in this way, and so required an external correction device.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|p=376}}

The [[Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement]] (COSTAR) system was designed to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS.

Hubble was designed to accommodate regular servicing and equipment upgrades while in orbit.  Instruments and limited life items were designed as [[orbital replacement unit (HST)|orbital replacement unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130219022932/http://setas-www.larc.nasa.gov/HUBBLE/HARDWARE/hubble_ORU.html Orbital Replacement Units HST]&lt;/ref&gt; Five servicing missions (SM 1, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4) were flown by NASA [[space shuttle]]s, the first in December 1993 and the last in May 2009.&lt;ref name="hubble-timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/hubble-timeline/ |title=The Secret to Hubble's Success |work=National Geographic |first1=Jason |last1=Treat |first2=Anna |last2=Scalamogna |first3=Eve |last3=Conant |date=2015 |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Servicing missions were delicate operations that began with maneuvering to intercept the telescope in orbit and carefully retrieving it with the shuttle's [[Canadarm|mechanical arm]]. The necessary work was then carried out in multiple tethered [[spacewalk]]s over a period of four to five days. After a visual inspection of the telescope, astronauts conducted repairs, replaced failed or degraded components, upgraded equipment, and installed new instruments. Once work was completed, the telescope was redeployed, typically after boosting to a higher orbit to address the [[orbital decay]] caused by atmospheric [[drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref name="nytimes20150424"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000003647066/hubble-reflects-the-cosmos.html |title=Hubble Reflects the Cosmos |work=The New York Times |first1=Jason |last1=Overbye |first2=Jonathan |last2=Corum |first3=Jason |last3=Drakeford |date=April 24, 2015 |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Servicing Mission 1 ===
{{Main|STS-61}}
[[File:Upgrading Hubble during SM1.jpg|thumb|left|Astronauts Musgrave and Hoffman install corrective optics during SM1]]

After the problems with Hubble's mirror were discovered, the first servicing mission assumed greater importance, as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics. The seven astronauts for the mission were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|pp=384-387}} SM1 flew aboard [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] in December 1993, and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days.

Most importantly, the [[High Speed Photometer]] was replaced with the [[Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement|COSTAR]] corrective optics package, and WFPC was replaced with the [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] (WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. The [[Photovoltaic module|solar arrays]] and their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four [[gyroscope]]s in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded with added [[coprocessor]]s, and Hubble's orbit was boosted.&lt;ref name="Servicing Mission 1"/&gt;

On January 13, 1994, NASA declared the mission a complete success and showed the first sharper images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The on-orbit performance of WFPC2 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |first1=J.

Its success was a boon for NASA, as well as for the astronomers who now had a more capable space telescope.

=== Servicing Mission 2 ===
{{Main|STS-82}}
[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|Hubble as seen from ''Discovery'' during its second servicing mission]]

Servicing Mission 2, flown by ''Discovery'' in February 1997, replaced the GHRS and the FOS with the [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] (STIS) and the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with a new Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubble.nasa.gov/missions/sm2.php |title=Servicing Mission 2 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419153631/http://hubble.nasa.gov/missions/sm2.php &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; NICMOS contained a [[heat sink]] of solid [[nitrogen]] to reduce the [[thermal noise]] from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected [[thermal expansion]] resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.&lt;ref name="NICMOStemp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/nicmos/performance/temperature |title=NICMOS Thermal History |publisher=STScI |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This reference only generally supports these two sentences, and does not give numbers such as the expected lifetime figures stated here.--&gt;

=== Servicing Mission 3A ===
{{Main|STS-103}}
Servicing Mission 3A, flown by ''Discovery'', took place in December 1999, and was a split-off from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed a few weeks before the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all six gyroscopes, replaced a [[Fine Guidance Sensor]] and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sm3a.gsfc.nasa.gov/overview.html |title=Servicing Mission 3A Overview |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than the [[DF-224]] it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |url=http://hubble.nasa.gov/a_pdf/news/SM3A-MediaGuide.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 3A Media Reference Guide |publisher=NASA |author=Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space |accessdate=April 27, 2008 |pages=5–9 and Section 7.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Servicing Mission 3B ===
{{Main|STS-109}}
Servicing Mission 3B flown by ''Columbia'' in March 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument, with the FOC (which, except for the [[Fine Guidance Sensor]]s when used for astrometry, was the last of the original instruments) being replaced by the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] (ACS). This meant that COSTAR was no longer required, since all new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration.&lt;ref name="COSTARNotNeeded"&gt;{{cite web |at=Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement |title=HST |url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/index_html#costar |publisher=STScI |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed-cycle cooler&lt;ref name="NICMOStemp"/&gt; and replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubble.nasa.gov/missions/sm3b.php |title=Servicing Mission 3 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407164008/http://hubble.nasa.gov/missions/sm3b.php&lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=April 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans called for Hubble to be serviced in February 2005, but the [[Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003, in which the orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator [[Sean O'Keefe]] decided that all future shuttle missions had to be able to reach the safe haven of the [[International Space Station]] should in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/resources/sm4meeting.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530063454/http://www.stsci.edu/resources/sm4meeting.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 30, 2012 |title=Servicing Mission 4 Cancelled |publisher=STScI |date=January 16, 2004 |accessdate=April 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11169 |title=Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope: Final Report |publisher=The National Academies |date=2005}} Chapter 7, "Given the intrinsic value of a serviced Hubble, and the high likelihood of success for a shuttle servicing mission, the committee judges that such a mission is worth the risk."&lt;/ref&gt; HST's planned successor, the [[James Webb Telescope]] (JWST), was not expected to launch until at least 2018. A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/aaac/reports/annual/aaac_2004_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=2004 Annual Report |publisher=Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee |at=Section 3.1&amp;nbsp;– The Scientific Impact of the HST SM4 Cancellation |date=March 15, 2004 |accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consideration that JWST will not be located in [[low Earth orbit]], and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only makes these concerns more acute. On the other hand, many astronomers felt strongly that the servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were to come from the JWST budget.

In January 2004, O'Keefe said he would review his decision to cancel the final servicing mission to HST due to public outcry and requests from Congress for NASA to look for a way to save it. The National Academy of Sciences convened an official panel, which recommended in July 2004 that the HST should be preserved despite the apparent risks. Their report urged "NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/14/us/panel-urges-nasa-to-save-hubble-space-telescope.html |title=Panel Urges NASA to Save Hubble Space Telescope |work=The New York Times |author=Warren E. Leary |date=July 14, 2004 |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2004, O'Keefe asked Goddard Space Flight Center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission. These plans were later canceled, the robotic mission being described as "not feasible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/12/AR2005041201646.html |title=Nominee Backs a Review of NASA's Hubble Decision |first=Guy |last=Gugliotta |date=April 12, 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2007 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2004, several Congressional members, led by Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]], held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support (including thousands of letters from school children across the country) to get the Bush Administration and NASA to reconsider the decision to drop plans for a Hubble rescue mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://mikulski.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=231696 |title=Mikulski Vows To Fight For Hubble |date=February 7, 2005 |publisher=[[Barbara Mikulski]] |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430100658/http://mikulski.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=231696 |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:218582main Batt FS img1 lg.jpg|thumb|Nickel–hydrogen battery pack for Hubble]]

The nomination in April 2005 of a new NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background, [[Michael D. Griffin]], changed the situation, as Griffin stated he would consider a manned servicing mission.&lt;ref name="Green Light"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15489217/ |title=NASA gives green light to Hubble rescue |first=Alan |last=Boyle |publisher=MSNBC |date=October 31, 2006 |accessdate=January 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by ''Atlantis'' was scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008,&lt;ref name="suddenly quiet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/37004/description/Hubble_suddenly_quiet |title=Hubble suddenly quiet |last=Cowen |first=Ron |publisher=ScienceNews |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn15056-hubble-reopens-an-eye.html |title=Hubble re-opens an eye |last=Courtland |first=Rachel |work=New Scientist |date=October 28, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029124801/http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn15056-hubble-reopens-an-eye.html |archivedate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a failure of the backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit.&lt;ref name="suddenly quiet" /&gt;

Since the start of the program, a number of research projects have been carried out, some of them almost solely with Hubble, others coordinated facilities such as [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]].  Although the Hubble observatory is nearing the end of its life, there are still major projects scheduled for it.  One example is the upcoming Frontier Fields program,&lt;ref name="SWGreport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/campaigns/frontier-fields/documents/HDFI_SWGReport2012.pdf |title=Hubble Deep Fields Initiative 2012 Science Working Group Report |work=STScI.edu |date=2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the results of Hubble's deep observation of the galaxy cluster [[Abell 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1317 |title=New Hubble image of galaxy cluster Abell 1689 |work=SpaceTelescope.org |id=heic1317 |date=September 12, 2013 |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Previous projects to be added. --&gt;

=== Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey ===
In an August 2013 press release, [[CANDELS]] was referred to as "the largest project in the history of Hubble". The survey "aims to explore galactic evolution in the early Universe, and the very first seeds of cosmic structure at less than one billion years after the Big Bang."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1315/#3 |title=Hubble explores the origins of modern galaxies |work=SpaceTelescope.org |id=heic1315 |date=August 15, 2013 |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CANDELS project site describes the survey's goals as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://candels.ucolick.org/survey/Survey_Desc.html |title=Survey Description |work=CANDELS ''at'' UCOLick.org |accessdate=October 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020092530/http://candels.ucolick.org/survey/Survey_Desc.html |archivedate=October 20, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution from z = 8 to 1.5 via deep imaging of more than 250,000 galaxies with WFC3/IR and ACS. It will also find the first Type Ia SNe beyond z &gt; 1.5 and establish their accuracy as standard candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected; each has multi-wavelength data from Spitzer and other facilities, and has extensive spectroscopy of the brighter galaxies. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; solar masses out to z ~ 8.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Frontier Fields program ===

The program, officially named "Hubble Deep Fields Initiative 2012", is aimed to advance the knowledge of early [[galaxy formation]] by studying high-redshift galaxies in [[Deep field|blank fields]] with the help of [[gravitational lensing]] to see the "faintest galaxies in the distant universe."&lt;ref name="SWGreport"/&gt; The Frontier Fields web page describes the goals of the program being:
* to reveal hitherto inaccessible populations of z = 5–10 galaxies that are 10 to 50 times fainter intrinsically than any presently known
* to solidify our understanding of the stellar masses and star formation histories of sub-L* galaxies at the earliest times
* to provide the first statistically meaningful morphological characterization of star forming galaxies at z &gt; 5
* to find z &gt; 8 galaxies stretched out enough by cluster lensing to discern internal structure and/or magnified enough by cluster lensing for spectroscopic follow-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/campaigns/frontier-fields |title=Hubble Space Telescope: Frontier Fields |work=STScI.edu |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone can apply for time on the telescope; there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation, but funding for analysis is only available to US institutions.{{sfn|Strolger|Rose|2017|p=11}} Competition for time on the telescope is intense, with about one-fifth of the proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on the schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview |title=HST Overview |publisher=NASA |date=June 21, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |at=Mission Operations and Observations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/team_hubble/ |title=Team Hubble |publisher=STScI |accessdate=November 5, 2012 |quote=Each year more than 1,000 proposals are reviewed and approximately 200 are selected.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calls for proposals are issued roughly annually, with time allocated for a cycle lasting about one year. Proposals are divided into several categories; "general observer" proposals are the most common, covering routine observations. "Snapshot observations" are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time, including overheads such as acquiring the target. Snapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in the telescope schedule that cannot be filled by regular GO programs.{{sfn|Strolger|Rose|2017|p=21}}

Astronomers may make "Target of Opportunity" proposals, in which observations are scheduled if a transient event covered by the proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle. In addition, up to 10% of the telescope time is designated "director's discretionary" (DD) time. Astronomers can apply to use DD time at any time of year, and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae.{{sfn|Strolger|Rose|2017|p=37}}

Other uses of DD time have included the observations that led to views of the Hubble Deep Field and Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and in the first four cycles of telescope time, observations that were carried out by amateur astronomers.

Public image processing of Hubble data is encouraged as most of the data in the archives has not been processed into color imagery.&lt;ref name="hubblesite.raiders"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/get_involved/hubble_image_processors/ |title=Hubble Image Processors: Raiders of the Hubble Archive |website=Hubblesite.org |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amateur observations ===
[[File:Hubble Space Telescope, time exposure May 4, 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|The HST is sometimes visible from the ground, as in this 10-second exposure.]]
The first director of STScI, [[Riccardo Giacconi]], announced in 1986 that he intended to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur astronomers to use the telescope. The total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among amateur astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1992/1992/23/text/ |title=Amateur Astronomers Will Use NASA's Hubble Space Telescope |publisher=STScI |date=September 10, 1992 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for amateur time were stringently reviewed by a committee of amateur astronomers, and time was awarded only to proposals that were deemed to have genuine scientific merit, did not duplicate proposals made by professionals, and required the unique capabilities of the space telescope. Thirteen amateur astronomers were awarded time on the telescope, with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref name="Omeara1997"&gt;{{cite journal |url=ftp://tlgleonid.asuscomm.com/HITACHI/BOOK_ASTRO/S&amp;T/SkyandTelescope_1997%20-%20astronomy/06/199706097105.pdf |title=The Demise of the HST Amateur Program |journal=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]] |first=Stephen J. |last=O'Meara |editor-first=Edwin L. |editor-last=Aguirre |volume=96 |issue=6 |page=97 |date=June 1997 |bibcode=1997S&amp;T....93f..97O}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such study was "[[Hubble search for transition comets|Transition Comets—UV Search for OH]]".

== Scientific results ==

=== Key projects ===
In the early 1980s, NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss key projects. These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, which would be explicitly dedicated to each project. This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed sooner than expected. The panels identified three such projects: 1) a study of the nearby intergalactic medium using quasar [[absorption line]]s to determine the properties of the [[intergalactic medium]] and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bahcall |first1=JN |last2=Bergeron |first2=J |last3=Boksenberg |first3=A |last4=Hartig |first4=GF |last5=Jannuzi |first5=BT |last6=Kirhakos |first6=S |last7=Sargent |first7=WLW |last8=Savage |first8=BD |last9=Schneider |first9=DP |displayauthors=8 |title=The Hubble Space Telescope Quasar Absorption Line Key Project.

=== Important discoveries ===
[[File:Saturn.Aurora.HST.UV-Vis.jpg|thumb|Hubble's STIS UV and ACS visible light are combined to reveal Saturn's southern aurora.]]

Hubble has helped resolve some long-standing problems in astronomy, while also raising new questions. Some results have required new [[scientific theory|theories]] to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to [[Cepheid variable]] stars more accurately than ever before, and thus [[Hubble's law#Using Hubble space telescope data|constrain the value]] of the [[Hubble constant]], the measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors]] of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the [[Virgo Cluster]] and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2001ApJ...553...47F |title=Final Results from the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project to Measure the Hubble Constant |last1=Freedman |first1=W.

While Hubble helped to refine estimates of the age of the universe, it also cast doubt on theories about its future. Astronomers from the [[High-z Supernova Search Team]] and the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] used ground-based telescopes and HST to observe distant [[supernova]]e and uncovered evidence that, far from decelerating under the influence of [[gravity]], the expansion of the universe may in fact be [[Deceleration parameter|accelerating]].  Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded [[Nobel Prize]]s for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmology |first=Steven |last=Weinberg |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=9780198526827}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-dark-energy-exist |title=Does Dark Energy Really Exist? |last1=Clifton |first1=Timothy |last2=Ferreira |first2=Pedro G |journal=Scientific American |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most common cause attributed is [[dark energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |date=June 20, 2003 |volume=300 |pmid=12817137 |issue=5627 |pages=1896–1897 |doi=10.1126/science.300.5627.1896 |title=Dark Energy Tiptoes Toward the Spotlight |first=Charles |last=Seife}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-resolution spectra and images provided by the HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of [[black hole]]s in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at the centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/caption/hst_blkhole.txt |title=Hubble Confirms Existence of Massive Black Hole at Heart of Active Galaxy |publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center |date=May 25, 1994 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Relationship between Nuclear Black Hole Mass and Galaxy Velocity Dispersion |author=Gebhardt, K |display-authors=4 |author2=Bender, R |author3=Bower, G |author4=Dressler, A |author5=Faber, SM |author6=Filippenko, AV |author7=Green, R |author8=Grillmair, C |author9=Ho, LC |author10= Kormendy, J |author11=et al. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=539 |pages=L13–L16 |date=2000 |doi=10.1086/312840 |issue=1 |bibcode=2000ApJ...539L..13G |arxiv=astro-ph/0006289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Fundamental Relationship between Supermassive Black Holes and their Host Galaxies |last=Ferrarese |first=Laura |last2=Merritt |first2=David |author2-link=David Merritt |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=539 |pages=L9–L12 |date=2000 |bibcode=2000ApJ...539L...9F |doi=10.1086/312838 |issue=1 |arxiv=astro-ph/0006053}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.

The collision of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] with [[Jupiter]] in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming just a few months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of the [[planet]] were sharper than any taken since the passage of [[Voyager 2]] in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.

Other discoveries made with Hubble data include proto-planetary disks ([[proplyd]]s) in the [[Orion Nebula]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1994/24/text/ |title=Hubble Confirms Abundance of Protoplanetary Disks around Newborn Stars |publisher=STScI |date=June 13, 1994 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; evidence for the presence of [[extrasolar planet]]s around Sun-like stars;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/exoplanet_transit.html |title=Hubble Finds Extrasolar Planets Far Across Galaxy |publisher=NASA |date=October 4, 2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the optical counterparts of the still-mysterious [[gamma-ray burst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast26mar99_1.htm |title=Autopsy of an Explosion |publisher=NASA |date=March 26, 1999 |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415053228/https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast26mar99_1.htm |archivedate=April 15, 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System, including the dwarf planets [[Pluto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=March 11, 1996 |title=Hubble Telescope Maps Pluto |access-date=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/24/full/ |title=Astronomers Measure Mass of Largest Dwarf Planet |publisher=STScI |date=June 14, 2007 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hubble Extreme Deep Field (full resolution).png|thumb|Hubble Extreme Deep Field image of space in the constellation [[Fornax]]]]

A unique window on the Universe enabled by Hubble are the [[Hubble Deep Field]], [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]], and [[Hubble Extreme Deep Field]] images, which used Hubble's unmatched sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new window on the early Universe. The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery of some of the most distant objects yet discovered, such as [[MACS0647-JD]].

In March 2015, researchers announced that measurements of aurorae around [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] revealed that the moon has a subsurface ocean. Using Hubble to study the motion of its aurorae, the researchers determined that a large saltwater ocean was helping to suppress the interaction between Jupiter's magnetic field and that of Ganymede.

On December 11, 2015, Hubble captured an image of the first-ever predicted reappearance of a supernova, dubbed "[[SN Refsdal|Refsdal]]", which was calculated using different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose gravity is [[General relativity|warping]] the supernova's light. The supernova was previously seen in November 2014 behind galaxy cluster [[MACS J1149.5+2223]] as part of Hubble's Frontier Fields program. Astronomers spotted four separate images of the supernova in an arrangement known as an [[Einstein Cross]]. The light from the cluster has taken about five billion years to reach Earth, though the supernova exploded some 10&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. The detection of Refsdal's reappearance served as a unique opportunity for astronomers to test their models of how mass, especially [[dark matter]], is distributed within this galaxy cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1525/ |title=Caught in the act: Hubble captures first-ever predicted exploding star |work=Spacetelescope.org |date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2016, researchers using Hubble data announced the discovery of the farthest known galaxy to date: [[GN-z11]]. The Hubble observations occurred on February 11, 2015, and April 3, 2015, as part of the [[CANDELS]]/[[GOODS]]-North surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/07/full/ |title=Hubble Team Breaks Cosmic Distance Record |website=HubbleSite.org |date=March 3, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2016 |id=STScI-2016-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/galaxies/hubble-finds-most-distant-oldest-galaxy-ever-160303.htm |title=Hubble Spies Most Distant, Oldest Galaxy Ever |work=[[Discovery News]] |first=Irene |last=Klotz |date=March 3, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on astronomy ===
[[File:Hubble Probes the Early Universe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Depiction of progress in the detection of the early Universe|Evolution of detecting the [[Timeline of the Big Bang|early Universe]]]]

Many objective measures show the positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy. Over 15,000 [[Scientific paper|papers]] based on Hubble data have been published in peer-reviewed journals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.stsci.edu/hst/bibliography/pubstat.html |title=HST Publication Statistics |publisher=STScI |accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and countless more have appeared in conference [[proceedings]]. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no [[citation]]s, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.stsci.edu/%7Ewebdocs/STScINewsletter/2003/spring_03.pdf |title=Hubble Science Metrics |journal=Newsletter |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |first1=Georges |last1=Meylan |first2=Juan |last2=Madrid |first3=Duccio |last3=Macchetto |volume=20 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the HST has clearly helped astronomical research, its financial cost has been large. A study on the relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on HST data generate 15 times as many citations as a {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} ground-based telescope such as the [[William Herschel Telescope]], the HST costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benn, CR |author2=Sánchez, SF |date=2001 |title=Scientific Impact of Large Telescopes |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=113 |issue=781 |pages=385–396 |doi=10.1086/319325 |bibcode=2001PASP..113..385B |arxiv=astro-ph/0010304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deciding between building ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based techniques such as [[aperture masking interferometry]] had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1987Natur.328..694H |author=Haniff, CA |display-authors=4 |author2=Mackay, CD |author3=Titterington, DJ |author4=Sivia, D |author5=Baldwin, JE |title=The first images from optical aperture synthesis |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=328 |date=August 1987 |issue=6132 |pages=694–696 |doi=10.1038/328694a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1990MNRAS.245P...7B |author=Buscher, DF |author2=Baldwin, JE |author3=Warner, PJ |author4=Haniff, CA |title=Detection of a bright feature on the surface of Betelgeuse |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=245 |date=July 1990 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, advances in [[adaptive optics]] have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only a small fraction of astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.

=== Aerospace engineering ===
In addition to its scientific results, Hubble has also made significant contributions to [[aerospace engineering]], in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|graphite composite]] structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, [[radiation damage]] to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of [[multi-layer insulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Experience with the Hubble Space Telescope: 20 years of an archetype |journal=Optical Engineering |first=Matthew D. |last=Lallo |volume=51 |issue=1 |at=011011 |date=January 2012 |doi=10.1117/1.OE.51.1.011011 |bibcode=2012OptEn..51a1011L |arxiv=1203.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.&lt;ref name="Gyros"/&gt;

=== Transmission to Earth ===
Hubble data was initially stored on the spacecraft. When launched, the storage facilities were old-fashioned reel-to-reel [[tape recorder]]s, but these were replaced by [[solid-state drive|solid state]] data storage facilities during servicing missions 2 and 3A. About twice daily, the Hubble Space Telescope radios data to a satellite in the [[geosynchronous]] [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] (TDRSS), which then downlinks the science data to one of two 60-foot (18-meter) diameter high-gain microwave antennas located at the [[White Sands Test Facility]] in [[White Sands, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Telemetry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/team_hubble/ |title=Team Hubble |publisher=STScI |at=Data Management |accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there they are sent to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, and finally to the Space Telescope Science Institute for archiving.&lt;ref name="Telemetry" /&gt; Each week, HST downlinks approximately 140 gigabits of data.&lt;ref name="hubblesite-facts" /&gt;

=== Color images ===
[[File:Cumulative-absorption-spectrum-hubble-telescope.jpg|thumb|left|Data analysis of a spectrum reveals the chemistry of hidden clouds]]

All images from Hubble are [[monochrome|monochromatic]] [[grayscale]], taken through a variety of filters, each passing specific wavelengths of light, and incorporated in each camera. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create [[false-color]] versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.&lt;ref name="space20130724"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/22086-how-hubble-space-telescope-photos-work.html |title=The Secret Science of the Hubble Space Telescope's Amazing Images |work=Space.com |last=Rosen |first=Raphael |date=July 24, 2013 |accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/magazine/150315-ngm-hubble |title=Iconic Space Images Are Actually Black-and-White |work=National Geographic |date=March 15, 2015 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/hubble-telescope.html |title=How Hubble Sees |work=Nova ScienceNow |publisher=PBS |first=Jeff |last=Hester |date=July 1, 2008 |accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archives ===
All Hubble data is eventually made available via the [[Space Telescope Science Institute|Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes]] at [[Space Telescope Science Institute|STScI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.stsci.edu/hst |title=The Hubble Telescope |publisher=STScI |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Astronomy Data Centre|CADC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/hst/ |title=CADC's Hubble Space Telescope Archive |publisher=CADC |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[European Space Astronomy Centre|ESA/ESAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=HST |title=European HST Archive at ESA/ESAC |publisher=ESA/ESAC |accessdate=February 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525154922/http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=HST |archivedate=May 25, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is usually proprietary—available only to the [[principal investigator]] (PI) and astronomers designated by the PI—for six months after being taken. The PI can apply to the director of the STScI to extend or reduce the proprietary period in some circumstances.{{sfn|Strolger|Rose|2017|p=53}}

Observations made on Director's Discretionary Time are exempt from the proprietary period, and are released to the public immediately. Calibration data such as flat fields and [[dark frame]]s are also publicly available straight away. All data in the archive is in the [[FITS]] format, which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use.{{sfn|Rose|2017|p=69}} The [[Hubble Heritage Project]] processes and releases to the public a small selection of the most striking images in [[JPEG]] and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] formats.&lt;ref name="heritage.stsci"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heritage.stsci.edu/commonpages/infoindex/ourproject/moreproject.html |title=The Hubble Heritage Project |publisher=STScI |accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pipeline reduction ===
Astronomical data taken with [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] must undergo several calibration steps before they are suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.{{sfn|Rose|2017|pp=67-69}}

=== Data analysis ===
Hubble data can be analyzed using many different packages. STScI maintains the custom-made [[Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System]] (STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, as well as many other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module of [[IRAF]], a popular astronomical data reduction program.{{sfn|Rose|2017|pp=68-69}}

== Outreach activities ==
It has always been important for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of [[taxpayer]]s to its construction and operational costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.nasa.gov/pdf/1968main_strategi.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Aeronautics and Space Administration 2003 Strategic Plan |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116011129/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/1968main_strategi.pdf |archivedate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.

[[File:Horsehead-Hubble.jpg|thumb|In 2001, NASA polled internet users to find out what they would most like Hubble to observe; they overwhelmingly selected the [[Horsehead Nebula]].]]

Several initiatives have helped to keep the public informed about Hubble activities.
In the United States, [[outreach]] efforts are coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, which was established in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program. To that end, STScI operates the HubbleSite.org website. The [[Hubble Heritage Project]], operating out of the STScI, provides the public with high-quality images of the most interesting and striking objects observed. The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers, as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy, and emphasizes the [[aesthetic]] nature of Hubble images. The Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which, for scientific reasons, may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full-color image.&lt;ref name="heritage.stsci" /&gt;

{{anchor|Hubblecast}}Since 1999, the leading Hubble outreach group in Europe has been the [[Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre]] (HEIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/ |title=The European Homepage for the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--courtesy link--&gt; This office was established at the [[Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility]] in Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency. The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including a [[videocast]] series called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/archive/category/hubblecast/ |title=Hubblecast |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hubble Space Telescope has won two Space Achievement Awards from the [[Space Foundation]], for its outreach activities, in 2001 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://2010.nationalspacesymposium.org/media/press-releases/historic-hubble-space-telescope-repair-mission-team-honored-by-the-space-founda |title=Historic Hubble Space Telescope Repair Mission Team Honored by the Space Foundation with 2010 Space Achievement Award |publisher=26th National Space Symposium |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306054724/http://2010.nationalspacesymposium.org/media/press-releases/historic-hubble-space-telescope-repair-mission-team-honored-by-the-space-founda |archivedate=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hubble Space Telescope celebrated its 20th anniversary in space on April 24, 2010. To commemorate the occasion, NASA, ESA, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) released an image from the [[Carina Nebula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/13/ |title=Starry-Eyed Hubble Celebrates 20 Years of Awe and Discovery |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |date=April 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment failures ==
[[File:Formalhaut b.jpg|thumb|left|Hubble views the [[Fomalhaut]] system. This false-color image was taken in October 2004 and July 2006 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys]]

===Instruments and electronics===
Past servicing missions have exchanged old instruments for new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible new types of science. Without servicing missions, all of the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of the [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but the first set of electronics failed in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/instruments/stis/ |title=Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph |publisher=STScI |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009.

Similarly, the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]] (ACS) main camera primary electronics failed in June 2006, and the power supply for the backup electronics failed on January 27, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jan/HQ_0715_Hubble_ACS.html |title=Engineers Investigate Issue on One of Hubble's Science Instruments |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |date=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the instrument's Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was operable using the side-1 electronics. A new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during SM 4, but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs |title=Advanced Camera for Surveys |publisher=STScI |accessdate=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wide Field Channel (WFC) was returned to service by [[STS-125]] in May 2009 but the High Resolution Channel (HRC) remains offline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090517fd7/index.html |title=Part of camera in newly repaired instrument revived |work=Spaceflight Now |first=William |last=Harwood |date=May 17, 2009 |accessdate=May 17, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520152548/http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090517fd7/index.html |archivedate=May 20, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gyroscope rotation sensors===
HST uses [[gyroscope]]s to detect and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets. (The gyroscopes are part of the Pointing Control System which has five types of sensor: magnetic sensors, various optical sensors and the gyros, and has two types of [[actuator]]: [[reaction wheel]]s and [[magnetic torquers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hubble Space Telescope Pointing Control System |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-space-telescope-pointing-control-system |website=NASA |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It carries six gyroscopes in total. Three gyroscopes are normally required for operation; observations are still possible with two or one, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stsci.edu/itt/review/2gyro_handbook/cover.html |title=HST Two-Gyro Handbook |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |location=Baltimore |first=K. R. |last=Sembach |display-authors=etal |version=1.0 |date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018, the plan is to drop into one-gyro mode if less than three working gyroscopes are operational. 

After the [[Columbia disaster]] in 2003, it was unclear whether another servicing mission would be possible, and gyro life became a concern again, so engineers developed new software for two-gyro and one-gyro modes to maximize the potential lifetime. The development was successful, and in 2005, it was decided to switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=17700 |title=NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope Begins Two-Gyro Science Operations |publisher=SpaceRef |accessdate=January 9, 2009 |date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; One more gyro failed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hubble telescope loses another gyroscope |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12600-hubble-telescope-loses-another-gyroscope-.html |first=Jeff |last=Hecht |work=New Scientist |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |date=September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six gyros were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three gyros were still working. Engineers determined that the gyro failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid.&lt;ref name="Gyros"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/about/general/gyroscopes/ |title=Gyroscopes |publisher=ESA |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new gyro models were assembled using pressurized nitrogen&lt;ref name="Gyros"/&gt; and they should be much more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/081030hubble |title=Endeavour to go Nov. 14; Hubble slips deeper into '09 |publisher=Spaceflight Now |first=William |last=Harwood |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 servcing mission all six gyroscopes were replaced, and after almost ten years only three gryos failed, but only after exceeding the average expected run time for the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/update-on-the-hubble-space-telescope-safe-mode|title=Update on the Hubble Space Telescope Safe Mode|last=Garner|first=Rob|date=2018-10-08|work=NASA|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the six gyroscopes replaced in 2009, three were of the old design susceptible for flex-lead failure, and three were of the new design with a longer expected lifetime.  The first of the old-style gyros failed in March 2014, and the second of the old-style gyros failed in April 2018.  On October 5, 2018, the last of the old-style gyros failed, and one of the new-style gyros was powered-up from standby state. However, that reserve gyro did not immediately perform within operational limits, and so the observatory was placed into "safe" mode while scientists attempted to fix the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Hubble telescope hit by mechanical failure |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45788412 |date=8 October 2018 |work=BBC News|accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA makes progress on fixing Hubble gyro |url=https://spacenews.com/nasa-makes-progress-on-fixing-hubble-gyro/ |publisher=Space News |author=Jeff Foust |date= 22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA tweeted on October 22, 2018 that the "rotation rates produced by the backup gyro have reduced and are now within a normal range. Additional tests to be performed to ensure Hubble can return to science operations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/10/24/nasa-hubble-space-telescope-fixed-turning-switch-off/1748161002/ "What fixed NASA’s Hubble space telescope? Someone flipped a switch on and off"] - USA Today News &lt;/ref&gt; 

The solution that restored the backup new-style gyro to operational range was widely reported as "turning it off and on again".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/10/24/no-nasa-didnt-fix-hubble-telescope-by-just-turning-it-off-again/?utm_term=.8717a860d011] - The Washington Post &lt;/ref&gt; A "running restart" of the gyroscope was performed, but this had no effect, and the final resolution to the failure was more complex. The failure was attributed to an inconsistency in the fluid surrounding the float within the gyroscope (e.g., an air bubble). On October 18, 2018 the Hubble Operations Team directed the spacecraft into a series of maneuvers - moving the spacecraft in opposite directions - in order to mitigate the inconsistency. Only after the maneuvers, and a subsequent set of maneuvers on October 19, did the gyroscope truly operate within its normal range.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/update-on-the-hubble-space-telescope-safe-mode] - NASA &lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==

=== Orbital decay and controlled reentry ===
[[File:Soft Capture Mechanism installed on Hubble (illustration).jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Soft Capture Mechanism (SCM) installed on Hubble]]

Hubble orbits the Earth in the extremely tenuous upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and over time its orbit [[orbital decay|decays]] due to [[drag (physics)|drag]]. If it is not re-boosted, it will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere within some decades, with the exact date depending on how active the Sun is and its impact on the upper atmosphere.  If Hubble were to descend in a completely uncontrolled re-entry, parts of the main mirror and its support structure would probably survive, leaving the potential for damage or even human fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3406079.stm |title=Why Hubble is being dropped |publisher=BBC News |first=David |last=Whitehouse |date=January 17, 2004 |accessdate=January 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, deputy project manager James Jeletic projected that Hubble could survive into the 2020s.&lt;ref name="cbsnews20130530"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/home/spacenews/files/1ae7cac0d167055e41e1f0da7b0ac6a3-588.html |title=Four years after final service call, Hubble Space Telescope going strong |work=CBS News |first=William |last=Harwood |date=May 30, 2013 |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on solar activity and atmospheric drag, or lack thereof, a natural atmospheric reentry for Hubble will occur between 2028 and 2040.&lt;ref name="cbsnews20130530"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/29206-how-will-hubble-space-telescope-die.html |title=How Will the Hubble Space Telescope Die? |work=Space.com |first=Mike |last=Wall |date=April 24, 2015 |accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, NASA extended the service contract for Hubble until June 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-extends-hubble-space-telescope-science-operations-contract |title=NASA Extends Hubble Space Telescope Science Operations Contract |publisher=NASA |last=Northon |first=Karen |date=June 23, 2016 |access-date=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA's original plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was to [[STS-144|retrieve it using a space shuttle]]. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. This is no longer possible since the [[Space Shuttle retirement|space shuttle fleet has been retired]], and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1050 |first=Keith |last=Cowing |title=NASA Considering Deletion of Hubble Deorbit Module |date=July 22, 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2007 |publisher=SpaceRef}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, in 2009, as part of Servicing Mission 4, the last servicing mission by the Space Shuttle, NASA installed the Soft Capture Mechanism (SCM), to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission. The SCM together with the Relative Navigation System (RNS) - mounted on the Shuttle to collect data to "enable NASA to pursue numerous options for the safe de-orbit of Hubble" - constitute the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System (SCRS).&lt;ref name="Soft Capture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Team Hubble: Servicing Missions |url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/team_hubble/servicing_missions.php |website=HubbleSite |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2017}}, the [[Trump Administration]] is considering a proposal by the [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] to use a manned version of its [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft to service ''Hubble'' some time in the 2020s both as a continuation of its scientific capabilities and as insurance against any malfunctions in the to-be-launched [[James Webb Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics-2017-02-03"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/telescopes/a25211/mission-to-service-hubble-space-telescope/ |title=A New Spaceship Could Fly Astronauts to the Hubble Space Telescope for Repairs |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |first=Jay |last=Bennett |date=February 14, 2017 |accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no direct replacement to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes do not duplicate Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying the expense of a space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using [[adaptive optics]] (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.

Plans for a Hubble successor materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which culminated in plans for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble.&lt;ref name="SAOverview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=hubble-servicing-mission-shuttle |title=Last Dance with the Shuttle: What's in Store for the Final Hubble Servicing Mission |first=John |last=Matson |date=May 8, 2009 |work=Scientific American |accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, it is designed to operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 [[Lagrangian point]], where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened.

It is expected to detect stars in the [[Timeline of the Big Bang|early Universe]] approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/farthest-galaxy.html |title=NASA's Hubble Finds Most Distant Galaxy Candidate Ever Seen in Universe |publisher=NASA |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=June 4, 2012}} [http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/512584main_i1105bw.jpg Visual representation].&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] since 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=33148 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515022906/http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=33148 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 15, 2016 |title=ESA JWST Timeline |publisher=Sci.esa.int |date=June 30, 2003 |accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is planned for launch on an [[Ariane 5]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/launch.html |title=About Webb's Launch |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the [[visible spectrum]]. A typical human eye can see to about 750&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.

[[File:JWST-HST-primary-mirrors.svg|left|thumb|Hubble and JWST mirrors (4.5 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 25 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively)]]
A complementary telescope, looking at even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's [[Herschel Space Observatory]], launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel was not designed to be serviced after launch, and had a mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the [[far infrared]] and [[submillimeter astronomy|submillimeter]]. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.

Further concepts for advanced 21st-century space telescopes include the [[Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope]],&lt;ref&gt;"What Will Astronomy Be Like in 35 Years?". ''Astronomy''. August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; a conceptualized {{convert|8|to|16.8|m|in |abbr=off|sp=us}} optical space telescope that if realized could be a more direct successor to HST, with the ability to observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the [[Spitzer Space telescope]]. This effort is being planned for the 2025–2035 time frame.

Existing ground-based telescopes, and various proposed [[Extremely Large Telescopes]], can exceed the HST in terms of sheer light-gathering power and diffraction limit due to larger mirrors, but other factors affect telescopes. In some cases, they may be able to match or beat Hubble in resolution by using adaptive optics (AO). However, AO on large ground-based reflectors will not make Hubble and other space telescopes obsolete. Most AO systems sharpen the view over a very narrow field—[[Lucky imaging|Lucky Cam]], for example, produces crisp images just 10" to 20" wide, whereas Hubble's cameras produce crisp images across a 2½' (150") field. Furthermore, space telescopes can study the universe across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, most of which is blocked by Earth's atmosphere. Finally, the background sky is darker in space than on the ground, because air absorbs solar energy during the day and then releases it at night, producing a faint—but nevertheless discernible—[[airglow]] that washes out low-contrast astronomical objects.&lt;ref name="Fienberg"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/sharpening-the-200-inch/ |title=Sharpening the 200-Inch |work=Sky &amp; Telescope |first=Richard |last=Tresch Fienberg |date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inorganic ions''' in [[animal]]s and [[plants]] are [[ion]]s necessary for vital [[cell (biology)|cellular]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inorganic Ions|publisher=RSC|url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/cfb/inorganicions.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In body tissues, ions are also known as [[electrolytes]], essential for the electrical activity needed to support muscle contractions and neuron activation. They contribute to [[osmotic pressure]] of [[body fluid]]s as well as performing a number of other important functions. Below is a list of some of the most important ions for living things as well as examples of their functions:

* [[Calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]{{snd}}calcium is a component of [[bone]]s and [[teeth]]. It also functions as a biological messenger, as do most of the ions listed below. See [[hypocalcaemia]]
* [[Potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]{{snd}}potassium ions' main function in animals is osmotic balance, particularly in the [[kidneys]]. See [[hypokalemia]].
* [[Sodium|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]{{snd}}sodium ions have a similar role to potassium ions. See [[sodium deficiency]].
* [[Magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]{{snd}} magnesium ions are a component of [[chlorophyll]]. See [[magnesium deficiency (plants)|magnesium deficiency]]
* [[Chloride|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]{{snd}} inability to transport chloride ions in humans manifests itself as [[cystic fibrosis#biological causes|cystic fibrosis]] (CP)
* [[Carbonate|{{chem|CO|3|2−}}]]{{snd}} the shells of sea creatures are [[calcium carbonate]]. In blood approximately 85% of [[carbon dioxide]], is converted into aqueous carbonate ions (an [[acid]]ic [[solution]]), allowing a greater rate of transportation.
* [[Phosphate|{{chem|PO|4|3−}}]]{{snd}}[[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) is a common molecule which stores energy in an accessible form. [[Bone]] is [[calcium phosphate]].
* [[Iron|Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;]]{{snd}}as found in [[haemoglobin]], the main oxygen carrying molecule has a central iron ion.
* [[Nitrate|{{chem|NO|3|−}}]]{{snd}} source of nitrogen in plants for the synthesis of proteins.

'''Isabelle Autissier''' (born 18 October 1956) is a French sailor, navigator, writer, and broadcaster. She is celebrated for being the first woman to have completed a solo world navigation in competition ([[Velux 5 Oceans Race#The BOC Challenge 1990-91|BOC Challenge 1990–91]]).

While competing in the [[Velux 5 Oceans Race#The BOC Challenge 1994-95|1994–95 BOC Challenge]] Autissier's boat ''Ecureuil Poitou Charentes II'' was dismasted and severely damaged approximately {{convert|900|nmi|km}} south of Adelaide, Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2607">'''Jogah''' (Drum Dancers) are the mythical "little people" in [[Iroquois]] lore.  Usually invisible, there are ways of telling if they are around.  For example, drumming with no visible drummers around.  They also leave rings of bare earth and "bowls" in stones or mud. offerings like tobacco and fingernails can be offered at these "bowls".  They are also used to explain disembodied lights and bad luck. When people, usually children, elders, and spiritual healers, see the Jagoh, they are described as "Knee high" to around four feet tall. Behaviorally the Jagoh love games and playing tricks, which can be dangerous if they are disrespected.  They have been claimed to cause illness in homes and neighborhoods that are built on sites to which that they are attracted.

The Jagoh are divided into multiple groups. The Gahongas "stone throwers or rollers" live in rocky areas like streams. Their favorite game is to play "catch" with people using stones, often the size of boulders.  The Gandayah care for the flora of an area, telling it when to grow and how good its yield will be.  They are known to help respectful Iroquois farmers. They are also known to love strawberries and take the forms of [[American robin]]s, if their news is good, or owls, if it is bad.  Lastly the Ohdows. These are the subterranean guardians of our world.  They protect it from creatures of the underworld which would spread disease and, in the case of the "White Buffalo", chaos. The Ohdow come out of the underground at night to dance and hunt any underworld creatures that have escaped. To help with this task, fingernails were left as offerings as the animals knew what Ohdow smelled like and would hide from them.

It appears at [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:29|John 1:29]], where [[John the Baptist]] sees Jesus and exclaims, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."&lt;ref name=Bulgakov &gt;''[[The Lamb of God (book)|The Lamb of God]]'' by [[Sergei Bulgakov]] 2008 {{ISBN|0-8028-2779-9}} page 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian doctrine holds that [[God the Son|divine Jesus]] chose to suffer [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] at [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his [[God the Father|divine Father]], as an "agent and servant of [[God in Christianity|God]]".&lt;ref name=anselm /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cullmann /&gt; In Christian theology the ''Lamb of God'' is viewed as foundational and integral to the message of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PB-zfFmR0I0C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Pascha%22+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FqKAT_eTKMfA0AG7xMHXBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pascha%22%20name&amp;f=false|title = The Antenicene Pascha: A Rhetorical History|author=Karl Gerlach|publisher = Peeters Publishers|quote=Long before this controversy, Ex 12 as a story of origins and its ritual expression had been firmly fixed in the Christian imagination. Though before the final decades of the second century only accessible as an exegetical tradition, already in the Pauline letters the Exodus saga is deeply involved with the celebration of bath and meal. Even here, this relationship does not suddenly appear, but represents developments in ritual narrative that must have begun at the very inception of the Christian message. Jesus of Nazareth was crucifed during [[Pesach-Mazzot]], an event that a new covenant people of Jews and Gentiles both saw as definitive and defining. Ex 12 is thus one of the few reliable guides for tracing the synergism among ritual, text, and kerygma before the Council of Nicaea.|page=21|year= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=84USbbs1jfUC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Passover+Lamb+Lamb+of+God&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DK-AT4vlMqjm0QGz1ICXCA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Passover%20Lamb%20Lamb%20of%20God&amp;f=false|title = The Destroyer and the Lamb: The Relationship Between Angelomorphic and Lamb Christology in the Book of Revelation|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|author= Matthias Reinhard Hoffmann|quote=1.2.2. ''Christ as the Passover Lamb from Exodus'' A number of features throughout Revelation seem to correspond to Exodus 12: The connection of Lamb and Passover, a salvific effect of the Lamb's blood and the punishment of God's (and His people's) opponents from Exodus 12 may possibly be reflected within the settings of the Apocalypse. The concept of Christ as a Passover lamb is generally not unknown in NT or early Christian literature, as can for instance be seen in 1 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Peter 1:19 or Justin Martyr's writing (''Dial''. 111:3). In the Gospel of John, especially, this connection between Christ and Passover is made very explicit.|ISBN=3-16-148778-8|page=117|year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lion-like lamb that rises to deliver victory after being slain appears several times in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref name=Glabach /&gt; It is also referred to in Pauline writings: [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#5:7|1 Corinthians 5:7]] suggests that [[Saint Paul]] intends to refer to the death of Jesus, who is the Paschal Lamb, using the theme found in [[Johannine]] writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/220115.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Homily 15 on First Corinthians (Chrysostom)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lamb metaphor is also in line with [[Psalm 23]], which depicts [[God]] as a shepherd leading his flock (mankind).

The Lamb of God title is widely used in Christian prayers, and the Agnus Dei is used as [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|a standard part]] of the Catholic [[Mass (religion)|Mass]], as well as the classical Western Liturgies of the Anglican and Lutheran Churches. It also is used in [[liturgy]] and as a form of [[contemplative prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Holy Conversation: Spirituality for Worship'' by Jonathan Linman 2010 {{ISBN|0-8006-2130-1}} page 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Prayer Book Parallels: The Public Services of the Church'' by Paul Victor Marshall 1990 {{ISBN|0-89869-181-8}} page 369&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]] also forms a part of the musical setting for the Mass.

As a visual motif the lamb has been most often represented since the Middle Ages as a standing haloed lamb with a foreleg cocked "holding" a pennant with a red cross on a white ground, though many other ways of representing it have been used.

==Gospel of John==
[[File:Agnus Dei.png|thumb|upright|Agnus Dei with the [[vexillum]]]]
The title ''Lamb of God'' for Jesus appears in the [[Gospel of John]], with the initial proclamation: "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:29|John 1:29]], the title reaffirmed the next day in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:36|John 1:36]].&lt;ref name=Bulgakov /&gt; The second use of the title Lamb of God takes place in the presence of the first two [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] of Jesus, who immediately follow him, address him as [[Rabbi]] with respect and later in the narrative bring others to meet him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life and Ministry of Jesus'' by Douglas Redford 2007 {{ISBN|0-7847-1900-4}} pages 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;

These two proclamations of Jesus as the Lamb of God closely bracket the Baptist's other proclamation in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:34|John 1:34]]: "I have borne witness that this is the Son of God". From a [[Christology|Christological]] perspective, these proclamations and the descent of the [[Holy Spirit]] as a dove in John 1:32 reinforce each other to establish the divine element of the [[Person of Christ]].&lt;ref name=Bulgakov /&gt; In Johannine Christology the proclamation "who takes away the sin of the world" begins the unfolding of the [[salvation in Christianity|salvific]] theme of the redemptive and sacrificial death of Jesus followed by his resurrection which is built upon in other proclamations such as "this is indeed the Saviour of the world" uttered by the Samaritans in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#4:42|John 4:42]].&lt;ref&gt;''Johannine Christology'' and the Early Church by T. E. Pollard 2005 {{ISBN|0-521-01868-4}} page 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Early Christology'' by Martin Hengel 2004 {{ISBN|0-567-04280-4}} page 371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book of Revelation==
[[File:Agnus Dei with Vexillum.jpg|thumb|upright|Lamb bleeding into the [[Holy Chalice]], carrying the vexillum]]
The [[Book of Revelation]] includes over twenty-nine references to a lion-like lamb ("slain but standing") which delivers victory in a manner reminiscent of the resurrected Christ.&lt;ref name=Glabach &gt;''Reclaiming the book of Revelation:'' by Wilfried E. Glabach 2007 {{ISBN|1-4331-0054-1}} pages&lt;/ref&gt; In the first appearance of the lamb in Revelation ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#5:1|5:1-7]]) only the lamb (which is of the tribe of Judah, and the root of David) is found worthy to take the judgment scroll from God and break the seals.&lt;ref name=Glabach /&gt;  The reference to the lamb in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#5:6|Revelation 5:6]] relates it to the [[Seven Spirits of God]] which first appear in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#1:4|Revelation 1:4]] and are associated with Jesus who holds them along with seven stars.&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament Theology'' by [[Thomas R. Schreiner]] 2008 Baker Academic {{ISBN|0-8010-2680-6}} page 502&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#21:14|Revelation 21:14]] the lamb is said to have twelve apostles.&lt;ref name=Glabach /&gt; The handing of the scroll (i.e. the book containing the names of those who will be saved) to the risen lamb signifies the change in the role of the lamb. In Calvary, the lamb submitted to the will of the Father to be slain, but now is trusted with the judgment of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Revelation'' by M. R. De Haan, Martin Ralph DeHaan 1998 {{ISBN|0-8254-2485-2}} page 103&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outset, the book of Revelation is presented as a "revelation of Jesus Christ" and hence the focus on the lamb as both redeemer and judge presents the dual role of Jesus: he redeems man through self-sacrifice, yet calls man to account on the day of judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation'' by Ben Witherington {{ISBN|978-0-521-00068-0}} page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christology==
The concept of the Lamb of God fits well within [[Johannine|John's]] "agent [[Christology]]", in which sacrifice is made as an ''agent of God'' or ''servant of God'' for the sake of eventual victory.&lt;ref name=Cullmann &gt;''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 {{ISBN|0-664-24351-7}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Johannine exegesis of God'' by Daniel Rathnakara Sadananda 2005 {{ISBN|3-11-018248-3}} page 281&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of a sacrificial lamb which rises in victory as the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrected Christ]] was employed in early [[Christology]].  For example in 375 [[Saint Augustine]] wrote: "Why a lamb in his passion? Because he underwent death without being guilty of any iniquity. Why a lion in his passion? Because in being slain, he slew death. Why a lamb in his resurrection? Because his innocence is everlasting. Why a lion in his resurrection? Because everlasting also is his might."&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation'' by William C. Weinrich 2005 {{ISBN|0-8308-1497-3}} page 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Poreč021.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Medieval ''Agnus Dei'' with [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] and cross;  [[Euphrasian Basilica]], [[Poreč]], [[Croatia]]]]The 11th century Christology of Saint [[Anselm of Canterbury]] specifically disassociates the Lamb of God from the [[Old Testament]] concept of a [[Scape goat|scapegoat]], which is subjected to punishment for the sins of others without knowing it or willing it.&lt;ref name=anselm &gt;''The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury'' by Dániel Deme 2004 {{ISBN|0-7546-3779-4}} pages 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Anselm emphasized that as Lamb of God, Jesus chose to suffer in Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of the Father.&lt;ref name=anselm /&gt;

[[John Calvin]] presented the same Christological view, of "The Lamb as the agent of God", by arguing that in his [[Pilate's Court|trial before Pilate]] and while at [[Jesus at Herod's Court|Herod's Court]] Jesus could have argued for his innocence, but instead remained mostly quiet and submitted to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] in obedience to the Father, for he knew his role as the Lamb of God.&lt;ref name=Hughes125&gt;''The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures'' by [[Hughes Oliphant Old]] 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-4775-7}} page 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Calvin91&gt;''Calvin's Christology'' by Stephen Edmondson 2004 {{ISBN|0-521-54154-9}} page 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christology, [[Sergei Bulgakov]] argued that the role of Jesus as the Lamb of God was "pre-eternally" determined by the Father, before the creation of the world, by considering the scenario that it would be necessary to send The Son as an agent to redeem humanity disgraced by the fall of Adam, and that this is a sign of His love.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lamb of God'' by Sergei Bulgakov 2008 {{ISBN|0-8028-2779-9}} page 129&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:270713 Museum in Monastery of Reformers in Kazimierz Dolny - 01.jpg|thumb|150px|right|San Damiano Cross depicts the sacrificial Christ as Agnus Dei]]
Multiple hypotheses about the suitable symbolism for the Lamb of God have been offered, within various Christological frameworks, ranging from the interpretation of Old Testament references to those of the Book of Revelation.&lt;ref name=Nev13&gt;''Symbols of Jesus: A Christology of Symbolic Engagement'' by Robert C. Neville (Feb 4, 2002) Cambridge Univ Pres {{ISBN|0521003539}} page 13&lt;/ref&gt; One view suggests the symbolism of [[Leviticus]] 16 as [[scapegoat]], coupled with [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 3:21-25 for atonement, while another view draws parallels with the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal Lamb]] in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 12:1-4, coupled with John 1:29-36, and yet another symbolism relies on Revelation 5:5-14 in which the lamb is viewed as a lion who destroys evil.&lt;ref name=Nev13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Lion and the Lamb'' by Andreas J. Kostenberger, L. Scott Kellum and Charles L Quarles (Jul 15, 2012) {{ISBN|1433677083}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt; However, as above, the view adopted by Saint Anselm and John Calvin rejects the scapegoat symbolism.  They view Jesus as making a knowing sacrifice as an agent of God, unlike an unwitting scapegoat.&lt;ref name=anselm /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hughes125/&gt;&lt;ref name=Calvin91/&gt;

In modern Roman Catholic Christology, [[Karl Rahner]] has continued to elaborate on the analogy that the blood of the Lamb of God, and the water flowing from the side of Christ on [[Calvary]], had a cleansing nature, similar to [[Baptism in Christianity|baptismal water]]. In this analogy, the blood of the Lamb washed away the sins of humanity in a new baptism, redeeming it from the fall of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the [[Roman Rite]] and also in the [[Eucharist]] of the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Lutheran Church]], and the [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite]] of the [[Orthodox Church]] the ''Agnus Dei'' is the invocation to the Lamb of God sung or recited during the [[fraction (religion)|fraction]] of the [[Host (Holy Communion)|Host]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01221a.htm "Agnus Dei (in Liturgy)"] article from ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to have been introduced into the Mass by [[Pope Sergius I]] (687–701).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodox.net/faq/weslives.htm Lives of Orthodox Western Saints] by
Reader Daniel Lieuwen (St Nicholas Orthodox Church, McKinney TX)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Agnus Dei'' has been set to music by many composers, usually as part of a [[mass (music)|Mass setting]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Harvard dictionary of music'' by Don Michael Randel 2003 {{ISBN|0-674-01163-5}} page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The earliest settings of the Agnus Dei and its tropes'' by Charles Mercer Atkinson, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 1975 page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art ==

[[File:Lamb of God in Herz-Jesu Church.jpg|thumbnail|right| Lamb of God with [[vexillum]], Sacred Heart Church (Berlin), 1898]]
In [[Christian]] [[iconography]], an Agnus Dei is a visual representation of Jesus as a lamb, since the [[Middle Ages]], usually holding a standard or banner with a [[Christian cross|cross]]. This normally rests on the lamb's shoulder and is held in its right foreleg. Often the cross will have a white banner suspended from it charged with a red cross (similar to [[St George's Cross]]), though the cross may also be rendered in different colors. Sometimes the lamb is shown lying atop a book with [[seven seals]] hanging from it. This is a reference to the imagery in the [[Book of Revelation]] {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|5:1-13|KJV}}, ff. Occasionally, the lamb may be depicted bleeding from the area of the heart (Cf. {{bibleverse||Revelation|5:6|KJV}}), symbolizing Jesus' shedding of his [[Blood of Christ|blood]] to take away the sins of the world (Cf. {{bibleverse||John|1:29|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|1:36|KJV}}).

In [[Early Christian art]] the symbol appears very early on. Several [[mosaic]]s in churches include it, some showing a row of twelve sheep representing the apostles flanking the central Agnus Dei, as in [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]], Rome (526-30).

The [[Moravian Church]] uses an Agnus Dei as their seal with the surrounding inscription ''Vicit agnus noster, eum sequamur'' ("Our Lamb has conquered, let us follow him").

Although the depiction of Jesus as the Lamb of God is of ancient origin, it is not used in the liturgical [[iconography]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The reason for this is that the depictions of Jesus in the Orthodox Church are anthropomorphic rather than symbolic, as a confession of the Orthodox belief in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the [[Logos]]. However, there is no objection to the application of the term "Lamb of God" to Jesus.  In fact, the Host used in the Orthodox [[Divine Liturgy]] is referred to as the [[Lamb (liturgy)|Lamb]] ({{lang-el|άμνος|translit=amnos''}}; {{lang-chu|Агнецъ|translit=agnets}}).

A ''Paschal Lamb'' is a charge used in heraldry, for example as the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Davie Baronets]], and is [[blazon]]ed: ''A paschal lamb''&lt;ref&gt;Montague-Smith, P.W. (ed.), Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Companionage,  Kelly's Directories Ltd, Kingston-upon-Thames, 1968, p.232&lt;/ref&gt; This charge is depicted as a lamb standing with body facing towards the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] (viewer's left), with [[halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]], and with head facing forwards (or turned looking backwards to [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]], termed ''reguardant'') holding under its right foreleg a flagpole, tipped with a small cross, resting at a diagonal angle over its shoulder, flying a banner of the [[St George's Cross|Cross of St. George]] (except in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]'s coat of arms, where it flies a banner of the [[Saltire|Cross of St Andrew]]).

== Catholic sacramental ==
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], an ''Agnus Dei'' is a disc of wax, stamped with an image of Jesus as a lamb bearing a cross, that is [[consecration | consecrated]] by the [[Pope]] as a [[sacramentals|sacramental]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01220a.htm "Agnus Dei"] article from ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; These were often set in jewelry, and might be worn round the neck on a chain, or as a brooch.

'''Leave No Trace''' is a set of [[outdoor]] [[ethics]] promoting [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] in the outdoors. It consists of seven principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lnt.org/learn/seven-principles-overview|title=Seven Principles Overview {{!}} Leave No Trace|website=lnt.org|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# plan ahead and prepare,
# travel and camp on durable surfaces,
# [[waste disposal|dispose of waste]] properly,
# leave what you find,
# minimize [[campfire]] impacts,
# respect [[wildlife]],
# be considerate of other visitors.

These  principles have been adapted to different activities, ecosystems and environments. Since 1994, '''Leave No Trace Center For Outdoor Ethics''', a non-profit organization also known as Leave No Trace, exists to educate people about their recreational impact on nature as well as the principles of Leave No Trace to prevent and minimize such impacts.

==Origins==
In the mid 20th-century there was a cultural shift in [[wilderness]] ethics from [[woodcraft]] where wilderness travelers prided themselves on their ability to rely on the resources of wild lands to a post-WWII ethics of minimal [[environmental impact|impact on the environment]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner|first=J.M.|title=From Woodcraft to 'Leave No Trace':Wilderness, Consumerism, and Environmentalism in Twentieth-Century America |journal=Environmental History| pages=462–484| volume=7| date=July 2002|url=http://environmentalhistory.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7-3_Turner.pdf |doi= 10.2307/3985918| format=PDF| issue=3| jstor=3985918| publisher=Environmental History, Vol. 7, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leave No Trace began in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="lnthist"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |url=http://lnt.org/about/history.html |title=In Depth History of Leave No Trace |work= |publisher=Leave No Trace |accessdate=2006-08-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718233839/http://www.lnt.org/about/history.html |archivedate=2006-07-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a large increase of wilderness visitation following the creation of new recreational equipment such as white gas stoves, synthetic tents, and sleeping pads. This began a commercial interest in [[outdoor recreation]] which in turn caused more visitors to national parks.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; In those decades, the [[United States Forest Service]], the [[Bureau of Land Management]], and the [[National Park Service]] started to teach their non-motorized visitors how to have a minimal impact on the land. Wilderness Informational Specialists were trained to educate visitors on minimal impact camping in the different parks. In 1987 the three departments cooperatively developed a pamphlet titled "Leave No Trace Land Ethics".&lt;ref name="USFSLNThist"&gt;{{cite web | last = Marion | first = Jeffrey L. | authorlink = |author2=Scott E. Reid  | year = 2001 | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev2_038125.pdf | format=PDF | title = Development of the U.S. Leave No Trace Program: An Historical Perspective | work = | publisher = U.S. Forest Service | accessdate = 2012-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1970s, groups such as the [[Sierra Club]] were advocating minimum impact camping techniques. The [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) had been actively advocating training and implementation of Leave No Trace and outdoor ethics principles early in the 1970s at such places as [[Philmont Scout Ranch]] in Northern [[New Mexico]]. A pilot program in the 1980s between the BSA and the Bureau of Land Management in the [[High Uintas Wilderness]] tried to reach a wide audience.

The national education program of Leave No Trace was developed in 1990 by the [[United States Forest Service]] in conjunction with the [[National Outdoor Leadership School]] (NOLS). At the time the USFS also created other programs such as [[Smokey Bear]], [[Woodsy Owl]], and previously in 1985 the [[Tread Lightly!]] program which was geared towards motorized recreation. The [[Bureau of Land Management]] joined the program in 1993 followed by the [[National Park Service]] and [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=USFSLNThist/&gt;

==Principles==
Leave No Trace provides a framework for outdoor recreation decision making, which is summarized in the following seven principles.  Originally developed for the "[[backcountry]]", there are now also seven "frontcountry" principles as well:&lt;ref name="lntprin"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.lnt.org/programs/lnt7/index.html| title =Seven Principles of Leave No Trace| work =| publisher =Leave No Trace| accessdate =2006-08-03| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060813092832/http://www.lnt.org/programs/lnt7/index.html| archivedate =2006-08-13| deadurl =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backcountry===
# Plan ahead and prepare: Poorly prepared people, when presented with unexpected situations, often resort to high-impact solutions that degrade the outdoors or put themselves at risk. Proper planning leads to less impact.
# Travel and camp on durable surfaces: Damage to land occurs when surface vegetation or communities of organisms are trampled beyond repair. The resulting barren area leads to unusable trails, campsites, and [[soil]] [[erosion]].
# Dispose of waste properly: Trash and litter in the backcountry ranks high as a problem in the minds of many backcountry visitors. This will greatly detract from the naturalness of an area and could potentially cause greater environmental damage.  If no trash receptacles are available, visitors should carry out all trash from what they have brought in.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/education/lnt/background/packing.htm| title=Pack it in, pack it out| work=Teaching leave no trace| publisher=U.S. Bureau of Land Management|accessdate=2007-09-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070814105440/http://www.blm.gov/education/lnt/background/packing.htm |archivedate = 2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, backcountry campers create [[wastewater|waste water]] from certain activities and fecal waste which requires proper disposal according to Leave No Trace principles.  (Urinating in the woods is not a violation of Leave No Trace. However, if defecating one must not leave any toilet paper, and the waste is to be buried a certain distance from both paths and water sources). 
# Leave what you find: Leave No Trace directs people to minimize site alterations by avoiding actions such as digging tent trenches, cutting branches from live trees, hammering nails into trees, permanently clearing an area of rocks or twigs, or removing other natural items.
# Minimize campfire impacts: Because the naturalness of many areas has been degraded by overuse of fires, Leave No Trace teaches to seek alternatives to fires or use low-impact fires.
# Respect wildlife: minimizing impact on wildlife and ecosystems.
# Be considerate of other visitors: Following hiking etiquette and maintaining quiet allows visitors to go through the wilderness with minimal impact on other users.

===Frontcountry===
# Know before you go
# Stick to trails and camp overnight right
# Stash your trash and pick up waste
# Leave it as you find it
# Be careful with fire
# Keep wildlife wild
# Share our trails and manage your pet

==Scientific foundation==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Two primary scientific disciplines form the foundation of the Leave No Trace program: [[recreation ecology]] and [[human dimensions of natural resources]]. Recreation ecology research, "a field of study that examines, assesses and monitors visitor impacts, typically to protected natural areas, and their relationships to influential factors" has provided the foundation for Leave No Trace messaging because of its focus on recreational impacts. Recreation ecology has dominated most minimum-impact research, and reviews suggest that there have been over one thousand recreation ecology articles published within recent decades. Examples include both ecological and social impacts of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rendezvous.nols.edu//content/category/46/262/733/|title=rendezvous.nols.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the behavior of outdoor enthusiasts is perhaps{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} the largest determinant of impact, and human dimensions research, which focuses on the sociological, psychological, cultural, and economic aspects of recreationists is limited but growing with regard to Leave No Trace-related studies.

The majority of human dimensions research related to Leave No Trace has evaluated educational effectiveness through various communication strategies in an effort to increase knowledge and influence behavioral change. For example, studies have evaluated communication strategies to mitigate human and wildlife conflict, reduce litter, minimize removal of natural objects or deter off-trail hiking. Few studies have addressed Leave No Trace specifically, instead focusing on minimum-impact behaviors broadly, and even fewer studies have evaluated the most common user-group, frontcountry visitors. More recently, however, social scientists have explored concepts such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, values, and behaviors of outdoor enthusiasts in the context of Leave No Trace practices, and have begun examining the perceptions of frontcountry visitors.

Since 1994, a Leave No Trace program has been managed by the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics.&lt;ref name="lnthome"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url = http://lnt.org/ | title = Center for Outdoor Ethics | work =  | publisher = Leave No Trace | accessdate = 2006-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics, a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization, is dedicated to the responsible enjoyment and active stewardship of the outdoors worldwide. 

The Center's mission is to teach people how to enjoy the outdoors responsibly. This mission is accomplished through education, research, volunteerism and partnerships. Leave No Trace tries to build awareness, appreciation and respect for wildlands. 

The Center has partnerships with the [[National Park Service]], the [[U.S. Forest Service]], the [[Bureau of Land Management]], the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]],&lt;ref name="lntnp"&gt;[http://www.lnt.org/support/nonprofits.php LNT Non-profit Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205153039/http://lnt.org/support/nonprofits.php |date=2011-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[US Army Corps of Engineers]], and other partners such as colleges, universities, outfitter/guide services, small businesses, non-profits and youth serving organizations such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[American Camp Association]].

There are also formal Leave No Trace organisations in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.

==Criticism==
{{criticism section|date=October 2015}}
Despite the fact that Leave No Trace is a widely accepted [[Conservation movement|conservationist]] ethic, there has been a good amount of criticism. Environmental historian James Morton Turner argued in 2002 that Leave No Trace focused attention of backpackers "largely on protecting wilderness as a [[recreation]]al landscape" rather than tackling larger questions, such as "the modern economy, [[consumerism]], and the environment".&lt;ref name=JSTOR1&gt;{{cite journal| jstor=3985918|title=From Woodcraft to 'Leave No Trace': Wilderness, Consumerism, and Environmentalism in Twentieth-Century America |journal=Environmental History |date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner also argues that this ethic omitted the calculus behind it, and the code itself, in his view, "helped ally the modern backpacker with the wilderness recreation industry" by encouraging backpackers to practice the Leave No Trace ethic while in the wilderness and to keep an eye out for the logo of this ethic in shopping malls.&lt;ref name=JSTOR1 /&gt;

Gregory Simon and Peter Alagona had a different argument, saying in a 2009 article that there should be a move beyond Leave No Trace. They argued that this ethic "disguises much about human relationships with non-human nature" because it makes it seem that parks and wilderness areas are "pristine nature" which in their view, "erases their human histories, and prevents people from understanding how these landscapes
have developed over time through complex human–environment interactions".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gregory-simon.com/GLS/Research_and_Publications_files/Beyond_Leave_No_Trace.pdf| title=Beyond Leave No Trace| publisher=Ethics, Place and Environment| accessdate=2014-10-31| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101004332/http://www.gregory-simon.com/GLS/Research_and_Publications_files/Beyond_Leave_No_Trace.pdf| archivedate=2014-11-01| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the place of this ethic, they say that there should be a  new [[environmental ethic]] "that transforms the critical scholarship of social science into a critical practice of wilderness recreation, addresses the global economic system...and reinvents wilderness recreation as a more collaborative, participatory, productive, democratic, and radical form of political action".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt; In the article they also write about how certain corporations in the outdoor recreation industry and magazines like ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' support Leave No Trace (LNT), but that in stores for outdoor recreation products like [[REI]], "the LNT logo becomes both a corporate brand and an official stamp of approval".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt;

The authors also argue that because LNT "focuses on the immediate, local impacts of recreational use while ignoring larger issues of change over time and connections through space" it has what they consider "two conceptual flaws": the idea that the current wilderness is in a "natural, pristine condition" and the obscuring of the "spatial connections between what takes place inside parks and wilderness areas and what occurs outside".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt; The authors note that additionally, this ethic is limited in scope, offering "a code of conduct calibrated to the particular, limited, and arbitrary geographic scale of parks and wilderness areas".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt; They articulate their new environmental ethic as expanding LNT, not rejecting it all together, expanding its "spatial scale beyond the boundaries of parks and wilderness areas...broaden[ing] LNT’s ethical purview to include the global economic systems that make contemporary American wilderness recreation possible", redefining recreationists rather than "passive ethical subjects and consumers, to active participants in collaborative programs" and in sum, "a more democratic, more participatory, and more radical vision of outdoor recreation as a form of political action".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt; Near the end of the article, the authors articulate the seven principles of what they call 'Beyond Leave No Trace':&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt;
# Educate yourself and others about the places you visit
# Purchase only the equipment and clothing you need
# Take care of the equipment and clothing you have
# Make conscientious food, equipment, and clothing consumption choices
# Minimize waste production
# Reduce [[energy consumption]]
# Get involved by conserving and restoring the places you visit

Three years later, Simon and Alagona responded to critiques of their 2009 article calling for a 'Beyond Leave No Trace' approach. They argued that they were not the first to explore LNT's history, that they "joined a growing chorus of researchers", and importantly that they "remain steadfast in our endorsement of LNT’s value and potential" but that they believe that "this simple ethic is not enough in a world of global capital circulation where the goods we produce and consume in order to enjoy the outdoors can have long-term and far-reaching social and environmental ramifications".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gregory-simon.com/GLS/Research_and_Publications_files/Alagona%20%26%20Simon%202012.pdf| title=Leave No Trace Starts at Home: A Response to Critics and Vision for the Future| publisher=Ethics, Place and Environment| accessdate=2014-10-31| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101004203/http://www.gregory-simon.com/GLS/Research_and_Publications_files/Alagona%20%26%20Simon%202012.pdf| archivedate=2014-11-01| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While dismissing the concerns of critics, they write that, firstly, Leave No Trace "could not exist in its current form without a plethora of consumer products;" secondly, that "the use of such products does not erase environmental impacts;" and thirdly that LNT "systematically obscures these impacts, displacements, and connections by encouraging the false belief that it is possible to 'leave no trace'".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT2 /&gt;

Other critics of Leave No Trace have argued that it is impractical, displaces [[environmental impact of tourism|environmental impacts]] to other locations, "obscures connections between the uses of outdoor products and their production and disposal impacts" and have questioned how much the ethic affects everyday environmental behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718512002680| title=Contradictions at the confluence of commerce, consumption and conservation; or, an REI shopper camps in the forest, does anyone notice?| accessdate=2014-10-31 | doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.11.022| volume=45| journal=Geoforum|pages=325–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://wea.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/2013_colloquium/2013%20olrs%20book%20of%20abstracts_final.pdf#page=22| title=Environmentally Responsible Behavior and the Application of Leave No Trace beyond the Backcountry|publisher=Outdoor Leadership Research Symposium|accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''List of Mountains in South Africa''' is a general list of mountains in [[South Africa]], with elevation.  This list includes mountains in two other sovereign states, in the [[Stormberg Mountains|Stormberg]]-[[Drakensberg]] range, where the highest elevations are to be found in [[Lesotho]], as well as [[Emlembe]], the highest mountain in [[Swaziland]], located at the border with South Africa. The highest mountain in South Africa is {{convert|3450|m|ft}} high [[Mafadi]], located on the border of South Africa and Lesotho.  

Several of the highest peaks have [[snow]] in the [[Southern hemisphere]] winter season.

A '''''Khulu''''' is a peak above {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} and not within {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} of another ''Khulu'', as defined by the [[Mountain Club of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulsh|first=Cliff|title=Khulus|journal=MCSA|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seweweekspoortpiek]] and [[Du Toits Peak]] are among the [[ultra prominent peak]]s of [[List of Ultras of Africa|Africa]].

A few mountains, such as [[Spion Kop (hill)|Spion Kop]] or [[Isandlwana]] are historically important hills, even though they are relatively not very high. [[Table Mountain]] is important because of its emblematic value.

This is a list of rivers that are at least partially in France. The rivers are grouped by sea or ocean. The rivers flowing into the sea are sorted along the coast. Rivers flowing into other rivers are listed by the rivers they flow into. Some rivers (e.g. Sûre/Sauer) do not flow through France themselves, but they are mentioned for having French tributaries. They are given in ''italics''. For clarity, only rivers that are longer than 50&amp;nbsp;km (or have longer tributaries) are shown.

In French, rivers are traditionally classified either as ''fleuves'' when they flow into the sea (or into a desert or lake), or as ''rivières'' when they flow into another river. The ''fleuves'' are shown in '''bold'''.

For an alphabetical overview of rivers of France, see the category [[:Category:Rivers of France|Rivers of France]].

{{Original research inline|date=April 2011}}

The '''lithium economy''' is a concept analogous to other element-based economies, such as the [[hydrogen economy]], [[methanol economy]], [[ethanol economy]], electron economy, [[vegetable oils as alternative energy|vegetable oil economy]], or [[liquid nitrogen economy]] but where the energy storage medium is [[lithium]]. Analogous "economies" are the "aluminium economy" where the energy storage medium (fuel) is aluminium (typically aluminium-gallium).

The hydrogen economy as a low-carbon solution to land transport has problems in generation, distribution (infrastructure), on-board storage and cost of power converter ([[fuel cell]]). The lithium economy has analogous problems in all four areas, but considered separately, the routes to their solution have different absolute limits and different timescales for their solutions.

The lithium economy concept is used primarily as a political argument to prevent over-domination of the post-carbon energy future by oil companies; and as a post-carbon economy on which action can be taken now instead of deferred to some future date (see [[FreedomCAR]] project).

The lithium economy differs from the other proposed future fuel economies in that the transition roadmap begins with convencional recreable batteries using conventional [[Lithium ion battery|Li-ion]] or [[Lithium ion polymer battery|Lithium polymer cell]] batteries and progressing to chemistries (such as [[Lithium sulfur battery|Li-S]] and [[Lithium iron hospedarte battery|Li-iron-phosphate]]) and cell types with higher energy densities. Eventually, anode replacement Li-air or Li-water cells are envisaged where only anodes (lithium metal) are replaced.

The energy is stored in unoxidised lithium atoms, which release energy when oxidised. A lithium atom is seven times as heavy as a hydrogen atom, and at room temperature, hydrogen is a gas, while lithium is solid. This means energy per mass is much worse, but since lithium is much more compact, it has more energy per volume. In fact, storing hydrogen requires so much ancillary equipment or material that lithium is also competitive in energy per mass when the whole system is considered.

'''Mathieu Kérékou''' ({{IPA-fr|ma.tjø ke.ʁe.ku}}) (2 September 1933 – 14 October 2015) was a [[Benin]]ese politician who served as [[President of Benin]] from 1972 to 1991 and again from 1996 to 2006. After seizing power in a military coup, he ruled the country for 19 years, for most of that time under an officially [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology, before he was stripped of his powers by the National Conference of 1990. He was defeated in the [[Beninese presidential election, 1991|1991 presidential election]] but was returned to the presidency in the [[Beninese presidential election, 1996|1996 election]] and controversially [[Beninese presidential election, 2001|re-elected in 2001]].

==Military background==
Kérékou was born in 1933 in [[Kouarfa]] village,&lt;ref name="Pouvoir"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=69248 "Après 29 ans de pouvoir, le Président Kérékou tire sa révérence"], IRIN, 6 April 2006 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in north-west [[French Dahomey]]. After having studied at military schools in modern-day Mali and Senegal,&lt;ref name="Pouvoir"/&gt; Kérékou served in the military by joining the French Army in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Harris |last=M. Lentz |isbn=978-1-134-26490-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D6HKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Mathieu+K%C3%A9r%C3%A9kou+born#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Heads of States and Governments Since 1945 |year=2014 |page=89–90 |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following independence, from 1961 to 1963 he was an ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to Dahomeyan President [[Hubert Maga]].&lt;ref name=Profiles&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Benin |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mz-fXRsedPMC&amp;q=mathieu+kerekou#v=snippet&amp;q=mathieu%20kerekou&amp;f=false |title=Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders |year=2003 |pages=55–56 |publisher=Europa Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Maurice Kouandété]]'s coup d'état in December 1967, Kérékou, who was his cousin,&lt;ref name=Profiles/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amuwo&gt;'Kunle Amuwo, "The State and the Politics of Democratic Consolidation in Benin, 1990–1999", in ''Political Liberalization and Democratization in Africa'' (2003), ed. Ihonvbere and Mbaku. {{ISBN|978-0275975067}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was made chairman of the Military Revolutionary Council.&lt;ref name=Profiles/&gt; After Kérékou attended French military schools from 1968 to 1970,&lt;ref name=Profiles/&gt; Maga made him a major, deputy chief of staff, and commander of the Ouidah paratroop unit.&lt;ref name=Profiles/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amuwo/&gt;

==1972 coup and single-party rule==
[[File:Mathieu Kerekou FOCR (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Mathieu Kérékou in 1976]]
Kérékou seized power in [[Republic of Dahomey|Dahomey]] in a military coup on 26 October 1972,&lt;ref name="Pouvoir"/&gt; ending a system of government in which three members of a presidential council were to rotate power (earlier in the year Maga had handed over power to [[Justin Ahomadegbé]]).&lt;ref name="Decalo"&gt;Samuel Decalo, "Benin: First of the New Democracies", in ''Political Reform in Francophone Africa'' (1997), ed. Clark and Gardinier. {{ISBN|978-0813327860}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first two years in power, Kérékou expressed only nationalism and said that the country's revolution would not "burden itself by copying foreign ideology ... We do not want communism or capitalism or socialism. We have our own Dahomean social and cultural system." On 30 November 1974, however, he announced the adoption of [[Marxism-Leninism]] by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Victor T. |last=Le Vine |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVlzpwjhGqgC&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;vq=mathieu%20kerekou&amp;pg=PA145#v=snippet&amp;q=mathieu%20kerekou&amp;f=false |title=Politics in Francophone Africa |page=145 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=9781588262493 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The country was renamed from the [[Republic of Dahomey]] to the [[People's Republic of Benin]] a year later; the banks and [[petroleum industry]] were nationalized. The [[People's Revolutionary Party of Benin]] (''Parti de la révolution populaire du Bénin'', PRPB) was established as the sole ruling party. In 1980, Kérékou was elected president by the Revolutionary National Assembly; he retired from the army in 1987.&lt;ref name="Onadipe"&gt;Abiodun Onadipe, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120120115521/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2242/is_n1567_v269/ai_18801059/ "The return of Africa's old guard – former African leaders, mostly dictators, bid for a return to power"], ''Contemporary Review'', August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that Kérékou's move to Marxism-Leninism was motivated mainly by pragmatic considerations, and that Kérékou himself was not actually a leftist radical; the new ideology offered a means of legitimization, a way of distinguishing the new regime from those that had preceded it, and was based on broader unifying principles than the politics of ethnicity. Kérékou's regime initially included officers from both the north and south of the country, but as the years passed the northerners (like Kérékou himself) became clearly dominant, undermining the idea that the regime was not based in ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Decalo"/&gt; By officially adopting Marxism-Leninism, Kérékou may also have wanted to win the support of the country's leftists.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Allen |chapter='Goodbye to All That': The Short and Sad Story of Socialism in Benin |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLIQC4jKOEEC&amp;q=goodbye+to+all+that#v=snippet&amp;q=goodbye%20to%20all%20that&amp;f=false |title=Marxism's Retreat from Africa |editor-first=Arnold |editor-last=Hughes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kérékou's regime was rigid and vigorous in pursuing its newly adopted ideological goals from the mid-1970s to the late 1970s. Beginning in the late 1970s, the regime jettisoned much of its radicalism and settled onto a more moderately socialist course as Kérékou consolidated his personal control.&lt;ref name=Myth&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Claffey |chapter=Kérékou the Chameleon, Master of Myth |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFKNH-U06VQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Staging%20Politics%3A%20Power%20and%20Performance%20in%20Asia%20and%20Africa&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q=mathieu%20kerekou&amp;f=false |title=Staging Politics: Power and Performance in Asia and Africa |year=2007 |editor-first=Julia C. |editor-last=Strauss |editor-first2=Donal Cruise |editor-last2=O'Brien |pages=98–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kérékou survived numerous attempts to oust him, including an [[1977 Benin coup d'état attempt|invasion]] of the port city of [[Cotonou]] by mercenaries contracted by a group of exiled Beninese political rivals in January 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |first=Olutayo |last=Adesina |article=Benin, Republic of (Dahomey) Kérékou, Mathieu (1935–) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ftz_gtO-pngC&amp;q=mathieu#v=snippet&amp;q=mathieu&amp;f=false |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History |editor-link=Kevin Shillington |editor-first=Kevin |editor-last=Shillington |pages=242+ |title=Encyclopedia of African History: A - G.. 1 |isbn=9781579582456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two coup attempts in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13040372|publisher=BBC News|title=Benin profile – Timeline|date=4 June 2015|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was hoped that the nationalizations of the 1970s would help develop the economy, but it remained in a very poor condition, with the state sector being plagued by inefficiency and corruption. Kérékou began reversing course in the early 1980s, closing down numerous state-run companies and attempting to attract foreign investment.&lt;ref name="Decalo"/&gt; He also accepted an [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] structural readjustment programme in 1989, agreeing to austerity measures that severely cut state expenditure.&lt;ref name="Decalo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; The economic situation continued to worsen during the 1980s, provoking widespread unrest in 1989. A student strike began in January of that year; subsequently strikes among various elements of society increased in frequency and the nature of their demands grew broader: whereas initially they had focused on economic issues such as salary arrears, this progressed to include demands for political reform.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

==Transition to democracy==
In the period of reforms towards multiparty democracy in Africa at the beginning of the 1990s, Benin moved onto this path early, with Kérékou being forced to make concessions to popular discontent. Benin's early and relatively smooth transition may be attributed to the particularly dismal economic situation in the country, which seemed to preclude any alternative.&lt;ref name="Decalo"/&gt; In the midst of increasing unrest, Kérékou was re-elected as president by the National Assembly in August 1989,&lt;ref name="Onadipe"/&gt; but in December 1989 Marxism-Leninism was dropped as the state ideology,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DC163DF93AA35751C1A96F948260&amp;n=Top%2fNews%2fWorld%2fCountries%20and%20Territories%2fBenin "Upheaval in the east; Benin, too, gives up Marxism for reforms"], Reuters, 9 December 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and a national conference was held in February 1990. The conference turned out to be hostile to Kérékou and declared its own sovereignty; despite the objections of some of his officers to this turn of events, Kérékou did not act against the conference,&lt;ref name="Decalo"/&gt; although he labelled the conference's declaration of sovereignty a "civilian coup". During the transition that followed, Kérékou remained president but lost most of his power.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Beyer, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,970130,00.html "Africa Continental Shift"], ''Time'', 21 May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990 National Conference, which was nationally televised, Kérékou spoke to the [[Archbishop of Cotonou]], [[Isidore de Souza]], confessing guilt and begging forgiveness for the flaws of his regime. An observer described it as a "remarkable piece of political theater", full of cultural symbolism and significance; in effect, Kérékou was seeking forgiveness from his people. Such a gesture, so unusual for the African autocrats of the time, could have fatally weakened Kérékou's political standing, but he performed the gesture in such a way that, far from ending his political career, it instead served to symbolically redeem him and facilitate his political rehabilitation, while also "securing him immunity from prosecution". Kérékou shrewdly utilized the timing and setting: "Culturally as well as theologically it was impossible to refuse forgiveness on these terms."&lt;ref name=Myth/&gt;

[[World Bank]] economist [[Nicéphore Soglo]], chosen as prime minister by the conference, took office in March, and a new constitution was approved in a December 1990 referendum. Multi-party elections were held in March 1991, which Kérékou lost, obtaining only about 32% of the vote in the second round against Prime Minister Soglo;&lt;ref name="Elections"&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/bj.html Elections in Benin], African Elections Database.&lt;/ref&gt; while he won very large vote percentages in the north, in the rest of the country he found little support.&lt;ref name="Decalo"/&gt; Kérékou was thus the first mainland African president to lose power through a popular election.&lt;ref name="Decalo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEED7173EF935A15750C0A967958260&amp;n=Top%2fNews%2fWorld%2fCountries%20and%20Territories%2fBenin "Official result in Benin vote shows big loss for Kerekou"], Associated Press, 26 March 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; He apologized for "deplorable and regrettable incidents" that occurred during his rule.&lt;ref name=Onadipe/&gt;

After losing the election in March 1991, Kérékou left the political scene and "withdrew to total silence", another move that was interpreted as penitential.&lt;ref name=Myth/&gt;

==1996 presidential election==
Kérékou reclaimed the presidency in the March 1996 election. Soglo's economic reforms and his alleged dictatorial tendencies had caused his popularity to suffer.&lt;ref name="Onadipe"/&gt; Although Kérékou received fewer votes than Soglo in the first round, he then defeated Soglo in the second round, taking 52.5% of the vote.&lt;ref name=Amuwo/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elections"/&gt; Kérékou was backed in the second round by third place candidate [[Adrien Houngbédji]] and fourth place candidate [[Bruno Amoussou]];&lt;ref name=Amuwo/&gt; as in 1991, Kérékou received very strong support from northern voters,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EEDD1F39F935A35750C0A960958260 "World News Briefs; Benin Presidential Vote Heads for a Runoff"], ''The New York Times'', 6 March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; but he also improved his performance in the south.&lt;ref name=Amuwo/&gt; Soglo alleged fraud, but this was rejected by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed Kérékou's victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9113740 Benin, Year in Review: 1996], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; When taking the oath of office, Kérékou left out a portion that referred to the "spirits of the ancestors" because he had become a born-again Christian after his defeat by Soglo. He was subsequently forced to retake the oath including the reference to spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Yale |last=Richmond |first2=Phyllis |last2=Gestrin |year=1998 |title=Into Africa: Intercultural Insights |page=36 |isbn=978-1877864575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputed re-election, 2001==
Kérékou was re-elected for a second five-year term in the [[Benin presidential election, 2001|March 2001 presidential election]] under controversial circumstances. In the first round he took 45.4% of the vote; Soglo, who took second place, and parliament speaker Houngbédji, who took third, both refused to participate in the second round, alleging fraud and saying that they did not want to legitimize the vote by participating in it. This left the fourth-place finisher, Amoussou, to face Kérékou in the run-off, and Kérékou easily won with 83.6% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Elections"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1263931.stm "Benin 'day of mourning'"], BBC News, 6 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently discovered that the American corporation [[Titan Corporation|Titan]] gave more than two million dollars to Kérékou's re-election campaign as a bribe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4310331.stm  "US company admits Benin bribery"], BBC News, 2 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Kérékou's second period in office his government followed a liberal economic path. The period also saw Benin take part in international peacekeeping missions in other African states.&lt;ref name="irin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/58686/benin-president-mathieu-kerekou-leaves-after-29-years|title=BENIN: President Mathieu Kerekou leaves after 29 years|agency=IRIN|date=7 April 2006|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kérékou was barred from running again in 2006 on two counts.  The constitution not only limited the president to two terms, but also required that presidential candidates be younger than 70 (he turned 70 in 2003, through his second term). Kérékou said in July 2005 that he would not attempt to amend the constitution to allow him to run for a third term.  "If you don't leave power," he said, "power will leave you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=55408 "Kerekou says will retire next year, will not change constitution to stay in power"], IRIN, 12 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, speculation that he had wanted it to be changed, but faced too much opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Idrissou-Toure, [http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=1723 "Africa's big men cling to power"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325222632/http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=1723 |date=25 March 2006 }}, Spero News, 18 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2006, [[Benin presidential election, 2006|voters went to the polls]] to decide who would succeed Kérékou as President of Benin. [[Yayi Boni]] defeated Adrien Houngbédji in a run-off vote on 19 March,&lt;ref name="Elections"/&gt; and Kérékou left office at the end of his term, at midnight on 6 April 2006.&lt;ref name="irin"/&gt;

==Religion and symbolism==
Born and baptized in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] faith, although he was a lapsed adherent, Kérékou allegedly converted to [[Islam]] in 1980 while on a visit to Libya, and changed his first name to Ahmed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulers.org/indexk2.html#kerek Rulers.org biographical entry for Kérékou].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2001 |first=Ruth Nora |last=Cyr |title=Twentieth Century Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlhwTte8pbkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Twentieth%20Century%20Africa%202001&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=mathieu&amp;f=false |page=35 |location=San Jose, California |publisher=Writers Club Press |isbn=9780595189823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he later returned to the use of the name Mathieu. This alleged conversion may have been designed to please the Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and obtain financial and military support.&lt;ref&gt;''Africa's First Peacekeeping Operation: The OAU in Chad, 1981–1982'' (2002) by Terry M. Mays, p. 61. {{ISBN|978-0275976064}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the conversion story may have been a rumor planted by some of his opponents in order to destabilize his regime. He subsequently became a [[born-again Christian]].&lt;ref name="magical"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Okanla | first =Karim  | title =Benin's 'magical' leader  |  publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 20 August 2003| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3166593.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Samuel |last=Decalo |title=African Personal Dictatorships |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=23 |issue=2 |date=June 1985 |pages=209–237 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X0000015X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[West African Vodun|Vodun]] believers in Benin regarded him as having magical powers, explaining his ability to survive repeated coup attempts during his military rule.&lt;ref name="magical"/&gt;

Nicknamed "the chameleon" from an early point in his career,&lt;ref name=Business&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1721005/The-Chameleon-s-triumphal-return.html |title=The 'Chameleon's triumphal return |publisher=African Business |date=1 April 2002 |accessdate=15 October 2015 |via=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119092111/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1721005/The-Chameleon-s-triumphal-return.html |archivedate=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kérékou's motto was "the branch will not break in the arms of the chameleon".&lt;ref name="Pouvoir"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Myth/&gt; The nickname and motto he adopted were full of cultural symbolism, articulating and projecting his power and ability. Unlike some past rulers who had adopted animal symbolism intending to project a violent, warlike sense of power, Kérékou's symbolic animal suggested skill and cleverness; his motto suggested that he would keep the branch from breaking, but implicitly warned of what could happen to "the branch" if it was not "in the arms of the chameleon"—political chaos.&lt;ref name=Myth/&gt; To some, his nickname seemed particularly apt as he successfully adapted himself to a new political climate and neoliberal economic policies in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Business/&gt;

He used the campaign slogan, "Experience in the service of youth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
After leaving office in 2006, Kérékou stayed out of politics and spent time at his homes in Cotonou and [[Natitingou]] in northwestern Benin, his native region. He suffered a health crisis in 2014 and was taken to Paris for treatment. Although he recovered, he continued to suffer health problems, and he died in Benin on 14 October 2015 at the age of 82.&lt;ref name=RFI&gt;Tirthankar Chanda, [http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20151014-cameleons-necrologie-mathieu-kerekou-benin-president-dictateur-constitution-democra "Les «Caméléons» meurent aussi: Mathieu Kérékou s’en est allé"], Radio France Internationale, 14 October 2015 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His death was announced in a statement by President [[Thomas Boni Yayi]].

'''Mount Carmel''' ({{lang-he-n|הַר הַכַּרְמֶל}}, ''Har HaKarmel'' &lt;small&gt;[[ISO 259-3]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Har ha Karmell''; {{lang-ar|الكرمل}}, ''Al-Kurmul'', or {{lang-ar|جبل مار إلياس}}, ''Jabal Mar Elyas'' (''lit.'' Mount Saint Elias/Elijah) is a coastal [[mountain range]] in northern [[Israel]] stretching from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] towards the southeast. The range is a [[UNESCO]] [[biosphere reserve]]. A number of towns are situated there, most notably the city of [[Haifa]], Israel's third largest city, located on the northern slope.

The name is presumed to be directly from the [[Hebrew language]] word Carmel (כַּרְמֶל), which means "fresh" (planted), or "vineyard" (planted).

==Geography and geology==
The phrase "Mount Carmel" has been used in three distinct ways:&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt;
*To refer to the 39&amp;nbsp;km-long (24-mile long) mountain range, stretching as far in the southeast as [[Jenin]].
*To refer to the northwestern {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the mountain range.
*To refer to the [[headland]] at the northwestern end of the range.

The Carmel range is approximately {{convert|6.5|to|8|km|1|abbr=off}} wide, sloping gradually towards the southwest, but forming a steep ridge on the northeastern face, {{convert|546|m|0|abbr=off}} high.  The [[Jezreel Valley]] lies to the immediate northeast. The range forms a natural barrier in the landscape, just as the Jezreel Valley forms a natural passageway, and consequently the mountain range and the valley have had a large impact on migration and invasions through the Levant over time.&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt; The mountain formation is an admixture of [[limestone]] and [[flint]], containing many caves, and covered in several volcanic rocks.&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt; The sloped side of the mountain is covered with luxuriant vegetation, including [[oak]], [[pine]], [[olive]], and [[Lauraceae|laurel]] trees.&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt;

Several modern towns are located on the range, including [[Yokneam Illit|Yokneam]] on the eastern ridge, [[Zikhron Ya'akov]] on the southern slope, the [[Druze]] communities of [[Daliyat al-Karmel]] and [[Isfiya]] on the more central part of the ridge, and the towns of [[Nesher]], [[Tirat Hakarmel]], and the city of [[Haifa]], on the far northwestern [[promontory]] and its base. There is also a small kibbutz called [[Beit Oren]], which is located on one of the highest points in the range to the southeast of Haifa.

==History==

===Paleolithic history===
As part of a 1929&amp;ndash;1934 campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jane|last=Callander|title=Garrod, Dorothy Annie Elizabeth (1892–1968)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37443|accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1930 and 1932, [[Dorothy Garrod]] excavated four caves, and a number of rock shelters, in the Carmel mountain range at el-Wad, [[Tabun, Israel|el-Tabun]], and [[Es Skhul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athenapub.com/8timelin.htm|title=Timeline in the Understanding of Neanderthals|accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrod discovered [[Neanderthal]] and early modern human remains, including the skeleton of a Neanderthal female, named Tabun I, which is regarded as one of the most important human fossils ever found.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stringer, custodian of Tabun I, [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], quoted in an exhibition in honour of Garrod; ''Callander and Smith'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation at el-Tabun produced the longest [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic record]] in the region, spanning 600,000 or more years of human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/~pjs1011/Pams.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228172528/http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/~pjs1011/Pams.html |archive-date=2009-02-28 |title=From ‘small, dark and alive’ to ‘cripplingly shy’: Dorothy Garrod as the first woman Professor at Cambridge|accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four caves and rock-shelters (Tabun, Jamal, el-Wad, and Skhul) together yield results from the [[Lower Paleolithic]] to the present day, representing roughly a million years of [[human evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arch.haifa.ac.il/index.php/2013-12-25-08-32-38/prehistory-division |title=Excavations and Surveys / Prehistory Division |publisher=The Zinman Institute of Archaeology, University of Haifa |accessdate=2016-04-18    }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several well-preserved burials of Neanderthals and [[Homo sapiens]] and passage from nomadic hunter-gatherer groups to complex, sedentary agricultural societies is extensively documented at the site. Taken together, these emphasize the paramount significance of the Mount Carmel caves for the study of human cultural and biological evolution within the framework of palaeo-ecological changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arch.haifa.ac.il/excav.php |title=The Zinman Institute of Archaeology – Excavations and Surveys |publisher=Arch.haifa.ac.il |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313142646/http://arch.haifa.ac.il/excav.php |archivedate=March 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, UNESCO's [[World Heritage Committee]] added sites of human evolution at Mount Carmel to the [[World Heritage Site|List of World Heritage Sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  |url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2012/Pages/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site_Carmel_Caves_2-Jul-2012.aspx |title=Newest UNESCO World Heritage Site-Carmel Caves |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=2012-07-02 |accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpostunesco&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Enviro-Tech/4-Mount-Carmel-caves-nominated-to-join-UNESCO |title=4 Mount Carmel Caves Nominated to Join UNESCO |date=2012-06-29 |author=Sharon Udasin |accessdate=2016-04-19 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/903/ |title=Twenty-six new sites inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List this year |publisher=UNESCO |date=2012-07-02 |accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Heritage Site includes four caves (Tabun, Jamal, el-Wad, and Skhul) on the southern side of the Nahal Me’arot/Wadi El-Mughara Valley. The site fulfils criteria in two separate categories, "natural"  and "cultural".&lt;ref name=jpostunesco/&gt;

===As a strategic location===
[[File:Mount Carmel 01.jpg|thumb|View from Carmel to Haifa.]]
Due to the lush vegetation on the sloped hillside, and many caves on the steeper side, Carmel became the haunt of criminals;&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt; Carmel was seen as a place offering an escape from God, as implied by the [[Book of Amos]].&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Amos|9:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Books of Kings]], [[Elisha]] travelled to Carmel straight after cursing a group of young men because they had mocked him and the ascension of Elijah by jeering, "Go on up, bald man!" After this, bears came out of the forest and mauled 42 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:25|}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily imply that Elisha had sought asylum there from any potential backlash,&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt; although the description in the Book of Amos, of the location being a refuge, is dated by textual scholars to be earlier than the accounts of Elisha in the Book of Kings,&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Books of Kings''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Book of Amos''&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Strabo]] it had continued to be a place of refuge until at least the first century.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geographica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]],&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius of Salamis, ''Panarion'' 1:18&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josephus]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[War of the Jews]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Carmel had been the stronghold of the [[Essenes]] that came from a place in [[Galilee]] named ''[[Nazareth]]''; this Essene group are sometimes referred to as ''Nazareans'', possibly akin to [[Nazarene (title)|Nazarene]]s, which followed the teachings of [[Jesus]] ([[Yeshua]]).&lt;ref&gt;J Gordon Melton, ''Encyclopedia of American Religions''&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], Mount Carmel played a significant strategic role. The (20th century) [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] took place at the head of a pass through the [[Carmel Ridge]], which overlooks the [[Jezreel Valley|Valley of Jezreel]] from the south. [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] led the British in the battle, which was the turning point in the war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Jezreel Valley had played host to many battles before, including the very historically significant [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)|Battle of Megiddo]] between the [[Egypt]]ians and Canaanites, but it was only in the 20th century battle that the Carmel Ridge itself played a significant part, due to the developments in [[munitions]].

[[Archaeologist]]s have discovered ancient wine and oil presses at various locations on Mt. Carmel.&lt;ref name="Biblica"&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J Enc"&gt;''Jewish encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a sacred location===
In ancient [[Canaan]]ite culture, ''high places'' were frequently considered to be sacred, and Mount Carmel appears to have been no exception; [[Thutmose III]] lists a ''holy headland'' among his Canaanite territories, and if this equates to Carmel, as [[egyptology|Egyptologists]] such as [[Gaston Maspero|Maspero]] believe, then it would indicate that the mountain headland was considered sacred from at least the 15th century BC.&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt; According to the Books of Kings, there was an altar to [[Yahweh]] on the mountain, which had fallen into ruin by the time of [[Ahab]], but [[Elijah]] built a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:30-32|}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iamblichus]] describes [[Pythagoras]] visiting the mountain on account of its reputation for sacredness, stating that it was ''the most holy of all mountains, and access was forbidden to many'', while [[Tacitus]] states that there was an [[oracle]] situated there, which [[Vespasian]] visited for a consultation;&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt; Tacitus states that there was an altar there,&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt; but without any image upon it,&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt; and without a temple around it.&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt;

====Elijah====
[[File:Grotto of Elijah, Mt Carmel.jpg|thumb|The Grotto of Elijah.]]
In mainstream [[Jew]]ish, [[Christian]], and [[Islamic]]&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt; thought, [[Elijah]] is indelibly associated with the mountain, and he is regarded as having sometimes resided in a [[grotto]] on the mountain. Indeed, one name for Mount Carmel is جبل مار إلياس (''Jabal Mar Elyas''; ''Mount Saint Elias'').  In the [[Books of Kings]], Elijah challenges 450 prophets of a particular ''[[Baal]]'' to a contest at the altar on Mount Carmel to determine whose deity was genuinely in control of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]; since the narrative is set during the rule of [[Ahab]] and his association with the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[biblical criticism|biblical scholars]] suspect that the ''Baal'' in question was probably [[Melqart]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bible in 1 Kings 18, the challenge was to see which deity could light a sacrifice by fire.  After the prophets of Baal had failed to achieve this, Elijah had water poured on his sacrifice to saturate the altar and then he prayed; fire fell and consumed the sacrifice, wood, stones, soil, and water which prompted the Israelite witnesses to proclaim, "The LORD, He is God!  The LORD, He is God!" In the account, Elijah announced the end to a long drought; clouds gathered, the sky turned black, and it rained heavily.

Though there is no biblical reason to assume that the account of Elijah's victory refers to any particular part of Mount Carmel,&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt; Islamic tradition places it at a point known as ''El-Maharrakah'', meaning ''the burning''.&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt;

Two places have been appointed as possible site for the story about the battle against the priests of Baal. The slaughter could have taken place near the river Kishon, at the mountain base, in an amphitheater-like flat area. The site where the offering took place is traditionally placed on the mountain above Yokneam, on the road to the Druze village of Daliyat el-Karmil, where there is a monastery built in 1868 called El-Muhraqa ("the Sacrifice").  It is praised as one of the must-visit tour site in Haifa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizisrael.com/tour/5-must-visit-sites-haifa-tour/|title=Tour Haifa: 5 Must-Visit Sites in Haifa|last=BI|first=Editor|date=2018-11-29|website=Biz Israel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although archeological clues are absent, it has a point in its favor because it has a spring, from which water could have been drawn to wet Elijah's offering, and secondly there is a sea view, where Elijah looked out to see the cloud announcing rain. On the other hand, in the Bible text it says that Elijah had to climb up to see the sea. There is an altar in the monastery which is claimed to be the one that Elijah built up in God's honor, but that is unlikely as it's not made of the local limestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mount Carmel|url = http://www.jewishmag.com/102mag/mtcarmel/mtcarmel.htm|website = www.jewishmag.com|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carmelites====
[[File:JPF-Cave Of Elijah.JPG|thumb|A statue of Elijah in the crypt of the monastery on Mount Carmel. According to Carmelite tradition, the crypt was originally the ''Cave of Elijah''.]]
A [[Catholic religious order]] was founded on Mount Carmel in the 12th century, named the [[Carmelites]], in reference to the mountain range; the founder of the Carmelites is unknown; in the original Rule or 'Letter of Life' given by Albert, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem who was resident in Acre, around the year 1210 this hermit is referred to simply as 'Brother B'; he probably died around the date 1210 and could have been either a pilgrim, someone serving out a penance or a crusader who had stayed in the Holy Land. The Order was founded at the site that it claimed had been the location of Elijah's cave, {{convert|1700|ft|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] at the northwestern end of the mountain range;&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt; this, perhaps not coincidentally, is also the highest natural point of the mountain range. Though there is no documentary evidence to support it, Carmelite tradition suggests that a community of [[Jew]]ish [[hermit]]s had lived at the site from the time of [[Elijah]] until the Carmelites were founded there; prefixed to the Carmelite Constitution of 1281 was the claim that from the time when Elijah and [[Elisha]] had ''dwelt devoutly on Mount Carmel'', priests and prophets, Jewish and Christian, had lived "praiseworthy lives in holy [[penitence]]" adjacent to the site of the "fountain of Elisha" in an uninterrupted succession.

A Carmelite [[Stella Maris Monastery|monastery]] was founded at the site shortly after the Order itself was created, and was dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under the title of "[[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]]" ("stella maris" in [[Latin]]), a common medieval presentation of her.&lt;ref name="Biblica"/&gt; Although [[Louis IX of France]] is sometimes named as the founder, he was not, and had merely visited it in 1252.&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt; The Carmelite Order grew to be one of the major Catholic [[religious order]]s worldwide, although the monastery at Carmel has had a less successful history. During the [[Crusades]] the monastery often changed hands, frequently being converted into a [[mosque]];&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt; under [[Islam]]ic control the location came to be known as "El-Maharrakah", meaning "place of burning", in reference to the account of Elijah's challenge to the priests of Hadad.&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt; In 1799 the building was finally converted into a [[hospital]], by [[Napoleon]], but in 1821 the surviving structure was destroyed by the [[pasha]] of [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt; A new monastery was later constructed directly over a nearby cave, after funds were collected by the Carmelite Order for restoration of the monastery.&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt; The cave, which now forms the [[crypt]] of the monastic church, is termed "Elijah's grotto" by the [[Discalced Carmelite]] friars who have custody of the monastery.&lt;ref name="J Enc"/&gt;

One of the oldest [[scapular]]s is associated with Mount Carmel and the Carmelites. According to Carmelite tradition, the [[Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] was first given to [[Simon Stock|St. Simon Stock]], an [[England|English]] Carmelite, by the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. The Carmelites refer to her under the title "[[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]]," and celebrate 16 July as her feast day.

====Bahá'í Faith====
[[File:TerracesBenGurion2.jpg|thumb|The [[Shrine of the Báb]] and its Terraces on Mount Carmel, 2004.]]
Mount Carmel is considered a sacred place for [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] around the world, and is the location of the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] and the [[Shrine of the Báb]]. The location of the Bahá'í holy places has its roots in the imprisonment of the religion's founder, [[Bahá'u'lláh]], near Haifa by the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the Ottoman Empire's rule over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

The Shrine of the Báb is a structure where the remains of the [[Báb]], the founder of [[Bábism]] and forerunner of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], have been laid to rest. The shrine's precise location on Mount Carmel was designated by Bahá'u'lláh himself and the Báb's remains were laid to rest on March 21, 1909 in a six-room mausoleum made of local stone. The construction of the shrine with a golden dome was completed over the mausoleum in 1953,&lt;ref name="anniversary"&gt;{{cite news | title=Golden anniversary of the Queen of Carmel | url=http://news.bahai.org/story/252 | publisher=Bahá'í World News Service. | date=2003-10-12 | accessdate=2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of [[The Terraces (Bahá'í)|decorative terraces]] around the shrine were completed in 2001. The white [[marble]]s used were from the same ancient source that most [[Athens|Athenian]] masterpieces were using, the [[Penteliko Mountain]].

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, writing in the ''[[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Lawh-i-Karmil (Tablet of Carmel)|Tablet of Carmel]]'', designated the area around the shrine as the location for the [[Bahá'í World Centre|administrative headquarters]] of the religion; the Bahá'í administrative buildings were constructed adjacent to the decorative terraces, and are referred to as ''[[The Arc (Bahá'í)|the Arc]]'', on account of their physical arrangement.

====Ahmadiyya Muslim Community====
[[File:Haifamosque222.jpg|thumb|The [[Mahmood Mosque (Kababir)|Kababir Mosque]].]]
The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has its largest Israeli mosque on Mount Carmel known as the [[Mahmood Mosque (Kababir)|Mahmood Mosque]] in [[Kababir]]. It is a unique structure composed of two minarets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/c12/67|title=Holy Sites in Haifa|publisher=Tour-Haifa|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque was once visited by the [[president of Israel]], [[Shimon Peres]], for an [[iftar]] dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKC-m6pq4Uo|title=Shimon Peres visits Ahmadiyya Mosque in Kababir Israel|publisher=youtube|accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Zuqualla''' (also spelled '''Zuquala''' or '''Chuqqaala''') is an [[extinct volcano]] in the [[Oromia]] region of [[Ethiopia]]. Situated in [[Ada'a Chukala]] woreda of the [[East Shewa Zone| (East) Shewa Zone]], it rises from the plain {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} south of [[Bushooftuu]]. With a height of {{convert|2989|m|ft|0}}, it is known for its [[crater lake]], lake Dembel, an elliptical crater lake with a maximum diameter of about one kilometer, but the trail around the crater is about 6&amp;nbsp;kilometers long.&lt;ref name=NAI-web&gt;[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/xyz/ORTZI.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 27 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Both the mountain and the lake is a holy site to the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] living nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 8 n. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The ambivalent attitude regarding the holiness of the mountain is seen in the Oromo [[proverb]]: "Those who live far away worship it, those who live nearby plow it."

The lake in the crater has an island [[Tulluu Irreechaa]], said to have been founded by [[Abba Gadaa of Tuulama]] on the site of a [[hermit]]age used by [[Saint Mercurius]]. This monastery was destroyed, and a church at the foot of the mountain looted, by Imam [[Ahmad Gragn]] in 1531; two churches were later built at the monastery, destroying the Galama of Tuulama Oromo, one dedicated to St Gebre Menfas built by [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] in 1880 and designed by the Italian [[Sebastian Castagna]], and the other dedicated to Kidane Mihret built during the reign of [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]].&lt;ref name=NAI-web /&gt; Various other holy sites are found around the mountain, mostly [[rock formation]]s, while the monastery is the site of a biannual [[festival]].

The explorers [[Orazio Antinori]], Antonelli and [[Antonio Cecchi]] used Zuqualla to determine various geographical locations in May 1881. Dr Scott, on behalf of [[Cambridge University]] and the [[British Museum]], secured a large and valuable entomological collection near Zuqualla in 1926. Three of the leaders of the attempted [[1960 Ethiopian coup]] fled to Zuqualla from the capital, where the Moja family had land. Two of them lost their lives 24 December while [[Mengistu Neway]], seriously wounded, was captured and brought to the capital for trial.&lt;ref name=NAI-web /&gt;

'''Neoevolutionism''' as a [[social theory]] attempts to explain the [[evolution of societies]] by drawing on [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] while discarding some dogmas of the previous theories of [[social evolutionism]]. Neoevolutionism is concerned with long-term, directional, evolutionary [[social change]] and with the regular patterns of development that may be seen in unrelated, widely-separated [[culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/neoevolutionism|title=neoevolutionism - anthropology|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- (In [[biology]], neoevolutionism is a controversial{{cn|date=September 2017}} scientific theory, seeing [[biological evolution]] as a ongoing process that continues to occur in the present day &lt;!-- As opposed to the notion that organisms cease to change once development reaches its apex or crowning glory in the form of Homo sapiens sapiens ?? --&gt; &lt;!--and offering examples such as coyote-dog hybrids across North America and hybrids of African and Asian pythons in Florida. The biological theory of neoevolutionism recognizes that human beings have significantly changed the Earth's environment and that new species evolve as a direct result of these changes.{{cn|date=October 2017}} Exotic species introduced into new environments have the most potential to adaptively radiate as they exploit available niches in their new ecosystems.{{cn|date=October 2017}}) --&gt;

Sociological neoevolutionism emerged in the 1930s. It developed extensively in the period after the [[Second World War]]—and was incorporated{{by whom?|date=September 2017}} into [[anthropology]] as well as into [[sociology]] in the 1960s.

Neoevolutionary theories are based on empirical evidence from fields such as [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], and [[historiography]]. Proponents{{which?|date=October 2017}} say neoevolutionism is objective and simply descriptive, eliminating any references to a moral or cultural system of [[values]].

While the 19th-century cultural evolutionism explained how culture develops by describing general principles of its evolutionary process, it was dismissed by [[historical particularism]] as unscientific in the early 20th century. Neoevolutionary thinkers brought back evolutionary ideas and developed them, with the result that they became acceptable to contemporary anthropology.

Neoevolutionism discards many ideas of classical [[social evolutionism]], notably the emphasis on  [[social progress]], so dominant in previous sociological evolution-related theories. Neoevolutionism discards the [[determinism]] argument and introduces [[probability]], arguing that accidents and [[free will]] have much impact on the process of social evolution. It also supports [[counterfactual history]]{{cn|date=September 2017}}—asking "what if?" and considering different possible paths that social evolution may (or might) have taken, and thus allows for the fact that various cultures may develop in different ways, some skipping entire [[Sociocultural evolution| "stages"]] others have passed through. Neoevolutionism stresses the importance of [[empirical]] evidence. While 19th-century social evolutionism used value judgments and assumptions when interpreting data, neoevolutionism relies on measurable information for analyzing the process of cultural evolution.

Important thinkers for neoevolutionism include:

* [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] (1855–1936). While not strictly a neoevolutionist himself, Tönnies produced work often{{quantify|date=September 2017}} viewed as the foundation of neo-evolutionism. He became one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that the [[social progress]] is not perfect—it can even be called a regress as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying high costs, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of individuals making up that society.
* [[Leslie A. White]] (1900–1975), author of ''The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome'' (1959). Publication of this book rekindled interest in evolution among sociologists and anthropologists. White attempted to construct a theory explaining the entire history of humanity. The most important factor in his theory is [[technology]]: ''[[Social system]]s are determined by [[technological system]]s'', wrote White in his book, echoing the earlier theory of [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. As a measure of societal advance he proposed measuring the [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]] of a given society (thus his theory is known as the [[energy theory of cultural evolution]]). White introduced a formula: C=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy. This theory resembles the later theory of the [[Kardashev scale]] proposed in the 1960s by the Russian astrophysicist [[Nikolai Kardashev]] (1932–). White differentiates five stages of human development:
** In the first, people use energy of their own muscles.
** In the second, they use energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]].
** In the third, they use the energy of plants (White refers to the [[Neolithic Revolution | agricultural revolution]] here).
** In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas.
** In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]].
* [[Julian Steward]] (1902–1972), author of ''Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution'' (1955, reprinted 1979), developed the theory of "multilinear" evolution which examined the way in which societies adapted to their environment—a more nuanced approach than White's theory of "unilinear evolution". He questioned the possibility of forming a single social theory encompassing the entire evolution of humanity, however he argued that anthropologists are not limited to descriptions of specific, existing cultures. He believed it possible to develop theories analysing typical, common culture, representative of specific eras or regions. As the decisive factors determining the development of given culture he pointed to technology and economics, and noted secondary factors such as like political systems, ideologies and religion. All those factors push the evolution of a given society in several directions at the same time, hence the multilinearity of his theory of evolution.
* [[Marshall Sahlins]] (1930–), author of ''Evolution and Culture'' (1960). He divided the evolution of societies into "general" and "specific" evolution, seeing general evolution as the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity, organisation and adaptiveness to their environment. However, as the various cultures are not isolated, there is interaction and a [[diffusion]] of their qualities. This leads cultures to deviate from the general evolution and develop in their specific, unique ways (specific evolution).
* [[Gerhard Lenski]] (1924–2015). In his ''Power and Prestige'' (1966) and ''Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology'' (1974), Lenski expands on the works of [[Leslie White]] and of [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. He views [[technological progress]] as the most basic factor in the evolution of societies and cultures. Unlike White, who defined technology as the ability to create and utilise [[energy]], Lenski focuses on [[information]]—its amount and uses. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of natural environments) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He distinguished four stages of human development, based on the advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information on by [[experience]]. In the third, humans start using [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can invent [[symbol]]s, and develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advances in the technology of communication translate into advances in the [[economic system | economic]] and [[political system]]s, the [[distribution of goods]], [[social inequality]] and other{{which?|date=September 2017}} spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication and economy:
** hunters and gatherers
** simple agricultural
** advanced agricultural
** industrial 
** special (like fishing societies)
* [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979), author of ''Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives'' (1966) and ''The System of Modern Societies'' (1971) divided evolution into four subprocesses:
*# division, which creates functional subsystems from the main system
*# adaptation, where those systems evolve into more efficient versions
*# inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems
*# generalization of values, increasing the legitimization of the ever more complex system.&lt;br&gt; Parsons shows those processes on three stages of evolution:
** primitive
** archaic and
** modern.&lt;br&gt;Archaic societies have the knowledge of [[writing]], while modern ones have the knowledge of [[law]]. Parsons viewed [[western world| Western civilisation]] as the pinnacle of modern societies, and out of all western cultures he declared the [[United States]] the most dynamic developed one.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">'''Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic''' is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] ecoregion of coastal [[East Africa]].

The [[ecoregion]] extends along the East African coast from southern [[Somalia]] through [[Kenya]] to the [[Lukuledi river]] in [[Tanzania]], which forms its southern boundary. It also encompasses the [[Zanzibar Archipelago]], including [[Unguja]] (Zanzibar) [[Pemba Island|Pemba]], and the surrounding smaller islands. The ecoregion includes a variety of habitats, including [[forest]], [[savanna]] and [[swamp]]s.

The ecoregion is bounded on the east by the [[Indian Ocean]]. It transitions to drier open woodlands and shrublands to the north and west: the [[Somali Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets]] in the north, the [[Northern Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets]] and [[Southern Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets]] west of the central portion, and the [[Eastern Miombo woodlands]] to the southwest. To the south, it borders the [[Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic]] across the Lukuledi River.

==Fauna==
The ecoregion is home to ten [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species of birds. Four are restricted to the island of Pemba (''[[Treron pembaensis]], [[Nectarinia pembae]], [[Zosterops vaughani]]'' and ''[[Otus pembaensis]]''). The remaining six are found on the mainland; one in the lower [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]] of Kenya (''[[Cisticola restrictus]]''), and four in the mainland coastal forest remnants – ''[[Erythrocercus holochlorus]], [[Anthus sokokensis]],'' Clarke's Weaver (''[[Ploceus golandi]]''), and ''[[Campethera mombassica]]''. ''[[Anthus melindae]]'' is endemic to the coastal grasslands in Kenya.

[[File:Oceans of Climate Change.ogv|thumbnail|right|Oceanographer Josh Willis discusses the heat capacity of water, performs an experiment to demonstrate heat capacity using a water balloon and describes how water's ability to store heat affects Earth's climate.]]

'''Oceanic heat content''' (OHC) is the heat stored in the ocean. [[Oceanography]] and [[climatology]] are the science branches which study ocean heat content. Changes in the ocean heat content play an important role in the [[sea level rise]], because of [[thermal expansion]]. It is with high confidence that ocean warming accounts for 90% of the energy accumulation from [[global warming]] between 1971 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Summary for policymakers |year = 2013 |url=http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf |author = IPCC AR5 WG1 |website=www.climatechange2013.org |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one third of that extra heat has been estimated to propagate to depth below 700 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/ocean-depths-are-trapping-heat-19922|title=Study: Deep Ocean Waters Trapping Vast Store of Heat|year=2016|work=[[Climate Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and measurement==
The areal density of ocean heat content between two depth levels is defined using a [[definite integral]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dijkstra|first=Henk A.|title=Dynamical oceanography|year=2008|publisher=Springer Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540763758|page=276|edition=[Corr. 2nd print.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H= \rho c_p \int_{h2}^{h1}  T(z) dz&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is [[seawater]] density, &lt;math&gt;c_p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] of sea water, h2 is the lower depth, h1 is the upper depth, and &lt;math&gt; T(z) &lt;/math&gt; is the temperature profile. In [[SI units]], &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; has units of J&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Integrating this density over an ocean basin, or entire ocean, gives the total heat content, as indicated in the figure to right. Thus, the total heat content is the product of the density, specific heat capacity, and the [[volume integral]] of temperature over the three-dimensional region of the ocean in question.

Ocean heat content can be estimated using temperature measurements obtained by a [[Nansen bottle]], an [[Argo (oceanography)|ARGO float]], or [[ocean acoustic tomography]].  The [[World Ocean Database Project]] is the largest database for temperature profiles from all of the world’s oceans.

The upper Ocean heat content in most North Atlantic regions is dominated by heat transport convergence (a location where ocean currents meet), without large changes to temperature and salinity relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heat content variability in the North Atlantic Ocean in ocean reanalyses|doi=10.1002/2015GL063299|authors=Sirpa Häkkinen, Peter B Rhines, and Denise L Worthen|year=2015|pmc=4681455|pmid=26709321|volume=42|journal=Geophys Res Lett|pages=2901–2909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent changes==
Several studies in recent years have found a [[multi-decadal oscillation]] increase in OHC of the deep and upper ocean regions and attribute the heat uptake to [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A review of global ocean temperature observations: Implications for ocean heat content estimates and climate change |year = 2013 |author = Abraham|doi= 10.1002/rog.20022 |display-authors=etal |volume=51 |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |pages=450–483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies based on ''ARGO'' indicate that ocean surface [[wind]]s, especially the [[subtropical ridge|subtropical trade winds]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], change ocean heat vertical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Distinctive climate signals in reanalysis of global ocean heat content |year = 2013 |author = Balmaseda, Trenberth &amp; Källén |doi=  10.1002/grl.50382 |volume=40 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |pages=1754–1759}} [http://www.rmets.org/weather-and-climate/climate/has-global-warming-stalled Essay]&lt;/ref&gt; This results in changes among [[ocean current]]s, and an increase of the [[thermohaline circulation#Movement of thermohaline circulation|subtropical overturning]], which is also related to the [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]] phenomenon. Depending on stochastic natural variability fluctuations, during La Niña years around 30% more heat from the upper ocean layer is transported into the deeper ocean.
Model studies indicate that [[ocean currents]] transport more heat into deeper layers during La Niña years, following changes in wind circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Model-based evidence of deep-ocean heat uptake during surface-temperature hiatus periods |year = 2011 |url= http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n7/full/nclimate1229.html| author = Meehl|doi= 10.1038/nclimate1229 |display-authors=etal |volume=1 |journal=Nature Climate Change |pages=360–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticalscience.com/The-Deep-Ocean-Warms-When-Global-Surface-Temperatures-Stall--.html |title= The Deep Ocean Warms When Global Surface Temperatures Stall |website=[[SkepticalScience.com]] |author=Rob Painting |date=2 October 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years with increased ocean heat uptake have been associated with negative phases of the [[Pacific decadal oscillation|interdecadal Pacific oscillation]] (IPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A Looming Climate Shift: Will Ocean Heat Come Back to Haunt us? |date =24 June 2013 |url= http://www.skepticalscience.com/A-Looming-Climate-Shift-Will-Ocean-Heat-Come-Back-to-Haunt-us.html| website=SkepticalScience.com | author = Rob Painting |accessdate=15 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is of particular interest to climate scientists who use the data to estimate the ''ocean heat uptake''.

A study in 2015 concluded that ocean heat content increases by the Pacific Ocean, were compensated by an abrupt distribution of OHC into the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature Geoscience|authors=Sang-Ki Lee, Wonsun Park, Molly O.

1. Oxygen photolyzed to atomic oxygen
2. Oxygen and ozone continuously interconverted. Solar [[UV]] breaks down ozone; molecular and atomic oxygen combine.
3. Ozone is lost by reaction with atomic oxygen (plus other trace atoms).]]
The '''ozone–oxygen cycle''' is the process by which [[ozone]] is continually regenerated in [[Earth]]'s [[stratosphere]], converting [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) into [[heat]]. In 1930 [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] resolved the [[chemistry]] involved. The process is commonly called the '''Chapman cycle''' by atmospheric scientists.

Most of the ozone production occurs in the tropical upper stratosphere and mesosphere. The total mass of ozone produced per day over the globe is about 400 million metric tons. The global mass of ozone is relatively constant at about 3 billion metric tons, meaning the Sun produces about 12% of the ozone layer each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~lizsmith/SEES/ozone/class/Chap_5/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727141412/http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~lizsmith/SEES/ozone/class/Chap_5/index.htm |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
#'''Creation''': an oxygen molecule is split ([[Photolysis|photolyzed]]) by higher frequency UV light (top end of [[UV-B]], [[UV-C]] and above) into two oxygen atoms (see figure):
#::O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;#8462;ν → 2 O•
#: Each oxygen atom then quickly combines with an oxygen molecule to form an ozone molecule:
#::O• + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
#'''The ozone–oxygen cycle''': the ozone molecules formed by the reaction above absorb radiation having an appropriate wavelength between [[UV-C]] and [[UV-B]]. The triatomic ozone molecule becomes diatomic molecular oxygen plus a free oxygen atom (see figure):
#::O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;#8462;ν&lt;sub&gt;(240–310&amp;nbsp;nm)&lt;/sub&gt; → O&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;+ O
#:The  atomic oxygen produced quickly reacts with another oxygen molecule to reform ozone:
#::O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''E''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;
#:where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the excess energy of the reaction which is manifested as extra [[kinetic energy]]. These two reactions form the ozone–oxygen cycle, in which the chemical energy released when O and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; combine is  converted into kinetic energy of molecular motion. The overall effect is to convert penetrating UV-B light into heat, without any net loss of ozone. This cycle keeps the ozone layer in a stable balance while protecting the lower atmosphere from UV radiation, which is harmful to most living beings. It is also one of two major sources of heat in the stratosphere (the other being the kinetic energy released when O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is photolyzed into O atoms).
#'''Removal''': if an oxygen atom and an ozone molecule meet, they recombine to form two oxygen molecules:
#::O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O· → 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
And if two oxygen atoms meet, they react to form one oxygen molecule:
#::2 O· → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
This reaction is known to have a negative [[order of reaction]] of -1.
The overall amount of ozone in the stratosphere is determined by a balance between production by solar radiation and removal.  The removal rate is slow, since the concentration of O atoms is very low.
#The net reaction will be 2 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Certain [[free radical]]s, the most important being [[hydroxyl]] (OH), [[nitric oxide]] (NO) and atoms of [[chlorine]] (Cl) and [[bromine]] (Br), [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the recombination [[Chemical reaction|reaction]], leading to an ozone layer that is thinner than it would be if the catalysts were not present.

Most of the OH and NO are naturally present in the stratosphere, but human activity, especially emissions of chlorofluorocarbons ([[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s) and [[Haloalkane|halons]], has greatly increased the Cl and Br concentrations, leading to [[ozone depletion]].  Each Cl or Br atom can catalyze tens of thousands of decomposition reactions before it is removed from the stratosphere.

[[File:Attenuation.svg|thumb|The penetration depth of [[X-rays]] in water as function of [[photon energy]].]]
'''Penetration depth''' is a measure of how deep light or any [[electromagnetic radiation]] can penetrate into a material. It is defined as the depth at which the intensity of the radiation inside the material falls to 1/e (about 37%) of its original value at (or more properly, just beneath) the surface.

When electromagnetic radiation is incident on the surface of a material, it may be (partly) reflected from that surface and there will be a field  containing energy transmitted into the material. This electromagnetic field interacts with the atoms and electrons inside the material. Depending on the nature of the material, the electromagnetic field might travel very far into the material, or may die out very quickly. For a given material, penetration depth will generally be a function of [[wavelength]].

According to [[Beer-Lambert law]], the intensity of an electromagnetic wave inside a material falls off exponentially from the surface as

: &lt;math&gt; I(z) = I_0 \, e^{-\alpha z} &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \delta_p &lt;/math&gt; denotes the penetration depth, we have 

:&lt;math&gt; \delta_p = \frac{1}{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;

"Penetration depth" is one term that describes the decay of electromagnetic waves inside of a material. The above definition refers to the depth &lt;math&gt; \delta_p&lt;/math&gt; at which the intensity or power of the field decays to 1/e of its surface value. In many contexts one is concentrating on the field quantities themselves: the electric and magnetic fields in the case of electromagnetic waves. Since the power of a wave in a particular medium is proportional to the ''square'' of a field quantity, one may speak of a penetration depth at which the magnitude of the electric (or magnetic) field has decayed to 1/e of its surface value, and at which point the ''power'' of the wave has thereby decreased to &lt;math&gt; 1/e^2&lt;/math&gt; or about 13% of its surface value:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta_e = \frac{1}{\alpha/2}  = \frac{2}{\alpha}  =  2 \delta_p &lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt; \delta_e &lt;/math&gt; is identical to the [[skin depth]], the latter term usually applying to metals in reference to the decay of electrical [[Electric current|currents]] (which follow the decay in the electric or magnetic field due to a plane wave incident on a bulk conductor). The attenuation constant  &lt;math&gt; \alpha/2 &lt;/math&gt; is also identical to the (negative) real part of the [[propagation constant]], which may also be referred to as &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; using a notation inconsistent with the above use. When referencing a source one must always be careful to note whether a number such as &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt; refers to the decay of the field itself, or of the intensity (power) associated with that field. It can also be ambiguous as to whether a positive number describes [[attenuation]] (reduction of the field) or [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]; this is usually obvious from the context.

The [[Propagation constant#Attenuation constant|attenuation constant]] for an electromagnetic wave at normal incidence on a material is also proportional to the imaginary part of the material's refractive index ''n''. Using the above definition of  &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; (based on intensity) the following relationship holds:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha / 2 =  \frac{1}{\delta_e}=  \frac{1}{2\delta_p}  =   \frac{\omega}{c} \; \mathrm{Im}(\tilde{n}(\omega)) =   \frac{2 \pi} {\lambda} \; \mathrm{Im}(\tilde{n}(\omega)) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \tilde{n} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''complex'' [[index of refraction#Dispersion and absorption|index of refraction]], &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the radian frequency of the radiation, ''c'' is the speed of light in vacuum and &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength. Note that &lt;math&gt; \tilde{n}(\omega) &lt;/math&gt;  is very much a function of frequency, as is its imaginary part which is often not mentioned (it is essentially zero for transparent dielectrics). The complex refractive index of ''metals'' is also infrequently mentioned but has the same significance, leading to a penetration depth (or [[skin depth]] &lt;math&gt; \delta_e &lt;/math&gt;) accurately given by a [[Skin effect#Formula|formula]] which is valid up to microwave frequencies.

Relationships between these and other ways of specifying the decay of an electromagnetic field are further detailed in the article: [[Mathematical descriptions of opacity]].

It should also be noted that we are only specifying the decay of the field which may be due to [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of the electromagnetic energy in a lossy medium or may simply describe the penetration of the field in a medium where no loss occurs (or a combination of the two). For instance, a hypothetical substance may have a complex index of refraction  &lt;math&gt; \tilde{n} = 1 + .01 j &lt;/math&gt;. A wave will enter that medium without significant reflection and will be totally absorbed in the medium with a penetration depth (in field strength) of&lt;math&gt;\delta_e \approx 16 \lambda&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \lambda&lt;/math&gt;  is the vacuum wavelength. A different hypothetical material with a complex index of refraction  &lt;math&gt; \tilde{n} = 0 + .01 j &lt;/math&gt; will ''also'' have a penetration depth of 16 wavelengths, however in this case the wave will be perfectly reflected from the material! No actual absorption of the radiation takes place, however the electric and magnetic fields extend well into the substance. In either case the penetration depth is found directly from the imaginary part of the material's refractive index as is detailed above.

'''prostep ivip''' is an association with its headquarter in [[Darmstadt]], Germany. It is a globally active, independent association of 180 member companies from industry, IT and research. As an industry-driven association it focuses on the digital transformation in product creation and production. By designing the digital transformation in the manufacturing industry prostep ivip defines and aggregates the requirements of manufacturers and suppliers, with the goal of defining standards and interfaces primarily for the digitalization of the entire product creation process – from idea to implementation. Founded in 1993 as ProSTEP Association for the Promotion of Product Data Standards and renamed to ProSTEP iViP Association in 2002. Since May 2017, the association's name is written as "prostep ivip".

== History ==
After the end of the ProSTEP Initiative of the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] (German acronym: BMWi), the ProSTEP Association was founded in 1993. Leading IT managers at [[BMW]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[Continental AG|Continental]], [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Delphi Automotive|Delphi]], [[Opel]], [[Siemens]], [[Volkswagen]] and 30 other companies realized that the development of modern processes for efficient product data management was crucial to ensuring the ability of German companies to compete in the global marketplace and that they can address their common aims at best when joining under the neutral umbrella of an association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostep.org/en/profile.html prostep ivip profile], as of January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emko_EjDAD8 prostep ivip: 25 years of digital transformation], as of August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point for this endeavor was the joint development of the [[ISO 10303|STEP data format (ISO 10303)]]. In 2002, it merged with the initiative "Integrated Virtual Product Creation (German acronym: iViP)" of the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (German acronym: BMBF), which led to a massive scope-extension. Until today, the prostep ivip association remains committed to developing new approaches to end-to-end process, system and data integration for its members and providing digital support for all the phases of the product creation process.

== Organization ==
40% of today's 180 member companies in ProSTEP iViP are manufacturing companies (manufacturers and suppliers), 40% are IT companies and service providers and 20% are research institutions and other standardization bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostep.org/en/profile/members.html prostep ivip Member List], as of January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This tripartism is also reflected within the by-annually elected board of the association: one representative of the manufacturers, one of the suppliers, one of the IT and one of the research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostep.org/en/profile/board.html prostep ivip Board], as of January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; prostep ivip's Technical Programm, with its currently over 20 running project groups, is governed be the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostep.org/en/projects.html prostep ivip Technical Program], as of January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooperations ==
prostep ivip maintains and continuously expands its network toward like-minded organizations. Examples for these organizations are [[Aerospace Industries Association|AIA]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[Object Management Group|OMG]]  as well as associations like the French [http://www.galia.com/en/dyn/AboutUs.asp GALIA], the Japanese [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association|JAMA]], the US-based [https://www.pdesinc.org/ PDES, Inc.], the German [https://www.vda.de/en/association/organization/organization-committees/working-group-PLM.html VDA] etc.

'''''Renewable Electricity and the Grid: The Challenge of Variability''''' is a 2007 book edited by [[Godfrey Boyle]] which examines the significance of the issue of [[Intermittent power source|variability]] of [[renewable energy]] supplies in the [[electricity grid]].

==Themes==
The energy available from sun, wind, waves, and tides varies in ways which may not match variations in consumer energy demand. Assimilating these fluctuations can affect the operation and economics of electricity networks and markets. There are many myths and misunderstandings surrounding this topic. ''Renewable Electricity and the Grid'' presents technical and operational solutions to the problem of reconciling the differing patterns of power supply and demand.&lt;ref name=boyle&gt;[http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=1159  Renewable Electricity and the Grid]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors==
Chapters of ''Renewable Electricity and the Grid'' are authored by leading experts, who explain and quantify the impacts of  renewable energy variability.  Godfrey Boyle (editor) is Director of the Energy and Environment Research Unit at the UK Open University and has written the textbooks ''Energy Systems and Sustainability'' (2003) and ''Renewable Energy: Power for a Sustainable Future'' (2004). He is a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology and a Trustee of the National Energy Foundation.&lt;ref name=boyle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://design.open.ac.uk/boyle/index.htm Godfrey Boyle]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Restingas'' form on sandy, acidic, and nutrient-poor soils, and are characterized by medium-sized [[tree]]s and [[shrubs]] adapted to the drier and nutrient-poor conditions.&lt;ref name="restinga"/&gt;

One of the most notable restingas is the [[Restinga da Marambaia]] (in [[Rio de Janeiro]]), which is owned and kept by the [[Army of Brazil|Brazilian Army]].

==Ecoregions==
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] distinguishes two ''Restinga'' [[ecoregion]]s. 
*[[Atlantic Coast restingas]] — found in several enclaves along Brazil's east coast from [[Rio Grande do Norte]] state in northeastern Brazil to [[Rio Grande do Sul]] state in southern Brazil, covering an area of {{convert|7,900|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} that extends from the tropics to the subtropics. Its flora and fauna shares affinities with the humid [[Atlantic forest]] of eastern Brazil.
*[[Northeastern Brazil restingas]] — found along the northern coast of Brazil, in [[Maranhão]], [[Piauí]], and [[Ceará]] states. Its flora and fauna are distinct from that of the Atlantic Coast ''restingas'', with greater affinities to the moist forests of the [[Amazon biome]].

'''Surface rupture''' (or '''ground rupture''', or '''ground displacement''') is the visible offset of the ground surface when an [[earthquake rupture]] along a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] affects the Earth's surface. Surface rupture is opposed by [[buried rupture earthquakes|buried rupture]], where there is no displacement at ground level. This is a major risk to any structure that is built across a fault zone that may be [[active fault|active]], in addition to any risk from ground shaking.&lt;ref name="What is Surface Rupture"&gt;{{cite web | access-date=2018-10-19 | url=https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-surface-faulting-or-surface-rupture-earthquake?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products | title=What is Surface Rupture | website=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface rupture entails vertical or horizontal movement, on either side of a fault which has ruptured. Surface rupture can affect large areas of land.&lt;ref name="Seismic Resilience"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.seismicresilience.org.nz/topics/seismic-science-and-site-influences/earthquake-hazards/surface-rupture/ |title=Surface rupture can be caused by vertical or horizontal displacement |date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Lack of surface rupture==

[[File:Running track after 1999 Chichi earthquake in Taiwan.jpg|thumb|300px|Surface rupture with folding due to reverse faulting along the [[Chelungpu Fault Preservation Park|Chelungpu Fault]] during the [[1999 Jiji earthquake]], [[Taiwan]]]]

Not every earthquake results in surface rupture, particularly for smaller and deeper earthquakes.&lt;ref name="What is Surface Rupture"/&gt;. In some cases, however, the lack of surface effects is because the fault that moved does not reach the surface. For example, the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] had a [[Moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 6.7, caused major damage in the [[Los Angeles]] area, occurred at {{convert|18.2|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} below the Earth's surface, but did not cause surface rupture, because it was a [[blind thrust earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/info/nr10/|title=USGS Northridge Earthquake 10th Anniversary|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Where surface rupture occurs==

Surface ruptures commonly occur on pre-existing faults. Only rarely are earthquakes (and surface ruptures) associated with faulting on entirely new fault structures.&lt;ref name="Surface Rupture"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/Prepare-Your-House-Earthquake-Risk/Geologic-Hazards/Surface-Rupture |title=Surface Rupture}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is shallow hypocenter, and large fracture energy on the [[asperity (faults)|asperities]],&lt;ref name="Surface Rupturing and Buried Dynamic-Rupture Models Calibrated with Statistical Observations of Past Earthquakes "&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article-abstract/98/3/1147/341883/surface-rupturing-and-buried-dynamic-rupture | title=Surface Rupturing and Buried Dynamic-Rupture Models Calibrated with Statistical Observations of Past Earthquakes | publisher=pubs.geoscienceworld.org | accessdate=28 October 2018 | author=Dalguer, Luis A.;  Miyake, Hiroe;  Day, Steven M.;  Irikura, Kojiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; the asperity shallower than {{convert|5|km|mi}}. Examples of such earthquakes are [[San Fernando earthquake]], [[Tabas earthquake]], and [[Chi-Chi earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Generation Mechanism of Surface and Buried Faults Considering the Effect of Plasticity in a Shallow Crust Structure "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/WCEE2012_1629.pdf | title=Generation Mechanism of Surface and Buried Faults Considering the Effect of Plasticity in a Shallow Crust Structure | publisher=iitk.ac.in | work=Generation Mechanism of Surface and Buried Faults Considering the Effect of Plasticity in a Shallow Crust Structure | accessdate=31 October 2018 | author=Wada, K.; Goto, H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In surface rupture earthquakes, the large slips of land are concentrated in the shallow parts of the fault.&lt;ref name="Differences in ground motion and fault rupture process between the surface and buried rupture earthquakes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2004/5601/56010003.pdf | title=Differences in ground motion and fault rupture process between the surface and buried rupture earthquakes | publisher=Earth Planets Space | date=14 March 2004 | accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, notably, permanent ground displacements which are measureable can be produced by shallow earthquakes, of [[moment magnitude|magnitude]] M5 and greater.&lt;ref name="Earthquake Processes and Effects"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/eqproc/grdmotion.php |title=Earthquake Processes and Effects |website=earthquake.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of surface rupture==
The form that surface rupturing takes depends on two things: the nature of the material at the surface and the type of fault movement.

[[File:Earthquake- road crack.jpg|thumb|300px|Consequences of the [[Chi-Chi earthquake]], [[Jiji, Nantou|Jiji]], [[Nantou County]], [[Taiwan]]]]

===Effect of surface lithology===
Where there are thick superficial deposits overlying the trace of the faults the resulting surface effects are typically more discontinuous. Where there is little or no superficial deposits the surface rupture is generally continuous, except where the earthquake rupture affects more than one fault, which can lead to complex patterns of surface faulting, such as in the [[1992 Landers earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zachariesen J. |last2=Sieh K. |year=1995 |title=The transfer of slip between two en echelon strike-slip faults: A case study from the 1992 Landers earthquake, southern California  |url=https://earthobservatory.sg/files/publications/pdf/The%20transfer%20of%20slip%20between%20two%20en%20echelon%20strike-slip%20faults.pdf |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=100 |issue=B8 |pages=15,281–15,301 |doi=10.1029/95JB00918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normal faulting===
Surface ruptures associated with normal faults are typically simple [[fault scarp]]s. Where there are significant superficial deposits, sections with more oblique faulting may from sets of en-echelon scarp segments. Antithetic faults may also develop giving rise to surface grabens.

===Reverse faulting===

Reverse faulting (or particularly thrust faulting) is associated with more complex surface rupture patterns as the protruding unsupported part of the hanging-wall of the fault is liable to collapse. In addition there may be surface folding and back-thrust development.

===Strike-slip faulting===
[[File:Denali Fault surface rupture.png|thumb|300px|Extent of surface rupture caused by strike-slip faulting during the 2002 Denali earthquake]]
Strike-slip faults are associated with dominantly horizontal movement, leading to relatively simple linear zones of surface rupture where the fault is a simple planar structure. However, many strike-slip faults are formed of overlapping segments, leading to complex zones of normal or reverse faulting depending on the nature of the overlap. Additionally, where there are thick superficial deposits, the rupture typically appears as a set of en-echelon faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tchalenko J.S. |last2=Ambraseys N.N. |year=1970 |title=Structural Analysis of the Dasht-e Bayaz (Iran) Earthquake Fractures |url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/81/1/41/6730 |journal=GSA Bulletin |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=41–60 |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1970)81[41:SAOTDB]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==

To retrofit a house to survive surface rupture requires engineered design by geotechnical, and structural or civil engineers. This can be quite expensive.&lt;ref name="Surface Rupture"/&gt;

[[File:Manu riverbank.jpg|thumb|right|Sediments underlying [[fluvial terrace]] exposed in cutbanks along the [[Manú River]], [[Peru]]]]

In [[geology]], a '''terrace''' is a step-like landform. A terrace consists of a flat or gently sloping geomorphic surface, called a tread, that is typically bounded one side by a steeper ascending slope, which is called a "riser" or "scarp."  The tread and the steeper descending slope (riser or scarp) together constitute the terrace. Terraces can also consist of a tread bounded on all sides by a descending riser or scarp.  A narrow terrace is often called a [[Bench (geology)|bench]].&lt;ref name="HowardOther1968a"&gt;Howard, A.D., R.W. Fairbridge, J.H. Quinn, 1968, ''Terraces, fluvial—Introduction.'' in R.W. Fairbridge, ed., The Encyclopedia of Geomorphology: Encyclopedia of Earth Science Series, vol. 3. Reinhold. Book Corporation. New York, New York..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson1997"&gt;Jackson, J.A., 1997, ''Glossary of Geology''. American Geological Institute. Alexandria, Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sediments underlying the tread and riser of a terrace are also commonly, but incorrectly, called terraces, leading to confusion.

Terraces are formed in various ways.

==Fluvial terraces==

{{main|Fluvial terrace}}

Fluvial terraces are remnants of the former [[floodplain]] of a stream or river. They are formed by the downcutting of a river or stream channel into and the abandonment and lateral erosion of its former floodplain. The downcutting, abandonment, and lateral erosion of a former floodplain can be the result of either changes in sea level, local or regional tectonic uplift; changes in local or regional climate; changes the amount of sediment being carried by the river or stream; change in discharge of the river; or a complex mixture of these and other factors. The most common sources of the variations in rivers and streams that create fluvial terraces are vegetative, geomorphic, and hydrologic responses to climate. More recently, the direct modification of rivers and streams and their watersheds by cultural processes have result in the development of terraces along many rivers and streams.&lt;ref name="HowardOther1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlumOther2000a"&gt;Blum, M., and T.E. Tonqvist, 2000, ''Fluvial responses to climate and sea-level change, a review and look forward.'' Sedimentology. v. 47 suppl. 1, pp. 2-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FluvialTerraces.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Hypothetical valley cross-section illustrating a complex sequence of aggradational (fill) and degradational (cut and strath) terraces and deposits (upland gravels). Note ct = cut terraces, ft = fill terraces, ft(b) = buried fill terrace, fp = active floodplain, st = strath terrace, and ug = upland gravels.]]

==Kame terraces==

{{main|Kame}}

Kame terraces are formed on the side of a glacial valley and are the deposits of meltwater streams flowing between the ice and the adjacent valley side.

==Marine terraces==
{{main|Marine terrace}}

A marine terrace represents the former shoreline of a sea or ocean. It can be formed by marine abrasion or erosion of materials comprising the shoreline (marine-cut terraces or [[wave-cut platform]]s); the accumulations of sediments in the shallow-water to slightly emerged coastal environments (marine-built terraces or [[raised beach]]); or the bioconstruction by [[coral reef]]s and accumulation of reef materials (reef flats) in intertropical regions.&lt;ref name="Pirazzoli2005"&gt;Pirazzoli, P. A., 2005, ''Marine Terraces.'' in M. L. Scheartz, ed., pp. 632-633. Encyclopedia of Coastal Science. Springer, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of a marine terrace follows this general process: A wave cut platform must be carved into bedrock (high wave energy is needed for this process). Although this is the first step to the process for the formation of a marine terrace, not all wave cut platforms will become a marine terrace. After the wave cut platform is formed it must be removed from interaction with the high wave energy. This process happens by either change in sea level due to glacial-interglacial cycles or tectonically rising landmasses.  When the wave cut has been raised above sea level it is preserved. The terraces are most commonly preserved in flights along the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~shlemonc/trips/santacruz_10/flogs/terraces.htm Clark, Alisha, ''Marine Terraces,'' University of California, Santa Cruz Island Geology and Geomorphology, accessed October 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131011184711/https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~shlemonc/trips/santacruz_10/flogs/terraces.htm |date=2013-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacustrine terraces==

A '''lake (lacustrine) terrace''' represents the former shoreline of either a nonglacial, glacial, or proglacial lake. As in case of marine terraces, a lake terrace can be formed by either the abrasion or erosion of materials comprising the shoreline, the accumulations of sediments in the shallow-water to slightly emerged environments, or some combination of these. Given the smaller size of lakes relative to the size of typical marine water bodies, lake terraces are overall significantly narrower and less well developed than marine terraces.&lt;ref name="Bowman1971"&gt;Bowman, D., 1971. ''Geomorphology of the shore terraces of the late  Pleistocene Lisan Lake (Israel)'' Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology Palaeoclimatology. v. 9, no. 3, p. 183-209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prieto1995"&gt;Prieto, F.J.G.,1995, ''Shoreline forms and deposits in [[Gallocanta Lake]] (NE Spain)'' Geomorphology. v. 11, no. 4, p. 323-335.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all lake terraces are relict shorelines. In case of the lake terraces of ancient ice-walled lakes, some proglacial lakes, and alluvium-dammed (slackwater) lakes, they often represent the relict bottom of these lakes.&lt;ref name="Shaw1915"&gt;Shaw. E.D., 1915, ''Newly discovered beds of extinct lakes in southern and western Illinois and adjacent states.'' Bulletin no. 20, Illinois State Geological Survey, Champaign, Illinois, p. 139-157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClaytonOthers2008"&gt;Clayton, L., J.W. Attig, N.R. Ham, M.D. Johnson, C.E. Jennings, and K.M. Syverson, 2008, ''Ice-walled-lake plains: Implications for the origin of hummocky glacial topography in middle North America.'' Geomorphology. v. 97, no. 1-2, p. 237–248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GrimleyOthers2009"&gt;Grimley, D.A., D. Larsen, S.W. Kaplan, C.H. Yansa, B.B. Curry, and E.A. Oches, 2009,  ''A multi-proxy palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic record within full glacial lacustrine deposits, western Tennessee, USA'' Journal of Quaternary Science. v. 24, no. 8, p. 960 - 981.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, glaciolacustrine [[kame]] terraces are either the relict deltas or bottoms of ancient ice marginal lakes.&lt;ref name="BitinasOthers2004"&gt;Bitinas, A. D. Karmaziene, and A. Jusiene, 2004, ''Glaciolacustrine kame terraces as an indicator of conditions of deglaciation in Lithuania during the Last Glaciation.'' Sedimentary Geology. v. 165, no. 3-4, p. 285–294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural terraces==

In geomorphology, a '''structural terrace''' is a terrace created by the differential erosion of flat-lying or nearly flat-lying layered strata. The terrace results from preferential stripping by erosion of a layer of softer strata from an underlying layer of harder strata. The preferential removal of softer material exposes the flat surface of the underlying harder layer creating the tread of a structural terrace. Structural terraces are commonly paired and not always associated with river valleys.&lt;ref name="HowardOther1968a"/&gt;

==Travertine terraces==

{{main|Travertine}}

A '''travertine terrace''' is formed when geothermally heated supersaturated alkaline waters emerge to the surface and form waterfalls of precipitated carbonates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6943">The [[Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation]] was the first [[circumnavigation|voyage around the world]] in human history. It was a Spanish expedition that sailed from [[Seville]] in 1519 under the command of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a Portuguese, in search of a maritime path from Spain to [[East Asia]] through the [[Americas]] and across the [[Pacific Ocean]], and concluded by Spanish navigator [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]] in 1522. Elcano and the 18 survivors of the expedition were the first men to circumnavigate the globe in a single expedition.&lt;ref name="cnn._CNN."&gt;{{Cite web| title = Fossett makes history| author = Coren, Michael| work = CNN| date = 2005-03-07| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/03/03/globalflyer.fossett/index.html?iref=newssearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hist_WasM"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Was Magellan the first person to circumnavigate the globe?| author = Evans Andrews| work = HISTORY.com| date = 2014-08-27| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/was-magellan-the-first-person-to-circumnavigate-the-globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Magellan Elcano Circumnavigation-en.svg|600px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;The Magellan–Elcano voyage. ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', one of the original five ships, circumnavigated the globe, finishing three years after setting out.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The  Spanish fleet, the ''[[Armada de Molucca]]'', that left Spain on 20 September 1519 consisted of five ships with 270 men: ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan, Captain General; ''[[San Antonio (spanish ship)|San Antonio]]'' under [[Juan de Cartagena]]; ''[[Concepcion (ship)|Concepcion]]'' under [[Gaspar de Quesada]]; ''[[Santiago (spanish ship)|Santiago]]'' under [[João Serrão]]; and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'' under [[Luiz Mendoza]]. 

After crossing the [[Atlantic]] and wintering in [[South America]]  the expedition navigated the [[Straits of Magellan]], then crossed the [[Pacific]] to the [[Philippines]].

Following Magellan's death in [[Mactan]] ([[Philippines]]) in 1521, [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] took command of the ship ''Victoria'', sailing back to Spain across the [[Indian Ocean]], round the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and north along the west coast of [[Africa]].
The circumnavigation was completed by Elcano and a crew of 18 men in ''Victoria'', returning to Spain three years after they left on 6 September 1522.

==Timeline==

===1519===
August 10:  Departure from [[Seville]]. 

September 20: Departure from [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]].

December 13: Entering the bay of [[Rio de Janeiro]].

December 31: Departure from Rio de Janeiro.

===1520===
January 10: Entering the [[Río de la Plata]].

February 27: Entering Bahia de los Patos.

March 31: Begin of the overwintering stay at [[Puerto San Julián]].

April 1 and 2: [[Mutiny]] on ''Victoria'', ''Concepcion'' and ''San Antonio''; death of Louis de Mendoza. Later execution of de Quesada, marooning of de Cartagena.   Alvaro de Mesquita becomes captain of ''San Antonio'', [[Duarte Barbosa]] of  ''Victoria''. 

End of April: ''Santiago'' is sent on a mission to find the passage. The ship is caught in a storm and wrecked. Survivors return to Puerto San Julián. Serrano ([[João Serrão]]) becomes captain of the ''Concepcion''.

July: Encounters with the “[[Patagonian giants]]” (likely the [[Tehuelche people]]).

August 24: Departure from Puerto San Julián.

October 21: Arriving at the [[Cape Virgenes|Cape of the Eleven Thousand Virgins]], entry to what would be known as [[Strait of Magellan]].

End of October: ''San Antonio'', charged to explore Magdalen Sound, fails to return to the fleet, instead sails back to Spain under [[Estêvão Gomes]] who imprisoned captain de Mesquita. The ship arrives in Spain on May 21, 1521.

November 28: The fleet leaves the strait and enters the Pacific Ocean.

===1521===
March 6: Arrival at [[Guam]] and encounters with the [[Chamorro people]].

March 16: Arrival of Magellan's expedition to one of the Philippine Islands. They headed to Suluan and dropped anchor for a few hours of respite.  [[Suluan]] is a small island in the province of [[Eastern Samar]]. They then next dropped anchor at [[Homonhon Island|Homonhon]], another small island in the province of Eastern Samar. They were detected by the boats of [[Rajah Humabon|Rajah Kolambu]] who was visiting [[Dimasaua|Mazaua]], who later guided them to Cebu, on April 7.

April 7: Arrival at the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]].

April 27: Death of Magellan in the [[Battle of Mactan]]. Serrano and Barbosa are voted co-commanders.

May 1:  At a local banquet Barbosa and 27 sailors (including Afonso de Góis, the new captain of ''Victoria'' after the election of Barbosa and Serrão) are murdered and Serrao captured, later killed. The three remaining ships escape.

May 2: There are not enough men to handle three ships, thus the worm-infested ''Concepcion'' is burned down. Two ships remain: ''Victoria'' and ''Trinidad''. Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa becomes captain of ''Victoria''. Joao  Lopez Carvalho is Captain General. The ships sail to [[Mindanao]] and [[Brunei]].

September 21: Carvalho is replaced by Martín Méndez as Captain General, Espinosa becomes captain of the ''Trinidad'' and [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] captain of ''Victoria''.

November 8: Arriving at [[Tidore]] in the [[Moluccas]].

December 21: ''Victoria'' under the command of Elcano leaves the Moluccas to return home, sailing west towards the Cape of Good Hope. ''Trinidad'' remains at Tidore for repairs.

===1522===
January 25:  ''Victoria'' reaches [[Timor]] and starts to cross the Indian Ocean.

April 6: ''Trinidad'' under the command of Espinosa leaves the Moluccas heading home sailing east. After five weeks, Espinosa decides to return to the [[Moluccas]] where he and his ship are captured by a Portuguese fleet under Antonio de Brito. However, the ship was wrecked during a storm.
 
May 22: ''Victoria'' passes the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and enters the Atlantic Ocean.

July 9: ''Victoria'' reaches [[Santiago, Cape Verde]].

September 6: ''Victoria'' returns to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] under the command of Elcano, two weeks shy of three years after setting sail.

September 8: ''Victoria'' arrives at Seville, technically completing the circumnavigation.

'''Tistarite''' is an exceedingly rare mineral with the formula Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, thus being the natural analogue of titanium(III) oxide.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, C., and Rossmann, G.R., 2009: Tistarite, Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a new refractory mineral from the Allende meteorite.

The '''Transpolar Sea Route (TSR)''' is a future [[Arctic shipping routes|Arctic shipping route]] running from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] across the center of the Arctic Ocean.&lt;ref name ="Østreng 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="AMSA 2009"/&gt;

The route is also sometimes called Trans-Arctic Route. In contrast to the [[Northeast Passage]] (including the [[Northern Sea Route]]) and the [[North-West Passage]] it largely avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states and lies in international high seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humpert|first=Malte|last2=Raspotnik|first2=Andreas|title=The Future of Shipping Along the Transpolar Sea Route|journal=The Arctic Yearbook|year=2012|volume=1|issue=1|pages=281–307|url=http://www.arcticyearbook.com/images/Articles_2012/Humpert_and_Raspotnik.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Østreng 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre et al. 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="AMSA 2009"/&gt;  The route is currently only navigable by heavy [[icebreaker]]s. However, due to the increasing [[Arctic sea ice decline|decline of Arctic sea ice extent]],&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre et al. 2014"/&gt; the route is slated to emerge as the predominant Arctic shipping route by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Geography of Transport Systems|url=http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch1en/conc1en/polarroutes.html|publisher=Hofstra University|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TSR is about {{convert|2100|nmi|km|disp=flip|abbr=out|-2}} long and offers significant distance savings between Europe and Asia. It is the shortest of the Arctic shipping routes. In contrast to the Northern Sea Route and the North-West Passage, which are both coastal routes, the TSR is a mid-ocean route and passes close to the North Pole.&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre et al. 2014"/&gt; Due to high seasonal variability of ice conditions throughout the entire Arctic basin, the TSR will not exist as one fixed shipping lane, but will follow a number of navigational routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Laurence C.|last2=Stephenson|first2=Scott R.|title=New Trans-Arctic shipping routes navigable by midcentury|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=26 March 2013|volume=110|issue=13|doi=10.1073/pnas.1214212110|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/13/E1191/1|accessdate=7 March 2014|pages=E1191–E1195|pmid=23487747|pmc=3612651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TSR passes outside the exclusive economic zones of Arctic coastal states making it of special geopolitical importance to countries looking towards the Arctic as a future trade route. While a number of legal disagreement and uncertainties revolve around both the North-West Passage and the Northern Sea Route, the TSR lies outside the territorial jurisdiction of any state.&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre et al. 2014"/&gt; The Chinese icebreaker [[MV Xue Long|''Snow Dragon'']] was one of the first major vessels to utilize the route during its 2012 journey through the Arctic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomasik|first=Magdalena|title=Successful journey of the ''Snow Dragon'' continues|url=http://arcticportal.org/news/21-shipping-news/833-successful-journey-of-the-snow-dragon-continuous|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=Arctic Portal|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Sea Gull''''' was a [[schooner]] in the service of the [[United States Navy]]. The ''Sea Gull'' was one of six ships that sailed in the [[US Exploring Expedition]] (known as the US Ex. Ex.) in 1838 to survey the coast of the then-unknown continent of [[Antarctica]] and the Pacific Islands. The specimens collected on the voyage would later form the backbone of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

==Acquisition==
Formerly the New York pilot boat ''New Jersey'', the ship was purchased by the Navy in July 1838 and renamed USS ''Sea Gull''. She was outfitted with a new mast and sails in three days' time, and under the command of Passed [[Midshipman]] James W. E. Reid, sailed for Hampton Roads to join the expedition as a tender.

==The US Exploring Expedition==
At [[Norfolk, Virginia]] the ''Sea Gull'' joined the other ships of the expedition: [[flagship]] {{USS|Vincennes|1826|2}}, {{USS|Peacock|1828|2}}, {{USS|Porpoise|1836|2}}, the schooner {{USS|Flying Fish|1838|2}}, and the supply ship {{USS|Relief|1836|2}}.

The ships left Norfolk on August 18, 1838, for the tip of South America, where they would await the slower ''Relief'' and then continue to [[Antarctica]] and the Pacific Islands. After surveying and collecting specimens, the remaining ships would sail to [[Hawaii]] and then the [[Columbia River]] to survey that area then return to the United States via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on June 9, 1842.

The ''Sea Gull'', commanded by [[Lieutenant]] Robert Johnson and in the company of the ''Porpoise'', headed south from Orange Bay on the tip of South America on February 25, 1839, to explore the area of the [[South Shetland Islands]]. Both ships encountered heavy seas which resulted in a broken gaff for the ''Sea Gull''; the crew was constantly drenched by huge waves. Soon they encountered snow squalls and penguins. Huge icebergs were sighted, some said to be as large as the U.S. Capitol building. On March 1, some islands of the South Shetlands were sighted. Attempts were made to land on the islands and gather specimens but the seas proved too rough to make a landing. On March 5, the wind increased to a whole gale and the commander of the expedition — Lt. [[Charles Wilkes]] — ordered the ships about and headed north. Wilkes ordered Johnson to proceed back to Orange Bay after stopping at [[Deception Island]] to attempt to retrieve a self-reading [[thermometer]] left there by an earlier British expedition. After removing ice from the ship's rigging, the crew of the ''Sea Gull'' headed for Deception. The crew didn't find the thermometer but did experience the volcanism of the island finding it frightening and unnerving to know they were standing on an active volcano. Eventually the ship made its way to Orange Bay.  After reaching Orange Bay the ''Sea Gull'' participated in a search for a missing crew in a survey launch, finding the launch eventually safe and sound with all aboard.

=== Loss of the ''Sea Gull''===
On April 17, 1839, Wilkes left Orange Bay in ''Vincennes'' with ''Porpoise'' for [[Valparaíso, Chile]] and ordered the schooners ''Flying Fish'' and ''Sea Gull'' to wait ten days for the supply ship ''Relief''. If the ''Relief'' didn't arrive they were to transport the scientists aboard to Valparaíso. On May 19, the ''Flying Fish'' arrived in Valparaíso and the ''Sea Gull'' was nowhere in sight. The ''Sea Gull'', under the command of passed midshipman James Reid, was last seen waiting out a gale in the lee of Staten Island off [[Cape Horn]]. After a month or so, the officers of the Ex. Ex. assumed the ''Sea Gull'' was lost and took up a collection for a monument to their memory. That monument stands in the Mount Auburn Cemetery in  Cambridge, Massachusetts. It lists the names of the officers who were lost on the ''Sea Gull'' and the names of two officers who were killed during the survey of the Pacific Islands. No mention was made of the other 24 sailors and marines who died during the expedition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5222">The '''Upper Guinean forests''' is a [[tropical seasonal forest]] region of [[West Africa]]. The Upper Guinean forests extend from [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]] in the west through [[Liberia]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Ghana]] to [[Togo]] in the east, and a few hundred kilometers inland from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. A few enclaves of [[montane forest]] lie further inland in the mountains of central Guinea and central Togo and [[Benin]].&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; 

In the drier interior, the Upper Guinean forests yield to the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]], a belt of dry forests and [[savanna]]s that lies between the coastal forests and the savannas and grasslands of the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] further north. The [[Dahomey Gap]], a region of Togo and Benin where the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic extends to the Atlantic coast, separates the Upper Guinean forests from the [[Lower Guinean forests]] to the east, which extend from eastern Benin through [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], and south along the coast of the [[Gulf of Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frans Bongers|author2=Marc P.

M.; Dinerstein, E. |year=1998 |work=Conservation Biology |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guinean moist forests are much affected by winds from the hot dry area to the north and the cool Atlantic currents. This gives the region a very seasonal climate with over {{convert|80|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} of rain falling in some areas in the wet season. Over 2000 species of vascular plant have been recorded in the ecoregion, and mammals found here include the [[chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes''), [[leopard]] (''Panthera pardus''), [[pygmy hippopotamus]] (''Hexaprotodon liberiensis''), [[Ogilby's duiker]] (''Cephalophus ogilbyi''), [[Nimba otter shrew]] (''Micropotamogale lamottei'') and the [[African golden cat]] (''Profelis aurata'').&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;  There are twenty-one endemic and near-endemic forest birds in the ecoregion of which three, Nimba Flycatcher ''Melaenornis annamarulae,'' Gola Malimbe ''Malimbus ballmanni'' and Spot-winged Greenbul   ''Phyllastrephus leucolepis'' are further restricted in distribution to the western forests only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allport|first=Gary|date=1991|title=The status and conservation of threatened birds in the Upper Guinea forest|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bird-conservation-international/article/status-and-conservation-of-threatened-birds-in-the-upper-guinea-forest/BC1B48786FA0A0C416716F77A968D753|journal=Bird Conservation International|volume=1|issue=1|pages=53–74|doi=10.1017/S095927090000054X|issn=1474-0001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) designated the Upper Guinean forests, which it calls the Guinean moist forests, as one of its [[Global 200]] critical regions for conservation.
&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/guinean_moist_forests.cfm |title=Guinean moist forests |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |accessdate=1 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103233723/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/guinean_moist_forests.cfm |archivedate=3 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WWF divides the Upper Guinean forests into three [[ecoregion]]s:
* The [[Western Guinean lowland forests]] extend from Guinea and Sierra Leone through Liberia and southeastern Côte d'Ivoire as far as the [[Sassandra River]].&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; 
* The [[Eastern Guinean forests]] extend east from the Sassandra River through Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana to western Togo, with a few isolated enclaves further inland in the highlands of central Togo and Benin.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;
* The [[Guinean montane forests]] are found at higher elevations in the [[Guinea Highlands]], which extend through central and southeastern Guinea, northern Sierra Leone, and eastern Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

'''Vernal pools''', also called '''vernal ponds''' or '''ephemeral pools''', are seasonal pools of water that provide habitat for distinctive plants and animals. They are considered to be a distinctive type of [[wetland]] usually devoid of fish, and thus allow the safe development of natal amphibian and insect species unable to withstand competition or predation by fish. Certain [[tropical]] fish lineages (such as [[killifish]]es) have however [[adaptation|adapted]] to this [[habitat]] specifically.

==Generation and annual development==
During most years, a vernal pool basin will experience [[inundation]] from local [[surface runoff]], followed by [[desiccation]] from [[evapotranspiration]]. These conditions are commonly associated with [[Mediterranean climate]]. Most pools are dry for at least part of the year, and fill with the winter rains or snow melt. Some pools may remain at least partially filled with water over the course of a year or more, but all vernal pools dry up periodically. A key time during vernal pool development between the flooding and evaporation phases is the flowering of native species, which attracts pollinators and seed distribution patterns.

Some authorities restrict the definition of vernal pools to exclude seasonal wetlands that have defined inlet and outlet channels. The justification is that such seasonal wetlands tend to be qualitatively different from isolated vernal pools; this is because they are fed by larger drainage basins so that firstly, inflow contributes higher concentrations of dissolved minerals. Secondly, flow patterns increase the periodic scouring and silting effect of flows through or simply into the wetland. Thirdly, longer distance inflow and outflow make for less strictly [[Endemism|endemic]] populations and plants. Low dissolved mineral concentrations of smaller vernal pool basins may be characterized as [[oligotrophic]], and poorly [[buffer solution|buffered]] with rapid [[pH]] shifts due to [[carbon dioxide]] uptake during [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems|last=Bauder|first=Ellen T.|last2=Belk|first2=Denton|last3=Ferrer|first3=Wayne T., Jr.|last4=|first4=|publisher=[[California Native Plant Society]]|year=1998|isbn=0-9434-6037-9|editor-last=Witham|editor-first=Carol W.|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vernal pools are so called because they are often, though not necessarily, at their maximum depth in the spring ("vernal" meaning of, relating to, or occurring in the spring). There are many local names for such pools, depending upon the part of the world in which they occur. Vernal pools may form in forests, but they are more typically associated with [[grassland]]s and rocky plains or basins. While many vernal pools are only a few meters in width, [[Dry lake|playas]] and prairie potholes are usually much larger, but still are otherwise similar in many respects, with high water in wet periods, followed by dry conditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=|isbn=0-5217-3967-5|edition=Second|location=|publication-date=September 13, 2010|pages=48–52, 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some exclude desert playas from the definition of vernal pools because their larger closed drainage basins in areas with high evaporation rates produce higher concentrations of dissolved minerals, with [[salinity]] and [[alkalinity]] favoring different species. Playas may be inundated less frequently than vernal pools, and inundation typically coincides with colder weather unfavorable for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems|last=Bauder|first=Ellen T.|last2=Belk|first2=Denton|last3=Ferrer|first3=Wayne T., Jr.|last4=|first4=|publisher=[[California Native Plant Society]]|year=1998|isbn=0-9434-6037-9|editor-last=Witham|editor-first=Carol W.|location=|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Despite being dry at times, vernal pools teem with life when filled. The most obvious inhabitants are various species of breeding frogs and toads. Some salamanders also utilize vernal pools for reproduction, but the adults may visit the pool only briefly. Other notable inhabitants are ''[[Daphnia]]'' and [[fairy shrimp]], the latter often used as an [[indicator species]] to decisively define a vernal pool. Other indicator species, at least in [[New England]], are the [[wood frog]], the [[Scaphiopus holbrookii|spadefoot toad]], and some species of [[mole salamander]]s. Certain plant species are also associated with vernal pools, although the particular species depend upon the ecological region. The flora of [[South Africa]]n vernal pools, for example, are different from those of Californian vernal pools, and they have characteristic [[Anostraca]], such as various [[Branchipodopsis]] species. In some northern areas, [[Notostracans|tadpole shrimp]] are more common.

== Habitat loss ==
Vernal pools harbor a distinct assemblage of flora and fauna that, in some cases, aren't found anywhere else on the planet. Despite this fact, about 90% of vernal pool ecosystems in California have been destroyed. Disturbingly, much of this destruction has occurred in recent years, with about 13% of remaining vernal pools being lost in the short interval from 1995-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Plants/Vernal-Pools|title=California's Vernal Pools|last=|first=|date=June 17, 2013|website=|publisher=[[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222230017/https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Plants/Vernal-Pools|archive-date=February 22, 2018|dead-url=No|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major threats to vernal pool habitats in the Central Valley are agriculture, urbanization, changes in hydrology, climate change, and improperly managed grazing by livestock.

=== Restoration ===
Vernal pools are prime habitats to be targeted for restoration work due to their value as hotpots of biodiversity as well as recent history of extensive destruction and degradation. However, there have been varying rates of success attributed to various restoration efforts. A number of hypotheses exists as to why:

Hypothesis 1: Constructed pools are too deep.

Hypothesis 2: Edges of constructed pools narrower than natural ones.

Hypothesis 3: Constructed pools have steeper slopes than natural ones.

Results: Research suggest that the last two details (Hypothesis 2 &amp; 3) are crucial in determining the habitat value of man-made vernal pools. In general, most constructed pools were too steep and did not have wide enough edges.

=== Mitigation  ===
There has been a fair amount of controversy surrounding the practice of mitigation, which is the destruction of protected or endangered species and habitats, such as vernal pools, on the condition that whatever entity (business, land manager, etc.) is destroying the habitat will undertake the construction of a replacement habitat to "mitigate" their impacts. This concept is difficult to apply to vernal pools, which represent a tremendous habitat value- but are difficult to successfully replicate using construction methods (as mentioned above). Thus, it has been very controversial to apply mitigation strategies to vernal pool systems due to the obvious risks inherent in trying to reconstruct this kind of habitat. Although, some agencies are now requiring two replacements for every vernal pool that is destroyed, in order to compensate for the low quality of man-made habitat.

==Soils==
Vernal pools can form anywhere that a depression fills with water. They can be found on bedrock of many kinds, or in grasslands that form over a variety of soil types containing silts and clays. They can develop hydric soils which are typical of flooded areas, including accumulations of organic matter, but this may not happen in drier areas. In some cases there is a hard pan layer which causes the retention of water in the pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461|title=Abiotic factor|last=Hogan|first=C. Michael|date=July 31, 2010|editor-last=Monosson|editor-first=Emily|website=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]]|publisher=[[National Council for Science and the Environment]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608071757/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461|archive-date=June 8, 2013|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardpan clay basin accumulates water due to the small particle size and therefore reduced porosity. This permits flooding and development of vernal pools.

==Flora==
[[Image:Vernal Pools 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Vernal pool flowers, with different species occurring in zones related to soil moisture and temperature gradients formed as the pool dries out. Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, Calif.]]
In vernal pools, flowering occurs simultaneously because of the seasonality of favorable conditions. Vernal pool ecosystems may include both [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species and [[endemism|endemic]] species adapted to unique environmental conditions. These include moisture gradients, salinity gradients, and reduced levels of competition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mircrotopographical gradients also contribute to species distribution in vernal pool communities, where plants that flower sooner in the season are more likely to be found at slightly higher elevations than later flowering species. Many vernal pool plants have buried seeds which accumulate in the soil. Different species are suited to different moisture levels, and as water evaporates from the edges of a pool, distinctive zonation of species can be seen.

Many upland [[perennial plant]]s are unable to withstand the duration of vernal pool inundation; while many wetland plants are unable to withstand desiccation. Wetland plants may also be nutrient limited within small drainage basins. When dissolved carbon dioxide is depleted by daytime photosynthesis, vernal pool species like Howell's quillwort (''[[Isoetes howellii]]'') and pygmyweed (''[[Crassula aquatica]]'') collect carbon dioxide nocturnally using [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]]. Vernal pool basin habitats favor annual plants with some uniquely adapted perennials which suffer extensive mortality resembling annual reproduction. Annuals comprise approximately 80 percent of vernal pool flora. Listed below are some genera of the approximately one hundred vascular plant species associated with California vernal pool habitats; although a typical pool will include only 15 to 25 species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems|last=Bauder|first=Ellen T.|last2=Belk|first2=Denton|last3=Ferrer|first3=Wayne T., Jr.|last4=|first4=|publisher=[[California Native Plant Society]]|year=1998|isbn=0-9434-6037-9|editor-last=Witham|editor-first=Carol W.|location=|pages=2–3, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upland plants commonly found at vernal pools in California include [[Yellow Pansy|yellow pansies]], several sweet-scented [[clover]]s, yellow and bright lavender [[Mimulus|monkeyflowers]], [[Common Star Lily|star lilies]], and [[yarrow]].

Vernal pools are often threatened by development in the same way that other [[wetlands]] are. As a result, most pools have been converted into residential zones, roads, and industrial parks. That is why most extant pools occur on protected or private land such as [[national park]]s, and [[ranch]]es.

A large number of [[rare species|rare]], [[endangered species]], and [[endemism|endemic]] species occur in vernal pool areas. For example, the [[San Diego mesa mint]], a highly endangered plant, is found exclusively in vernal pools in the [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] area. Another example is the [[wildflower]] ''[[Lasthenia conjugens]]'', which is found in limited parts of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. A third example is the herb ''[[Limnanthes vinculans]]'' endemic to [[Sonoma County, California]].

==Fauna==
[[File:NRCSCA01049 - California (715)(NRCS Photo Gallery).jpg|upright|thumb|Vernal pool in northern California]]
Many of the amphibians that breed only in vernal pools spend most of their lives in the uplands within hundreds of feet of the vernal pool. Eggs are laid in the vernal pool, then the juveniles leave the pool two or three months later, not to return until the following spring to breed. Therefore, the upland areas surrounding a vernal pool are critical for the survival of these species. In New York state, the endangered [[tiger salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma tigrinum]]'') is dependent on vernal pools to breed as described above. A few other obligate vernal pool species are the [[marbled salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma opacum]]''), [[Jefferson's salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma jeffersonianum]]''), the [[blue-spotted salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma laterale]]'') and the [[spotted salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma maculatum]]'').

Some other species, notably [[Anostraca]], fairy shrimp and their relatives, lay eggs capable of entering a state of [[cryptobiosis]]. They hatch when rains replenish the water of the pool, and no stage of the animals' life cycle leaves the pool, except when eggs are accidentally transported by animal [[phoresis (biology)|phoresis]], wind, or rarely, by flood. Such animal populations may be very old indeed, when the conditions for seasonal vernal waters are stable enough. As an extreme example, ''[[Branchipodopsis]] relictus'' on the main island of the [[Socotra archipelago]], which is exceedingly remote for what it is, a continental fragment of Gondwana, is believed to have been isolated since the [[Miocene]]. ''Branchipodopsis relictus'' is correspondingly isolated genetically as well as geographically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Damme|first1=Kay|last2=Dumont|first2=Henri J.|last3=Weekers|first3=Peter H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5962">[[Image:Zurich sunspot number since 1750.png|thumb|350px|Wolf number since 1750.]]

The '''Wolf number''' (also known as the '''International sunspot number''', '''relative sunspot number''', or '''Zürich number''') is a quantity that measures the number of [[sunspots]] and groups of sunspots present on the surface of the sun.

== History ==
The idea of computing sunspot numbers was originated by [[Rudolf Wolf]] in 1848&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sun - History|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whsun.html|date=2001-11-25|accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] and, thus, the procedure he initiated bears his name (or place). The combination of sunspots and their grouping is used because it compensates for variations in observing small sunspots.

This number has been collected and tabulated by researchers for over 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sidc.oma.be/ SIDC], RWC Belgium, World Data Center for the Sunspot Index, [[Observatoire Royal de Belgique|Royal Observatory of Belgium]], 'year(s)-of-data'.&lt;/ref&gt; They have found that sunspot activity is cyclical and reaches its maximum around every 9.5 to 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;Using data from [http://sidc.oma.be/index.php3 SIDC] for the last 300 years and running a fast [[Discrete Fourier transform|FFT]] function on the data gives an average maximum at 10.4883 years/cycle.&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle was first noted by [[Heinrich Schwabe]] in 1843.

Due to weather and researcher unavailability, "the" sunspot count is actually an average of observations by multiple people in multiple locations with different equipment, with a scaling factor ''k'' assigned to each observer to compensate for their differing ability to resolve small sunspots and their subjective division of groups of sunspots.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Revisiting the Sunspot Number|arxiv = 1407.3231|journal = Space Science Reviews|issn = 0038-6308|pages = 35–103|volume = 186|issue = 1-4|doi = 10.1007/s11214-014-0074-2|first = Frédéric|last = Clette|first2 = Leif|last2 = Svalgaard|first3 = José M.|last3 = Vaquero|first4 = Edward W.|last4 = Cliver|quote = On average, the observed sunspot number after 1945 is a factor 1.21 higher than the expected value, again showing the influence of the weighting of sunspots according to size, coinciding with the tenure of Waldmeier|bibcode = 2014SSRv..186...35C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative sunspot number &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is computed using the formula (collected as a daily index of sunspot activity):

: &lt;math&gt;R = k(10g + s) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the number of individual spots,
* &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the number of sunspot groups, and
* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a factor that varies with location and instrumentation (also known as the ''observatory factor'' or the ''personal reduction coefficient'' &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117707001974# personal reduction coefficient K]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revision ==
Since 1 July 2015 a revised and updated list of the sunspot numbers has been made available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stce.be/press/01/welcome.html Switching to the new Sunspot Number (1 July 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The biggest difference is an overall increase by a factor of 1.6 to the entire series.  Traditionally, a scaling of 0.6 was applied to all sunspot counts after 1893, to compensate for Alfred Wolfer's better equipment, after taking over from Wolf.  This scaling has been dropped from the revised series, making modern counts closer to their raw values.  Also, counts were reduced slightly after 1947 to compensate for bias introduced by a new counting method adopted that year, in which sunspots are weighted according to their size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, alternative (group) sunspot number series exist &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lockwood|first1=et al.|title=Centennial variations in sunspot number, open solar flux, and streamer belt width: 1.
