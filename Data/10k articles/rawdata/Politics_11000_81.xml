      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15414">The '''2011 Rutgers Tuition Protests''' were a series of primarily student-led public education reform initiatives at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. Faced with rising education costs, diminished state subsidies and the possibility of a non-existent [[tuition]] cap, campus groups (including the Rutgers Student Union, the Rutgers One Coalition and the [[Rutgers University student organizations#Rutgers University Student Assembly|Rutgers University Student Assembly]] (RUSA), supported by New Jersey United Students (NJUS), mobilized to keep the increase in annual student financial obligation to a minimum through marches, [[sit-in]]s, letters to administration officials and forums.

==State/federal legislation==

The [[Pell Grant]], a federal annuity of $5,500 available to low-income students, faced a relatively steep cut in 2011 as Republicans in the [[US House of Representatives]] pushed for further limits on [[discretionary spending]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Diduch, Mary. "US Congress Proposes Cuts to Pell Grant - The Daily Targum: News." The Daily Targum: Serving the Rutgers Community since 1869. Daily Targum, 17 Feb. 2011. Web. 05 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.dailytargum.com/news/us-congress-proposes-cuts-to-pell-grant/article_9c3b7a9d-ac45-5b54-951a-0c25a2ffe020.html {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130121072657/http://www.dailytargum.com/news/us-congress-proposes-cuts-to-pell-grant/article_9c3b7a9d-ac45-5b54-951a-0c25a2ffe020.html |date=2013-01-21 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly for economically disadvantaged students, the Pell Grant is an indispensable part of the federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] program.  In 2008, this program provided in excess of $31 million to over 10,000 Rutgers University students.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;"Office of Federal Relations: Financial Aid." Office of Federal Relations: Home. Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 15 Aug. 2011. Web. 05 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://federalrelations.rutgers.edu/fin_aid.shtml&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich Williams, an advocate of the New Jersey [[Public Interest Research Group]], stated that grants are the principal method in which the federal government can assist students in battling rising college tuition costs.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; He further explains that if changes are made to the current program, 1.5 million students are at risk of losing their funding, while the remaining 7.7 million students could see a 15 percent drop in the amount of attainable awards.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; During the 2010-2011 academic year, 68 percent of Rutgers students have reportedly borrowed through a federal loan program at some point in their collegiate career.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;"Common Data Set 2010-11: Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey: University-Wide."

Governor [[Chris Christie]]’s proposed budget showed a $25 million increase in tuition aid for college students.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Zhdankin, Dmitry. "NJ Split on Proposed State Budget - The Daily Targum: University." The Daily Targum: Serving the Rutgers Community since 1869. Daily Targum, 3 Mar. 2011.

==Tuition policy==
Typical in-state students pay $12,755 annually in tuition and mandatory fees, excluding [[room and board]], while out-of-state students pay $25,417 in tuition and fees.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;"Annual Tuition &amp; Fees." Rutgers | Rutgers Admissions. Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. Web. 05 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://admissions.rutgers.edu/costs/tuitionandfees.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  A breakdown of the tuition and fees (by [[semester]]) is as follows: tuition, campus fee, school fee, off-campus campus fee, [[dormitory]] charges, meal plan, computer fee, NJPIRG fee, [[The Daily Targum|Targum]] fee and course fee.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey 2011-2012 Tuition and Fees by Semester Undergraduate Schools - New Brunswick Campus." Rutgers.edu. Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 2011. Web. 5 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://studentabc.rutgers.edu/forms/tuition/FY11-12Tuition-NBUndergraduate.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105093926/http://www.studentabc.rutgers.edu/forms/tuition/FY11-12Tuition-NBUndergraduate.pdf |date=2012-01-05 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Rutgers University Board of Governors, tuition and fee rates are set in July.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Foderaro, Lisa W. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/nyregion/rutgers-students-occupy-building-in-protest.html "Students at Rutgers Occupy a Building."] NY Times, 27 Apr. 2011. Web. 5 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributing factors==
At a glance the cause of the Rutgers tuition protests appear to be simple; however, further scrutiny in the matter reveal local, state and federal involvement to play a more central role in these events.  Three years ago, Rutgers froze pay raises on staff and faculty.  The union decided in good faith to share the burden with the University and withheld raises for one year.  Since then, the University still has not paid raises, amounting to $40 million.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Talib, Tabish. "Students Share Tactics on Creating Change - The Daily Targum: News: Rutgers United Students against Sweatshops, Take Back the Economy, Voorhees Mall,." The Daily Targum: Serving the Rutgers Community since 1869. Daily Targum, 13 Oct. 2011. Web. 05 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.dailytargum.com/news/students-share-tactics-on-creating-change/article_f4aa87c0-f554-11e0-b17f-0019bb30f31a.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the [[American Association of University Professors]] recently funded an independent research on the University's budget, conducted by Howard Bunsis of [[Eastern Michigan University]].&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt; Test results showed that the faculty's salary raises were stagnant despite a $177 million surplus in the budget the previous year.&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt; The University has yet to confirm this study's analysis.&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt;

New federal and state [[health care]] laws are also affecting the rise in tuition costs.  Legislations requiring full-time college and university students to have [[health insurance]] will subsequently raise the cost of minimum coverage provided by the University.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Kypers, Neil P. "Health Care Laws up Cost of Tuition - The Daily Targum: News." The Daily Targum: Serving the Rutgers Community since 1869. Daily Targum, 30 Mar. 2011. Web. 05 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.dailytargum.com/news/health-care-laws-up-cost-of-tuition/article_cdc04633-03bc-578c-afc1-3f9969aefd33.html {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130120052351/http://www.dailytargum.com/news/health-care-laws-up-cost-of-tuition/article_cdc04633-03bc-578c-afc1-3f9969aefd33.html |date=2013-01-20 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  James Breeding, director of [[Risk Management]] and Insurance at Rutgers, stated, “Effective this coming year, we are going to have a hard waiver program that has a minimum limit of $100,000,” he continues, “an increase of between $600 and $800 from the mandatory coverage provided currently with a limit of $5,000 at about $170 per student, which anyone without insurance must pay.”&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt;  Students without health insurance are compelled to buy into this particular program, but at competitive costs.  Those with insurance can opt out of the hard waiver program, a change from the former policy regarding a mandatory fee on students’ bills.&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt;

Recent outbreaks at Rutgersfest have also worried students about tuition costs.  Rutgersfest is an annual [[block party]] and concert hosting tens of thousands of people to celebrate the end of the school year.  The event typically garners major artists to perform and provides a plethora of games for students to play.  Students pay almost $1,200 in campus and student fees each year, of which a portion of the fees go to Rutgersfest.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Marcus, Aaron. "Rutgersfest Further Damages U. - The Daily Targum: Columnists." The Daily Targum: Serving the Rutgers Community since 1869. Daily Targum, 18 Apr. 2011.

"Rutgers to Permanently Cancel Annual Rutgersfest Concert | NJ.com." New Jersey Local News, Breaking News, Sports &amp; Weather - NJ.com. Nj.com, 19 Apr. 2011. Web. 05 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/rutgers_to_cancel_annual_rutge.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, four confirmed shootings at the event proves Rutgersfest too dangerous and will permanently close, says University President [[Richard L. McCormick]].&lt;ref name="eleven"/&gt; Based on these events, one student urged a limitation on student-run programming, suggesting that their student fees are being wasted.&lt;ref name="ten"/&gt;

==Protests==
On April 13, 2011, hundreds of Rutgers students and demonstrators marched from [[Voorhees Mall]] to [[Old Queens]] on the New Brunswick campus protesting tuition hikes and diminishing financial aid to higher education.&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;Millicker, Anastasia, and Kristine R. Enerio. "Walk into Action' Draws in Hundreds - The Daily Targum: News." The Daily Targum: Serving the Rutgers Community since 1869. Daily Targum, 13 Apr. 2011.

"Rutgers Students March in New Brunswick to Protest Tuition Hikes, N.J. Funding Cuts | NJ.com." New Jersey Local News, Breaking News, Sports &amp; Weather - NJ.com. Nj.com, 13 Apr. 2011. Web. 05 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/rutgers_students_march_in_new.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Jersey United Students’ (NJUS) “Walk in Action” protest brought tuition increases to the forefront of University issues.&lt;ref name="eighteen"/&gt;

Since the [[protest march]], a group of students representing a variety of campus organizations has scheduled regular meetings with President McCormick. In 2010, “a cap limited the increase in tuition to 4 percent, but this year, public colleges are likely to have the ability to set their own rates, meaning the rise could be higher…President McCormick predicted the tuition increases would be less than 10 percent.”&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;"Rutgers Students Stage Protest Against Increased Tuition Costs | Top Colleges Blog."

On Wednesday April 27, approximately 20 students &lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Staff, Star-Ledger. "Rutgers University Students Protest Tuition Hikes with Sit-in inside Administrative Building | NJ.com." New Jersey Local News, Breaking News, Sports &amp; Weather - NJ.com. Nj.com, 27 Apr. 2011. Web. 05 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/rutgers_university_students_pr.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; occupied a third- floor landing of Old Queens, the administrative building and office of President McCormick, with a list of demands to the university President.&lt;ref name="fifteen"/&gt; The students claimed that President McCormick had yet to meet their demands by their [[Time limit|deadline]] two days ago.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Their demands included requesting McCormick to support a tuition freeze, place three students on the Rutgers Board of Governors as voting members and provide students with 10 free [[College transcript|transcripts]].&lt;ref name="thirteen"/&gt; They also demanded an increase in wages for Rutgers workers whose salaries were currently frozen.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;

Of the students who were involved with the sit-in, 11 had announced they would be spending the night in the building.&lt;ref name="thirteen"/&gt; They were willing to “stay until their demands have been met and prepared to be arrested.”&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;  One reporter noted that during the sit-in, “students used [[Skype]] and other internet sites to view the classes they were missing and receive notes from their classmates.  Other students also brought the protesters pizza, [[Juicebox (container)|juice boxes]], ice cream, strawberries and other food.”&lt;ref name="thirteen"/&gt;

Students were notified by the university officials that they were “trespassing”&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; but stood no risk of arrest at the time of the announcement.

Other students around campus gathered in front of Old Queens in support of the protestors.  Roughly 30 students showed up that evening and pitched a tent with a sign that read, “Education is a right.”&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Some students marched around the area to the beat of [[bongo drum]]s, chanting, “The administration ain’t so tough, unless they put us all in cuffs.”&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;

The sit-in lasted until Thursday evening, of which only 9 students remained.&lt;ref name="seventeen"&gt;Star-Ledger, Tom Wright-Piersanti/The.

The '''2011 [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]]''' (COP17) was held in [[Durban]], South Africa, from 28 November to 11 December 2011 to establish a new treaty to limit carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/unfccc_calendar/items/2655.php|title=Calendar|work=UN Framework Convention on Climate Change|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A treaty was not established, but the conference agreed to establish a [[legally binding]] deal comprising all countries by 2015, which was to take effect in 2020.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 Dec 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/11/global-climate-change-treaty-durban

The fund is to distribute US$100&amp;nbsp;billion per year to help poor countries adapt to climate impacts.&lt;ref name=bbc111211/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:COP17 December 6.jpg|thumb|From left to right: UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]], President of South Africa [[Jacob Zuma]], President of the Conference [[Maite Nkoana-Mashabane]] and UNFCC Deputy Executive Secretary Richard Kinley]]
The conference was officially referred to as the 17th session of the Conference of the Parties {{nowrap|(COP 17)}} to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the 7th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties {{nowrap|(CMP 7)}} to the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. In addition, the two permanent subsidiary bodies of the UNFCCC – the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) – were likely to hold their 35th sessions. The [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] extended the mandates of the two temporary subsidiary bodies – the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) and the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) – so they were expected to meet as well.

A primary focus of the conference was to secure a global climate agreement as the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period (2008–2012) was about to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/14/cancun-climate-change-compromise-carrington|title=Cancún deal leaves hard climate tasks to Durban summit in 2011|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=14 December 2010|work=[[The Guardian Weekly]]|location=London|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also expected to focus on "finalising at least some of the Cancun Agreements", reached at the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2010 Conference]], such as "co-operation on [[clean technology]]", as well as "forest protection, adaptation to climate impacts, and finance – the promised transfer of funds from rich countries to poor in order to help them protect forests, [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt to climate]] impacts, and [[green economy|"green" their economies]]".&lt;ref name="BBC Black"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15518421|title=Durban: A summit of small steps?|publisher=BBC News |date=31 October 2011|first=Richard|last=Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month before the Conference began, the [[BBC]] highlighted two contentious proposals which had been submitted – one by [[Russia]], the other by [[Papua New Guinea]], both aiming to amend the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. Russia's proposal&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/05.pdf "Proposal from the Russian Federation to amend article 4, paragraph 2 (f), of the Convention"]&lt;/ref&gt; would bring about a "periodic review" whereby countries currently categorised as "poor" could be recategorised as "rich", and thus obliged to shoulder greater obligations in the combat against climate change. BBC Environment correspondent Richard Black commented that the proposal would be "provocative and explosive, if Russia pushes it", because potentially affected countries, such as [[Economy of China|China]] and [[Economy of Brazil|Brazil]], would "push back very strongly". Papua New Guinea's proposal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/04.pdf "Proposal from Papua New Guinea and Mexico to amend Articles 7 and 18 of the Convention"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626042827/http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/04.pdf |date=26 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted by Ambassador [[Kevin Conrad]] with the support of [[Mexico]], would introduce a "last resort" mechanism to break any deadlocks in climate change negotiations through a three-quarters majority vote, thus clarifying the decision-making process under the Convention. Describing the proposal as "intriguing", Black noted that although it would theoretically enable [[developing countries]] to use their numerical superiority to adopt any kind of world-wide binding obligation, in practical terms they would still need the approval of rich countries to secure funding.&lt;ref name="BBC Black" /&gt;

== Statements==

===China===
[[Xie Zhenhua (politician)|Xie Zhenhua]], head of the Chinese delegation, stated that China was willing to make binding commitments to limited greenhouse gases in 2020 if they appropriately took into account historical contributions of greenhouse gases by developed countries such as the United States and European states and sustainable economic needs of [[Developing country|developing countries]] such as China and India.&lt;ref name=Xinhua&gt;{{cite news|title=China open to talks on binding emission cut|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-12/05/content_14213729.htm|accessdate=8 December 2011|newspaper=[[China Daily]] |agency=Xinhua|date=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xie said that he was concerned about the reluctance of developed nations to [[climate change mitigation|reduce]] their own greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="ho zhenhua china comments"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He called on developed countries to provide financial and technical aid to help developing nations fight against and cope with the [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]].&lt;ref name="ho zhenhua china comments"/&gt;

===India===
[[India]]'s representative at the conference, [[Jayanthi Natarajan]] stated that India "will not be intimidated. There is an attempt to shift the blame to developing countries. We do not accept that. Please do not hold us hostage. And please do not take our agreement to be weakness."&lt;ref name="Gerhardt"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gerhardt|first=Tina|date=11 December 2011|url=http://www.progressive.org/climate_change.html|title=Get it Done! Youth to UN on Climate Treaty|work=[[The Progressive]]|location=Madison}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natarajan responded to European Union Climate Commissioner [[Connie Hedegaard]], saying that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Africa/India-gets-its-way-as-climate-summit-in-Durban-closes/Article1-780872.aspx|title=India gets its way as climate summit in Durban closes|date=11 December 2011|work=[[Hindustan Times]] |location=New Delhi|accessdate=13 December 2011|agency=Indo-Asian News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We have shown more flexibility than virtually any other country. But equity is the centrepiece, it cannot be shifted. This is not about India. Does fighting climate change mean we have to give up on equity? We have agreed to protocol and legal instrument. What's the problem in having one more option? India will never be intimidated by any threat or any kind of pressure. What's this legal instrument? How do I give a blank cheque? We're talking of livelihoods and sustainability here. I'm not accusing anybody, but there are efforts to shift the (climate) problem to countries that have not contributed to it. If that is done, we're willing to reopen the entire Durban Package. We did not issue a threat. But are we being made into a scapegoat? Please don't hold us hostage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===CGIAR===
Bruce Campbell, Director of the [[CGIAR]] research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), said it was astonishing that agriculture, one of the worst emitters of greenhouse gases, remained excluded from global agreements on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Dardagan, Colleen. "[http://www.iol.co.za/mercury/leaders-need-to-focus-on-agriculture-1.1192908 Leaders need to focus on agriculture]." ''The Mercury.'' The Mercury Independent Online, 6 Dec. 2011. Web. 24 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; “Leading agricultural groups, from farmers and researchers to policymakers and development organisations, have all come together to call on COP17 negotiators to address the need for a Work Programme on agriculture,” Campbell said.&lt;ref name="Negotiations"&gt;"[http://chimalaya.org/2011/12/06/negotiations-must-deliver-a-work-programme-on-agriculture/ Negotiations must deliver a work programme on agriculture]." ''chimalaya.org.'' Climate Himalaya, 6 Dec. 2011. Web. 24 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; “Now, it is up to negotiators to heed our joint call-to-action and allow agriculture to play its part in building resilience amongst vulnerable populations, helping farmers adapt to more unpredictable and extreme weather conditions and mitigating future climate change.”&lt;ref name="Negotiations"/&gt;

===Friends of the Earth===
Nnimmo Bassey, Chair of Friends of the Earth International, said "delaying real action until 2020 is a crime of global proportions ... An increase in global temperatures of 4 degrees Celsius, permitted under this plan, is a death sentence for Africa, Small Island States, and the poor and vulnerable worldwide. This summit has amplified climate apartheid, whereby the richest 1% of the world have decided that it is acceptable to sacrifice the 99%."&lt;ref name="Gerhardt"/&gt;

===Greenpeace===
[[Greenpeace]] issued a statement calling on conference participants to ensure a peak in global emissions by 2015, continue the Kyoto Protocol and provide a mandate for a comprehensive legally binding instrument, deliver climate finance and set up a framework for protecting forests in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/Polluticians-occupy-the-climate-/|title=Polluticians occupy the climate|publisher=[[Greenpeace]]|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth Delegation===
Anjali Appadurai, a college student at [[College of the Atlantic]] in [[Maine]] and a member of the Youth Delegation, delivered a succinct speech that summed up the science regarding global warming and the failure of the UNFCCC negotiations to rein in climate change, demanding the UN "Get it done!"&lt;ref name="Gerhardt"/&gt;

==Durban Platform==
After two weeks of negotiations a deal was reached only on the last day, Sunday 11 December, after a 60-hour marathon negotiation session. Negotiators agreed to be part of a legally binding treaty to address global warming. The terms of the future treaty are to be defined by 2015 and become effective in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6645.php UNFCCC:Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP), accessed online 2/8/2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement, referred to as the "Durban Platform for Enhanced Action", was notable in that for the first time it included developing countries such as China and India, as well as the US which had refused to ratify the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 Dec 2011"/&gt;

The agreement entailed the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol in the interim, although only some countries including members of the EU were indicated as likely to commit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/11/durban-conference-climate-change?intcmp=239|first=Michael|last=Jacobs|title=Hope at last at the Durban conference on climate change|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 December 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of the Durban Platform were ultimately met following the successful negotiation of the [[Paris Agreement]] at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

;Green fund
The conference led to agreement on a management framework for a future [[Green Climate Fund]]. The fund is to distribute US$100bn per year to help poor countries adapt to climate impacts.&lt;ref name=bbc111211/&gt;

==Responses==
After the conference concluded, Michael Jacobs of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] in London, said: "The agreement here has not in itself taken us off the 4 °C path we are on... But by forcing countries for the first time to admit that their current policies are inadequate and must be strengthened by 2015, it has snatched 2 °C from the jaws of impossibility. At the same time it has re-established the principle that climate change should be tackled through international law, not national, voluntarism."&lt;ref name=bbc111211/&gt;

[[Christiana Figueres]], executive secretary of the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] said: "I salute the countries who made this agreement. They have all laid aside some cherished objectives of their own to meet a common purpose, a long-term solution to climate change."&lt;ref name=bbc111211reaction&gt;{{cite news |title=Reaction to UN climate deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16129762 |publisher=BBC News|date=11 December 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kumi Naidoo]] of [[Greenpeace International]] said: "Right now the global climate regime amounts to nothing more than a voluntary deal that's put off for a decade. This could take us over the 2 °C threshold where we pass from danger to potential catastrophe."&lt;ref name=bbc111211reaction/&gt;

U.S. Senator [[Jim Inhofe]], who opposes government energy regulations such as cap-and-trade and has called man-made climate change a hoax,&lt;ref&gt;''The Hill'': [http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/194815-inhofe-global-warming-as-polar-vortex-factor-laughable Inhofe: 'Laughable' to call global warming a polar vortex factor].  January 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; cheered what he called the setting aside of "any remote possibility of a UN global warming treaty" and described the conference outcome as "the complete collapse of the global warming movement and the failure of the Kyoto process". Inhofe said that the message from Washington, including from President Obama and the Democratic leadership of the U.S. Senate, to the delegates of the conference was that they are being ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=18d950be-802a-23ad-463c-00218cbecc56|title=Inhofe on Durban UN Climate Conference: Kyoto Process Is Dead|publisher=[[U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]]|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German media criticised the outcome as "almost useless", saying the pledges are vague and the timeline is slow, the main merit being that the talks have been kept alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Crossland|first=David|date=12 December 2011|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,803158,00.html|title=The Durban Climate Agreement 'Is Almost Useless{{'-}}|work=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6470">The '''AMD Platform Security Processor''' ('''PSP'''), officially known as '''AMD Secure Technology''', is a [[trusted execution environment]] subsystem incorporated since about 2013 into [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] microprocessors.&lt;ref name="Williams_2017"/&gt; According to an AMD developer's guide, the subsystem is "responsible for creating, monitoring and maintaining the security environment" and "its functions include managing the boot process, initializing various security related mechanisms, and monitoring the system for any suspicious activity or events and implementing an appropriate response."&lt;ref name="AMD_2016"/&gt; Critics worry it can be used as a backdoor and is a security concern.&lt;ref name="Martin_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Claburn_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larabel_2017"/&gt; AMD has denied requests to open source the code that runs on the PSP.&lt;ref name="Williams_2017"/&gt;

The PSP is similar to the [[Intel Management Engine]] for Intel processors.&lt;ref name="Williams_2017"/&gt;

==Details==
The PSP itself is an [[ARM core]] inserted on the main CPU die.&lt;ref name="Libreboot"/&gt;

==Security history==
In September 2017, Google security researcher Cfir Cohen reported a vulnerability to AMD of a PSP subsystem that could allow an attacker access to passwords, certificates, and other sensitive information; a patch was rumored to become available to vendors in December 2017.&lt;ref name="Millman_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cimpanu_2018"/&gt;

In March 2018, a handful of alleged serious flaws were announced in AMD's [[Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen]] architecture CPUs ([[EPYC]], [[Ryzen]], Ryzen Pro, and Ryzen Mobile) by an Israeli [[IT security]] company related to the PSP that could allow malware to run and gain access to sensitive information.&lt;ref name="Goodin_2018"/&gt; AMD has announced firmware updates to handle these flaws.&lt;ref name="Bright_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Papermaster_2018"/&gt; While there were claims that the flaws were published for the purpose of [[Market manipulation|stock manipulation]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamersnexus.net/industry/3260-assassination-attempt-on-amd-by-viceroy-research-cts-labs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157242-amd-cts-labs-story-failed-stock-manipulation?page=2&lt;/ref&gt; their validity from a technical standpoint was upheld by independent security experts who reviewed the disclosures.&lt;ref name="trailofbits"/&gt;

'''Aircraft warning paint''' is a system of red/orange and white paint scheme that allows for aircraft to avoid colliding with tall objects like [[radio masts]] and other tall objects (during daylight hours) that may pose a collision threat to aircraft.&lt;ref name="FAA, Obstruction Marking" &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and use==
Aircraft warning paint serves the purpose of identifying tall structures in daylight conditions, they are often utilized in urban areas where lighting is drowned out or communities where the classic [[aircraft warning lights|white strobe lights]] that normally are used during the day are considered a nuisance.

==Markings==
Most structures that have warning paint are painted aviation red/orange and white stripes.

==Patterns==
Multiple patterns can be used for aircraft warning paint, including stripes, checkerboards, spheres, and teardrops.&lt;ref name="FAA, Obstruction Marking" /&gt;

==Alternatives==
Alternatives include [[aircraft warning lights]] and flag markers.

The '''American Peace Award''' is awarded to American citizens working to further the cause of world peace.

== The 1924 American Peace Award ==
The American Peace Award was created in 1923 by [[Edward W. Bok]], who believed that the [[United States Government]] was not taking initiative to promote peace in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nnp.org/nni/Publications/Dutch-American/bok.html&lt;/ref&gt; $100,000 was to be awarded to the person submitting “the best practicable plan by which the United States may co-operate with other nations for the achievement and preservation of world peace.” &lt;ref&gt;“Bok Offers $100,000 for Best Peace Plan: Seeks Workable Method for International Cooperation Against War” &lt;u&gt; Washington Post &lt;/u&gt; July 2, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; The first half of the prize was awarded upon the selection of the plan by a jury, and the remainder upon acceptance by the United States Senate &lt;ref&gt;http://www.boktowergardens.org/about/edward-bok&lt;/ref&gt; or showing “sufficient popular support”.&lt;ref&gt;“POLITICAL NOTES: 1002nd Night” &lt;u&gt; Time Magazine &lt;/u&gt; February 11, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; The 1924 American Peace Award received plans from thousands of applicants,&lt;ref&gt;DeBenedetti, Charles. “The $100,000 American Peace Award of 1924.” &lt;u&gt; The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography&lt;/u&gt; Vol. 98, No. 2 (Apr., 1974), pp. 224-249&lt;/ref&gt; and caught the interest of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;“Bok Peace Plan Given a Subzero Senate Welcome.” &lt;u&gt; Chicago Daily Tribune &lt;/u&gt; Jan. 8, 1924&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Senators Summon Bok on Peace Plan.” &lt;u&gt; New York Times &lt;/u&gt; Jan 18, 1924&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Bok’s Winning Plan League Propaganda, Senate Chiefs Aver.” &lt;u&gt; Washington Post &lt;/u&gt; Jan. 4, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was awarded in February 1924 &lt;ref&gt;“To Give Bok Prize Tonight.” &lt;u&gt; New York Times &lt;/u&gt; Feb. 4, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; to Dr. [[Charles Herbert Levermore]], who was secretary of the [[World Court League]], the [[League of Nations Union]], and the [[New York Peace Society]], and former president of [[Adelphi College]].&lt;ref&gt;“POLITICAL NOTES: 1002nd Night” &lt;u&gt; Time Magazine &lt;/u&gt; February 11, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; Levermore’s plan suggested the United States adhere to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] and should extend its cooperation with the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;“Charles Herber Levermore.” &lt;u&gt; Dictionary of American Biography Base Set &lt;/u&gt; (American Council of Learned Societies, 1928-1936)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contemporary American Peace Award ==
The American Peace Award was established in 2008 as a prize awarded to an American citizen or citizens working to further the cause of world Peace, in the spirit of Edward W. Bok’s original award. The American Peace Award is awarded by an advisory committee of artists, who present each recipient with an original work of art to honor their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanpeaceaward.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104183250/http://americanpeaceaward.org/ |archive-date=2014-01-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anataban Campaign''' ({{lang-ar|انا تعبان}}, ''Ana Taban'', meaning "I am tired") is an [[artist collective]] based in [[Juba]], [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name=Leach2016&gt;{{cite news |last= Leach|first= Anna  |date= September 21, 2016 |title= Tired of war: South Sudan street artists calling for peace - in pictures |url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/sep/21/tired-war-south-sudan-street-artists-calling-peace |work= The Guardian|location= South Sudan|access-date= June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group uses street theater, graffiti, murals, sculpture and poetry to foster public discussion about the issues of social injustice and government accountability, and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Dahir|first= Abdi Latif |date= September 21, 2016|title= "I am tired": Young South Sudanese are using art to protest the endless cycle of violence and death |url= https://qz.com/786411/south-sudans-ana-taban-campaign-calls-for-change-as-the-country-is-marred-in-civil-war/ |work= Quartz Africa |location= South Sudan |access-date= June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news &lt;!-- staff author--&gt; |date= October 25, 2016 |title= South Sudan artists paint for peace in Juba|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37754047 |work= BBC |location= South Sudan |access-date= June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anataban members see solidarity, courage, integrity, inclusion, non-violence and political neutrality as the important values guiding their work.

==Background==
The [[South Sudanese Civil War]] began in 2013. The people live in fear because there is a high level of armed violence and sexual violence, mostly against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-southsudan-violence-women-idUKKCN0S11XR20151007|title=Scale of South Sudan sexual violence is unprecedented - Red Cross|last=Esslemont|first=Tom|newspaper=Reuters UK|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict has affected food production leading to hunger and poverty.

==History==
[[File:I Hate War.jpg|thumb|Anataban street art in Juba, South Sudan]]
In September 2016, Anataban was founded in [[Juba]] by a group of [[Demographics of South Sudan|South Sudanese]] visual artists, musicians, actors, poets, and fashion designers. The group was created in response to the [[South Sudanese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news &lt;!--staff writer--&gt; |date= October 20, 2016 |title= Interview with #Ana Taban Art Movement |url= http://www.africanpoliticsandpolicy.com/?p=4182 |work= African Politics and Policy |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign emerged from a collaborative workshop held in [[Naivasha]], [[Kenya]], with Pawa 254, a [[Nairobi| Nairobi-based]] hub for activists, journalists, and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bul |first= Jacob|date= October 28, 2016 |title= 'Tired' of war, young South Sudanese artists form 'Ana Taban' movement |url= http://observers.france24.com/en/20161028-south-sudan-art-ana-taban-youth-music-peace-war |work= The Observers - Copyright France 24 |location= South Sudan|access-date= June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Juba Arabic]], ''Ana Taban'', means "I am tired".&lt;ref name=Leach2016 /&gt;

In ''[[The Guardian]]'', the Anataban collective said, "We are tired of war and all the suffering that comes with it. We are tired of just sitting by and seeing our country burn. We are tired of having a country with vast natural resources and yet a crashing economy. We are tired of the fact that we have a beautiful cultural diversity that is destroyed by tribal animosity. We are tired of having a starving population yet we have a fertile land. We are tired of being used to kill ourselves for the benefit of a few".&lt;ref name=Leach2016 /&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the [[International Day of Peace]] Anataban distributed 1000 white handkerchiefs with the message "we are sorry for what we have done to each other" written on them. They spoke with people in the streets, apologizing for what they have had to endure in this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Anataban South Sudan|title=#Anataban #PeaceDay Activities September 21st 2016: Juba, South Sudan|date=2016-09-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Hu5QQs_Og&amp;t=18s|accessdate=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Anataban launched the campaign "#BloodShedFree2017"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://unmiss.unmissions.org/youth-demand-bloodshed-free-2017|title=Youth demand bloodshed free 2017|date=10 February 2017|agency=UNIMISS|last1=Oked|first1=Patricia|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks a genuine and permanent ceasefire in South Sudan; security for all citizens; an end to ethnic targeting and violence; protection of the right to free speech; and a return to justice and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5a88osF2U&amp;t=9s|title=#SouthSudan #BloodShedFree2017 #Anataban Campaign|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
[[File:Anataban Street Show.jpg|thumb|Anataban members perform street theatre in Juba, South Sudan]]
Anataban's aim is to create a platform for the ordinary South Sudanese citizen to speak out and have their voice heard. Anataban aims to create awareness of the common struggles of the South Sudanese people, especially the insecurity of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/un-says-fighting-in-2-south-sudan-hotspots-is-devastating/2017/02/14/298b5ca0-f273-11e6-9fb1-2d8f3fc9c0ed_story.html|title=UN says fighting in 2 South Sudan hotspots is 'devastating'|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of Anataban's work is to use [[artivism]] to engage and mobilize people through community dialogues on the issues affecting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=S.Sudan: Artists, Musicians and Actors protest the endless cycle of violence|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlb3olENYFI|accessdate=19 February 2017|agency=CGTN Africa|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Justin|title=South Sudan artists protest civil war with peace campaign|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/95e3e781b961471a883c0d40421274df/south-sudan-artists-protest-civil-war-i-am-tired|accessdate=19 February 2017|agency=AP|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some show positive messages that encourage people to make a difference. This is the first time such street art has been done in Juba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Sudan artists paint for peace in Juba|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37754047|accessdate=19 February 2017|agency=BBC Africa|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armistice of Cherasco''' was an armistice signed at [[Cherasco]], [[Piedmont]], on 28 April 1796 between [[Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia]] and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. It withdrew Sardinia from the [[War of the First Coalition]] (leaving only Britain and Austria in the Coalition) and handed over [[Alessandria]], [[Cuneo|Coni]] and [[Tortone]] to Republican France. Sardinia also handed over supplies and munitions to France and allowed its troops free passage through [[Piedmont]]. It was followed by a full  [[Treaty of Paris (1796)|peace treaty]] signed in Paris the following 15 May, in which Sardinia handed over the county of [[Nice]], the [[duchy of Savoy]], Tende and Beuil to France, as well as guaranteeing free passage through its remaining territory for French troops.

'''Censorship''' is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive,  or "inconvenient" as determined by a government&lt;ref name=OED_censorship&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; or private institution,&lt;ref name=ACLU&gt;https://www.aclu.org/other/what-censorship "What Is Censorship", ACLU&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[corporate censorship]].

Governments&lt;ref name=OED_censorship/&gt; and private organizations may engage in censorship. Other groups or institutions may propose and petition for censorship.&lt;ref name=ACLU/&gt; When an individual such as an author or other creator engages in censorship of their own works or speech, it is referred to as ''[[self-censorship]]''.   It occurs in a variety of different media, including speech, books, music, films, and other arts, the press, radio, television, and the Internet for a variety of claimed reasons including [[national security]], to control [[obscenity]], [[child pornography]], and [[hate speech]], to protect children or other vulnerable groups, to promote or restrict political or religious views, and to prevent [[Defamation|slander]] and [[Defamation|libel]].

Direct censorship may or may not be legal, depending on the type, location, and content. Many countries provide strong protections against censorship by law, but none of these protections are absolute and frequently a claim of necessity to balance conflicting rights is made, in order to determine what could and could not be censored. There are no laws against self-censorship.

==History==
[[File:Victims of Communism Memorial DBKing A.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Chinese troops destroyed the statue ''[[Goddess of Democracy]]'' in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square in 1989]], and continue to censor information about those events.&lt;ref name="Reuters Tmen Sq"&gt;{{cite news|title=China blocks Tiananmen talk on crackdown anniversary|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/04/us-china-tiananmen-idUSBRE85305320120604|accessdate=2013-05-08|newspaper=Reuters|date=June 4, 2012|author=Sui-Lee Wee|author2=Ben Blanchard}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statue, now known as the ''[[Victims of Communism Memorial]]'' was recreated by [[Thomas Marsh (sculptor)|Thomas Marsh]] in [[Washington, DC]].]]
In 399 BC, Greek philosopher, [[Socrates]], defied attempts by the Greek state to censor his philosophical teachings and was sentenced to death by drinking a poison, [[Conium|hemlock]]. Socrates' student, [[Plato]], is said to have advocated censorship in his essay on ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', which opposed the existence of democracy. In contrast to Plato, Greek playwright Euripides (480–406&amp;nbsp;BC) defended the true liberty of freeborn men, including the right to speak freely. In 1766, [[Censorship in Sweden|Sweden became the first country to abolish censorship by law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beaconforfreedom.org/liste.html?tid=415&amp;art_id=475 "The Long History of Censorship"], Mette Newth, Beacon for Freedom of Expression (Norway), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The rationale for censorship is different for various types of information censored:
* Moral censorship is the removal of materials that are [[Obscenity|obscene]] or otherwise considered morally questionable. Pornography, for example, is often censored under this rationale, especially [[child pornography]], which is illegal and censored in most jurisdictions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Pornography: Model Legislation &amp; Global Review|url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/CP_Legislation_Report.pdf|publisher=International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children|year=2008|edition=5|accessdate=2012-08-25|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/index.htm |title=World Congress against CSEC |publisher=Csecworldcongress.org |date=2002-07-27 |accessdate=2011-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316121435/http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/index.htm |archivedate=March 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Military censorship is the process of keeping [[military intelligence]] and [[military tactics|tactics]] confidential and away from the enemy. This is used to counter espionage, which is the process of gleaning military information.
* [[Political censorship]] occurs when governments hold back information from their citizens. This is often done to exert control over the populace and prevent free expression that might foment [[rebellion]].
* [[Censorship by religion|Religious censorship]] is the means by which any material considered objectionable by a certain religion is removed. This often involves a dominant religion forcing limitations on less prevalent ones. Alternatively, one religion may shun the works of another when they believe the content is not appropriate for their religion.
* [[Corporate censorship]] is the process by which editors in corporate media outlets intervene to disrupt the publishing of information that portrays their business or business partners in a negative light,&lt;ref name=Jay&gt;{{cite book|title=Why We Curse: A Neuro-psycho-social Theory of Speech|author=Timothy Jay|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-55619-758-1|pages=208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Regulating the Changing Media: A Comparative Study|author1=David Goldberg |author2=Stefaan G.

Strict censorship existed in the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref name="major6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the bloc, the various ministries of culture held a tight rein on their writers.&lt;ref name="major15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural products there reflected the propaganda needs of the state.&lt;ref name="major15"/&gt; Party-approved censors exercised strict control in the early years.&lt;ref name="crampton247"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Stalinist period, even the weather forecasts were changed if they suggested that the sun might not shine on [[May Day]].&lt;ref name="crampton247"/&gt; Under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], weather reports were doctored so that the temperatures were not seen to rise above or fall below the levels which dictated that work must stop.&lt;ref name="crampton247"/&gt;

Independent journalism did not exist in the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became its leader; all reporting was directed by the [[Communist Party]] or related organizations. [[Pravda]], the predominant newspaper in the Soviet Union, had a monopoly. Foreign newspapers were available only if they were published by [[Communist Parties]] sympathetic to the Soviet Union.

Possession and use of [[copy machine|copying machines]] was tightly controlled in order to hinder production and distribution of [[samizdat]], illegal [[self-publishing|self-published]] books and magazines. &lt;!-- Page 308 {{ISBN|0-88687-654-0}} --&gt; Possession of even a single samizdat manuscript such as a book by [[Andrei Sinyavsky]] was a serious crime which might involve a visit from the [[KGB]]. &lt;!--Page 309 {{ISBN|0-88687-654-0}} --&gt;Another outlet for works which did not find favor with the authorities was publishing abroad.

The [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China]] employs sophisticated censorship mechanisms, referred to as the [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Golden Shield Project|Golden Shield Project]], to monitor the internet. Popular search engines such as [[Baidu]] also remove politically sensitive search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked/|title=Baidu's Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (1) (Updated) – China Digital Times (CDT)|website=China Digital Times (CDT)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked-2/|title=Baidu's Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (2)  – China Digital Times (CDT)|website=China Digital Times (CDT)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/04/baidus-internal-monitoring-and-censorship-document-leaked-3/|title=Baidu's Internal Monitoring and Censorship Document Leaked (3)  – China Digital Times (CDT)|website=China Digital Times (CDT)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq under [[Baathist]] [[Saddam Hussein]] had much the same techniques of press censorship as did Romania under Nicolae Ceauşescu but with greater potential violence.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Cuban media used to be operated under the supervision of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party's]] ''Department of Revolutionary Orientation'', which "develops and coordinates propaganda strategies".&lt;ref name="CPJ-2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/censored/censored_06.html|title=10 most censored countries|publisher=The Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connection to the Internet is restricted and censored.&lt;ref name="cubaonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_gb_md_1.pdf|title=Going online in Cuba: Internet under surveillance|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303221407/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_gb_md_1.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Censorship also takes place in capitalist nations, such as Uruguay. In 1973, a military coup took power in Uruguay, and the State practiced censorship. For example, writer [[Eduardo Galeano]] was imprisoned and later was forced to flee. His book [[Open Veins of Latin America]] was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in Chile and Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/28/eduardo|title=Fresh Off Worldwide Attention for Joining Obama's Book Collection, Uruguayan Author Eduardo Galeano Returns with "Mirrors: Stories of Almost Everyone"|publisher=Democracynow.org|date=28 May 2009|accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, censorship occurs through books, film festivals, politics, and public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncac.org/issue/books|title=Books|website=National Coalition Against Censorship|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[List of books banned by governments|banned books]] for more information.  Additionally, critics of [[campaign finance reform in the United States]] say this reform imposes widespread restrictions on political speech.&lt;ref name="The Trick of Campaign Finance Reform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantleap.org/envision/campaign.htm|title=The Trick of Campaign Finance Reform|publisher=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Felonious Advocacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/132594.html|title=Felonious Advocacy|publisher=reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Censorship in Singapore|Media censorship in Singapore}}
In the [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]], Section 33 of the Films Act originally banned the making, distribution and exhibition of "party political films", at pain of a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years. The Act further defines a "party political film" as any film or video

: ''(a) which is an advertisement made by or on behalf of any political party in Singapore or any body whose objects relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore, or any branch of such party or body; or''

: ''(b) which is made by any person and directed towards any political end in Singapore''

In 2001, the short documentary called ''A Vision of Persistence'' on opposition politician [[J. B. Jeyaretnam]] was also banned for being a "party political film". The makers of the documentary, all lecturers at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic, later submitted written apologies and withdrew the documentary from being screened at the 2001 [[Singapore International Film Festival]] in April, having been told they could be charged in court. Another short documentary called ''Singapore Rebel'' by [[Martyn See]], which documented [[Singapore Democratic Party]] leader Dr [[Chee Soon Juan]]'s acts of civil disobedience, was banned from the 2005 [[Singapore International Film Festival]] on the same grounds and See is being investigated for possible violations of the Films Act.

This law, however, is often disregarded when such political films are made supporting the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP). [[Channel NewsAsia]]'s five-part documentary series on Singapore's PAP ministers in 2005, for example, was not considered a party political film.

Exceptions are also made when political films are made concerning political parties of other nations. Films such as [[Michael Moore]]'s [[Fahrenheit 911]] are thus allowed to screen regardless of the law.

Since March 2009, the Films Act has been amended to allow party political films as long as they were deemed factual and objective by a consultative committee. Some months later, this committee lifted the ban on Singapore Rebel.

===State secrets and prevention of attention===
[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|''[[Wieczór Wrocławia]]'' – Daily newspaper of [[Wrocław]], [[People's Republic of Poland]], March 20–21, 1981, with censor intervention on first and last pages—under the headlines "Co zdarzyło się w Bydgoszczy?" ([[Bydgoszcz events|What happened in Bydgoszcz?]]) and "Pogotowie strajkowe w całym kraju" (Country-wide strike alert). The censor had removed a section regarding the strike alert; hence the workers in the printing house blanked out an official propaganda section. The right-hand page also includes a hand-written confirmation of that decision by the local [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|"Solidarność" Trade Union]].]]

In wartime, explicit censorship is carried out with the intent of preventing the release of information that might be useful to an enemy. Typically it involves keeping times or locations secret, or delaying the release of information (e.g., an operational objective) until it is of no possible use to enemy forces. The moral issues here are often seen as somewhat different, as the proponents of this form of censorship argues that release of tactical information usually presents a greater risk of casualties among one's own forces and could possibly lead to loss of the overall conflict.

During [[World War I]] letters written by British soldiers would have to go through censorship. This consisted of officers going through letters with a black marker and crossing out anything which might compromise operational secrecy before the letter was sent. The [[World War II]] catchphrase "[[Loose lips sink ships]]" was used as a common justification to exercise official wartime censorship and encourage individual restraint when sharing potentially sensitive information.

An example of "[[sanitization (classified information)|sanitization]]" policies comes from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] under [[Joseph Stalin]], where publicly used photographs were often altered to remove people whom Stalin had condemned to execution. Though past photographs may have been remembered or kept, this deliberate and systematic alteration to all of history in the public mind is seen as one of the central themes of [[Stalinism]] and [[totalitarianism]].

Censorship is occasionally carried out to aid authorities or to protect an individual, as with some kidnappings when attention and media coverage of the victim can sometimes be seen as unhelpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/technology/internet/29wiki.html_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper|title=''New York Times''|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rawstory.com/news/afp/Cat_and_mouse_at_Wikipedia_over_NYT_06292009.html The Raw Story | Investigative News and Politics]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main article|Censorship by religion}}
Censorship by religion is a form of censorship where [[freedom of expression]] is controlled or limited using [[religious authority]] or on the basis of the teachings of the [[religion]]. This form of censorship has a long history and is practiced in many societies and by many religions. Examples include the [[Galileo affair]], [[Edict of Compiègne]], the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (list of prohibited books) and the condemnation of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' by [[Iran]]ian leader [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]]. Images of the Islamic figure Muhammad are also regularly censored. In some secular countries, this is sometimes done to prevent hurting religious sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncert.nic.in/textbook/textbook.htm?iess4=6-6|title=National Council Of Educational Research And Training :: Home (Page 105, Democratic Politics - Class 9)|last=|first=|date=|website=ncert.nic.in|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational sources===

The content of school textbooks is often the issue of debate, since their target audience is young people, and the term "whitewashing" is the one commonly used to refer to removal of critical or conflicting events. The [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|reporting of military atrocities in history]] is extremely controversial, as in the case of [[The Holocaust]] (or [[Holocaust denial]]), [[Bombing of Dresden]], the [[Nanking Massacre]] as found with [[Japanese history textbook controversies]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], and the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]] of the [[Vietnam War]].

In the context of secondary school education, the way facts and history are presented greatly influences the interpretation of contemporary thought, opinion and socialization. One argument for censoring the type of information disseminated is based on the inappropriate quality of such material for the young. The use of the "inappropriate" distinction is in itself controversial, as it changed heavily. A Ballantine Books version of the book ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' which is the version used by most school classes&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Ray. ''Fahrenheit 451''. Del Rey Books. April 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; contained approximately 75 separate edits, omissions, and changes from the original Bradbury manuscript.

In February 2006 a ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' cover was censored by the [[Nashravaran Journalistic Institute]]. The offending cover was about the subject of [[love]] and a picture of an embracing couple was hidden beneath a white sticker.&lt;ref name="Lundqvist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lundqvist|first=J.|title=More pictures of Iranian Censorship|url=http://viewsdesk.com/2006/more-pictures-of-iranian-censorship/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429200541/http://viewsdesk.com/2006/more-pictures-of-iranian-censorship/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-04-29|accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lundqvist"/&gt;

===Copy, picture, and writer approval===
Copy approval is the right to read and amend an article, usually an interview, before publication. Many publications refuse to give copy approval but it is increasingly becoming common practice when dealing with publicity anxious celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The readers' editor on requests that are always refused|author=Ian Mayes|date=2005-04-23|publisher=The Guardian|url=https://guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1468351,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-01|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picture approval is the right given to an individual to choose which photos will be published and which will not. [[Robert Redford]] is well known for insisting upon picture approval.&lt;ref name="Observer-approval"&gt;{{cite news|title=Caution: big name ahead|date=2002-01-27|publisher=The Observer|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,639829,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-01|location=London|first=Lynn|last=Barber}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer approval is when writers are chosen based on whether they will write flattering articles or not. Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley is known for banning certain writers who wrote undesirably about one of her clients from interviewing any of her other clients.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Creative censorship===
There are many ways that censors exhibit creativity, but a specific variant is of concern in which censors rewrite texts, giving these texts secret co-authors.

===Self-censorship===

{{Main article|Self-censorship}}

Self-censorship is the act of censoring or [[Classified Information|classifying]] one's own [[blog]], book, film, or other forms of [[Media (communication)|media]]. This is done out of fear of, or deference to, the sensibilities or preferences (actual or perceived) of others and without overt pressure from any specific party or institution of authority. Self-censorship is often practiced by [[film producer]]s, [[film director]]s, [[publisher]]s, [[news anchor]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[musician]]s, and other kinds of [[author]]s including individuals who use [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rm.coe.int/168070ad5d|title=Journalism under pressure.

According to a [[Pew Research Center]] and the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' survey, "About one-quarter of the local and national journalists say they have purposely avoided newsworthy stories, while nearly as many acknowledge they have softened the tone of stories to benefit the interests of their news organizations. Fully four-in-ten (41%) admit they have engaged in either or both of these practices."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://people-press.org/report/39/ Self Censorship: How Often and Why]". Pew Research Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

Threats to media freedom have shown a significant increase in Europe in recent years, according to a study published in April 2017 by the [[Council of Europe]].
This results in a fear of physical or psychological violence, and the ultimate result is self-censorship by journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/en-europe-les-journalistes-sont-exposes-a-la-violence-aux-intimidations-et-a-l-autocensure-selon-une-etude-du-conseil-de-l-europe|title=Journalists suffer violence, intimidation and self-censorship in Europe, says a Council of Europe study|last=|first=|date=20 April 2017|work=Council of Europe.

Book censorship can be enacted at the national or sub-national level, and can carry legal penalties for their infraction. Books may also be [[Challenge (literature)|challenged]] at a local, community level. As a result, books can be removed from schools or libraries, although these bans do not extend outside of that area.

===Films===
{{Main article|Film censorship}}
Aside from the usual justifications of pornography and obscenity, some films are censored due to changing racial attitudes or [[political correctness]] in order to avoid [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic stereotyping]] and/or ethnic offense despite its historical or artistic value. One example is the still withdrawn "[[Censored Eleven]]" series of animated cartoons, which may have been innocent then, but are "incorrect" now.

Film censorship is carried out by various countries to differing degrees. For example, only [[Censorship in China#Film|34 foreign films]] a year are approved for official distribution in [[China]]'s [[Censorship in China#Film|strictly controlled]] film market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why China is letting 'Django Unchained' slip through its censorship regime|url=http://qz.com/62717/why-china-is-letting-django-unchained-slip-through-its-censorship-regime/|publisher=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Censorship of maps is often employed for military purposes. For example, the technique was used in former [[East Germany]], especially for the areas near the border to [[West Germany]] in order to make attempts of defection more difficult. Censorship of maps is also applied by [[Google Maps]], where certain areas are grayed out or blacked or areas are purposely left outdated with old imagery.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/21/AR2007072101296.html|title=Google's View of D.C.

Internet censorship is control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the Internet. It may be carried out by governments or by private organizations either at the behest of government or on their own initiative. Individuals and organizations may engage in [[self-censorship]] on their own or due to intimidation and fear.

The issues associated with Internet censorship are similar to those for offline censorship of more traditional media. One difference is that national borders are more permeable online: residents of a country that bans certain information can find it on websites hosted outside the country. Thus censors must work to prevent access to information even though they lack physical or legal control over the websites themselves. This in turn requires the use of technical censorship methods that are unique to the Internet, such as site blocking and content filtering.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/freedom-of-connection-freedom-of-expression-the-changing-legal-and-regulatory-ecology-shaping-the-internet/ ''Freedom of Connection, Freedom of Expression: The Changing Legal and Regulatory Ecology Shaping the Internet''], Dutton, William H.; Dopatka, Anna; Law, Ginette; Nash, Victoria, Division for Freedom of Expression, Democracy and Peace, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris, 2011, 103 pp., {{ISBN|978-92-3-104188-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the censor has total control over all Internet-connected computers, such as in [[Internet censorship in North Korea|North Korea]] or [[Internet censorship in cuba|Cuba]], total censorship of information is very difficult or impossible to achieve due to the underlying distributed technology of the Internet. [[Pseudonymity]] and [[data haven]]s (such as [[Freenet]]) protect [[free speech]] using technologies that guarantee material cannot be removed and prevents the identification of authors. Technologically savvy users can often find ways to [[Internet censorship circumvention|access blocked content]]. Nevertheless, blocking remains an effective means of limiting access to sensitive information for most users when censors, such as those in [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]], are able to devote significant resources to building and maintaining a comprehensive censorship system.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

Views about the feasibility and effectiveness of Internet censorship have evolved in parallel with the development of the Internet and censorship technologies:
* A 1993 ''Time Magazine'' article quotes computer scientist [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gillmore]], one of the founders of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], as saying "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html "First Nation in Cyberspace"], Philip Elmer-Dewitt, ''Time'', 6 December 1993, No. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2007, "Father of the Internet" [[Vint Cerf]] stated that he sees government control of the Internet failing because the Web is almost entirely privately owned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSN1420689320071114?sp=true "Cerf sees government control of Internet failing"], Pedro Fonseca, Reuters, 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* A report of research conducted in 2007 and published in 2009 by the Beckman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University stated that: "We are confident that the [censorship circumvention] tool developers will for the most part keep ahead of the governments' blocking efforts", but also that "...we believe that less than two percent of all filtered Internet users use circumvention tools".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/2007_Circumvention_Landscape.pdf ''2007 Circumvention Landscape Report: Methods, Uses, and Tools''], Hal Roberts, Ethan Zuckerman, and John Palfrey, Beckman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* In contrast, a 2011 report by researchers at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] published by [[UNESCO]] concludes "... the control of information on the Internet and Web is certainly feasible, and technological advances do not therefore guarantee greater freedom of speech."&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

A [[Internet censorship#BBC World Service global public opinion poll|BBC World Service poll]] of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet users,&lt;ref&gt;For the BBC poll Internet users are those who used the Internet within the previous six months.&lt;/ref&gt; was conducted between 30 November 2009 and 7 February 2010. The head of the polling organization felt, overall, that the poll showed that:
:Despite worries about privacy and fraud, people around the world see access to the internet as their fundamental right. They think the web is a force for good, and most don’t want governments to regulate it.&lt;ref name=BBCPoll-2010&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_03_10_BBC_internet_poll.pdf "BBC Internet Poll: Detailed Findings"], BBC World Service, 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The poll found that nearly four in five (78%) Internet users felt that the Internet had brought them greater freedom, that most Internet users (53%) felt that "the internet should never be regulated by any level of government anywhere", and almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right (50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm "Internet access is 'a fundamental right'"], BBC News, 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social media====
The rising usages of social media in many nations has led to the emergence of citizens organizing protests through social media, sometimes called "[[Twitter Revolution (disambiguation)|Twitter Revolution]]s". The most notable of these social media led protests were parts [[Social media and the Arab Spring|Arab Spring uprisings]], starting in 2010. In response to the use of social media in these protests, the Tunisian government began a hack of Tunisian citizens' Facebook accounts, and reports arose of accounts being deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/01/the-inside-story-of-how-facebook-responded-to-tunisian-hacks/70044/|title=The Inside Story of How Facebook Responded to Tunisian Hacks|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automated systems can be used to censor [[social media]] posts, and therefore limit what citizens can say online. This most notably occurs in [[Censorship in China|China]], where social media posts are automatically censored depending on content. In 2013, Harvard political science professor [[Gary King (political scientist)|Gary King]] led a study to determine what caused social media posts to be censored and found that posts mentioning the government were not more or less likely to be deleted if they were supportive or critical of the government. Posts mentioning collective action were more likely to be deleted than those that had not mentioned collective action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Gary|last2=Pan|first2=Jennifer|date=2014|title=Reverse-engineering censorship in China: Randomized experimentation and participant observation|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6199/1251722.full|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1251722|pmid=25146296|access-date=7 April 2016|volume=345|issue=6199|pages=1251722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, social media censorship appears primarily as a way to restrict Internet users' ability to organize protests.  For the Chinese government, seeing citizens unhappy with local governance is beneficial as state and national leaders can replace unpopular officials. King and his researchers were able to predict when certain officials would be removed based on the number of unfavorable social media posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/151768150|title=Professor Gary King, Inaugural Government Regius Lecture 2015|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has proved that criticism is tolerable on social media sites, therefore it is not censored unless it has a higher chance of collective action. It isn't important whether the criticism is supportive or unsupportive of the states' leaders, the main priority of censoring certain social media posts is to make sure that no big actions are being made due to something that was said on the internet. Posts that challenge the Party's political leading role in the Chinese government are more likely to be censored due to the challenges it poses to the Chinese Communist Party. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shao |first1=Li |title=THE DILEMMA OF CRITICISM: DISENTANGLING THE DETERMINANTS OF MEDIA CENSORSHIP IN CHINA |journal=Journal of East Asian studies |date=11/01/2018 |volume=18 |issue=3 |page=279-297 |doi=10.1017/jea.2018.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Social Media Censorship.jpg|thumb|This represents how different types of social media are censored based on what is appropriate to share with the public.]]

===Video games===
{{Main article |Video game censorship |List of regionally censored video games}}

Since the early 1980s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an [[games as art|expressive medium]], arguing for their protection under the laws governing [[freedom of speech]] and also as an educational tool. Detractors argue that video games are [[harm principle|harmful]] and therefore should be [[Free speech limitations|subject to legislative oversight and restrictions]]. Many video games have certain elements removed or edited due to [[Video game content rating system|regional rating standards]].&lt;ref&gt;Byrd P. [http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/44-2_pdf/5_Byrd.pdf "It's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt: the effectiveness of proposed video game regulation."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924031423/http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/44-2_pdf/5_Byrd.pdf# |date=2015-09-24 }} Houston Law Review 2007.

For example, in the Japanese and PAL Versions of ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]'', blood splatter and gore is removed from the gameplay. Decapitation scenes are implied, but not shown. Scenes of missing body parts after having been cut off, are replaced with the same scene, but showing the body parts fully intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGlGgSjD2Zs|title=No More Heroes - Censored gameplay 12-07-07|first=|last=gamesradararchive|date=19 October 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveillance as an aid==
{{See also |Surveillance|Mass surveillance|Computer and network surveillance}}

Surveillance and censorship are different. Surveillance can be performed without censorship, but it is harder to engage in censorship without some form of surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/02/censorship-inseperable-from-surveillance "Censorship is inseparable from surveillance"], Cory Doctorow, ''The Guardian'', 2 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; And even when surveillance does not lead directly to censorship, the widespread knowledge or belief that a person, their computer, or their use of the Internet is under surveillance can lead to self-censorship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wefightcensorship.org/cybercensorship-worldwidehtml.html "Online Censorship : Ubiquitous Big Brother, witchhunt for dissidents"]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}, WeFightCensorship.org, Reporters Without Borders, retrieved 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection of sources is no longer just a matter of journalistic ethics; it increasingly also depends on the journalist's computer skills and all journalists should equip themselves with a "digital survival kit" if they are exchanging sensitive information online or storing it on a computer or mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/opinion/without-computer-security-sources-secrets-arent-safe-with-journalists.html?_r=1&amp; "When Secrets Aren’t Safe With Journalists"], Christopher Soghoian, ''New York Times'', 26 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831072750/http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ |date=2013-08-31 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; And individuals associated with high-profile rights organizations, dissident, protest, or reform groups are urged to take extra precautions to protect their online identities.&lt;ref name=CitizensLab-2007&gt;[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/circ_guide.pdf ''Everyone's Guide to By-passing Internet Censorship''], The Citizen Lab, University of Toronto, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
[[File:Censuraindex.jpg|thumb|upright|Censored pre-press proof of two articles from "[[Notícias da Amadora]]", a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] newspaper, 1970]]
The former Soviet Union maintained a particularly extensive program of state-imposed censorship. The main organ for official censorship in the Soviet Union was the ''Chief Agency for Protection of Military and State Secrets'' generally known as the ''[[Main Administration for Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press|Glavlit]]'', its Russian acronym. The ''Glavlit'' handled censorship matters arising from domestic writings of just about any kind—even beer and vodka labels. ''Glavlit'' censorship personnel were present in every large Soviet publishing house or newspaper; the agency employed some 70,000 censors to review information before it was disseminated by publishing houses, editorial offices, and broadcasting studios. No mass medium escaped ''Glavlit''{{'}}s control. All press agencies and radio and television stations had ''Glavlit'' representatives on their editorial staffs.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Sometimes, public knowledge of the existence of a specific document is subtly suppressed, a situation resembling censorship. The authorities taking such action will justify it by declaring the work to be "[[subversion (politics)|subversive]]" or "inconvenient". An example is [[Michel Foucault]]'s 1978 text ''[[Sexual Morality and the Law]]'' (later republished as ''The Danger of Child Sexuality''), originally published as ''La loi de la pudeur'' &amp;#91;literally, "the law of decency"&amp;#93;. This work defends the decriminalization of [[statutory rape]] and the [[age of consent reform|abolition of age of consent laws]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

When a publisher comes under pressure to suppress a book, but has already entered into a contract with the author, they will sometimes effectively censor the book by deliberately ordering a small print run and making minimal, if any, attempts to publicize it. This practice became known in the early 2000s as ''privishing'' ('''priv'''ate publ'''ishing''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0711-05.htm |title=Journalists Thrown 'Into the Buzzsaw' |last=Winkler |first=David |date=11 July 2002 |publisher=CommonDreams.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804080018/http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0711-05.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:2014 Cenzura.jpg|thumb|upright| Artistic allegory of communist press censorship, 1989]]
Censorship has been criticized throughout history for being unfair and hindering progress. In a 1997 essay on Internet censorship, social commentator Michael Landier claims that censorship is counterproductive as it prevents the censored topic from being discussed. Landier expands his argument by claiming that those who impose censorship must consider what they censor to be true, as individuals believing themselves to be correct would welcome the opportunity to disprove those with opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landier.com/michael/essays/censorship/fulltext.htm "Internet Censorship is Absurd and Unconstitutional"], Michael Landier, 4 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Censorship is often used to impose moral values on society, as in the censorship of material considered obscene. English novelist [[E. M. Forster]] was a staunch opponent of censoring material on the grounds that it was obscene or immoral, raising the issue of moral subjectivity and the constant changing of moral values. When the novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was [[R v Penguin Books Ltd|put on trial in 1960]], Forster wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_trial_of_lady_chatterleys_lover "The Trial of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover''"], Paul Gallagher, Dangerous Minds, 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' is a literary work of importance...I do not think that it could be held obscene, but am in a difficulty here, for the reason that I have never been able to follow the legal definition of obscenity. The law tells me that obscenity may deprave and corrupt, but as far as I know, it offers no definition of depravity or corruption.}}

The '''Charter of Liberties''', also called the '''Coronation Charter''', was a written proclamation by [[Henry I of England]], issued upon his accession to the throne in 1100.  It sought to bind the King to certain laws regarding the treatment of nobles, church officials, and individuals.  The nineteenth-century historians [[Frederic William Maitland|Frederick Maitland]] and [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] considered it a landmark document&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pollock|Maitland|1968|pp=95 et seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[English legal history]] and a forerunner of [[Magna Carta]].

The document addressed abuses of royal power by his predecessor [[William II of England|William II]] (his brother William Rufus), as perceived by the nobility, specifically the over-taxation of the barons, the abuse of vacant [[Episcopal see|sees]], and the practices of [[simony]] and [[benefice#Abuse|pluralism]].

The Charter of Liberties was generally ignored by monarchs, until in 1213 [[Stephen Langton|Archbishop Langton]] reminded the nobles that their liberties had been guaranteed over a century prior in Henry I's Charter of Liberties.

==Background==
[[File:Henry1.jpg|180px|thumb|left|[[Henry I of England]] was forced to make concessions to the barons in the Charter of Liberties when he assumed the throne in 1100.]]
[[Henry I of England]], nicknamed Beauclerk, was the fourth and youngest son of William I ([[William the Conqueror]]) by his queen [[Matilda of Flanders]]. The name Beauclerk was given because Henry was well educated, being able to read and write Latin, and possessed a knowledge of English law and natural history. He had received 5,000 pounds of silver from his father, but no land holdings. He used this to purchase a district in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] in [[Normandy]] for 3,000 pounds from his brother [[Robert Curthose|Robert of Normandy]]. Robert had been left the [[Duchy of Normandy]] by their father, but needed money. Various political intrigues occurred in France, which led to the imprisonment of Henry for two years by his brother William II, then King of England. In 1096, Robert left Normandy for the [[First Crusade]]. Henry swore fealty to William, who took over Normandy in Robert's absence. William was killed in a hunting accident on 2 August 1100. (Henry was present on this hunting trip.) With William dead and Robert absent, Henry claimed the English crown.

Henry was immediately faced with three political problems. (1) The earls and barons did not accept him. (2) There was antagonism from the Church, especially Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]]. (3) The native Anglo-Saxon population was not receptive to the new king.&lt;ref name="Lapp"&gt;J. M. Lappenberg, ''History of England Under the Angevin Kings'', Vol. 1 (1887)&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry made concessions to the Church and reconciled with Anselm. He married [[Matilda of Scotland|Edith]], the daughter of King [[Malcolm III]] of Scotland, who was of mixed Anglo-Scots heritage, and so garnered great favor with the Anglo-Saxons. She changed her name to the Norman Mathilda. However, the choice displeased the barons and earls.

Henry needed to mollify the nobles and secure his throne.

[[William II of England]], the son of William the Conqueror and brother of Henry Beauclerk,  had issued a charter in 1093, when he was ill and fearing death. The text of this charter has been lost to history. It is believed to have freed prisoners, forgiven debts, and assured that holy and good laws would be maintained. Whatever promises William made, he quickly broke after he recovered his health.&lt;ref&gt;Eadmer, ''Historia novella'', pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry went further. He negotiated with the leading barons and earls, making various concessions to them. When all sides were agreed, the agreement was issued as the Charter of Liberties.&lt;ref name="Lapp"/&gt;

==Summary ==
After a traditional greeting, the Charter of Liberties contained fourteen declarations, summarized as follows:

Henry, king of the English, to Bishop Samson and Urso de Abetot and all his barons and faithful, both French and English, of Worcestershire, [copies were sent to all the shires] greeting.

{{Cquote|[[File:Whitetowerchapel.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Charter was issued from the Norman Chapel in the [[Tower of London]] in 1100.]]
# I, Henry, by the grace of God having been crowned the King of England, shall not take or sell any property from a Church upon the death of a bishop or abbot, until a successor has been named to that Church property. I shall end all the oppressive practices which have been an evil presence in England.
# If any baron or earl of mine shall die, his heirs shall not be forced to purchase their inheritance, but shall retrieve it through force of law and custom.
# Any baron or earl who wishes to betroth his daughter or other women kinsfolk in marriage should consult me first, but I will not stand in the way of any prudent marriage. Any widow who wishes to remarry should consult with me, but I shall abide by the wishes of her close relatives, the other barons and earls.  I will not allow her to marry one of my enemies.
# Any wife of my barons, who becomes a widow shall not be denied her dowry. She should be allowed to remarry according to her wishes, so long as she maintains the integrity of her body, in a lawful manner. Barons overseeing the children of a dead baron shall maintain their land and interest in a lawful manner.
# Common seigniorages took in the cities and counties, which was not taken in the time of Edward I ([[Edward the Confessor]]), shall henceforth be forbidden.
# I shall remit [cancel] all debts and pleas which were owing to my brother, except those which were lawfully made through an inheritance.
# If any of my barons should grow feeble, and give away money or other possessions, these shall be honored, so long as the heirs are properly remembered. Gifts given by feeble barons under force of arms shall not be enforced.
# If any of my barons commit a crime, he shall not bind himself to the crown with a payment as was done in the time of my father and brother, but shall stand for the crime as was custom and law before the time of my father, and make amends as are appropriate. Anyone guilty of treachery or other heinous crime shall make proper amends.
# I forgive all murders committed before I was crowned. Subsequent murders shall stand before the justice of the Crown.
# With the common consent of my barons, I shall maintain all the forests as was done in the time of my father.
# Those knights who render military service and horses shall not be required to give grain or other farm goods to me.
# I impose a strict peace on the land and command it be maintained.
# I restore the law of King Edward and the amendments which my father introduced upon the advice of his barons.
# Anything taken from me after the death of my father shall be returned immediately, without fine.  If it is not returned, a heavy fine shall be enforced.

==Aftermath==
[[File:William2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[William II of England]] was killed in a hunting accident, allowing his brother, [[Henry I of England]] to assume the throne in 1100.]]

William I had been a great admirer of the laws of [[Edward the Confessor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pollock|Maitland|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had reformed many laws in an effort to make the law of Edward the common law of England while establishing a strong Norman rule and custom. During the entire Norman period, there was little legislation.

Henry began his reign with the Charter of Liberties,&lt;ref&gt;Charters of Liberties (Statutes of the Realm, vol. I), p.1; Select Charters, Liebermann, Trans. R. Hist. Soc. viii. 21&lt;/ref&gt; sending a strong message: he was returning to his father’s ways, which were viewed with great nostalgia. The perceived abuses of William II were to be abolished. The corruption and larceny of reliefs, wardships, marriages, murder fines and so forth, was to end. Debts and past offences were to be forgiven. The demesne lands and military tenants were to be freed from the danegeld of [[Danelaw]]. Above all, the “laga Eadwardii” [[Law of Edward the Confessor]], as amended by William I, would be restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pollock|Maitland|1968|pp=93-95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation was made with the assumption that the barons would make the same concessions to their tenants as the king had promised to them. Plucknett is of the opinion that this good will probably did flow down the feudal chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Plucknett|1956|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter was not legislation, but rather a promise to return to the law, as it existed in the time of William I, before it had been corrupted by William II.

The promises made in the Charter could not be enforced. There is ample evidence that Henry I ignored them. The [[Pipe Rolls]] which came thirty-one years into Henry’s reign indicate he had extended the power of the crown well beyond the limits set in the Charter. The establishment of the [[Exchequer]], ostensively to end corruption and fraud in the taking and holding of taxes, in reality, led to greater power of the crown. The direction of its chief minister, [[Bishop Roger of Salisbury]] evolved the law for tenants in chief which became the harshest and most severe in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Pipe Roll of 31 Henry I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pollock_Maitland_95_96"&gt;{{harvp|Pollock|Maitland|1968|pp=95-96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred silently, and placed precedent upon precedent. Early in his reign, Henry issued a writ declaring the county and hundred courts should be held as in the days of Edward the Confessor. These had the result of bringing the ancient traditional tribunals in accordance with newer Norman methods.&lt;ref&gt;The writ is recorded in ''Select Charters''; [[Felix Liebermann]], ''[[Quadripartitus]]'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Chroniclers of the age state that {{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Henry legislated about theft, restored capital punishment (which had been suspended for a great many crimes by William II), and harshly treated utterers of bad money and rapacious exactions of his courtiers. He made his roving court and army the terror of every neighborhood. Henry made the measure of his own arm the standard [[ell]].

The drowning of his son, [[William Adelin|William]], in the loss of the [[White Ship]] in 1120, led to the end of the Norman dynasty. [[Stephen of England]] claimed the throne in 1135. He was the last Norman king. His conflict with Henry's daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] led to [[The Anarchy]].&lt;ref name="Pollock_Maitland_95_96"/&gt;
[[File:WhiteShipSinking.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The sinking of the [[White Ship]] in 1120, drowning Henry's heir, William, effectively marked the end of the Norman era in England.]]

Plucknett describes the Charter of Liberties as a forerunner to legislation in later years. There was no legislation as such either under the Saxons or the Normans. The Charter was a great concession, born of political need. Large portions of the charter were a withdrawal of practices which were of questionable legality,  and corrosive politically. Various feudal dues, instead of being arbitrary and ''ad hoc'', were declared to be reduced to ''reasonable'' limits. The Charter led to an obscure decree of Stephen (1135-1154), the '''''statutum decretum''''' that established where there was no son, daughters would inherit. This was remarkable in its day, and pre-dated the reforms of [[Henry II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Plucknett|1956|pp=318–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems with the Church had been brewing for some time. William I had tried to invest bishops with his temporal seal. [[Pope Gregory VII]] in 1075 had prohibited lay investiture, holding the Church was independent of the state.  A long struggle ensued.  This was still going on when Henry I assumed the throne and entered into open conflict with Anselm. This conflict was moderated and ameliorated by the canon lawyer [[Ivo of Chartres]]. It was agreed that Henry could observe the selection of bishops, without interference. This accord was extended to all of Europe by 1122. The [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122 did not last, but only changed the nature of tension between Church and State, which exists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Plucknett|1956|pp=14–15, 318 et seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Henry I at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] became exquisitely effective. The mechanism of Norman government needed a strong hand.  Stephen was not up to it. Henry’s death was viewed as a great tragedy for several centuries:

{{quote|Then there was tribulation soon in the land, for every man that could forthwith robbed another...A good man (Henry I)  he was, there was great awe of him. No man durst misdo against another in his time. He made peace for man and beast. Whoso bare his burden of gold and silver, no man durst say aught but good.&lt;ref&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', in Stubbs Charters; also seen in ''Y. BB. Edward II'' (Seldon Society), xx. 159, no. 71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the reign of Stephen, Henry I came to be known as the "Lion of Justice".&lt;ref&gt;Dahmus, Joseph. ''The Middle Ages, A Popular History'',  p.290. Doubleday, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter of Liberties was a precedent for [[Magna Carta]] (Great Charter) of 1215, at the end of the reign of [[John of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Plucknett|1956|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Communications Act 2003'''  is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communications Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/contents|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act, which came into force on 25 July 2003, superseded the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]]. The new act was the responsibility of [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Tessa Jowell]]. It consolidated the telecommunication and broadcasting regulators in the UK, introducing the Office of Communications ([[Ofcom]]) as the new industry regulator. On 28 December 2003 Ofcom gained its full regulatory powers, inheriting the duties of the Office of Telecommunications ([[Oftel]]). Among other measures, the act introduced [[legal recognition]] of [[community radio]] and paved the way for full-time community radio services in the UK, as well as controversially lifting many restrictions on cross-[[media ownership]]. It also made it illegal to use other people's [[Wi-Fi]] broadband connections without their permission. In addition, the legislation also allowed for the first time non-European entities to wholly own a British television company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/PracticeNote.2102.html UK Office of Communications [4.4.1&amp;#93; | ICT Regulation Toolkit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623230407/http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/PracticeNote.2102.html |date=23 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/Broadcasting/media_ownership/ Department for Culture Media and Sport - media ownership&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817104225/http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/Broadcasting/media_ownership/ |date=17 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provisions of the act ==
The act had a large number of provisions, including the following:

* Obtaining access to the Internet with no intention to pay for the service was made a criminal offence.
* Sending a malicious communication using [[social media]] was made a criminal offence. 
* The [[Independent Television Commission]], Radio Authority, Office of Telecommunications, and Radiocommunications Agency were merged into Ofcom.
* The telecommunications licensing regime was replaced by a general authorisation for companies to provide telecommunications services subject to general conditions of entitlement, while [[BT Group|BT]] retained its universal service obligation.
* It was declared an offence to "persistently make use of a public electronic communications network for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety". Ofcom subsequently developed policies to reduce the number of [[silent call|silent telephone calls]].
* The public service remit for [[Channel 4]] was revised.
* Broadcasters were required to make a proportion of television programmes outside the London area (defined as outside the [[M25 motorway|M25]]).
* Restrictions on ITV company ownership were lifted, aside from "public interest" test that was added as an amendment in the [[House of Lords]]. The result was the formation of a single entity [[ITV plc]] controlling all of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchises in England and Wales in February 2004.
* The limit on the proportion of [[ITN]] that any ITV operating company could own was abolished.
* Broadcasters were required to carry a "suitable quantity and range of programmes" dealing with religion and other beliefs, as part of their [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcasting]].
* Political advertising on television or radio was prohibited.

* [[Community radio]] stations were recognised as a distinct third tier of radio alongside [[BBC Radio]] and [[commercial radio]].
* The authority for the [[BBC]] to collect the [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|licence fee]] was set out.
* Provision was made for the requirements for blind and deaf television viewers. This has subsequently included [[sign language on television|sign language]], [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] and [[audio description]].
* The [[Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice]] was established as the regulatory body ensuring that advertising on radio and television is not misleading, harmful, offensive, or beyond the boundaries of taste and decency.

== Wi-Fi ==

It is an offence under section 125 of the act to obtain access to the Internet when there is no intention to pay for that service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communications Offences|url=https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/|publisher=The Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was intended to prevent the major defrauding of communications companies. Nevertheless, the individual practice of [[Piggybacking (Internet access)|piggybacking]] (the illicit use of a Wi-Fi connection to access another subscriber's Internet service) was demonstrated to be a contravention of the act by ''R v Straszkiewicz'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jane Wakefield|title=Wireless hijacking under scrutiny|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4721723.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=28 July 2005|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been subsequent arrests for the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man arrested over wi-fi 'theft' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6958429.stm |publisher=BBC News|date=22 August 2007|accessdate= 22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piggybacking may also be a breach of the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]]. Section 125 of the act has been criticised for its vagueness, resulting in the possibility that many users of portable Wi-Fi enabled devices may be inadvertently breaching it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stewart Mitchell|title=Vague Wi-Fi laws lead to legal risk for mobile surfers|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/350836/vague-wi-fi-laws-lead-to-legal-risk-for-mobile-surfers|publisher=PC Pro|date=17 August 2009|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malicious communications ==

Section 127 of the act makes it an offence to send a message that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character over a public electronic communications network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neil Addison|title=Harassment Law UK - Malicious Communications Offences|url=http://www.neiladdison.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/law/malcomm.htm|publisher=Harassment Law|accessdate=23 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009221620/http://www.neiladdison.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/law/malcomm.htm|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section replaced section 43 of the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]] and is drafted as widely as its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Professor Lilian Edwards|title=Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003: Threat or Menace?|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2012/10/19/section-127-of-the-communications-act-2003-threat-or-menace/|publisher=The London School of Economics and Political Science|date=19 October 2012|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section has been used controversially to prosecute users of social media in cases such as the [[Twitter Joke Trial]] and [[Facebook]] comments concerning the [[murder of April Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Amanda Bancroft|title=Is the law criminalising 'improper' Twitter use a menace?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/27/law-criminalisng-offensive-twitter-use|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 April 2012|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2012, to strike a balance between freedom of speech and criminality, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] issued interim guidelines, clarifying when social messaging is eligible for criminal prosecution under UK law. Only communications that are credible threats of violence, harassment, or [[stalking]] (such as aggressive [[Troll (Internet)|Internet trolling]]) which specifically targets an individual or individuals, or breaches a [[court order]] designed to protect someone (such as those protecting the identity of a victim of a sexual offence) will be prosecuted. Communications that express an "unpopular or unfashionable opinion about serious or trivial matters, or banter or humour, even if distasteful to some and painful to those subjected to it" will not. Communications that are merely "grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false" will be prosecuted only when it can be shown to be necessary and proportionate. People who pass on malicious messages, such as by retweeting, can also be prosecuted when the original message is subject to prosecution. Individuals who post messages as part of a separate crime, such as a plan to import drugs, would face prosecution for that offence, as is currently the case.&lt;ref name="USDOS-HRR-UK-2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012: United Kingdom|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204352 |publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dominic Casciani|title=Prosecutors clarify offensive online posts law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20777002|publisher=BBC News|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.K. sets out social media prosecution guidelines|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57559969/u.k-sets-out-social-media-prosecution-guidelines/|publisher=CBS News (Associated Press)|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revisions to the interim guidelines were issued on 20 June 2013 following a public consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Barrett|title=Offensive online posts to escape prosecution if writers apologise, say new guidelines|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/10132657/Offensive-online-posts-to-escape-prosecution-if-writers-apologise-say-new-guidelines.html|newspaper=The Telegraph (UK)|date=20 June 2013|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revisions specified that prosecutors should consider:
* whether messages were aggravated by references to race, religion or other minorities, and whether they breached existing rules to counter harassment or stalking; and
* the age and maturity of any wrongdoer should be taken into account and given great weight.
The revisions also clarified that criminal prosecutions were "unlikely": 
* when the author of the message had "expressed genuine remorse";
* when "swift and effective action ... to remove the communication" was taken; or
* when messages were not intended for a wide audience.

== Amendments to the act ==
*Regulations amended the act in 2009 and 2010, making Ofcom the co-regulator for [[video on demand]] in the UK, along with [[ATVOD]] and the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]].
* The [[Digital Economy Act 2010]] amended the Communications Act 2003, giving Ofcom the responsibility of enforcing regulations concerning Internet copyright breaches.
* The [[Postal Services Act 2011]] allowed Ofcom to take over regulatory responsibility for the [[Royal Mail]] from the [[Postal Services Commission]].
* The [[Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014]] amended the Communications Act 2003 to set out statutory and legal obligations for media distributors of on-demand content. The regulations define the content that can legally be distributed under an [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]] and make it a criminal offence to not adequately restrict access to such content to those aged over 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014|url=http://legislation.data.gov.uk/cy/uksi/2014/2916/made/data.htm?wrap=true|date= 4 November 2014|accessdate=24 November 2014|author=Ed Vaizey|publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable prosecutions==
* 2012: [[Twitter Joke Trial|Paul Chambers]] made a joke on [[Twitter]] in response to [[Robin Hood Airport]] cancelling flights. He said that unless the facility resolved the problem within a week, he would be "blowing the airport sky high". After an off-duty manager discovered the post, Chambers was arrested by anti-terror police. He was found guilty, lost his job and was ordered to pay a £385 fine and £600 in costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/may/10/tweeter-fined-spoof-message: "Wrong kind of tweet leaves air traveller £1,000 out of pocket"], 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;However, after a strong public outcry&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/12/iamspartacus-campaign-twitter-airport: "#IAmSpartacus campaign explodes on Twitter in support of airport joker"], 13 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and three appeals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/06/twitter-joke-trial-david-allen-green: "The "Twitter Joke Trial" returns to the High Court"], 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the case was eventually overturned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-19009344: "Robin Hood Airport tweet bomb joke man wins case"], 27 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*2014: A Lincolnshire man was charged with being grossly offensive after posting a photograph of a policeman on social media, with two phalluses drawn on it. The offending picture was passed on to Lincolnshire Police, who arrested the 20-year-old. He was ordered to pay £400 in compensation to the officer in question, in addition to £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2552269/Builder-ordered-pay-policeman-400-drawing-two-penises-picture-posting-Facebook.html: "Builder ordered to pay policeman £400 after drawing two penises on a picture of him and posting it on Facebook"], 6 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2017: ''R v Mwaikambo'' where a 43-year-old man posted one video and seven pictures of a victim of the [[Grenfell Tower fire|Grenfell Towers tragedy]] to his [[Facebook]] account. Notable in this case was the rapidity of conviction: the fire occurred on 14 June and the case was heard but two days later. Mwaikambo was imprisoned by Ikram J for a total of three months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/16/man-jailed-sharing-photo-dead-grenfell-tower-fire-victim-facebook/ telegraph.co.uk: "Man jailed for sharing photo of dead Grenfell Tower fire victim on Facebook"], 16 Jun 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.met.police.uk/news/man-jailed-for-malicious-communication-offences-246895 met.police.uk: "Man jailed for malicious communication offences"], 16 Jun 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea Russell had used lyrics from a Snap Dogg song as a tribute to a boy who died in a road accident. She was sentenced to an eight week community order, along with an eight-week curfew. She was also ordered to pay costs of £500 and an £85 victim surcharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-43816921|title=Woman guilty of 'racist' Snap Dogg rap lyric Instagram post|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/woman-who-posted-rap-lyrics-14543694|title=Woman who posted rap lyrics as tribute on Instagram guilty of sending offensive message|work=Liverpool Echo|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2018: A severely depressed GP who believed he had been wrongly advised about his NHS pension in 2012 and lost a 6 figure sum of money, had subsequently been very distressed with suicidal thoughts for 5 years and was convicted of malicious communication for implied threat of suicidal self harm, when he first tried to phone the Financial Advisor in 2017 to try and speak to him for an explanation. He was ordered to pay costs of £1500, fined £6000 and banned from further contacting the company. There was no harm or anxiety reported from this contact by the financial advisor.

== History ==

Modern hostage negotiation principles were established in 1972 when then-[[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Detective [[Harvey Schlossberg]], also a psychologist, recognized the need for trained personnel in crisis intervention. Schlossberg had worked on the [[David Berkowitz]] ("Son of Sam") case, and had instituted other psychological principles in police work, including [[psychological screening]] of police applicants and the use of [[hypnosis]] in suspect/witness interviews.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The first Hostage Negotiation Teams (HNTs) were often created as elements of Special Weapons and Tactics ([[SWAT]]) Teams and merely created a diversion while SWAT deployed. In modern usage, while sometimes acting independently, hostage negotiation teams are often deployed in conjunction with SWAT.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The [[FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit]] (which developed the Behavioral Change Stairway Model&lt;ref name=vecchi&gt;Crisis (hostage) negotiation: current strategies and issues in high-risk conflict resolution, Gregory M. Vecchi 'et al', http://negotiationconcepts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Crisis-Hostage-Negotiation-Current-Strategies-and-Issues-in-High-Risk-Conflict-Resolution.pdf,{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 2003&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Singapore Police Force Crisis Negotiation Unit]] are examples of specialized units trained in these techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Greenstone, J.L.(2005).

Currently under Taylor and Francis Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral Change Stairway Model==

One specific model developed by the FBI is the Behavioral Change Stairway Model.  Police negotiators that follow this model work through the following stages in order&lt;ref name=vecchi/&gt;

# '''Active Listening''': Understand the psychology of the perpetrator and let them know they are being listened to.
# '''Empathy''': Understand their issues and how they feel.
# '''Rapport''': When they begin to see how the negotiator feels, they are building trust.
# '''Influence''': Only once trust has been gained can solutions to their problem be recommended.
# '''Behavioral Change''': They act, and maybe surrender.

It is considered to be important to work through these steps in order, and not to try to effect behavioral change before rapport has been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= "Talk To Me": What It Takes To Be An NYPD Hostage Negotiator

{{Economic systems sidebar|By coordination}}
{{Libertarian socialism|Economics}}

A '''decentralized-planned economy''' or '''decentrally-planned economy''' (occasionally '''[[Horizontalidad|horizontally]]-planned economy''') is a type of [[economic system]] based on [[Decentralization|decentralized]] [[economic planning]], in which decision-making is distributed amongst various economic agents or localized within production units. Decentralized planning is held in contrast to [[centralized planning]] where economic information is aggregated and used to formulate a plan for production, investment and resource allocation by a central authority. Decentralised planning can take shape both in the context of a [[mixed economy]] as well as in a [[Post-capitalism|post-capitalist]]  economic system.

This usually implies some form of democratic decision-making within the economy or within firms in the form of [[economic democracy]] or [[industrial democracy]]. Alternatively, computer-based or computer-managed forms of decentralized coordination between economic enterprises have been proposed by various economists and computer scientists.{{citation needed|reason=for instance?|date=March 2016}}

Recent proposals for decentralized-economic planning have used the term "[[Participatory economics|participatory planning]]" to highlight the cooperative and democratic character of this system and to contrast it with centralized planning associated with the former [[Soviet Union]]. Proponents present decentralized and participatory economic planning as an alternative to [[market socialism]] for a post-capitalist society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.umass.edu/dmkotz/What_Ec_Struc_Soc_08_03.pdf |title='&amp;#39;What economic structure for socialism?'&amp;#39;, by Kotz, David. 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decentralized-planning has been proposed as a basis for [[socialism]] and has been advocated by [[democratic socialist]]s and [[anarchists]] who advocate a non-market form of socialism while rejecting [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet-type central planning]]. Some writers (e.g. Robin Cox) have argued that decentralised planning allows for a spontaneously self-regulating system of stock control (relying solely on calculation in kind) to come about and that in turn decisively overcomes the objections raised by the economic calculation argument that any large scale economy must necessarily resort to a system of market prices.&lt;ref&gt;Schweickart, David. [http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm  ''Democratic Socialism'']. Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice (2006): "Virtually all (democratic) socialists have distanced themselves from the economic model long synonymous with 'socialism,' i.e. the Soviet model of a non-market, centrally-planned economy...Some have endorsed the concept of 'market socialism,' a post-capitalist economy that retains market competition, but socializes the means of production, and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace. Some hold out for a non-market, participatory economy.  All democratic socialists agree on the need for a democratic alternative to capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==

===Cybernetics===
The use of computers to coordinate production in an optimal fashion has been proposed for socialist economies. The economist [[Oskar Lange]] argued that the computer is more efficient than the market process at solving the multitude of simultaneous equations required for allocating economic inputs efficiently (either in terms of physical quantities or monetary prices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calculemus.org/lect/L-I-MNS/12/ekon-i-modele/lange-comp-market.htm |title="The Computer and the market", Lange, Oskar. Retrieved March 16, 2011 |publisher=Calculemus.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970 Chilean computer-controlled planned economy [[Project Cybersyn]] was pioneered by [[Salvador Allende]]'s socialist government in an attempt to move towards decentralised economic planning with the [[Viable system model|experimental viable system model]] of computed organisational structure of autonomous operative units though an [[algedonic feedback|algedonic feedback setting]] and bottom-up participatory decision-making by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110512062330/http://www.cybersyn.cl:80/ingles/cybersyn/cyberfolk.html Cyberfolk] component.

===Negotiated coordination===
Economist [[Pat Devine]] has created a model of decentralized economic planning called "negotiated coordination", which is based upon social ownership by those affected by the use of the assets involved, with decisions made by those at the most localised level of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gesd.free.fr/devine.pdf |title=Participatory Planning Through Negotiated Coordination |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participatory Planning===
{{See also|Parecon}}
The planning structure of a decentralized planned economy is generally based on a consumers council and producer council (or jointly, a distributive cooperative), which is sometimes called a [[consumers' cooperative]]. Producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. This structure is central to [[participatory economics]], [[guild socialism]] and [[Anarchist economics|economic theories]] related to [[social anarchism|anarchism]].

==Similar concepts in practice==

===Decentralised planning in Kerala (India)===
{{Main|People's Planning in Kerala}}
{{See also|District planning in India}}
Some decentralised participation in economic planning has been implemented in various regions and states in India, most notably in [[People's Planning in Kerala|Kerala]]. Local level planning agencies assess the needs of people who are able to give their direct input through the Gram Sabhas (village-based institutions) and the planners subsequently seek to plan accordingly.

===Community participatory planning===
{{Main|Participatory planning}}
The United Nations has developed local projects that promote participatory planning on a community level. Members of communities take decisions regarding [[community development]] directly.

Decentralised planning has been a feature of [[socialist]] and [[anarchist economics]]. Variations of decentralized planning include [[participatory economics]], [[economic democracy]] and [[industrial democracy]] and have been promoted by various political groups, most notably [[libertarian socialist]]s, [[guild socialism|guild socialists]], [[Libertarian Marxism|Libertarian Marxists]], [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]&lt;ref&gt;''Writings, 1932–33'' p. 96, Leon Trotsky.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[anarchist]]s and [[democratic socialist]]s.

During the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], some areas where anarchist and libertarian socialist influence through the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] was extensive, particularly rural regions, were run on the basis of decentralised planning resembling the principles laid out by [[Diego Abad de Santillan]] in the book ''After the Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://membres.multimania.fr/anarchives/site/syndic/aftertherevolution.htm#local |title=After the Revolution |publisher=Membres.multimania.fr |date=1936-01-07 |accessdate=2012-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829175011/http://membres.multimania.fr/anarchives/site/syndic/aftertherevolution.htm |archivedate=2012-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department for Business, Innovation and Skills''' ('''BIS''') was a [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|ministerial department of the United Kingdom Government]] created on 5 June 2009 by the merger of the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] (DIUS) and the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] (BERR). It was disbanded on the creation of the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] on 14 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19525 Prime Minister's Office: Changes to the machinery of Government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608051333/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19525 |date=8 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the department's dissolution, it no longer has ministers responsible.&lt;ref name="cabinetoffice1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills#ministers |title=Department for Business, Innovation and Skills |publisher=www.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Permanent Secretary]] was [[Martin Donnelly (UK civil servant)|Sir Martin Donnelly]].

==Responsibilities==
Some policies apply to [[England]] alone due to [[devolution]], while others are not devolved and therefore apply to other nations of the [[United Kingdom]]. The department was responsible for [[United Kingdom Government|UK Government]] policy in the following areas:&lt;ref name="cabinetoffice1"/&gt;
* [[business]] regulation and support
* [[company law]]
* [[Competition (economics)|competition]]
* [[consumer affairs]]
* [[corporate governance]]
* [[employment relations]]
* [[export]] licensing
* [[further education]]
* [[higher education]]
* [[innovation]]
* [[insolvency]]
* [[intellectual property]]
* [[outer space]]
* [[post office|postal]] affairs
* regional and local [[economic development]]
* [[science]] and [[research]]
* [[skills]]
* [[trade]]
* [[training]]

==Devolution==
Economic policy is mostly devolved but several important policy areas are reserved to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]].  Further and higher education policy is mostly devolved.  [[Reserved and excepted matters]] are outlined below.

'''Scotland'''

Reserved matters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_14#sch5-pt2 |title=Scotland Act 1998, Schedule 5, Part II |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Please respect alphabetical order--&gt;
* [[Competition law|Competition]]
* [[Consumer protection|Customer protection]]
* [[Customs|Import and export control]]
* [[Insolvency]]

* [[Outer space]]
* [[Postal services]]
* Product standards, safety and liability

* [[outer space]]

The department's main counterparts are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/sr/sr1999/19990481.htm |title=Departments (Transfer and Assignment of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1999 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2012-10-05 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] (general economic policy)
*[[Department for Employment and Learning]] (employment relations, further and higher education policy)

'''Wales'''

A '''federal republic''' is a [[federation]] of [[federated state|states]] with a [[republic]]an form of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=republic|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: "a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen".

In a federal republic, there is a [[division of powers]] between the federal government, and the government of the individual subdivisions. While each federal republic manages this division of powers differently, common matters relating to security and defence, and monetary policy are usually handled at the federal level, while matters such as infrastructure maintenance and education policy are usually handled at the regional or local level.  However, views differ on what issues should be a federal competence, and subdivisions usually have sovereignty in some matters where the federal government does not have jurisdiction. A federal republic is thus best defined in contrast to a [[unitary republic]], whereby the central government has complete sovereignty over all aspects of political life.  This more decentralized structure helps to explain the tendency for more populous countries to operate as federal republics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forum of Federations]]: [http://www.forumfed.org/libdocs/FedCountries/FC-USA.pdf], Schram, Sanford. Handbook of Federal Countries: United States, pg 373–391, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Most federal republics codify the division of powers between orders of government in a written [[constitution| constitutional document]].

The political differences between a federal republic and other [[Federation|federal states]], especially [[federal monarchy|federal monarchies]] under a [[parliamentary system]] of government, are largely a matter of legal form rather than political substance, as most federal states are democratic in structure if not practice with [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]]. However, some federal monarchies, such as the [[United Arab Emirates]] are based upon principles other than democracy.

'''The Germantown Colony and Museum''' is an [[historical preservation]] project north of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] in [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]] in northwestern [[Louisiana]], USA. It was among three sites in Louisiana founded by former members of the [[Utopia]]n Movement called the [[Harmony Society]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=brochure&gt;Brochure, Germantown Colony Museum, 200 Museum Road, Minden, Louisiana 71055&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==

The original colonists came from [[Germany]], having first settled in [[Harmony, Pennsylvania|Harmony]], [[Pennsylvania]], in 1803, then in [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], [[Indiana]] in 1814, and finally in 1825 in [[Old Economy Village|Economy]] (now [[Ambridge, Pennsylvania|Ambridge]], Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

About 250 former members of the Harmony Society, many of whom left Economy, Pennsylvania, during 1832, decided to leave because of disagreements over the society's custom of [[celibacy]]. They followed a visionary named [[Bernhard Müller]], who called himself "Count de Leon". The Count called upon all the heads of Europe to relinquish their crowns in a "new world to come."&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Paul Campbell, "Germantown historical marker to be unveiled by Gov. Kennon Tuesday", ''Minden Press'', October 7, 1954, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Philadelphian Congregation, established by the New Philadelphia Society, planted its first colony in 1832 at [[Phillipsburg (town), Pennsylvania|Phillipsburg]] (now [[Monaca, Pennsylvania|Monaca]]), Pennsylvania. Perhaps because of ongoing litigation, and other financial problems, Müller's group decided to sell their [[Commune (intentional community)|communal]] land in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1833. Some community members stayed, while others followed Müller and his family down the [[Ohio River]] on a [[flatboat]].  Soon they started again at [[Grand Ecore, Louisiana|Grand Ecore]], twelve miles north of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], Louisiana. There Müller died and was interred in [[Natchitoches Parish]]. When the Count died, a congressman 
obtained passage of a bill donating a tract of land to the colonists and to [[Countess Leon]], the Count's widow. The roots of the Germantown Colony were hence established.&lt;ref&gt;"Minden Germantown Colony", ''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]'', August 14, 1987 [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AD&amp;p_theme=ad&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4747F61B2022E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MVI 2585 Kitchen at Germantown Museum.jpg|right|thumb|Kitchen at Germantown Museum]]

==The Countess takes charge==

In 1835, the group, then led by Müller's widow, the Countess, settled seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of Minden in what was then [[Claiborne Parish, Louisiana|Claiborne Parish]].&lt;ref name=mpress&gt;David James, III, "Germantown: Once Thriving and Socialistic", ''Minden Press'', July 7, 1958, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly four decades, the colony operated on a [[Commune (intentional community)|communal]] basis until it dispersed in 1871, when Webster Parish was created from Claiborne Parish.&lt;ref&gt;"Respect for the Past, Confidence in the Future", Webster Parish Centennial, 1871-1971, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; The Countess then moved to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], where she died in 1881.&lt;ref name=mpress/&gt;

One of three [[Utopia]]n Society settlements in this area, the Germantown Colony, located off Louisiana Highway 531, was the most successful and lasted the longest, having peaked at fifty to sixty pioneers but usually with fewer than forty followers. The settlement had  been planned by the Countess' husband, who died on August 29, 1834, of [[yellow fever]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Louisiana Historical Association]] in its ''Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'' attributes the cause of death as [[cholera]].&lt;/ref&gt; at Grand Ecore near Natchitoches, before he ever reached the intended Webster Parish.&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

Leon and his followers attempted to build an earthly utopia, [[socialism|socialist]] in practice, while awaiting for the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. For his religious views, Leon had been exiled from Germany. He intended to plant the settlement in Webster Parish to coincide with the [[latitude]] of [[Jerusalem]], 31 degrees, 47 minutes. The colonists worshiped under [[oak]] trees at the center of the colony. They supported themselves from farming, with a concentration on cotton.&lt;ref name=mpress/&gt; According to the Louisiana historian [[Marietta LeBreton]] of [[Northwestern State University]], there was also navigation nearby on the lower [[Dorcheat Bayou]] from [[Lake Bistineau]] to Minden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6a-9ZHqz8oC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=dorcheat+bayoiu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DtJOfecT_k&amp;sig=kMu3l8r5zzp5ggx6hYxuAuvqeAo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5NuRSuCxNZeQtger88DOBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Marietta LeBreton, "Bayou Dorcheat" in ''The Rivers and Bayous of Louisiana'' by Edwin Adams Davis|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minden, LA MVI 2584 Guide at Germantown Museum.jpg|right|thumb|Guide Amanda Steiner, a descendant of the Krouses, at Germantown Museum]]
The colony thereaftrer was maintained by members of the Krouse family, including Dr. Francis Otto Krouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=gladys-krouse-mobley&amp;pid=163780233#fbLoggedOut|title=Gladys Letitia Krouse Mobley (1920-2013)|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]''|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1973, Krouse descendants, including Chester Phillip Krouse (1899–1981) and his sister, Ruby Florence Krouse (1906–2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; donated an acre of land to the Webster Parish Police Jury, equivalent to [[county commission]] in other states. Three of the original buildings, the Countess’ cabin, the kitchen-dining hall, and the Dr. Goentgen cottage, survive at the site. The [[general store]] no longer exists. Replicas have been constructed of the [[smokehouse]] and the [[blacksmith]] shop. The buildings contain items used by the early settlers. There is also a [[sugar cane]] press outside. Some of the original wallpaper remains in the large room of the Countess' cottage, paper which she had ordered from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] to cover the rough walls. A refined woman, the Countess gave [[piano]] instruction to girls and young women in her cottage.&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

[[File:MVI 2600 Germantown Cemeter.jpg|right|thumb|Historic Germantown Cemetery]]
The small Germantown Cemetery at the site holds the remains of many of the settlers. Tombstone information reveals that a number were born in Germany. In some cases, the cause of death is listed on the markers.&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

==Establishment of the museum==

In 1954, then [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Robert F. Kennon]] unveiled a still standing historical marker of the Germantown Colony. The sign is located at the intersections of Broadway, Elm, and East and West streets, across from the Webster Parish Library.&lt;ref&gt;"Governor to unveil historical marker here", ''Minden Press'', September 30, 1954, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Germantown Museum did not open to the public until May 10, 1975, with then former Governor Kennon, a Webster Parish native and a descendant of Germantown colonists, in attendance for the observation.&lt;ref&gt;"Ceremonies formally open Germantown", May 12, 1975, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the colony was placed on the list of the "Cultural Resources Worthy of Preservation" by the [[United States Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;  As ''Germantown'', the village was listed in 1979 on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

In 2008, the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] under Act 847 declared it appropriate for the state to operate the Germantown Colony and Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.louisiana.gov/tabid/700/Default.aspx |title=Germantown Colony Museum |accessdate=August 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618145521/http://www.sos.louisiana.gov/tabid/700/Default.aspx |archivedate=June 18, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2009, the museum switched from parish to state control. Museum hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday through Saturday. A [[Bluegrass music]] festival is held annually the last Saturday of September. The facility is closed during the winter. There is no admission.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Amanda Steiner, Germantown Colony guide, August 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Germantown Colony is featured in two 1977 articles in the publication ''[[North Louisiana History]]'', based in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. Pauline Jennings penned "Elisa Leone: First Lady of the Germantown Colony," in Vol. 8, No.2 (Winter 1977), pp.&amp;nbsp;43–51. Rita Moore Krouse wrote "The Germantown Store" in the same edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;53–64.

The Germantown Colony Museum temporarily closed on June 3, 2013, for the construction of a new visitors center in the [[Dogtrot house|dogtrot]] style of architecture. The visitors center, which cost $512,000, opened to the public in November 2014. It provides a climate-controlled area to display more than a hundred artifacts used by the settlers. The renovation includes restrooms and new office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press-herald.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6483:germantown-colony-to-be-closed-while-center-is-built&amp;catid=34:local-news&amp;Itemid=69|title=Melissa Harris, "Germantown Colony to be closed while center is built"|publisher=''Minden Press-Herald''|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kakent/&gt;

The museum director is former [[Louisiana House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Jean Doerge]] of Minden. She had worked in 2008 to secure funding for the building. Webster Parish raised more than $60,000 in contributions and in-kind donations of plumbing and electrical fixtures. Germantown Colony and Museum is the last museum to have been added to the state system. "We are telling a part of history that's almost been lost. We're opening that up to not only adults but children as well," said Doerge.&lt;ref name=kakent&gt;Kate Archer Kent, "Germantown Colony Museum reopens in Minden, 1800s artifacts preserved", mediad.publicbroadcasting.net, November 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After all the renovation was completed, the museum fell victim to mid-year budget cuts required by Governor [[Bobby Jindal]]. Beginning April 13, 2015, the museum became open to the public only on Saturdays, instead of the former three-day a week schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-herald.com/germantown-colony-museum-part-of-budget-cuts/|title=Germantown Colony Museum part of budget cuts|author=Bonnie Culverhouse|publisher=''Minden Press-Herald''|date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related Webster Parish history is also featured in the [[Dorcheat Historical Association Museum]] in  Minden. Contact information for the Germantown Museum is listed on the website of [[Louisiana Secretary of State]] [[Tom Schedler]]: http://www.sos.la.gov/tabid/700/Default.aspx In 2013, the colony was highlighted as an historic site on the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Maps website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press-herald.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6467:germantown-colony-gaining-national-attention&amp;catid=34:local-news&amp;Itemid=69|title=Melissa Harris, "Germantown Colony gaining national attention|publisher=''[[Minden Press-Herald]]''|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne Waddell]], a former state representative from [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] who is an administrator for Secretary of State Tom Schedler, said that funding for the museum is secure for the 2016–2017 years, despite the questionable condition of the overall state budget. Waddell said that Schedler will continue, where possible, to transfer facilities such as Germantown Colony and Museum, to the local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-herald.com/germantown-museum-continue-funded-state/|title=Germantown Colony Museum to continue to be funded by state|author=Michelle Bates|date=April 26, 2016|publisher=''Minden Press-Herald''|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31116">'''Infection control''' is the discipline concerned with preventing [[nosocomial infection|nosocomial]] or healthcare-associated infection, a practical (rather than academic) sub-discipline of [[epidemiology]].  It is an essential, though often underrecognized and undersupported, part of the infrastructure of health care. Infection control and hospital epidemiology are akin to [[public health]] practice, practiced within the confines of a particular health-care delivery system rather than directed at society as a whole. Anti-infective agents include [[antibiotics]], [[antibacterials]], [[antifungals]], [[antivirals]] and [[antiprotozoals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/anti-infectives.html|title=Anti-infectives|publisher=[[Drugs.com]]| accessdate =27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infection control addresses factors related to the spread of infections within the healthcare setting (whether patient-to-patient, from patients to staff and from staff to patients, or among-staff), including prevention (via hand hygiene/hand washing, cleaning/disinfection/sterilization, vaccination, surveillance), monitoring/investigation of demonstrated or suspected spread of infection within a particular health-care setting (surveillance and outbreak investigation), and management (interruption of outbreaks).  It is on this basis that the common title being adopted within health care is "infection prevention and control."

==Infection control in healthcare facilities==
[[Aseptic technique]] is a key component of all invasive medical procedures.  Similarly, infection control measures are most effective when Standard Precautions (health care) are applied because undiagnosed infection is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korniewicz, Ph.D, RN, FAAN|first1=Denise M.|title=Infection Control for Advanced Practice Professionals|date=1 January 2014|publisher=DEStech Publications, Inc|location=Lancaster PA|isbn=978-1-60595-060-0|pages=264|edition=1st|url=http://www.destechpub.com/links/catalogs/bookstore/nursing-and-health-science-4/infection-control-for-advanced-practice-professionals/|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand hygiene ===
Independent studies by [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] in 1846 in [[Vienna]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] in 1843 in [[Boston]] established a link between the hands of health care workers and the spread of [[Nosocomial infection|hospital-acquired]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5116a1.htm |journal=MMWR |title=CDC Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) state that “It is well documented that the most important measure for preventing the spread of pathogens is effective handwashing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/cruiselines/hand_hygiene_general.htm |publisher=CDC |title=General information on Hand Hygiene}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the developed world, [[Hand washing#Medical hand washing|hand washing]] is mandatory in most health care settings and required by many different regulators.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In the United States, OSHA standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10051 |title=Bloodborne Pathogens Regulations 1910.1030 |publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; require that employers must provide readily accessible hand washing facilities, and must ensure that employees wash hands and any other skin with soap and water or flush mucous membranes with water as soon as feasible after contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM).

In the UK healthcare professionals have adopted the 'Ayliffe Technique', based on the 6 step method developed by [[Graham Ayliffe]], JR Babb and  AH Quoraishi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy for Hand Hygiene Infection Prevention and Control Policy No. 2|url=http://www.wirralct.nhs.uk/attachments/article/25/IPC2Handhygienepolicyv2020812.pdf|website=Wirral.nhs.uk|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process.  In November 2008, a non-peer-reviewed&lt;ref&gt;According to p. 35 of the Redway/Fawdar presentation, "Note: this study has not been peer reviewed but it is intended that the test methods described in this document are provided in sufficient detail to allow
replication by those who wish to confirm the results."&lt;/ref&gt; study was presented to the European Tissue Symposium by the [[University of Westminster]], London, comparing the bacteria levels present after the use of [[paper towel]]s, warm air hand dryers, and modern jet-air hand dryers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090402-2008%20WUS%20Westminster%20University%20hygiene%20study,%20nov2008.pdf | work=Table 4| page=13 | title=A comparative study of three different hand drying methods: paper towel, warm air dryer, jet air dryer’| author=Keith Redway and Shameem Fawdar (School of Biosciences, University of Westminster London) |date=November 2008| publisher=European Tissue Symposium|accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of those three methods, only paper towels reduced the total number of bacteria on hands, with "through-air dried" towels the most effective.

The presenters also carried out tests to establish whether there was the potential for cross-contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying method. They found that:

* the jet air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of 400&amp;nbsp;mph, was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment '''up to 2 metres away'''
* use of a warm air hand dryer spread micro-organisms '''up to 0.25 metres''' from the dryer
* paper towels showed '''no significant spread''' of micro-organisms.

In 2005, in a study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=TÜV Produkt und Umwelt |url=http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf |title=Report No. 425-452006 concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands |date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:

===Sterilization===
Sterilization is a process intended to kill all microorganisms and is the highest level of microbial kill that is possible. Sterilizers may be heat only, steam, or liquid chemical.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Chris H. |title=Infection control and management of hazardous materials for the dental team |edition=4th |publisher=Mosby Elsevier Health Science |year=2010 |chapter=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Effectiveness of the sterilizer (e.g., a steam autoclave) is determined in three ways.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;
First, mechanical indicators and gauges on the machine itself indicate proper operation of the machine. Second heat sensitive indicators or tape on the sterilizing bags change color which indicate proper levels of heat or steam. And, third (most importantly) is biological testing in which a microorganism that is highly heat and chemical resistant (often the bacterial endospore) is selected as the standard challenge. If the process kills this microorganism, the sterilizer is considered to be effective.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;

Sterilization, if performed properly, is an effective way of preventing [[bacteria]] from spreading. It should be used for the cleaning of the medical instruments or [[gloves]], and basically any type of medical item that comes into contact with the [[blood stream]] and sterile tissues.

There are four main ways in which such items can be sterilized: [[autoclave]] (by using high-pressure [[steam]]), dry [[heat]] (in an oven), by using chemical sterilants such as glutaraldehydes or [[formaldehyde]] solutions or by [[radiation]] (with the help of physical agents). The first two are the most used methods of sterilizations mainly because of their accessibility and availability. Steam sterilization is one of the most effective types of sterilizations, if done correctly which is often hard to achieve. Instruments that are used in [[health care facilities]] are usually sterilized with this method. The general rule in this case is that in order to perform an effective sterilization, the steam must get into contact with all the surfaces that are meant to be disinfected. On the other hand, dry heat sterilization, which is performed with the help of an oven, is also an accessible type of sterilization, although it can only be used to disinfect instruments that are made of [[metal]] or [[glass]]. The very high [[temperatures]] needed to perform sterilization in this way are able to melt the instruments that are not made of glass or metal.

Steam sterilization is done at a temperature of 121 C (250 F) with a pressure of 209 kPa (15&amp;nbsp;lbs/in2). In these conditions, rubber items must be sterilized for 20 minutes, and wrapped items 134 C with pressure of 310 kPa for 7 minutes. The time is counted once the temperature that is needed has been reached. Steam sterilization requires four conditions in order to be efficient: adequate contact, sufficiently high temperature, correct time and sufficient [[moisture]].&lt;ref name="Sterilization"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/4morerh/4ip/IP_manual/11_Sterilization.pdf |title=Sterilization |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization using steam can also be done at a temperature of 132 C (270 F), at a double pressure. Dry heat sterilization is performed at 170 C (340 F) for one hour or two hours at a temperature of 160 C (320 F). Dry heat sterilization can also be performed at 121 C, for at least 16 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |title=Eliminating microbes |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724144955/http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical sterilization, also referred to as cold sterilization, can be used to sterilize instruments that cannot normally be disinfected through the other two processes described above. The items sterilized with cold sterilization are usually those that can be damaged by regular sterilization. Commonly, glutaraldehydes and formaldehyde are used in this process, but in different ways. When using the first type of disinfectant, the instruments are soaked in a 2-4% solution for at least 10 hours while a solution of 8% formaldehyde will sterilize the items in 24 hours or more. Chemical sterilization is generally more expensive than steam sterilization and therefore it is used for instruments that cannot be disinfected otherwise. After the instruments have been soaked in the chemical solutions, they are mandatory to be rinsed with sterile water which will remove the residues from the [[disinfectants]]. This is the reason why [[Hypodermic needle|needles]] and [[syringes]] are not sterilized in this way, as the residues left by the chemical solution that has been used to disinfect them cannot be washed off with [[water]] and they may interfere with the administered treatment. Although formaldehyde is less expensive than glutaraldehydes, it is also more irritating to the [[Human eyes|eyes]], [[Human skin|skin]] and [[respiratory tract]] and is classified as a potential [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref name="Sterilization"/&gt;

Other sterilization methods exist, though their efficiency is still controversial. These methods include [[gas]], UV, [[gas plasma]], and chemical sterilization with agents such as [[peroxyacetic acid]] or [[paraformaldehyde]].

===Cleaning===
Infections can be prevented from occurring in homes as well. In order to reduce their chances to contract an infection, individuals are recommended to maintain a good hygiene by washing their hands after every contact with questionable areas or bodily fluids and by disposing of [[waste|garbage]] at regular intervals to prevent [[Microorganism|germs]] from growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preventinginfection.com/ |title=Preventing infections adequately |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disinfection===
Disinfection uses liquid chemicals on surfaces and at room temperature to kill disease causing microorganisms. Ultraviolet light has also been used to disinfect the rooms of patients infected with ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'' after discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/performance-feedback-ultraviolet-cleaning-device-and-dedicated-housekeeping-team |title=Performance feedback, ultraviolet cleaning device, and dedicated housekeeping team significantly improve room cleaning, reduce potential for spread of common, dangerous infection |date=2014-01-15 | accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disinfection is less effective than sterilization because it does not kill bacterial endospores.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;

===Personal protective equipment===
[[File:Disp-med-ppe.jpg|thumb|120px|Disposable PPE]]
[[Personal protective equipment|Personal protective equipment (PPE)]] is specialized clothing or equipment worn by a worker for protection against a hazard. The hazard in a health care setting is exposure to blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids or aerosols that may carry infectious materials such as [[Hepatitis C]], [[HIV]], or other blood borne or bodily fluid [[pathogen]]. PPE prevents contact with a potentially infectious material by creating a physical barrier between the potential infectious material and the healthcare worker.

The United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) requires the use of [[Personal protective equipment|Personal protective equipment (PPE)]] by workers to guard against blood borne pathogens if there is a reasonably anticipated exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10051#1910.1030(d)(2)(i) |publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] |title=Bloodborne Pathogens Regulations |at=1910.1030(d)(2)(i)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Components of PPE include [[Medical gloves|gloves]], [[Hospital gown|gowns]], bonnets, shoe covers, [[face shield]]s, [[CPR mask]]s, [[goggles]], [[surgical mask]]s, and respirators. How many components are used and how the components are used is often determined by regulations or the infection control protocol of the facility in question. Many or most of these items are [[disposable]] to avoid carrying infectious materials from one patient to another patient and to avoid difficult or costly [[disinfection]]. In the US, OSHA requires the immediate removal and disinfection or disposal of a worker's PPE prior to leaving the work area where exposure to infectious material took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10051#1910.1030(d)(2)(i) |publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] |title=Bloodborne Pathogens Regulations |at=1910.1030(d)(3)(vii)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The inappropriate use of PPE equipment such as gloves, has been linked to an increase in rates of the transmission of infection &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/infection-control/does-glove-use-increase-the-risk-of-infection/5074976.article&lt;/ref&gt;, and the use of such must be compatible with the other particular hand hygiene agents used. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/hand-hygiene/hand-hygiene-and-glove-issues&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antimicrobial surfaces===
[[Microorganisms]] are known to survive on non-antimicrobial in animate ‘touch’ surfaces (e.g., bedrails, over-the-bed trays, call buttons, bathroom hardware, etc.) for extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wilks SA |author2=Michels H |author3=Keevil CW |year=2005 |title=The survival of Escherichia coli O157 on a range of metal surfaces |journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=445–454 |pmid=16253366 |doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.04.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michels HT |title=Anti-microbial characteristics of copper |journal=ASTM Standardization News |date=October 2006 |pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be especially troublesome in hospital environments where patients with [[immunodeficiencies]] are at enhanced risk for contracting nosocomial infections.

{{main|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}

Products made with [[Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces|antimicrobial copper alloy]] ([[brass]]es, [[bronze]]s, [[cupronickel]], copper-nickel-zinc, and others) surfaces destroy a wide range of microorganisms in a short period of time.&lt;ref name="Copper Touch Surfaces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/antimicrobial/bacteria/index.html |title=Copper touch surfaces |publisher=coppertouchsurfaces.org}}{{medrs|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has approved the registration of 355 different [[Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces|antimicrobial copper alloys]] and one synthetic copper-infused hard surface that kill ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' O157:H7, [[methicillin]]-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]), ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''Enterobacter aerogenes,'' and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' in less than 2 hours of contact. Other investigations have demonstrated the efficacy of antimicrobial copper alloys to destroy 
''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'', [[influenza A virus]], [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]], and [[Fungus|fungi]].&lt;ref name="Copper Touch Surfaces"/&gt; As a public hygienic measure in addition to regular cleaning, [[Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces|antimicrobial copper alloys]] are being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K., Ireland, Japan, Korea, France, Denmark, and Brazil. The synthetic hard surface is being installed in the United States as well as in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://insidebiz.com/news/sentara-leighs-new-copper-infused-surfaces-kill-bacteria-said-be-worlds-largest-clinical-trial |work=Inside Business |title=Sentara Leigh's new copper-infused surfaces that kill bacteria said to be world's largest clinical trial |date=6 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaccination of health care workers==
Health care workers may be exposed to certain infections in the course of their work.  [[Vaccine]]s are available to provide some protection to workers in a healthcare setting. Depending on regulation, recommendation, the specific work function, or personal preference, healthcare workers or first responders may receive vaccinations for [[Hepatitis B#Prevention|hepatitis B]]; [[Influenza vaccine|influenza]]; [[MMR vaccine|measles, mumps and rubella]]; [[TDaP|Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis]]; [[Neisseria meningitidis#Vaccines|N. meningitidis]]; and [[Varicella vaccine|varicella]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/node.do/id/0900f3ec8005df1f CDC Vaccine Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveillance for infections==

{{main|Disease surveillance}}

Surveillance is the act of infection investigation using the CDC definitions.  Determining the presence of a hospital acquired  infection requires an infection control practitioner (ICP) to review a patient's chart and see if the patient had the signs and symptom of an infection. Surveillance definitions exist for infections of the bloodstream, urinary tract, pneumonia,surgical sites and gastroenteritis.

Surveillance traditionally involved significant manual data assessment and entry in order to assess preventative actions such as isolation of patients with an infectious disease. Increasingly, computerized software solutions are becoming available that assess incoming risk messages from microbiology and other online sources. By reducing the need for data entry, software can reduce the data workload of ICPs, freeing them to concentrate on clinical surveillance.

As of 1998, approximately one third of healthcare acquired infections were preventable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/3/98-0320 |publisher=CDC |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=September 1998 |author=Weinstein RA |title=Nosocomial Infection Update | doi = 10.3201/eid0403.980320 |pages=416–420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance and preventative activities are increasingly a priority for hospital staff. The ''Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control'' (SENIC) project by the U.S. CDC found in the 1970s that hospitals reduced their nosocomial infection rates by approximately 32 per cent by focusing on surveillance activities and prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/7/2/pdfs/70-0170.pdf |publisher=CDC |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=7 |issue=2 |title=Infection Control and Changing Health-Care Delivery Systems |author=Jarvis WR |date=March–April 2001 |pmid=11294699|doi=10.3201/eid0702.700170 |pages=170–3 |pmc=2631740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isolation and quarantine==

{{main|Isolation (health care)}}

In the health care context, medical isolation refers to various physical measures taken to interrupt [[nosocomial]] spread of contagious diseases. Various forms of isolation exist, and are applied depending on the type of infection and agent involved, to address the likelihood of spread via airborne particles or droplets, by direct skin contact, or via contact with body fluids.

In cases where infection is merely suspected, individuals may be [[quarantined]] until the incubation period has passed and the disease manifests itself or the person remains healthy. Groups may undergo quarantine, or in the case of communities, a [[cordon sanitaire]] may be imposed to prevent infection from spreading beyond the community, or in the case of [[protective sequestration]], into a community. Public health authorities may implement other forms of [[social distancing]], such as school closings, to control an epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/integrity/phethics/docs/panflu_ethic_guidelines.pdf Kathy Kinlaw, Robert Levine, "Ethical Guidelines on Pandemic Influenza," ''CDC'', December 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak investigation==
When an unusual cluster of illness is noted, infection control teams undertake an investigation to determine whether there is a true outbreak, a pseudo-outbreak (a result of contamination within the diagnostic testing process), or just random fluctuation in the frequency of illness.  If a true outbreak is discovered, infection control practitioners try to determine what permitted the outbreak to occur, and to rearrange the conditions to prevent ongoing propagation of the infection.  Often, breaches in good practice are responsible, although sometimes other factors (such as construction) may be the source of the problem.

Outbreaks investigations have more than a single purpose. These investigations are carried out in order to prevent additional cases in the current outbreak, prevent future outbreaks, learn about a new disease or learn something new about an old disease. Reassuring the public, minimizing the economic and social disruption as well as teaching [[epidemiology]] are some other obvious objectives of outbreak investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|title=Conducting an Outbreak Investigation|date=|accessdate=2010-07-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331173846/http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[WHO]], outbreak investigations are meant to detect what is causing the outbreak, how the pathogenic agent is transmitted, where it all started from, what is the carrier, what is the population at risk of getting infected and what are the risk factors.

The results of outbreak investigations are always made public in the means of a report in which the findings are communicated to the authorities, media, scientific community and so on. These reports are commonly used as pedagogical tools.

==Training in infection control and health care epidemiology==
Practitioners can come from several different educational streams. Many begin as nurses, some as medical technologists (particularly in clinical microbiology), and some as physicians (typically infectious disease specialists). Specialized training in infection control and health care epidemiology are offered by the professional organizations described below. Physicians who desire to become infection control practitioners often are trained in the context of an infectious disease fellowship.

In the United States, Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology is a private company that certifies infection control practitioners based on their educational background and professional experience, in conjunction with testing their knowledge base with standardized exams. The credential awarded is CIC, Certification in Infection Control and Epidemiology.  It is recommended that one has 2 years of Infection Control experience before applying for the exam.  Certification must be renewed every five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbic.org/about-cbic |publisher=Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology |title=About CBIC }} (official site)&lt;/ref&gt;

A course in hospital epidemiology (infection control in the hospital setting) is offered jointly each year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shea-online.org/Education.aspx |title=Education |publisher=Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712131147/http://www.shea-online.org/Education.aspx |archivedate=12 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} (official site)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19798">'''Integrated urban water management''' (IUWM) is a philosophy of varying definitions and interpretations. According to the authors of the book entitled, "Integrated Urban Water Management: Humid Tropics", IUWM is described as the practice of managing [[freshwater]], [[wastewater]], and [[storm water]] as components of a [[Drainage basin|basin-wide]] management plan. It builds on existing [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] considerations within an [[urban area|urban]] settlement by incorporating urban [[water management]] within the scope of the entire river basin.&lt;ref name="Tucci"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early champions of IUWM, SWITCH is a research program funded by the [[European Union]] and seeks to shift urban water management away from ad hoc solutions to a more integrated approach. IUWM within an urban water system can also be conducted by performance assessment of any new intervention strategies by developing a holistic approach which encompasses various system elements and criteria including [[sustainability]] type ones in which integration of water system components including [[water supply]], [[waste water]] and [[storm water]] subsystems would be advantageous.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Advantages of integrated and sustainability based assessment for metabolism based strategic planning of urban water systems|last = Behzadian|first = K|date = 2015|journal = Science of the Total Environment|doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.097|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kapelan|first2 = Z|volume = 527-528|pages = 220–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation of [[metabolism]] type flows in urban water system can also be useful for analysing processes in urban water cycle of IUWM.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Modelling metabolism based performance of an urban water system using WaterMet2|last = Behzadian|first = k|date = 2015|journal = Resources, Conservation and Recycling|doi = 10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.03.015|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kapelan|first2 = Z|volume = 99|pages = 84–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUWM is commonly seen as a strategy for achieving the goals of [[Water Sensitive Urban Design]]. IUWM seeks to change the impact of [[urban development]] on the natural [[water cycle]], based on the premise that by managing the urban water cycle as a whole; a more efficient use of resources can be achieved providing not only economic benefits but also improved social and environmental outcomes.  One approach is to establish an inner, urban, water cycle loop through the implementation of reuse strategies.  Developing this urban water cycle loop requires an understanding both of the natural, pre-development, water balance and the post-development water balance.  Accounting for flows in the pre- and post-development systems is an important step toward limiting urban impacts on the natural water cycle.&lt;ref name="CSRIO"/&gt;

==Components==

*Improve [[water supply]] and [[water consumption|consumption]] efficiency
*Upgrade [[drinking water]] [[water quality|quality]] and [[wastewater treatment]] {{Clarify|date=September 2009}}
*Increase economic efficiency of services to sustain operations and investments for water, wastewater, and stormwater management
*Utilize alternative [[water source]]s, including [[rainwater]], and [[reclaimed water|reclaimed]] and treated water
*Engage communities to reflect their needs and knowledge for [[water management]]
*Establish and implement policies and strategies to facilitate the above activities
*Support capacity development of personnel and institutions that are engaged in IUWM

According to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ([[CSIRO]]), IUWM requires the management of the urban water cycle in coordination with the hydrological water cycle which are significantly altered by urban landscapes and its correlation to increasing demand.  Under natural conditions the water inputs at any point in the system are precipitation and overland flows; while the outputs are via surface flows, evapo-transpiration and [[groundwater recharge]].  The large volumes of piped water introduced with the change to an urban setting and the introduction of vast impervious areas strongly impact the water balance, increasing in-flows and dramatically altering the out-flow components.&lt;ref name="CSRIO"&gt;{{cite web

==Approaches==
*The [[Agenda 21]] (UN Department for Sustainable Development, 1992) has worked out the [[Dublin Principles]] for Integrated water resources management in more detail for urban areas. One of the objectives of Agenda 21 is to develop environmentally sound management of water resources for urban use.&lt;ref name="Switch"/&gt;
*The Bellagio Statement formulated by the Environmental Sanitation Working Group of the [[Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council]] in 2000 include principals such as: Human dignity, quality of life, environmental security, an open stakeholder process, and many others.&lt;ref name="Switch"/&gt;
*The UNEP 3 Step Strategic Approach developed in 2005 is based on the application of the "Cleaner Production approach" that has been successful in the industrial sector. The three steps are: Prevention, Treatment for reuse, and Planned discharge with stimulation of self-purification capacity.&lt;ref name="Switch"/&gt;
*UNESCO's Institute for Water Education seeks to build on the progress made by the Bellagio Statement and UNEP's 3-step approach by developing the ''SWITCH'' approach to IUWM. Components include: the addition of a sustainability assessment, new methods of planning urban water systems, and modifications to planning and strategy development.&lt;ref name="Switch"/&gt;

==Examples==
{{Main|New York City water supply system}}
An example of IUWM is the [[:Category:Catskill/Delaware watersheds|Catskill/ Delaware water system]] that provides {{convert|1.4|e9USgal|m3}} of water per day, including to all of [[New York City]]. The IUWM process included an extensive [[stakeholder engagement]] process, whereby the needs of all parties were included into the final management plan. A partnership was created between New York City, the agricultural community, and the federal government. The case has become a model for successful IUWM.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web

== Grey water systems ==
{{See also|greywater}}

[[Greywater|Grey water]] (also written; greywater, gray water, or graywater) is water used with appliances that do not involve or encounter human waste.  It gets its name relative to black water which is heavily contaminated with human waste.  Different resources suggest what equipment produce grey or black water.  However, it is most commonly accepted that bathtubs, showers, washbasins, washing machines, and laundry tubs produce grey water, whereas toilets, sinks, and dishwashers are classified as black water sources.

In 1989 Santa Barbara became the first district in the United States to legalize the recycling and reuse of grey water. Since then, grey water has become a part of integrated urban water management.  It addresses the practice of managing wastewater at the residential scale. The premise of grey water reuse is the concept that the average household uses most of its water indoors (roughly 60%), meaning much of that water can be reused to provide for the water required to support irrigation.  Additionally, most domestic appliances automatically collect grey water in order for it to be disposed.

There are three types of grey water systems each of which has different requirements, codes, and sizing specifications. However, they share standards to meet health and safety regulations:

The Arizona R18-9-711. Type 1 [[Reclaimed water]] General Permit for Gray Water,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azdeq.gov/environ/water/permits/|title=ADEQ: Water Quality Division: Permits|website=www.azdeq.gov|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; stands as the model for grey water system regulation
# Human contact with gray water and soil irrigated by gray water is avoided;
# Gray water originating from the residence is used and contained within the property boundary for household gardening, composting, lawn watering, or landscape irrigation;
# Surface application of gray water is not used for irrigation of food plants, except for citrus and nut trees;
# The gray water does not contain hazardous chemicals derived from activities such as cleaning car parts, washing greasy or oily rags, or disposing of waste solutions from home photo labs or similar hobbyist or home occupational activities;
# The application of gray water is managed to minimize standing water on the surface;
# The gray water system is constructed so that if blockage, plugging, or backup of the system occurs, gray water can be directed into the sewage collection system or onsite wastewater treatment and disposal system, as applicable. The gray water system may include a means of filtration to reduce plugging and extend system lifetime;
# Any gray water storage tank is covered to restrict access and to eliminate habitat for mosquitoes or other vectors;
# The gray water system is sited outside of a floodway;
# The gray water system is operated to maintain a minimum vertical separation distance of at least five feet from the point of gray water application to the top of the seasonally high groundwater table;
# For residences using an onsite wastewater treatment facility for black water treatment and disposal, the use of a gray water system does not change the design, capacity, or reserve area requirements for the onsite wastewater treatment facility at the residence, and ensures that the facility can handle the combined black water and gray water flow if the gray water system fails or is not fully used;
# Any pressure piping used in a gray water system that may be susceptible to cross connection with a potable water system clearly indicates that the piping does not carry potable water;
# Gray water applied by surface irrigation does not contain water used to wash diapers or similarly soiled or infectious garments unless the gray water is disinfected before irrigation; and
# Surface irrigation by gray water is only by flood or drip irrigation.

A complex grey water system provides for a development with a substantial discharge (greater than 250 gallons) per day. It requires a written construction permit submitted to the enforcing agency.

A simple grey water system is sized to serve a one or two family home with a medium level water discharge (maximum 250 gallons) per day.  It too, requires a written construction permit submitted to the Enforcing Agency.

A clothes washer grey water system is sized to recycle the grey water of a one or two family home using the reclaimed water of a washing machine (produces 15 gallons per person per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oasisdesign.net/greywater/laundry/|title=Laundry to Landscape Original Complete Information Hub|website=oasisdesign.net|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on either the pump from the washing machine or gravity to irrigate.  This particular system is the most common and least restricted system. In most states, this system does not require construction permits.  This system is often characterized as Laundry to Landscape (L2L).  The system relies on valves, draining to a mulch basin, or the area of irrigation for certain landscape features (a mulch basin for a tree requires 12.6&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  The drip system must be calibrated to avoid uneven distribution of grey water or overloading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/style/la-hm-graywater27-2008sep27-story.html|title=Gray water: from the washer to the garden|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Delivery methods ===
* Above Grade Gravity-Fed Irrigation
Often used for washing machine or tub with gravity-fed irrigation systems&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.level.org.nz/water/wastewater/on-site-wastewater-treatment/greywater-recycling/greywater-systems/|title=How does a greywater system work?|last=Ltd|first=BRANZ|website=www.level.org.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Grey water leaves source and passes through three-way diversion valve
#Water enters either gully trap or surge tank
#Tank water enters filter bag
#Filtered water falls to irrigation system
* Submersible Pump Diversion to Irrigation
Often used for low level of contamination in water, providing that unsuitable water enters sewer&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#Grey Water discharges over a screen filter which can be diverted to a gully with a valve leading to the sewer
#Screen filtered water enters a submersed pump
#Pump sends water to irrigation system
* Above Grade Gravity-Fed Pumped Irrigation
Often used for laundry or bathroom grey water systems with pumped irrigation&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#Grey water leaves through three-way diversion valve
#Enters surge tank
#Tank water enters filter bag
#Filtered water enters submersible pump
#Pump supplies water to irrigation system

=== Indoor reuse ===
Recycled grey water from domestic appliances can be also be used to flush toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oasisdesign.net/greywater/indoors/|title=Gray Water Indoor Reuse, Cascading, Rainwater Harvesting|website=oasisdesign.net|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It application is based on standards set by plumbing codes.  Indoor grey water reuse requires an efficient cleaning tank for insoluble waste, as well as a well regulated control mechanism.

The [[Uniform Plumbing Code]], adopted in some U.S. jurisdictions, prohibits greywater use indoors.

{{see also|rainwater harvesting}}

=== Construction of grey water systems ===

A written construction permit is required prior to building, fixing, relocating, or altering any system that ''requires'' a permit. Permits require usage data, member sizing, and soil conditions (to reduce pooling of grey water).  Different states and regions are subject to different requirements of plans and system specifications.  Standards set by state dictate codes for grey water systems based on definition of grey water, system type, and permit requirement.  In many cases, construction can be done without contracting a professional.

=== Testing and inspection ===

A grey water system that requires a permit must accurately determine the absorptive capacity of soils.  Certain tests may be required for irregular soils, or undocumented areas.

A permitted system is required to be inspected. During construction the system is to be left uncovered.  Additionally, implementation of certain devices can be prescribed in codes and requirements.  A [[Reduced pressure zone device|Reduced Pressure (RP) backflow device]] at property entry makes it easier to assess any amounts of crossover between grey water and a potentially potable water supply.

==Challenges==
The biggest concern in Integrated Urban Water Management systems, specifically grey water reuse is the introduction of untreated water into a landscape.  It is important that grey water systems maximize natural purification through [[soil health|healthy]] [[topsoil]], avoiding contact between greywater before and after filtration.  Untreated grey water has the capacity to meet [[surface runoff|runoff]] and ultimately [[water pollution|pollute]] water systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spur.org/publications/spur-report/2006-11-07/integrated-stormwater-management|title=Integrated Stormwater Management|website=SPUR|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that evaporated grey water can leave microorganisms that can be harmful if breathed or consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanfaxlabs.com.au/greywater.htm|title=Greywater|website=www.lanfaxlabs.com.au|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is best practice to not use greywater in a [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]] system, for this reason.  Direct application of grey water can leave the aforementioned microorganisms on foliage. Grey water should not be used on fruits or vegetables (unless applied very carefully and specifically to the roots – although most state codes won’t allow this).

Excess grey water which may not percolate into the soil could become runoff often leading the untreated water to waterways. Grey water should not be applied to saturated soil, and should be used conservatively.

Many household cleaners contain ingredients which can’t be removed by a typical grey [[water filtration]] system.  This requires an assessment of which substances will alter the quality of the grey water.  Additionally, not all household appliances should be used for grey water recycling.  Some should be diverted separately to sewage.

Grey water filtration systems are not equipped to handle the highest levels contaminants.  Discretion is required as to when to use the grey water system. This includes consideration of what appliances to connect, as well as how much water is being processed at any given time.

One of the most significant challenges for IUWM could be securing a consensus on the definition of IUWM and the implementation of stated objectives at operational stages of projects. In the developing world there is still a significant fraction of the population that has no access to proper water supply and sanitation. At the same time, population growth, [[urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] continue to cause pollution and depletion of water sources. In the developed world, pollution of water sources is threatening the [[sustainability]] of urban water systems. Climate change is likely to affect all urban centers, either with increasingly heavy storms or with prolonged droughts, or perhaps both. To address the challenges facing IUWM it is crucial to develop good approaches, so that policy development and planning are directed towards addressing these global change pressures, and to achieving truly sustainable urban water systems.&lt;ref name="Switch"&gt;{{cite web

== Origins ==

The first steps toward the creation of CIMMYT were taken in 1943 when cooperative efforts of the Mexican government and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] led to the founding of the Office of Special Studies, an organization within the Mexican [[Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Nourishment|Secretariat of Agriculture]], now known as the [[Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food]]. [http://www.gob.mx/sagarpa SAGARPA website] The goal of the office was to ensure food security in Mexico and abroad through selective plant breeding and crop improvement.

The project developed into a collaboration between Mexican and international researchers. It established global networks to test experimental crop varieties. One of its researchers, wheat breeder [[Norman Borlaug]], developed dwarf wheat varieties that put more energy into grain production and responded better to fertilizer than older varieties, won the Nobel Peace Prize for that work in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/borlaug-facts.html |title=Norman Borlaug - Facts |website=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was renamed and morphed into CIMMYT in 1963, though it was still under the Secretariat of Agriculture’s jurisdiction. As international demand grew and it became apparent CIMMYT required internal organization and increased funding, the center was reorganized and established as a non-profit scientific and educational institution in its own right in 1966.

In the early 1970s, a small cadre of development organizations, national sponsors, and private foundations organized CGIAR to further spread the impact of agricultural research to more nations. CIMMYT became one of the first international research centers to be supported through the CGIAR. Today, the CGIAR comprises 15 such centers, all dedicated to sustainable food security through scientific research.&lt;ref name="cimmyt" /&gt;

== Activities ==

CIMMYT focuses on 1) the conservation and utilization of maize and wheat genetic resources, 2) developing and promoting improved maize and wheat varieties, 3) testing and sharing sustainable farming systems, 4) analyzing the impact of its work and researching ways for further improvement. In Mexico in the late 1980s, CIMMYT began working developing better varieties of maize and wheat that helped small peasant farmers, using breeding to increase crops' resistance to pests and diseases, as well as raise the protein content of maize.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cotter, ''Troubled Harvest: Agronomy and Revolution in Mexico, 1880-2002''. Contributions in Latin American Studies, No. 22. Westport CT: Prager 2003, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;
CIMMYT partners with national agriculture research institutions across the globe. Though its headquarters are in Mexico, the center supports 13 regional offices (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Turkey, and Zimbabwe), as well as number of experimental stations.

== CIMMYT programs and units ==
=== Global Wheat Program and Global Maize Program ===
The core of CIMMYT is its two main programs: the Global Wheat Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/rainf_wht/index.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717062246/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/rainf_wht/index.cfm |date=July 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Maize Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/afr_livelih/index.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808055150/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/afr_livelih/index.cfm |date=August 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both programs specialize in breeding varieties of their respective crop that are high yielding and adapted to withstand specific environmental constraints, such as infertile soils, drought, insects, and diseases. Center scientists use, traditional cross-breeding, molecular markers, and potentially [[Genetically modified crops#Stabilizing high-value varieties|genetic engineering]] to develop new varieties. Additional efforts focus on a variety of agricultural aspects such as proper seed storage, natural resource management, value chains, the benefits of using improved seed, and appropriate machine use and access.&lt;ref name="maize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/afr_livelih/index.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808055150/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/afr_livelih/index.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-08 |title=CIMMYT - Global Maize Program |date=2009-08-08 |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainable Intensification Program ===
The Sustainable Intensification Program was previously the Conservation Agriculture Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimmyt.org/sustainable-intensification-program/ |title=Sustainable Intensification &amp;#124; CIMMYT. International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center |website=Cimmyt.org |date=2016-04-27 |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/ca/index.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904065338/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/ca/index.cfm |date=September 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research priorities within the Sustainable Intensification Program focus on methods to increase crop and agricultural productivity while maintaining the three pillars of [[sustainability]]; preservation of the environment, delivery of positive economic outcomes, adaptation to cultural and society. With a broad mandate, CIMMYT's sustainable intensification research have corresponding diverse focal points. These include [[climate change]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortiz|first=Rodomiro|last2=Sayre|first2=Kenneth D.|last3=Govaerts|first3=Bram|last4=Gupta|first4=Raj|last5=Subbarao|first5=G.

The Socioeconomics Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/se/index.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904065258/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/wpp/se/index.cfm |date=September 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was once part of the former Impacts Targeting and Assessment Unit, which was dissolved in 2009 to form the Conservation Agriculture Program and the Socioeconomics Program.  The mission of this program is to evaluate the center’s work and to increase its positive global impacts.  Areas of focus include public policy, efficient use of resources, monitoring of global maize and wheat trends, and the understanding of economic, political and institutional environments in which CIMMYT operates.

=== Genetic Resources Program ===
The Genetic Resources and Enhancement Unit (GREU) is support unit that holds the maize and wheat collections of CIMMYT in trust for humanity under UN-FAO agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-bb895e.pdf |title=Agreement Between the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN|date=October 16, 2006|accessdate=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program works on genetic traits that are identified as priorities by the eco-regional programs, such as drought tolerance.

A '''land raid''' was a form of political protest in rural Scotland, primarily in the [[Scottish Highlands|highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=Iain J.M.|title=Landscapes of Protest in the Scottish Highlands After 1914: The Later Highland Land Wars|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317108047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land raiders threatened to seize, or seized, land which they claimed had been unfairly taken from them or their forebears. Landowners, and the law, regarded the protests as a form of [[squatting]].

Land raids were particularly common in the [[Hebrides]], but some of the most prominent cases occurred on the mainland, for example in [[Wester Ross]] and in [[Sutherland]].

Due to the ancient land relations and taxation and regulation under the [[British Raj]], at the time of independence, India inherited a semi-feudal agrarian system, with ownership of land concentrated in the hands of a few individual landlords. Since independence, there has been voluntary and state initiated/mediated land reforms in several states. The most notable and successful example of land reforms are in the states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Kerala]]. The Land Reforms Ordinance was a law in the state of Kerala, [[India]] by  [[K. R. Gowri Amma]] minister in the [[First E. M. S. ministry|first EMS government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article1204236.ece|title=Land Reforms Act no longer relevant, says Industries Secretary |last1= Staff Reporter|first1= |last2= |first2= |date=Feb 18, 2008 |website=http://www.thehindu.com|publisher=The Hindu |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EMS government was the first [[communist]] state government popularly elected to power in India, in the southern state of Kerala. Soon after taking its oath of office, the government introduced the controversial Land Reforms Ordinance, which was later made into an act.  This, along with an [[Kerala Education Bill, 1957|Education Bill]], raised a massive uproar from the landlord classes.  The popular slogan for the radical socialists was "the land for tillers", which sent shock-waves through the landlord classes in the country.  The ordinance set an absolute ceiling on the amount of land a family could own. The tenants and hut dwellers received a claim in the excess land, on which they had worked for centuries under the feudal system. In addition, the law ensured [[wikt:Special:Search/fixity|fixity]] of tenure and protection from eviction.&lt;ref name="deccan_chronicle_2016_pkmtharakan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Land reforms reshaped state: Prof P K Michael Tharakan|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/amp/nation/in-other-news/051116/land-reforms-reshaped-state-prof-p-k-michael-tharakan.html|work=www.deccanchronicle.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These ground-breaking measures caused the premature death of the state government, as the central government, under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], used [[president's rule|article 356]] to dismiss it, alleging the breakdown of law and order. The land reforms in Kerala imparted drastic changes to the political, economic and social outlook.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Different types of [[feudalism|feudal]] relations existed in [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Malabar region|Malabar]] at the time of the formation of the state.  The landless farmers and those who were evicted from their land wanted to get their grievances redressed. The clamour for changes gathered strength. The government which came to power in 1957 introduced the Land Reforms Bill in the [[Legislative Assembly of Kerala|Legislative Assembly]].  The [[Liberation Struggle#Agrarian relations bill|Agrarian Relations Bill]] introduced in 1958 was passed with minor amendments.  The legislature passed subsequent land reform bills in 1960, 1963, and 1964. But the historical land reform act, Kerala  Land  Reforms  (Amendment)  Act,  1969 by [[C. Achutha Menon]] government which put an end to the feudal system and ensured the rights of the tenants on land, came into force on 1 January 1970. However, cash crop plantations had been exempted from its purview. There have been many amendments to the act since, the latest having been in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/KLR-Act-amendment-could-grave-situation-for-result-fragment-of-estatesplantation-sector/articleshow/17081837.cms|title=KLR Act amendment could grave situation for result fragment of estatesplantation sector|last1= Kiran|first1=K P Sai |last2= |first2= |date=Nov 4, 2012 |website=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com|publisher=The Times of India |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main objectives==
* To bestow on tenants ownership of a minimum of ten cents of land
* To end the old feudal relations by legitimizing the right of real peasants to own the land they cultivate
* To introduce land ceiling and distribute excess land among the landless agricultural labourers
* To abolish exploitation and inequalities in the agrarian sector
* To ensure the consistent progress and transformation of society
* To achieve economic development and modernisation
* To end the era of [[Indian feudalism|feudalism]]{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Impact==
* Leasing of land became unlawful.
* The [[Jenmis]] who lived by collecting lease became extinct.
* The lease holders were given ownership of the land.
* A few big farmers who had cultivated on the leased lands also became owners of that land.
* Land owners sold their excess land.
* Hundreds of thousands of people got dwelling places of their own.
* The labour market was enlarged as former serfs entered it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pulaprebalakrishnan.in/?q=node/204|title=Why did a slump follow land reforms in Kerala?|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=Mar 2012 |website= |publisher=''South Asia Economic Journal'' |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">The following is a list of [[dog breed]]s that are or have been used as aids in police forces. There are a number of different jobs that a [[police dog]] can do, including public-order enforcement, illicit-substance detection, tracking, and cadaver or survivor searching. Some police forces use only one breed of dog for every one of these tasks rather than using, for example, one breed for tracking and another for illegal-substance detection. In some cases, a single dog may be trained and used in a number of these tasks.

==All police dog breeds used in law enforcement==
These dogs have the job of chasing a fleeing suspect and detaining the suspect until officers arrive; or restraining suspects from some action by threat of the dog being released and causing harm. This is the traditional image of a police dog

==Illicit-substance detection dogs==
These dogs sit with their handlers in airports and other transport hubs, sniffing the passengers from afar to detect any illegal substances a person may be carrying on their person or in luggage or carry-on items. The substances are most commonly [[drug]]s and [[explosive]]s, although many nations also interdict foreign food items.

'''MassEquality''' is a [[Boston]]-based organization that seeks to promote [[LGBT rights]] in the [[U.S. Commonwealth]] of [[Massachusetts]]. It supported the implementation of ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'', the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]]'s 2003 decision that legalized same-sex marriage, and opposed efforts to adopt an [[Constitutional amendment|amendment]] to the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] seeking to limit the impact of or annul the ruling.

The coalition was formed in the late 1990s in response to the first attempts in the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts state legislature]] to pass a "defense of marriage act" that would have prohibited the recognition of same-sex marriage. MassEquality was formally incorporated in late 2001 as a 501(c)4 advocacy organization, though it operated without staff until after the ''Goodridge'' decision.

The organization is a member of the [[Equality Federation]].&lt;ref name="masseq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.massequality.org/content/kara-suffredini-named-equality-federation-board-directors | title=Kara Suffredini Named to Equality Federation Board of Directors | publisher=MassEquality | date=September 30, 2011 | accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eqfed-members"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://equalityfederation.org/members | title=Member Organizations | work=Equality Federation | accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional amendment advocacy==
The ''Goodridge'' ruling reignited attempts to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to ban civil recognition of same-sex marriage. In late 2003, the coalition of organizations that formed the Steering Committee for MassEquality hired its first staffer, Campaign Coordinator Marty Rouse. Rouse, an experienced political operative who had helped members of the Vermont legislature recover form election losses they suffered as a consequence of supporting [[civil union]] legislation, quickly implemented a campaign to marshal the coalition's resources and build a field operation to bolster the [[LGBT]] movement's legislative lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kiritsy|first=Laura|title=Marty Rouse to leave MassEquality |url=http://baywindows.com/marty-rouse-to-leave-massequality-67879|accessdate=March 1, 2014|newspaper=Bay Windows |date=December 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the ''Goodridge'' ruling, legislative debate on a "defense of marriage" amendment in Massachusetts was intense. The debate, conducted in a joint session of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] and [[Massachusetts Senate|Senate]], a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] that spanned four days over nearly two months, was carried live on [[C-SPAN]]. During that time, MassEquality identified and mobilized supporters of same-sex marriage in an attempt to defeat the proposed constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People of the year: Mass Equality|url=http://baywindows.com/people-of-the-year-mass-equality-68805|accessdate=March 1, 2014|newspaper=Bay Windows|date=December 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2004, the Massachusetts legislature passed by a five-vote margin a proposed [[constitutional amendment]] that would ban same-sex marriage and provide civil unions for same-sex couples. This amendment, called the Travaglini-Lees amendment, needed to win a majority of the votes in a second constitutional convention before being put to a popular vote. It was defeated in a joint session of the legislature on September 29, 2005, by a vote of 39-157, due largely to increased public support for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts and to victories by several legislative candidates supportive of same-sex marriage backed by MassEquality.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Opponents of same-sex marriage then launched a new initiative to pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. This new amendment sought to ban same-sex marriage without creating an alternative institution for same-sex couples. This amendment was brought as an initiative petition, requiring collection of a certain number of voters' signatures, followed by a vote of one-quarter of legislators meeting in joint session in both the 2005-2006 legislative session and the 2007-2008 session. The Massachusetts legislature adopted this amendment just before its 2005-2006 session ended, but defeated it during its 2007-2008 session.

==Other activities==
Following the defeat of the amendment, MassEquality expanded its mission to work for equal rights and opportunities for all LGBT people from cradle to grave—in schools, in marriage and family life, at work and in retirement. Since that expansion, it helped pass a statewide anti-bullying law and secured an executive order from Governor [[Deval Patrick]] prohibiting discrimination against transgender people in state agencies and state contracts. Kara Suffredini, an attorney with over a decade of LGBT policy and movement experience, was appointed executive director in 2010.

==Parade invitation==
On February 28, 2014, following pressure on the part of Boston Mayor [[Martin J. Walsh (politician)|Martin J. Walsh]], the organizers of South Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade, which had banned open participation by gay organizations for 20 years and in 1995 won a [[Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston|Supreme Court case]] that supported their stance, announced that MassEquality would be welcome to participate in the parade. It set conditions that MassEquality's marchers not wear shirts or carry signs that display the word ''gay'' or refer to sexual orientation. One organizer said: "They can march under the MassEquality banner. We'd be happy to have them here. And we’d be proud to have them here. Everybody knows who MassEquality is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Andrew|title=Gay group invited to march in St. Patrick’s Day parade with a caveat|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/03/01/gay-group-invited-march-patrick-day-parade-with-caveat/junEiNrYzvkfc2pe6F0OlO/story.html|accessdate=March 1, 2014|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; MassEquality leaders welcomed the opportunity to discuss the question with parade organizers directly and said: "MassEquality has not accepted any invitation to march, and will only consider accepting an invitation that allows LGBT people to march openly.... LGBT people should not have to silence who they are to celebrate other parts of their identities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmerma |first=David|title=LGBT group MassEquality responds to the invitation to march in South Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/blogs/bostonspirit/2014/03/lgbt_group_massequality_respon.html |accessdate=March 1, 2014|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Masculism sidebar}}

The consciousness and philosophy of '''men's liberation''' is critical of the restraints which society imposes on men. Men's liberation activists are generally sympathetic to feminist standpoints and have been greatly concerned with deconstructing negative aspects of male identity and portions of masculinity which do not serve to promote the stories and lives of all men.{{weasel inline|date=November 2018}}

''Men's liberation'' is not to be confused with different movements such as the [[men's rights movement]], in which some argue that modern [[feminism]] has gone too far and additional attention should be placed on men's rights. The men's liberation movement stresses the costs of some negative portions of traditional [[masculinity]], the men's rights movement is largely about unequal or unfair treatment of men by modern institutions because of, or in spite of those traits ubiquitous to traditional masculinity.

== History ==
Beginning well before the women's liberation movement of the 1960s, men in the early portions of the 20th century started to use the battle for worker's rights as a way of examining their own lives as men in a capitalist society. This can be observed as writers like Upton Sinclair exposed the horrendous conditions men worked under in meat packing plants. Unskilled immigrant men did the backbreaking and often dangerous work, laboring in dark and unventilated rooms, hot in summer and unheated in winter. Many stood all day on floors covered with blood, meat scraps, and foul water, wielding sledge-hammers and knives. The extent to which the growth of capital outpaces wages can and does force men to work in dangerous conditions and for others' betterment is often viewed through the lens of Marxism. Thus, it is somewhat difficult to differentiate between men's liberation, men's rights, and labor rights. The rights of labor are often synonymous with the rights of men. This can also be examined politically in the 1791 treatise, The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine. In this work Paine suggests "The mutual dependence and reciprocal interest which man has upon man, and all the parts of civilised community upon each other, create that great chain of connection which holds it together. The landholder, the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant, the tradesman, and every occupation, prospers by the aid which each receives from the other, and from the whole. Common interest regulates their concerns, and forms their law; and the laws which common usage ordains, have a greater influence than the laws of government. In fine society performs for itself almost everything which is ascribed to government." In as much as Sinclair and Marx were attempting to empower working men from their capital holding brethren -- Paine is shown to be examining the rights of man to be a worker of his own sort, free from a government which doesn't exist to his betterment. The men's liberation movement, as recognized by feminists and today's gender scholars who are often ignorant and even hostile towards Marxist critique, developed mostly among heterosexual, middle-class men in Britain and North America as a response to the cultural changes of the 1960s and 1970s, including the growth of the feminist movement, [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], [[Women's liberation movement|women's]] and [[gay liberation]] movements, and the [[sexual revolution]].&lt;ref name="Baker1980"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Baker, Maureen &amp; Bakker, J.

By the early 1980s, members of the male liberation movement had fully split into two entities. The members who had placed greater emphasis on the 'cost of male gender roles to men' than the 'cost of male gender roles to women' had formed the [[men's rights movement]] focusing on issues faced by men.  The members who saw sexism exclusively as a system of men oppressing women rejected the language of sex roles and created pro-feminist men's organizations focused primarily on addressing sexual violence against women.&lt;ref name=Messner1998 /&gt;

==Race==
Racial differences have historically stratified the men’s liberation movement and such divisions still remain problematic today.  Some profeminist scholars argue&lt;ref name="Hoch1"&gt;Hoch, Paul. "White Hero, Black Beast: Racism, Sexism, and the Mask of Masculinity", reprinted in ''Feminism &amp; Masculinities'', Peter F. Murphy, ed. ([1970]; Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 93–107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Messner1"&gt;Messner, Michael. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PP1 "Politics of Masculinities: Men in Movements"]. Oxford: AltaMira Press, 2000, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; that racism within American society has emasculated non-white men. For example, black men are perceived to lack control over their innate sexual aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carbado |first=Devon |title=Black Men on Race, Gender, and Sexuality: A Critical Reader |year=1999 |publisher=NYU Press |chapter=Walking Proud: Black Men Living Beyond the Stereotypes |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this ideological framework black men are presented as hyper-sexual to an animalistic degree; they therefore represent beasts, not men.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} [[Asian American|East Asian Americans]] have been emasculated in an opposite way: they have been portrayed as desexualized, unattractive, small, wimpy, intelligent, and devious (see: [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States]]).

==Gay liberation==
[[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave]] [[pro-feminism]] paid increased attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and [[hegemonic masculinity]]. This shift led to more cooperation between the men's liberation and [[gay liberation]] movements. In part this cooperation arose because masculinity was then understood to be a [[social construction]], and as a response to the universalization of "men" seen in previous men's movements.

==Organizations==
===Radical Faeries===
{{main| Radical Faeries}}
The Radical Faeries were organized in California in 1979 by gay activists wanting to create an alternative to being assimilated into mainstream men's culture.&lt;ref name=remembering&gt;{{citation |title=Remembering Harry |first=Mark |last= Thompson |accessdate=2008-10-17 |date=21 January 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%22Remembering%20Harry%22%20advocate&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q | periodical=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |publisher=Here Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Margo Adair who attended the twelfth gathering in 1987, wrote that she found the atmosphere strangely different than anything she had previously experienced.  After thinking about it, she realized it was the first time she had ever felt completely safe among a large group of men, with few other women.  She also noticed that everyone was accepted, and affection among participants was displayed openly.&lt;ref name="hagan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Adair | first = Margo| editor-last = Hagan | editor-first = Kay | title = Women respond to the men's movement: a feminist collection | page = 64 | publisher = [[HarperCollins|HarperSanFrancisco]] | location = San Francisco | year = 1992 | isbn = 0062509969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[history of Germany]], the '''Ministry of the Reichswehr''' or '''Reich Ministry of Defence''' ({{lang-de|Reichswehrministerium}}) was the defence ministry of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the early [[Third Reich]]. The 1919 [[Weimar Constitution]] provided for a unified, national ministry of defence to coordinate the new ''[[Reichswehr]]'', and that ministry was set up in October 1919, from the existing Prussian [[Prussian Minister of War|War Ministry]] and ''[[Reichsmarineamt]]''. It was based in the [[Bendlerblock]] building. The ''Wehrgesetz'' (Defence Law) of 21 May 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} RGBl I, S. 609 / Faksimile [http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19350007&amp;seite=00000609&amp;zoom= Wehrgesetz]&lt;/ref&gt; renamed it the ''Reichskriegsministerium'' (Reich Ministry of War), which was then abolished in 1938 and replaced with the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]''.

==History==
Within the framework of the ''Gesetz über die Bildung einer vorläufigen Reichswehr'' ("Law on the formation of a provisional national defence force") of March 1919, the [[President of Germany (Weimar Republic)|''Reichspräsident'']] was [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces, with the ''Reichswehrminister'' (Reich Minister of Defence) exercising command. These arrangements left out the Prussian armed forces, which remained under the command of the [[Prussian Minister of War]]. After the [[Weimar Constitution]] came into force, the war ministries of [[Ministry of War (Kingdom of Bavaria)|Bavaria]], Saxony, [[Ministry of War of Württemberg|Württemberg]] and Prussia were dissolved and command authority was concentrated in the hand of the national ''Reichswehrminister''. Power of command for each branch was given to the head of the Army Command (''Heeresleitung'') and the head of the Navy Command (''Marineleitung''). The ''Ministeramt'' was established as a third office within the ministry in 1929, with the ''Ministeramt''′s head acting as the ''Reichswehrminister''′s political deputy. The innocuous Troop Office (''[[Truppenamt]]'') functioned as a covert general staff, which was banned by the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

The "''Verkündung der Wehrhoheit''" (proclamation of military sovereignty) of 1935 created a new ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' (OKL), under the [[Air Ministry (Germany)|Air Ministry]], and turned the ''Heeresleitung'' into the ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' (OKH) and the ''Marineleitung'' into the ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' (OKM). The ''Ministeramt'' was renamed the ''Wehrmachtsamt''. As a result of the [[Blomberg-Fritsch Affair]] in 1938, the ''Reichskriegsminister'' and ''Wehrmachtsamt'' were abolished by [[Adolf Hitler]] and their duties transferred to the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9410">The '''Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange Program''', also known by the acronym '''MATRIX''', was a U.S. federally funded [[data mining system]] originally developed for the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]] described as a tool to identify terrorist subjects.

The system was reported to analyze government and commercial databases to find associations between suspects or to discover locations of or completely new "suspects". The database and technologies used in the system were housed by [[Seisint]], a Florida-based company since acquired by [[Lexis Nexis]].

The Matrix program was shut down in June 2005 after federal funding was cut in the wake of public concerns over privacy and state surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-205261], ''Privacy International'', 5 June 2005, loaded 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Matrix was the brainchild of [[Hank Asher]], a businessman in the [[data aggregation]] field. Asher reportedly contacted Florida police immediately after the September 11 terrorist attacks, claiming he could find the hijackers as well as other potential terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/16985/], ''Alternet'', 16 October 2003, loaded 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Asher reportedly offered to make available the database and technology that could do the job quickly, for free, supplied by the company he owned and operated: [[Seisint]].

Control of the system was handed over to law enforcement officials, although Seisint continued to house and operate it on their behalf. After a demonstration of the system at the White House in January 2003 Matrix received US$4 million in grants from the U.S. Justice Department and the program was earmarked US$8 million by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50577-2004Jul14.html LexisNexis To Buy [[Seisint]] For $775 Million], ''Washington Post'', 15 July 2004, loaded 2 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The program snowballed, as states signed up to participate, including Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Ohio and Utah. California and Texas joined then exited the program, citing privacy and security concerns. The U.S. federal government and the [[CIA]] was cited as likely future users.

The program's similarity to the [[Information Awareness Office|Total Information Awareness]] (TIA) federally funded initiative that was terminated following public concerns contributed to Matrix's demise.  Matrix came under scrutiny by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU)  which made [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests in Florida, where the program originated, and to the federal government on 30 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/Privacy/Privacy.cfm?ID=14240&amp;c=130 requests]&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU followed this up with simultaneous information requests in Connecticut, Michigan, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania for information about those states' participation in Matrix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://writ.news.findlaw.com/ramasastry/20031105.html Why We Should Fear The Matrix], ''ACLU''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU's requests sought to find out the information sources that Matrix was drawing upon, who had access to the database and how it is being used. As well as the funding and operations described here, the ACLU's requests revealed that Matrix would perform an almost identical function to the banned TIA. Matrix would bind together government and commercial databases to allow federal and state law enforcement entities to conduct detailed searches on individuals.

Public revelation of the projects funding caused an uproar in the media and states began withdrawing their support. The Matrix program was finally shut down in June 2005 after federal funding was cut in the wake of public concerns over privacy and state surveillance.

Seisint retained the technology used to operate Matrix. Both Seisint and its Matrix technology are now owned by [[Lexis Nexis]].

==Function==

The Matrix website stated that the data would include criminal histories, driver's license data, vehicle registration records, and  public data record entries. Other data was thought to include credit histories, driver's license photographs, marriage and divorce records, social security numbers, dates of birth, and the names and addresses of family members, neighbors and business associates. All of this information is available to the government without the need for a warrant. The ACLU pointed out that the type of data that the Matrix compiles could be expanded to include information in commercial databases encompasses such as purchasing habits, magazine subscriptions, income and job histories.

Matrix would combine these government records and information from commercial databases in a [[data warehouse]]. Dossiers would be reviewed by specialized software to identify anomalies using 'mathematical analysis'. When anomalies are spotted, they would be scrutinized by personnel who would search for evidence of terrorism or other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reform.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Dockery.pdf Congressional testimony (25 March 2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040325022033/http://reform.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Dockery.pdf |date=25 March 2004 }},&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the TIA, Matrix would use [[data mining]] where searches for patterns in this data (including the 'anomalies') would be used to identify individuals possibly involved in [[terrorism|terrorist]] or other criminal activity. Congressional critic [[Paula B. Dockery]] pointed out that like the TIA, this kind of 'data mining' may be ineffective, and have severe downsides, including its privacy costs.

Data from Matrix would be transferred through the [[Regional Information Sharing Systems]] network, an existing secure law enforcement network used to transmit sensitive information among law enforcement agencies. The network was linked to High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, United States Attorneys' Offices, other federal agencies and several state law enforcement systems.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''National Engineering Laboratory''' ('''NEL''') was originally one of several large government-funded public research laboratories in the UK, staffed by scientists and engineers of the [[British Civil Service|Scientific Civil Service]].  Other such laboratories include the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL), the [[Laboratory of the Government Chemist]] (LGC), the [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) and the [[Transport Research Laboratory|Transport Research Establishment]] (TRL).

NEL was established in 1948 at [[Thorntonhall]] under the name Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory (MERL), in the village of the same name near [[East Kilbride]], Glasgow, Scotland.   The location was partly dictated by politics, since it was realised that Scotland did not have a UK public research establishment (in contrast to its [[Military of Scotland#Sensitive establishments|defence establishments]]).  There was also debate on whether the new laboratory would be an outpost of the prestigious NPL (which now has its main base in Teddington, just west of London), or have a separate identity.  Eventually the latter course was taken with the new laboratory focussing on mechanical engineering research, complementing the work of the then [[CEGB]] laboratories in [[electrical engineering]] when the name was changed to NEL.

As NEL expanded, it moved to a large, purpose-built site in East Kilbride itself.  Under the control of the Director, it was then part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]]. The 'lab' was organised into a number of subject-based divisions, including Creep Division, an important part of the UK effort to catalogue wear characteristics of materials, a Control Systems Division, Manufacturing Services Division, Fluid Power Division and Design Analysis Division.   The last of these was in the forefront in the use of the emerging technology of [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA).   Indeed, the growing need for quality-assurance in FEA led to the foundation of the ''National Agency for Finite Element Methods and Standards'', now operating simply as [[NAFEMS]].

Each building at NEL was named after a prominent engineer whose field was related to the focus of that division, so there was Maudsley Building, named after [[Henry Maudslay]], famous for his invention of the [[slide-rest lathe]] amongst many other achievements, Bramah Building so called after [[Joseph Bramah]] owing to his contribution to hydraulic engineering, Rankine Building named after [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] which specialised in [[thermodynamics]], Whitworth Building named after [[Joseph Whitworth]] immortalised after his work to unify standards for screw threads, one of the key stepping stones that paved the way for mass production.

The policy of the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] Government was originally for the full [[privatisation]] of all of the government laboratories and the dismantling of NEL was undertaken by [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|Lord Young]]. In practice, re-organisation has in some cases stopped short of a straight sale of these internationally important facilities, but NEL became part of the German-owned [[TÜV SÜD]] group in 1995. Along with the other national laboratories, some of which are still owned or controlled by the UK government, NEL now has a mixed portfolio of work from both government and private sectors. NEL holds the national standard for flow measurement, one of the most important roles it undertakes as part of the overall UK government science strategy.  This is now in the remit of the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]], working in part through the new [[National Measurement Office]], which is itself an Executive Agency created in April 2009.

==Engineering apprenticeships==

NEL operated an [[indentured]] apprentice training scheme and offered a wide range of skills for young engineers before being privatised ranging between light machining, heavy machining, fitting, electro-discharge-machining, jig and horizontal boring and in later years CNC machining, programming and introductions to FMS ([[flexible manufacturing system]]) and [[CAD/CAM]] facilities running KCurve on DEC/VAX mini computers. This work commenced around 1982-6 using raster scan, (green) monitors to visualise the programming, each known as workstations, (since the 'intelligence' was built into the desk, not the monitor) and the CAD CAM programs were still printed out on punched paper to be transferred in some cases into onboard RAM and in others read and implemented sequentially.

The '''Nepal Sadbhavana Party''' (NSP; {{lang-ne|'''नेपाल सदभावना पार्टी'''}}) was a national [[political party]] in [[Nepal]], now merged into [[Rastriya Janata Party Nepal]], that worked for rights of the [[Madhesi people]] and discriminated communities and groups of Nepal. 

==History==
The party was founded in 1985, as the Nepal Sadbhavana Council, by [[Gajendra Narayan Singh]]. In domestic affairs, it aimed at promoting the interests and citizenship of the Madhesi community of the [[Terai]] Region, favored the introduction of [[Maithili language|Maithili]] as the second national language, and supported the framework of a democratic socialist society. Within the bipolar framework of the [[Cold War]], it worked for the establishment of a special relationship with [[India]] and [[China]] in the framework of [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonalignment]]. [[Govinda Sah]] is central spokesperson of Nepal Sadbhawana Party.

Nepal Sadbhawana Parishad participated in the [[Democracy|democratic]] movement in Nepal. After the [[People's Movement I (1990)|People's Movement of 1990]] against the monarchical [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchyati Regime]], NSP participated in the multi-party system that was re-established in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dalannepal.net/2014/12/madhes-politics-part-2-rise-of.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 it transformed into NSP. NSP took part in several coalition governments in [[Nepal]] during the 1990s. At the last [[legislative]] [[elections in Nepal|elections]] before the [[King of Nepal]] took power, 3 May and 16 May 1999, the party won 3.2% of the popular vote and five out of 205  seats.

In July 2001, Singh reorganised the NSP central committee. [[Rajendra Mahato]] was appointed general secretary and Sarita Giri as Central Spokesperson [[Badri Prasad Mandal]] and [[Hridesh Tripathy]], both members of parliament, were nominated vice-presidents.Mr. Gauri Shankar Mohpal was appointed as member of Central Committee who held position as Vice president earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com.np/archive/2001/july/arc237.htm Nepalnews.com (newsflash) Arc235)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gajendra Narayan Singh died on January 23, 2002. Badri Prasad Mandal was appointed acting party chairman after Singh's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com.np/archive/2002/june/arc409.htm Nepalnews.com (newsflash) Arc409)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 4th NSP general convention, held in [[Rajbiraj]] in March 2003, the party split into two. A group led by the widow of Singh, [[Anandi Devi Singh]] and Hridesh Tripathy broke away and formed the [[Nepal Sadbhavana Party (Anandidevi)]]. The remaining group elected Badri Prasad Mandal as the new chairman of the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com.np/archive/2003/march/arc629.htm Nepalnews.com (newsflash) Arc629&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com.np/archive/2003/march/arc630.htm Nepalnews.com (newsflash) Arc630&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com.np/archive/2003/march/arc631.htm Nepalnews.com (newsflash) Arc630&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The convention elected a Central Working Committee, consisting of Badri Prasad Mandal, Ramnarayan Yadav, Bisheswor Rajbanshi, Dilip Kumar Dhadewa, Bishwonath Singh Rajbanshi, Chandrakala Singh Kuswah, Manish Kumar Suman, Satyanarayan Yadav, Dipendra Kumar Chaudhary, Sitaram Mandal, Durga Chaudhary, Dr. Dambar Narayan Yadav, Rajkumar Gupta, Laxman Lal Karna, Amrita Agrahari and Devendra Mishra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com.np/archive/2003/march/arc634.htm Nepalnews.com (newsflash) Arc633&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Mandal was expelled from the party. Laxman Lal Karna became the new party chairman. In June 2007 NSP merged into NSP(A).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com/archive/2007/jun/jun08/news14.php Nepalnews.com Mercantile Communications Pvt. Ltd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the demise of [[Gajendra Narayan Singh]] the party came to be overshadowed by some of the other [[Madhesh]] based parties coming into existence, which affected the party’s strength. Also because of some dissatisfaction among the Nepal Sadbhawana Party’s leaders the party broke into several pieces resulting into formation of several “Sadbhawana Parties”.&lt;ref&gt;http://madheshvani.com/en/details/5558/madhesh-editorial&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://election.ujyaaloonline.com/politicalparties/10/Sadbhawana-Party/&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Rajendra Mahato]], [[Anil Kumar Jha]], [[Sarita Giri]], [[Bikash Tiwari]] and [[Shyam Sundar Gupta]].

In 2015 the Sanghiya Sadbhawna Party, led by Anil Kumar Jha, merged with the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Anil Kumar Jha will chair the integrated party (NSP), while Sarita Giri will be its vice chairperson and [[Rajeev Jha]] will be its General Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2015/03/02/nation/two-sadbhawana-parties-unite/273785.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
In early October 2015, Sarita Giri quit the Nepal Sadbhawana Party.&lt;ref&gt;http://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sarita-giri-quits-nepal-sadbhawana-party/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onlinekhabar.com/2015/10/338668/&lt;/ref&gt; Later Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged with another four smaller parties: [[Madhesh Rastra Jantantrik Party (Krantikari)]], [[Social Republican Party]], [[Nepal Republican People]]'s Party and [[Jantantrik Terai Madhesh Mukti Tigers]]. Other local political leaders from [[Madhesh]], from different parties in [[Mahottari]], [[Bara District|Bara]] and [[Rupandehi]], also joined NSP. Following unification the party celebrated its silver jubilee, and participated in relief distribution after the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|devastating earthquake]] in Nepal. NSP's 6th General Convention in [[Janakpur]] took place in April 2016.

The dispute was the first well-publicized violent conflict between [[First Nations]] and the [[Canadian government]] in the late 20th century.

==Historical background==
Mohawk people first settled in the Montreal area in the early 18th century, moving north from their homeland in the [[Hudson River]] valley.&lt;ref name="rumrill"&gt;Donald A. RUMRILL, "An Interpretation and Analysis of the Seventeenth Century Mohawk Nation: Its Chronology and Movements," ''The Bulletin and Journal of Archaeology for New York State,'' 1985, vol. 90, pp. 1-39&lt;/ref&gt; They displaced the [[Wyandot people]] (or Hurons) native to the area, with whom the [[Haudenosaunee]] (of which the Mohawk were a tribe) had long been in conflict, and who had been weakened through prolonged contact with French settlers. Mohawk settlement in the St Lawrence river valley was influenced to a great extent by French [[Jesuit]] missionaries who sought converts from among the Mohawk and who established Jesuit missionary villages for them at [[Kahnawake]] and Kahnesatake.

In 1717, the governor of [[New France]] had granted the lands encompassing "the Pines" and the Pine Hill Cemetery, where local Mohawk ancestors had been buried,&lt;ref name="Revisiting"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Marian|title=Revisiting the Pines: Oka's legacy|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/revisiting-the-pines-okas-legacy|accessdate=27 June 2017|publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and to whom it was considered sacred burial ground)&lt;ref name="JMSS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lackenbauer|first1=P. Whitney|title=Carrying the Burden of Peace: the Mohawks, the Canadian Forces, and the Oka Crisis|journal=Journal of Military and Strategic Studies|date=Winter 2008|volume=10|issue=2|url=http://jmss.org/jmss/index.php/jmss/article/viewFile/89/99|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice or [[Sulpician Fathers]] [[Seminary]], a Roman Catholic order that was based out of Paris, France. In 1868, one year after [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], the chief of the Oka Mohawk people, [[Joseph Onasakenrat]], wrote a letter to the seminary claiming that its grant had included about nine square miles reserved for Mohawk use in trust of the seminary, and that the seminary had neglected this trust by granting themselves (the seminary) sole ownership rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katlatont Gabriel-Doxtater|first1=Brenda|last2=Kawanatatie Van den Hende|first2=Arlette|title=At the Woods' Edge: An Anthology of the History of the People of Kanehsatà:ke|date=1995|publisher=Kanehsatake Education Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oka Legacy: Oka Timeline: An Unresolved Land Claim Hundreds of Years in the Making|url=http://www.cbc.ca/firsthand/features/oka-timeline-an-unresolved-land-claim-hundreds-of-years-in-the-making|website=Firsthand|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Company|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 Onasakenrat attacked the seminary with a small armed force after having given the missionaries eight days to hand over the land. Local authorities ended this stand-off with force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=York|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Pindera|first2=Loreen|last3=David|first3=Dan|title=People of the Pines: The Warriors and the legacy of Oka|date=1991|publisher=Little, Brown Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace &amp; Enviro News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tekastiaks|title=Mohawk territory at Oka under dispute|url=http://www.perc.ca/PEN/1990-09/tekastiaks.html|accessdate=2 July 2017|publisher=Peace and Environment News|date=September 1990|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207040852/http://www.perc.ca/PEN/1990-09/tekastiaks.html|archivedate=7 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the seminary sold the territory under protest by the local Mohawk community. At the time they still kept cattle on the common land. By 1956, the Mohawk were left to six remaining square kilometers from their original 165.&lt;ref name="CBC timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace &amp; Enviro News" /&gt;

In 1959, the town approved the development of a private nine-hole golf course, the ''Club de golf d'Oka'', on a portion of the disputed land.&lt;ref name="CBC timeline" /&gt; The Mohawk suit filed against the development did not succeed. Construction also began on a parking lot and golf greens adjacent to the Mohawk cemetery.

In 1977, the Kanehsatà:ke [[Band society|band]] filed an official land claim with the federal Office of Native Claims regarding the land. The claim was accepted for filing and funds were provided for additional research of the claim. In 1986 the claim was rejected on the basis that it failed to meet key legal criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanesatake.com/heritage/crisis/events.html "Our Heritage"], Kanesatake Website, (accessed 12 March 2008) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307122146/http://www.kanesatake.com/heritage/crisis/events.html |date=March 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1989, the ''Club de golf d'Oka'' announced plans to expand the golf course by an additional nine holes. As the Office of Native Claims had rejected the Mohawk claim on the land three years earlier, his office did not consult the Mohawk on the plans. No environmental or historic preservation review was undertaken. Protests by Mohawks and others, as well as concern from the [[Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (Quebec)|Quebec Minister of the Environment]], led to negotiations and a postponement of the project by the municipality in August pending a court ruling on the development's legality.

In 1990, the court found in favour of the developers and the mayor of Oka, Jean Ouellette, announced that the remainder of the pines would be cleared to expand the golf course to eighteen holes and to construct 60 condominiums. Not all residents of Oka approved of the plans, but opponents found the mayor's office unwilling to discuss them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/acts_of_defiance|title=Acts of Defiance|year=1992|accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crisis==
As a protest against the court decision to allow the golf course construction to proceed, some members of the Mohawk community erected a [[barricade]] blocking access to the area. Mayor Ouellette demanded compliance with the court order, but the protesters refused. Quebec's [[Ministry of Native Affairs (Quebec)|Minister of Native Affairs]] [[John Ciaccia]] wrote a letter of support for the natives, stating that "these people have seen their lands disappear without having been consulted or compensated, and that, in my opinion, is unfair and unjust, especially over a golf course."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.ca/film/kanehsatake_270_years_of_resistance/ Alanis Obomsawin, ''Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance''], National Film Board of Canada, 1993, accessed 29 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, the mayor asked the [[Sûreté du Québec]] (SQ), Quebec's provincial police force, to intervene with the Mohawk protest, citing alleged criminal activity at the barricade. The Mohawk people, in accordance with the [[Great Law of Peace|Constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy]], asked the women, the caretakers of the land and "progenitors of the nation", whether or not the arsenal which the Warriors had amassed should remain.

The SQ deployed an emergency response unit, the [[List of special police units#Canada|Groupe d'intervention]] (Intervention group), which responded to the barricade by deploying [[tear gas]] canisters, [[Grenade#Concussion|concussion grenades]]&lt;ref name="Revisiting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JMSS" /&gt; in an attempt to force the Mohawks to disperse. In response, gunfire ensued from both sides,&lt;ref name="Revisiting" /&gt; and after a 15-minute gun battle the police fell back, abandoning six cruisers and a bulldozer. Although an initial account reported that 31-year-old SQ Corporal Marcel Lemay had been shot in the face during the [[Battle|firefight]],&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (1990).

Before the raid, there were approximately 30 armed Warriors in and around the barricade, following the gun battle, this number grew to 60–70, and would swell later to 600.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"/&gt; The Mohawks seized six vehicles, including four police cars, and commandeered the front-end loader to crush the vehicles and use them to form a barricade across the main highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officer Dies as Mohawks and Quebec Police Clash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/12/world/officer-dies-as-mohawks-and-quebec-police-clash.html|accessdate=13 December 2014|agency=New York Times|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the day, several of the elders protesting were arrested and a confrontation with the band community ensued as Mounties marched the squad cars holding those arrested through the reserve en route to Lillooet.]]
The Warriors established a network for communications between the Mohawk villages [[Akwesasne]], [[Kanesatake]] and [[Kahnawake]], that used hand-held radios, cellular phones,  air raid sirens and fire hall bells, as well as local radio stations, and human patrols.&lt;ref name="JMSS" /&gt; The situation escalated as the local Mohawks were joined by Natives from across the country and the United States. Despite pressure to do so, their barricade was not dismantled.&lt;ref name="JMSS" /&gt; The Sûreté du Québec established their own blockades on [[Quebec Route 344|highway 344]] to restrict access to Oka and Kanesatake. Another group of Mohawks at the nearby location of Kahnawake, in solidarity with Kanesatake, blockaded the [[Mercier Bridge]] at the point where it passed through their territory, thereby sealing off a major access point between the [[Island of Montreal]] and Montreal's heavily populated [[South Shore (Montreal)|South Shore]] suburbs.

At the peak of the crisis, the Mercier Bridge and Routes [[Quebec Route 132|132]], [[Quebec Route 138|138]] and [[Quebec Route 207|207]] were all blocked, creating substantial disruption to traffic and anger as the crisis dragged on. A group of frustrated [[Châteauguay]] residents started building an unauthorized, unplanned roadway circumventing the Kahnawake reserve. Long after the crisis, this unfinished roadway was eventually incorporated into [[Quebec Autoroute 30]].

Frustration over traffic congestion and diversion due to the bridge and road blocks were occasionally expressed publicly. Residents of Châteauguay burned an effigy of a Mohawk warrior while chanting "''sauvages''" (savages).&lt;ref&gt;[[Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance]] (1993 film), directed by [[Alanis Obomsawin]]&lt;/ref&gt; Radio host [[Gilles Proulx]] raised tensions with comments such as the Mohawks "couldn't even [[Quebec French|speak French]]". These remarks inflamed tempers that had been running especially high from comments preceding this crisis, including those by the federal [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Châteauguay]], [[Ricardo López (politician)|Ricardo Lopez]].&lt;ref name="Voir"&gt;{{citation | last = Hamilton | first = Graeme | title = Dion ranks a distant second in Quebec Liberal leader haunted by Clarity Act | newspaper = National Post | date = 13 September 2008 | quote =  Ricardo Lopez, a former Tory MP and Canadian Alliance candidate running for the Liberals in Salaberry-Beauharnois, had recommended in 1988 that all Indians be shipped to Labrador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, [[Quebec premier]] [[Robert Bourassa]] announced at a press conference that he had, as per Section 275 of the [[National Defence Act]], requested military support in "aid of the civil power". [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]] was reluctant to have the federal government and, in particular, the [[Canadian Forces]], so involved. Under the act, however, the [[Solicitor General of Quebec]], under direction from the Premier of Quebec, had the right to requisition the armed forces to maintain [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] as a provincial responsibility; this move had precedent in Canada, including two decades earlier during the [[October Crisis]] which had been requested by Robert Bourassa at that time as well.

It was around this time that the SQ had apparently lost control of the situation, and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] were deployed on August 14. They were prohibited from using force and were soon overwhelmed by riots caused by Mohawks and mobs created by the blocked traffic (during the course of which, ten constables were hospitalized).&lt;ref name="prezi.com"&gt;https://prezi.com/eet-fwelw-_h/canadas-aboriginal-people-the-oka-crisis-sovereignty-rec/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], General [[John de Chastelain]], placed Quebec-based troops in support of the provincial authorities; some 2,500 regular and reserve troops from the [[34 Canadian Brigade Group|34]] and [[35 Canadian Brigade Group]]s and [[5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]] were put on notice. On August 20, a company of the [[Royal 22e Régiment|Royal 22&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Régiment]], led by Major Alain Tremblay, took over three barricades and arrived at the final blockade leading to the disputed area. There, they reduced the stretch of [[no man's land]], originally implemented by the Sûreté du Québec before the barricade at the Pines, from 1.5 kilometers to 5 meters. Additional troops and mechanized equipment mobilized at staging areas around Montreal, while reconnaissance aircraft staged air photo missions over Mohawk territory to gather intelligence. Despite high tensions between the two sides, no shots were exchanged.

==Resolution and aftermath==
On August 29, the Mohawks at the Mercier Bridge negotiated an end to their protest blockade with Lieutenant-Colonel Robin Gagnon, the [[Royal 22e Régiment|"Van Doo"]] commander who had been responsible for the south shore of the [[St. Lawrence River]] during the crisis. This stand-down eventually contributed to the resolution of the original siege on the Kahnawake reserve, and on September 26 the Mohawks there dismantled and burned some of their guns and returned to the reserve after ceremonially burning [[tobacco]].&lt;ref name="rcinet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montgomery|first1=Mark|title=History: Oka Crisis Ends|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2016/09/26/history-oka-crisis-ends/|website=Radio Canada International|publisher=RCI|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohawks at Oka, however, felt betrayed at the loss of their most effective bargaining chip in the Mercier Bridge: once traffic began flowing again, the Quebec government rejected further negotiations pursuant to their original dispute concerning the Oka golf course expansion.&lt;ref name="rcinet" /&gt; September 25 witnessed the final engagement of the crisis: a Mohawk warrior walked around the perimeter of the blockade area with a long stick, setting off flares that had been originally installed by the Canadian Forces to alert them to individuals fleeing the area. The soldiers turned a water hose on this man, but it lacked enough pressure to disperse the crowd surrounding him. This crowd taunted the soldiers and began throwing water balloons at them, but the incident did not escalate further.&lt;ref name="Canada History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oka|url=http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/eras/pcs%20in%20power/Oka.html|website=Canada History|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those charged and convicted for their participation was Ronaldo Casalpro (who used the alias Ronald "Lasagna" Cross during the conflict). Casalpro was beaten by Sûreté du Québec officers after his arrest, and while three were suspended without pay, the case took so long to process that they had already left the force.&lt;ref name="Ha"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/crisis-inspired-many-native-people/article4165629/?page=all|title=Crisis inspired many native people - The Globe and Mail|last=Ha|first=Tu Thanh|date=2000-07-11|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two SQ officers were suspended and investigated for allegedly beating Casalpro while in captivity, but were not subsequently charged.&lt;ref name="Ha"/&gt; Cross served a six-year sentence for assault and weapons charges related to his role on the crisis and died of a heart attack in November 1999.&lt;ref name="Ha"/&gt; Casalpro's brother, Tracy Cross, later served as the best man at the wedding of slain SQ Corporal Lemay's sister, Francine, who had reconciled with the community after reading ''At the Woods' Edge'', a history of Kanesatake.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/oka-crisis-sister-of-slain-corporal-builds-bridges|title=Oka Crisis: Sister of slain corporal builds bridges|last=Scott|first=Marian|date=July 10, 2011|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golf course expansion that had originally triggered the crisis was cancelled and the land under dispute purchased from the developers by the federal government for $5.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/oka-crisis/&lt;/ref&gt; The Oka Crisis motivated the development of a national [[Aboriginal Police Force in Canada|First Nations Policing Policy]] to try to prevent future incidents, and brought Native issues into the forefront in Canada.&lt;ref name="Canada History" /&gt; In 1991, Ouellette was re-elected mayor of Oka by [[acclamation]]. He later said of the crisis that his responsibilities as mayor required him to act as he did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Ouellette, Jean (guest); Medina, Ann (interviewer); Maitland, Alan (host) |date=11 July 1991 |title=Oka: A year later |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/civil-unrest/the-oka-crisis-1/oka-a-year-later.html|format=Audio clip |medium= |publisher=The CBC Digital Archives |location= |accessdate=2008-06-24 |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
The Oka Crisis was extensively documented and inspired numerous books and films.  Canadian filmmaker [[Alanis Obomsawin]] has made [[Documentary film|documentaries]] about the Oka Crisis, including ''[[Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance]]'' (1993) and ''Rocks at Whiskey Trench'' (2000). These and two additional documentaries on the crisis were all produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]]: Christine Welsh directed ''Keepers of the Fire'' (1994), which documented the role of Mohawk women during the crisis, and Alec MacLeod created ''Acts of Defiance'' (1993).&lt;ref name="Acts"&gt;{{cite web|last=MacLeod|first=Alex|title=Acts of Defiance|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/acts_of_defiance/|work=Documentary film|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' [[journalist]] [[Albert Nerenberg]] switched careers after smuggling a video camera behind the barricades and making his first documentary, called ''Okanada''. While serving a college [[internship]] at the Mohawk Survival School, Ric Oliveira was the only American journalist allowed to live on the reservation during the time of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsar.com/personalities/ric-oliveira&lt;/ref&gt;

Micheal Baxendale and Craig MacLaine wrote ''This Land Is Our Land: The Mohawk Revolt at Oka''. Geoffrey York and Loreen Pindera's wrote ''People of the Pines: The People and the Legacy of Oka'' (1991). Donna Goodleaf wrote ''Entering the Warzone: A Mohawk Perspective on Resisting Invasions'', which was published by Theytus Books in 1995.

[[Gerald R. Alfred]], a [[Kahnawake]] Mohawk who was part of the [[band council]] during the crisis, and who later became a professor of [[political science]], wrote ''Heeding the Voices of Our Ancestors: Kahnawake Mohawk Politics and the Rise of Native Nationalism'' (1995). This was based on his [[PhD dissertation]], which examined the issues.

[[John Ciaccia]], the [[Minister of Native Affairs]] for Quebec at the time, wrote a book about the events related to the Oka Crisis.  His book, titled ''The Oka Crisis, A Mirror of the Soul'', was published in 2000. Harry Swain, then the federal deputy minister of [[Indian Affairs and Northern Development]], wrote "Oka: a Political Crisis and its Legacy," in 2010.

[[Robin Philpot]] wrote a book about [[English Canada]]'s use of the crisis as a political tool following the failed [[Meech Lake Accord]]: ''Oka: dernier alibi du Canada anglais'' (1991).&lt;!--this is a highly POV and discriminatory statement, as "English Canada" doesn't mean the political establishment or media establishment, it means ''ALL'' Anglophone Canadians (or rather it means all non-Quebec francophones; not sure how to reword it and shouldn't be deleted but very, very "attack" and hostile towards anglophones in general. Yeah I know we all sound alike, but we're not all the same; all the weirder because it was the SQ who launched the attack, and Claude Ryan who presided over the army's and RCMP's replacement of them; anglophone politicians were nowhere to be seen --&gt;

Anarchist author and activist [[Peter Gelderloos]] has argued that the Oka Crisis should serve as a model for activists to get what they want for four reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Failure of Nonviolence|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# It was able to successfully seize territory and repel state forces
# It did not have the support of political or economic elites
# It spread ideas of indigenous sovereignty and social justice
# It was successful in stopping the construction of the golf course

==In art==
[[Joseph Tehawehron David]], a Mohawk artist who became known for his role as a warrior during the Oka Crisis in 1990, developed a body of artistic work that was deeply influenced by his experience "behind the wire" in 1990.

==In popular culture==
In the 1999 film ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'', [[Al Pacino]]'s character Lowell Bergman says "Everybody thinks Canadian Mounties ride horses and rescue ladies from rapids. Mike, they backed locals in Oka in a fight with Mohawks over building a golf course on their burial site, they beat up protestors at Kanesatake".

The Canadian [[punk rock]] band [[Propagandhi]] wrote a song titled "Oka Everywhere", which was released in 1995 on a 10-inch split album with [[I Spy (band)|I Spy]]. It was later re-released on their 1998 [[compilation album]] ''[[Where Quantity Is Job Number 1]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1793">In the field of [[security engineering]], an '''oracle attack''' is an attack that exploits the availability of a weakness in a system that can be used as an "[[test oracle|oracle]]" to give a simple go/no go indication to tell an attacker whether he or she has reached, or is nearing, their goal. The attacker can then combine the oracle with systematic search of the problem space to complete their attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/understanding-oracle-attacks-on-informat/184405917|title=Understanding Oracle Attacks|publisher=Dr. Dobbs'|author=Jason Coombs|date=2 December 2004|accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[padding oracle attack]], and compression oracle attacks such as [[BREACH]], are examples of oracle attacks, as was the practice of "crib-dragging" in the [[cryptanalysis]] of the [[Enigma machine]]. An oracle need not be 100% accurate: even a small statistical correlation with the correct go/no go result can frequently be enough for a systematic automated attack.

In a '''compression oracle attack''' the use of adaptive [[data compression]] on a mixture of [[chosen plaintext]] and unknown plaintext can result in content-sensitive changes in the length of the compressed text that can be detected even though the content of the compressed text itself is then encrypted. This can be used in protocol attacks to detect when the injected known plaintext is even partially similar to the unknown content of a secret part of the message, greatly reducing the complexity of a search for a match for the secret text. The [[CRIME]] and [[BREACH (security exploit)|BREACH]] attacks are examples of protocol attacks using this phenomenon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4994">The '''Peace Mothers''' (Kurdish: ''Dayîkên Aşîtîyê'', Turkish: ''Barış Anneleri'') is a women's [[civil rights movement]] in Turkey, which aims to promote peace between Turkey's different ethnic groups through [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] means.

==History==
The Peace Mothers dates from 1999. A member of the founding Assembly explained " We had come together to say that the dirty war should come to an end and that there should be peace among Turks and Kurds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Kurdish and Turkish Mothers: Let’s Build Peace Together!|publisher= International Fellowship of Reconciliation|date=2007-05-24|url= http://www.ifor.org/WPP/Articles/May24-2007OK.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the women involved have lost a close relative in the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]]. In the words of Türkiye Bozkurt " In 1999 we came together as mothers, whose children were either in the mountains, in prisons or had lost their lives in the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= International Women's Day for Peace and Disarmament|publisher= International Peace Bureau|year=2007|url= http://www.ipb.org/i/pdf-files/May_24-2007_Int_Womens_Day_for_Peace_and_Disarmament.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are based in [[Istanbul]] and [[Diyarbakir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Delegationsbericht der Newroz-Delegation 2008 aus München, Berlin und NRW|publisher= Deutsch-Kurdischen Gesellschaft|year=2008|url= http://www.dkg-muenchen.de/DKG%20Aktuell-Dateien/DelegationsberichtNewroz.html|accessdate=2009-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have been frequently in the news for their protests and court cases. In 2000, [[Amnesty International]] reported a delegation of Peace Mothers had allegedly been tortured and ill-treated, after they travelled to neighbouring Iraq to try to mediate between the two sides in the civil conflict in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish region]] in North [[Iraq]]. The lawyer who defended them, [[Eren Keskin]], was later put on trial for having insulted the army after her description of the alleged torture of the Peace Mothers was published in a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Memorandum from Amnesty International UK|publisher= Amnesty International|date=January 2002

In June 2006, Peace Mother activists Muyesser Gunes and Sakine Arat were sentenced to 1-year jail each and 600 YTL in Ankara 4th Criminal Court on a charge of praising a separatist organisation and its leader, after they had visited the [[Turkish General Staff|General Staff]] headquarters on 22 August 2005 to present their case. The sentence was later commuted to 10 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jail sentence to Peace Mothers|publisher= Karawane|date=2006-06-03|url= http://thecaravan.org/node/757|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''presidency''' is an [[Administration (government)|administration]] or the [[Executive (government)|executive]], the collective administrative and governmental entity that exists around an office of [[president]] of a state or nation. Although often the [[executive branch]] of government, and often personified by a single elected person who holds the office of "president," in practice, the presidency includes a much larger collective of people, such as chiefs of staff, advisers and other bureaucrats. Although often led by a single person, presidencies can also be of a collective nature, such as the presidency of the [[European Union]] is held on a rotating basis by the various national governments of the member states. Alternatively, the term presidency can also be applied to the [[First Presidency|governing authority]] of some churches, and may even refer to the holder of a non-governmental office of president in a corporation, business, charity, university, etc. or the institutional arrangement around them. For example, "the presidency of the [[Red Cross]] refused to support his idea."  Rules and support to discourage vicarious liability leading to unnecessary pressure and the early termination of term have not been clarified.  These may not be as yet supported by state let initiatives.  Contributory liability and fraud may be the two most common ways to become removed from term of office and/or to prevent re-election

==The presidency by country==

===American presidency===
{{main|President of the United States}}
[[File:Flag of the President of the United States of America.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of the President of the United States]]
In the United States the Presidency is headed by the president, who has many roles, such as:
* Chief of State: The chief public representative of a country, who may also be the head of government.
* Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces: Is the civilian commander of a nation's military forces.
* Chief Legislator: Gives information to Congress to consider through the state of the Union address and recommendations for consideration of new statutes.
* Chief Diplomat: The president is both a national spokesman and a world leader. As representative of a country of immigrants with ties around the globe, the president is expected to defend America's security and economic interests, and also to promote democratic principles and human rights internationally. Several presidents whose domestic policies were frustrated by an uncooperative Congress have focused their attention on foreign affairs, where their power and freedom to determine policy was less hindered.
* Chief Executive: A president serves as the government's chief administrative officer, with the responsibility to see that the laws are faithfully executed. The president also appoints officials, with the advice and consent of the Senate.

The United States holds their presidential election every four years. At the national convention, major and minor political parties nominate candidates for the president and vice president. Citizens then vote on the presidential and vice presidential candidate of their choice. However, these votes do not elect a candidate directly. Instead, the votes are sent to the Electoral College, and cast ballots for presidential electors. The candidate with a majority in the Electoral College will win the presidential or vice presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bardes|first=Barbara|title=American Government and Politics Today|year=2012|publisher=Steffen W. Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazilian Presidency===
{{main|President of Brazil}}
As a republic with a presidential executive, [[Brazil]] grants significant powers to the president. According to the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]], he or she effectively controls the executive branch, represents the country abroad, and appoints the [[Cabinet of Brazil|cabinet]] and, with the approval of the Federal Senate, the judges for the [[Supreme Federal Court]]. The president is also the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of Brazil|armed forces]].

The president also have significant lawmaking powers, exercised either by proposing laws to the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]], or else by using ''Medidas Provisórias'' (provisional measures), an instrument with the force of law that the president can enact in cases of urgency and necessity, except to make changes to some areas of law (provisional measures cannot be used to change criminal law, electoral law, to abolish individual rights or to alter the fundamental framework of the State — the Separation of Powers and the Federal Republic). A provisional measure comes into effect immediately, before Congress votes on it, and remains in force for up to 60 days unless Congress votes to rescind it. This 60-day period can be extended once, up to a maximum of 120 days. If Congress, on the other hand, votes to approve the provisional measure, it becomes an actual law, with changes decided by the legislative branch. The provisional measure expires at the end of the 60-day period (or 120-day, in case of extension), or sooner, if rejected by one of the Houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Constitution, art. 62 as amended by Constitutional Amendment n. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish presidency===
{{main|President of Finland}}
[[File:Flag of the President of Finland.svg|150px|thumb|Flag of the President of Finland]]
The Finnish presidency is based on a [[Parliamentary republic]] system. The president's powers were curtailed in the constitutional reform in 2000, and yet further in 2011. Currently the president leads the Finnish foreign policy together with the cabinet. EU affairs, however, fall to the prime minister's authority. The president has little domestic power. He or she can dissolve the parliament, but only at the prime minister's request. The president can choose not to ratify a bill, but this only returns it to parliament, which must then approve the bill again in order for it to become a law without the president's signature. The president's power to appoint officials has been reduced, but he or she still appoints all military officers as well as judges. The president is the Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defence Forces. The president also has the power to pardon anyone convicted of a crime. With the curtailment of the president's formal powers, many analysts have emphasized the president's position as a leader of values.

===French presidency===
{{main|President of France}}
[[File:Armoiries république française.svg|thumb|150px|Emblem of France]]
The French presidency is based on a [[semi-presidential system]] where both a [[President of France|president]] and a [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] are active participants in the day-to-day administration of the state. France's president appoints a prime minister, who then forms a government. France's presidency includes the three traditional branches: the Executive, Judicial and Legislative, but it also includes a fourth branch called the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which determines the constitutionality of new laws. 

Since the formation of the [[French Fifth Republic]] in 1958, France has had a [[semi-presidential system]]. Historically France has not had a semi-presidential system. For example, between 1875 and 1958 during the [[French Third Republic]] and [[French Fourth Republic]], France's presidency was based on a [[Parliamentary System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerdarlington.me.uk/Frenchpoliticalsystem.html |title=French political system |publisher=Rogerdarlington.me.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish presidency===
{{main|President of Ireland}}
The office of the President of Ireland ({{lang-ga|Uachtarán na hÉireann}}) is outlined in [[Constitution of Ireland|Ireland's constitution]]. The president is elected by direct popular vote. Suffrage is universal for anyone eighteen and older and is determined that anyone who is eligible to vote for members of [[Dáil Éireann]] (the lower house of parliament), is eligible to vote for the president. The vote is conducted by secret ballot. Every citizen who is thirty-five or older is eligible to be nominated for the presidency; and must be nominated by either twenty or more representatives from Houses of the [[Oireachtas]] (the national parliament) or four administrative counties. The term of office is for seven years and no president may serve more than two terms. The president must reside in or near Dublin. The president acts as chief diplomat and represents all the people of Ireland in their engagements home or abroad. The president does not have executive power, and only enacts their powers under the discretion of the rest of the government. However, the president has ultimate discretion in some instances, an example of which would be that the president can refer a bill to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] to rule on its constitutionality. Another duty of the president is to appoint the [[Taoiseach]] (prime minister), as nominated by the Dáil Éireann. The president can then appoint other ministers to the government by the nomination of the Taoiseach. The president is the commander of the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]]. The President of Ireland since 2012 is [[Michael D. Higgins]], who was elected in October 2011.

===Italian presidency===
{{main|President of Italy}}
[[File:Flag of prime minister of Italy.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of the Prime Minister of Italy]]
The Italian presidency is based on a [[Parliamentary republic]] system, where both a [[President of Italy|president]] and a [[Prime Minister of Italy|prime minister]] are active participants in administration of the state, but where the [[de facto]] the prime minister holds the majority of power, while the president remains the nominal [[head of state]].

The president is intended to represent national unity and guarantee that [[Italian politics]] complies with the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]]. Although the prime minister is considered the [[head of government]], the formal [[Italian order of precedence]] lists the office as being ceremonially the fourth most important Italian state office. It also is considered the de facto leader of the [[Italian government]]. The prime minister appoints Council of Ministers and Cabinet officials to their rightful area of office.  The president of the Republic gives wide support across all political parties.  The president of the Republic appoints Italy’s prime minister and accepts advice from the prime minister. The Italian government includes the traditional three branches: Executive, Judicial and Legislative.

===Australian chief executive===
{{main|Governor-General of Australia}}
Australia has a constitutional monarchy – a form of government in which a monarch acts as the head of state within the parameters of a constitution.  The constitution could be written, unconfined or blended. It uses what is called a "Parliamentary System of Government,"  one that administers the executive branch which then gets Democratic legitimacy from the Legislature.

===German presidency===
{{main|President of Germany}}
The head of state is the President of Germany, where the president completes a five-year term and can be reelected after that five-year term for only one time. He has similar roles like to other countries. He represents Germany as the Commander-in-chief of the military, He has the role of being the Minister of Defense and Germany cannot declare a state of war without the approval of the president. The president then appoints what is called a chancellor, which is known as Germany’s Head of state. Which the role is pretty comparable to a prime minister like in other countries. There are many roles the chancellor has here are a few of them. The chancellor provides basic law and for their party, it determines the composition of the Federal Cabinet. But the president then gives recommendation on appointing and dismissing Cabinet Minister, through the Federal Cabinet. The chancellor then goes by three main principles. The first is called the Chancellor Principles in which he or she is responsible for all government policies. The Second one is called The Principle of ministerial autonomy in which the chancellor prepares everything for the legislative and proposes other laws threw the Cabinet and the third one is called Cabinet Principle were this calls for disagreements between federal ministers over Jurisdictional or Budgeting relative things, in which is settled by the Cabinet. Germany has what is called a Federal legislative power which is divided between the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. The Bundestag is elected by the German people. To were the Bundestrat represents the regional states. It seems that Bundestag is more powerful than the Bundesrat. The reason is because bundestag has more powers and responsibilities of that the states given to it. The judicial branch of Germany has three courts which are the Ordinary Courts, Specialized Courts and the Constitutional Courts. Ordinary courts, deal with criminal and civil cases. Specialized Courts, deal with administrative, labor, social, fiscal, and patent law and Constitutional Courts deal with more of judicial review and constitutional interpretation. The big thing in Germany constitution is individual liberty, which gives protection to individual liberty in an extensive catalogue of human rights and also divides powers between the federal and state levels which are between the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches.

===Icelandic presidency===
{{main|President of Iceland}}
Iceland’s government is a constitutional republic, with three distinct separate branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Is Iceland Governed?|url=http://www.government.is/how-iceland-is-governed/|publisher=Government Offices of Iceland|accessdate=15 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The head of the government is the prime minister, who makes up part of the executive branch.

However the president cannot hold a seat in the Althingi. The president’s term in office begins on the first of August. According to the twelfth article of Iceland’s Constitution, the president must live in or near Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution|url=http://www.government.is/constitution|publisher=Government Offices of Iceland|accessdate=15 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking office the president must take an oath to uphold the Constitution.

===Russian presidency===
{{main|President of Russia}}
[[File:Standard of the President of the Russian Federation.svg|thumb|150px|Standard of the President of Russia]] 
According to the Constitution of Russia, the country is a federation and semi-presidential republic, wherein the president is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government.
The President of the Russian Federation is the head of state, supreme commander-in-chief and holder of the highest office within the Russian Federation. Despite the fact that the Constitution of Russia does not explicitly determine the president as the head of the executive branch, executive power is de facto split between the president and the prime minister, who is the head of government. 

=== Switzerland presidency ===
{{main|President of the Swiss Confederation}}
The unique aspect of Switzerland’s government and politics is that any one citizen can challenge any law voted by federal parliament and any citizen can introduce a new amendment to the federal constitution, which makes Switzerland the closest example of a direct democracy in the world today. In definition, a [[direct democracy]] is the extraordinary amount of participation a citizen can have in the legislation process. The adaption of direct democracy for Switzerland, however, dates all the way back to the 12th century during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Switzerland's Direct Democracy|url=http://direct-democracy.geschichte-schweiz.ch/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of Switzerland is a current member of Switzerland’s executive branch, which is the seven-member Swiss Federal Council. Presidential power in Switzerland is limited, consistent with its commitment to direct democracy. Any Swiss citizen eligible to be a member of the National Council can be elected; candidates do not have to register for the election or to actually be members of the National Council. Unlike most countries, where the presidential term can be up to eight years (two four-year terms), the [[President of the Swiss Confederation]] is only appointed one year at a time. The President of the Confederation chairs the meetings of the Federal Council and undertakes special representational duties, while continuing to head their department. The Swiss president is not the Head of State of the country; the Federal Council administers both the Head of State and the Head of Government, which emphasizes that the executive power is not concentrated on only one person. Traditionally the duty of presidency rotates among the members in order of seniority and the previous year's vice president becomes president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadians for Direct Democracy|url=http://www.npsnet.com/cdd/cdd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vice presidency ==

===American vice presidency ===
[[File:Seal of the Vice President of the United States.svg|thumb|100px|Seal of the Vice President of the United States]]
{{Main|Vice President of the United States}}
In the United States, the vice president is the second in command of the country and also presides as the [[President of the Senate]]. The vice president may break tie votes in the Senate chamber and also may be assigned additional duties by the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Constitution Article 2 Section 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vice president is sometimes chosen for election purposes, to help counterbalance the presidential candidate's weakness. For many vice presidents their duties have not been strenuous, but, more recently these duties have increased as more responsibilities are delegated by the president. In the case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice president. The vice president's salary, as of 2011, is $230,700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Longley|first=Robert|title=Presidential Pay and compensation|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/thepresidentandcabinet/a/presidentialpay.htm|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vice president position of the United States is unique in that "it is the only office that participates in two of the three branches of government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vice President in Congress|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/vice-president4.htm|work=Vice President|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazilian vice presidency===
[[File:Flag of the Vice President of Brazil.svg|thumb|100px|Flag of the Vice President of Brazil]]
{{Main|Vice President of Brazil}}
The vice president assumes the presidency of the Federative Republic of Brazil in the event that the president can not carry out their duties. The vice president also becomes the "acting president" when the president is away or not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Presidential Line of Succession|url=http://www.enotes.com/topic/Brazilian_presidential_line_of_succession|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Deputy Prime Minister===
{{Main|Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom}}
Like many parliamentary systems, the prime minister may appoint a deputy prime minister, who serves many of the duties of a traditional vice president. As the deputy prime minister possesses no [[de jure]] powers, they will not automatically assume the duties of the prime minister, in the event of their in-capitation or resignation. The position is often considered one of honor and hence holds many traditional vice presidency powers in a [[de facto]] manner.

===German vice chancellor===
The [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]] does not assume the position of chancellor, but rather the president chooses a minister to succeed the chancellor position. The vice chancellor is usually a member of the cabinet.

==Presidential transition in the United States==
In the United States, a presidential election is held every four years. While transitions between presidents are peaceful, they are highly complicated and expensive. After the president-elect is sworn in, one of his primary obligations is to build his administration. The most publicized of these duties is appointing members of his Cabinet (Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Defense, et cetera).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential obligations|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/thepresidentandcabinet/a/prestrans.htm|work=Transition of Presidents|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In total, the president makes 6,000 to 9,000 appointments, although he has the right to appoint as many as 700,000 to the federal bureaucracy. Sometimes, a president will allow appointments from the previous administration to maintain their position.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powers of the President of the United States#Powers of Appointment]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Normally these appointments include: Cabinet Officers and heads of other executive branch agencies; Under Secretaries; Assistant Secretaries; Directors of Bureaus and Services; and Chairpersons and Members of Boards, Commissions, and Committees. Theses appointments are often authorized by specific provisions of law or approved by the Senate. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential appointments|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRI-2008/html/CRI-2008-PRESIDENTIAL-APPOINTMENTS.htm|work=Plum Book|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1963, the president-elect paid for his own smooth transition. In 1963, Congress passed the Presidential Transition Act, which allocates up to $900,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential Transition Act|url=http://gsa.gov/portal/content/103158|work=Presidential Transition Act|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three different types of positions that the president can delegate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Branches of Delegates|url=http://www.opm.gov/transition/trans20r-ch1.htm|work=Administrational Transition|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different pay levels for Executive employees, ranging from $114,500 to $157,000. Civilian Payroll for Executive Agencies is nearly 12 million a year. Executive Direct Compensation was $129,923 million and personal benefits were $47,596 million.

== The impeachment or removal of a president ==
A president may be removed or impeached from their position in a nation's government for breaking or disregarding various laws or procedures that are written by that nation. The removal or impeachment process varies depending on the nation and their specific form of government. For example, the impeachment process of the president of the United States is quite different from that of France. The president of France is granted what is called the power of immunity throughout their term as the president. This power of immunity states that the president cannot be prosecuted or requested to testify before any jurisdiction. However, they may still be impeached only by the High Court. The High Court is a court conveyed by both houses of Parliament. In the United States, the impeachment process begins in the House of Representatives, where the president is first accused of committing either bribery, treason, or other high crimes including misdemeanors. If the House passes a majority vote to impeach the president, the Senate then conducts the trial to remove them from office. If a president is found guilty, he is removed from office and replaced by the vice president for the remainder of the term. If the president is acquitted in court, he will continue to serve the rest of their term as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bardes|first=Barbara|title=American Government and Politics Today|year=2012|publisher=Schmidt|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection of the presidency==

===Protection for former Presidents of the United States===
For former presidents who had entered office before January 1, 1997 are entitled to lifetime protection carried out by [[United States Secret Service|The Secret Service]]. Protection of the president's spouse is also granted until death or in the case of remarriage. In 1984 the ability to decline Secret Service protection was enacted by legislation enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential Pay and Compensation|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/thepresidentandcabinet/a/presidentialpay.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The costs of protecting former presidents and dependents are not publicized by the Secret Service due to security reasoning. Former presidents who entered office after January 1, 1997 are limited to ten years of protection for themselves and their spouses. A spouse’s protection ends upon divorce, remarriage, or the former president’s death.
According to the [[25th Amendment]] to the United States Constitution, the death of a president still active in office is automatically entitles his or hers spouse to one year of protective services. However, authorization of protection can be issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Children of former presidents, up to the age of 16, are guaranteed the same services as long as the time period does not surpass 10 years. In addition to direct protection, the Secret Service was entitled to investigate any potential threats against the former presidents and their dependents by the Presidential Threat Protection Act passed in 2000. The act passed by the 106th Congress can be deciphered as so: To amend section 879 of title 18, United States Code, to provide clearer coverage over threats against former presidents and members of their families, and for other purposes.

==Presidential line of succession==

===United States===
{{Main|United States presidential line of succession}}
The original Constitution of the United States only provided for the vice president to succeed the president in the event that the president becomes incapacitated. In the case that both the president and vice president are incapacitated, Congress will appoint an acting president. In 1791, the founders of the United States provided for only the vice president to usurp the president and was in effect until 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential Line of Succession 1791-1947|url=http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/a_succession.htm|work=Presidential Line of Succession 1791-1947|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, this changed with the passing of the [[Presidential Succession Act]], which allows for the Speaker of the House, the President Pro Tempore, and the cabinet to succeed the president. Before the passage of the Presidential Succession Act, succession was set up to keep the Executive branch of the presidency separate from the Legislative branch.

The first Presidential Succession Act (valid 1886-1947):
# Vice President
# Secretary of State
# Secretary of Treasury
# Secretary of War

Presidential line as of 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential Line of Succession|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_succ.html|work=Presidential Line of Succession|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Vice President
# Speaker of the House of Representatives
# President Pro Tempore of the Senate
# Members of Cabinet

===Brazil===
{{main|Brazilian presidential line of succession}}
# [[Vice-President of Brazil]]
# [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil]]
# [[President of the Senate of Brazil]]
# President of the Supreme Federal Court

In the event that the president and vice president become incapacitated, the line of succession falls sequentially to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Senate, and the president of the Federal Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal—STF).
If less than half of the mandate has been completed, a supplementary election must be called within ninety days. If more than half the mandate has been completed, the Congress elects a new president and vice president within thirty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil's Presidential Line of Succession|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-1762.html|work=Brazil's Government|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidential, vice presidential, and legislative compensation ==

=== United States ===
* Compensation of U.S President
The United States presidential salary cap is $400,000 per year. The current salary cap was set in 2001, designed to account for cost-of-living increases. [[George W. Bush]] was the first U.S. President to receive this amount. Previous to 2001, the salary cap was set at $200,000 per year. In addition to the base salary, in 1949, the president began receiving a $50,000 expense account. Details and rules for the compensation of the U.S presidency can be found in [[the United States Constitution]] under Article II, Section I&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= U.S. Constitution, Article II|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the U.S Code under Title III, Chapter II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 USC § 15 - COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES IN CONGRESS|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Additional Expense Accounts
In addition to the $50,000 expense account for the president implemented in 1949, he or she also receives numerous other expense reimbursements. These funds are set aside to cover expenses including official expenses of the White House office, entertainment expenses and traveling expenses for anyone who travels with the president. Also, there is an “Unanticipated Needs” account awarded. This account is not to exceed over $1 million per year and acts as a back up for an instance in which the president exceeds budgeting in other accounts.

* Retirement for the presidency

Once the president is no longer in office he or she receives an annual pension of at least $150,000. The pension is to be equal to that of a current cabinet member. Additional perks are given to the former presidents, including free postal service and up to $96,000 for office space. Also, after their term has expired, former presidents are allotted $150,000 per year to help with the transition from presidency to civilian life for the first 30 months after leaving office.

'''Qualified person''' ('''QP''') is a technical term used in [[European Union]] [[pharmaceutical]] regulation ([[Directive 2001/83/EC]] for Medicinal products for human use).  The regulations specify that no batch of medicinal product can be released for sale or supply prior to certification by a QP that the batch is in accordance with the relevant requirements.([[EudraLex]], Volume 4, Chapter 1) The QP is typically a licensed [[pharmacist]], [[biologist]] or [[chemist]] (or a person with another permitted academic qualification) who has several years' experience working in pharmaceutical manufacturing operations, and has passed examinations attesting to his or her knowledge. 
The requirement for QP oversight has been extended to material for use in clinical trials since the introduction of EU Directive 2001/20/EC.

In countries that are part of the [[Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme]] (PIC/S), the same role may be termed '''responsible person''' ('''RP''') or '''authorized person''' ('''AP''').

The system is designed for [[force protection]], border security, [[disaster response]] and other missions.&lt;ref&gt; “[https://www.logostech.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Logos_Redkite_WAPS_Brochure_01042017._web.pdf  Redkite: Lightweight Wide-Area Motion Imagery for Manned and Unmanned Aircraft].” Logos Technologies. Retrieved 17 May 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; Weighing less than 35 pounds, Redkite is equipped with a 50-plus megapixel electro-optical camera and an onboard, eight-hour data processing/storage unit. This allows users to both image a city-sized area as well as conduct analyses of live and recorded imagery in the air, in real time. &lt;ref&gt;Mizokami, Kyle. “[https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a25515/redkite-drone-surveillance/ Tiny Drone-Based Surveillance System Can Watch Over a Entire Small Town].” Popular Mechanics. 2 March 2017.

Retrieved 17 May 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

The Redkite WAMI system comes in two versions. It is either housed in a pod that can be mounted to the hard point of a plane, helicopter, and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)]], or it can be integrated directly into the payload bay of a tactical UAV (or [[U.S. military UAS groups|U.S. Department of Defense Group 3 unmanned aircraft system]]). &lt;ref&gt; Turnbull, Grant. ”[https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/digital-battlespace/ausa-2017-redkite-i-soars-final-testing/ AUSA 2017: Redkite-I soars to final testing.]” Shephard Media Digital Battlespace. 11 October 2017. Retrieved 17 May 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; In terms of capability, Redkite resembles systems used by the U.S. military in both Iraq and Afghanistan, such as [[Constant Hawk]] and [[Kestrel (surveillance system)|Kestrel]] Block I, but much lighter than these fielded sensors. &lt;ref&gt;Howard, Courtney. “[http://www.intelligent-aerospace.com/articles/2016/09/hpec-enables-onboard-data-processing-for-persistent-surveillance.html  HPEC enables onboard data processing for persistent surveillance.]” Intelligent Aerospace. 22 September 2016. Retrieved 17 May 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The podded version of the Redkite WAMI sensor was first prototyped by Logos Technologies in May 2014. It weighed 35 pounds and, at the time, lacked processing electronics. Since then, company engineers have been creating lighter, more sophisticated versions of the system. In May 2016, the company unveiled a version of the podded Redkite system weighing less than 30 pounds at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) in Tampa, Fla. And Logos Technologies has been working on a version weighing nearly 20 pounds for smaller UAVs, or Group 2 unmanned aircraft systems. &lt;ref&gt; “[https://www.azosensors.com/news.aspx?newsID=11143 OFIC to Feature Logos’ Weight-Reduced Redkite Wide-Area Motion Imagery Sensor.]” Azo Sensors. 17 May 2016. Retrieved 17 May 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Capabilities==

When flown 12,000 feet above ground level, Redkite images a 12-square kilometer area in real time and medium resolution—allowing the WAMI system to detect and track multiple, geographically dispersed targets at once. &lt;ref&gt; “[https://www.logostech.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Logos_Redkite_WAPS_Brochure_01042017._web.pdf  Redkite: Lightweight Wide-Area Motion Imagery for Manned and Unmanned Aircraft].” Logos Technologies. Retrieved 17 May 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; Redkite can also cue a narrow-field, high-resolution video cameras to identify people and vehicles that have been detected. &lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Graham. “[https://www.logostech.net/mag-logos-partnership-featured-aviation-weekly/ MAG Offers Turnkey Wide-area Surveillance With Logos Sensor].” Aviation Week. 12 May 2016. Retrieved 17 May 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; Users on the ground can access up to 10 different video feeds, or “chip-outs,” pulled from the WAMI system’s vast field of view and have them displayed in windows on their mobile devices while the system is still in the air. &lt;ref&gt;“[https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/digital-battlespace/logos-introduces-redkite-wami-sensor/ Logos introduces Redkite WAMI sensor].” Shepherd Media Digital Battlespace. 4 June 2015.

Retrieved 17 May 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==

The Redkite WAMI system was first tested on manned aircraft: on the [[Eurocopter AS350]] Écureuil, in December 2014, and the [[Cessna 206]] Caravan, in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt; “[http://www.officer.com/product/12082306/logos-technologies-llc-redkite Redkite Compact, Ultra-lightweight, Wide-area Motion Imagery (WAMI) Sensor System].” Officer.com. 10 June 2015.

Retrieved 17 May 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; However, given its light weight and compact size, Redkite has also been tested on Group 3 unmanned aircraft systems.

The first such test was with the Boeing Insitu Integrator (flown by the U.S. Navy and Marines as the [[RQ-21 Blackjack]]) in February 2017, with a follow-on conducted in May. For those demonstrations, Redkite was integrated directly into the payload bay of the Integrator. &lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.auvsi.org/logos-technologies-and-insitu-conduct-first-flight-integrator-tactical-uas-equipped-redkite-wide Logos Technologies and Insitu Conduct First Flight of Integrator Tactical UAS Equipped With Redkite Wide-Area Sensor.]” AUVSI News. 15 February 2017.

Retrieved 17 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The podded version of Redkite was tested on the TigerShark, a [[Navmar Applied Sciences Corporation|NAVMAR Applied Sciences Corporation]] (NASC) UAV, in June 2017. The five-day demonstration was conducted in Yuma, Arizona, under the auspices of U.S. Naval Air Command. &lt;ref&gt;Fein, Geoff. “[http://www.janes.com/article/72524/logos-tests-ultra-lightweight-wami-pod-on-group-3-uav Logos tests ultra-lightweight WAMI pod on Group 3 UAV].” Jane’s International Defence Review. 21 July 2017. Retrieved 17 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

In 2018, Redkite won two industry awards: one from Aviation Week (“Defense: Best New Product”) &lt;ref&gt; “[https://laureates.aviationweek.com/en/winners/2018-winners.html Aviation Week Laureates: 2018 Winners].” Aviation Week. 1 March 2018.

'''Robert Underwood Ayres''' (born June 29, 1932) is an American-born physicist and economist. His career has focused on the application of physical ideas, especially the laws of [[thermodynamics]], to [[economics]]; a long-standing pioneering interest in material flows and transformations ([[industrial ecology]] or [[industrial metabolism]])—a concept which he originated.&lt;ref name=AyresBio2010/&gt; His most recent work challenges the widely held [[Economic growth|economic theory of growth]].

==Career==
Trained as a physicist at the [[University of Chicago]], [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and [[King's College London]] (PhD in Mathematical Physics), Ayres has dedicated his professional life to advancing the environment, technology and resource end of the [[sustainability]] agenda. His major research interests include technological change, [[environmental economics]], "industrial metabolism" and "eco-restructuring". He has worked at the [[Hudson Institute]] (1962–67), Resources for the Future Inc (1968) and International Research and Technology Corp (1969–76). From 1979 until 1992 he was Professor of Engineering and Public Policy at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, except for two years (and six summers) on leave at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA) in Laxenburg Austria. In 1992 he moved to the international business school [[INSEAD]] in Fontainebleau, France as Sandoz (later Novartis) Professor of Environment and Management. Since his formal retirement in 2000 he has been Jubilee Visiting Professor (2000–2001) and king Karl Gustav XVI professor of environmental science (2004–2005) at [[Chalmers Institute of Technology]] Gothenburg (Sweden). He is currently an Institute Scholar at IIASA.

He remains an active researcher. He has written or co-authored 20 books, edited or coedited another dozen books, written or co-authored more than 200 journal articles and book chapters not to mention many unpublished reports, on subjects ranging from environmental effects of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] to theoretical economics. But most of his life-work is [[interdisciplinary]]. He was a pioneer of a new field, sometimes called Industrial Metabolism or [[Industrial Ecology]]. He has contributed to [[futures studies]], [[technological forecasting]], transportation and energy studies, material flow studies (`dematerialization'), environmental technology, [[environmental economics]], thermodynamics and economics, and the theory of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/profiles/rayres/ |title=insead - faculty &amp; research - Robert U. Ayres |publisher=Insead.edu |date=2002-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here taken from one of his recent papers are two paragraphs that provide a flavor of his recent work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mainstream economics today is based to a large extent on bad ideas. Economic concepts, from foundational issues like markets, supply and demand and “free trade”,  to money and finance, lack any systematic awareness of the physical process of production or the implications of the Laws of Thermodynamics  for those processes. A corollary, almost worthy of being a separate bad idea on its own, is that energy doesn’t matter (much) because the cost share of energy in the economy is so small that it can be ignored e.g. {Denison, 1984 #6184}. The so-called “production functions” used by all schools of economic thought that build growth models omit any necessary role for energy, as if output could be produced by labor and capital alone—or as if energy is merely a form of man-made capital that can be produced (as opposed to extracted) by labor and capital.

The essential truth missing from economic education today is that energy is the stuff of the universe, that all matter is also a form of energy, and that the economic system is essentially a system for extracting, processing and transforming energy as resources into energy embodied in products and services. This is a thermodynamic process, as the Rumanian economist Georgescu-Roegen said half a century ago (Georgescu-Roegen 1971). The economic process is subject to both the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of mass/energy; nothing can be created or destroyed) and the second law of thermodynamics (increasing entropy; all transformation processes are irreversible). The “first law” implies that the notion of “consumption” as applied to products is misleading: material transformation processes unavoidably generate large quantities of material wastes or residuals {Ayres, 1969 #284;{Ayres, 1989 #424}.  Some of those wastes are merely inconvenient but others are harmful or toxic. The second law says that energy becomes less useful (exergy is destroyed) by every action.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

There is much more to be said along these lines. Key publications reflecting these (and some other) important ideas are given in the bibliography below.

A '''short swing''' rule restricts [[Corporate title|officers]] and insiders of a company from making short-term profits at the expense of the firm. It is part of [[United States securities law|United States federal securities law]], and is a prophylactic measure intended to guard against so-called [[insider trading]].&lt;ref&gt;See William A. Klein et al., Business Associations, 511 (6th ed. Foundation Press)(2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The rule mandates that if an officer, director, or any shareholder holding more than 10% of outstanding shares of a [[publicly traded]] company makes a profit on a transaction with respect to the company's stock during a given six-month period, that officer, director, or shareholder must pay the difference back to the company.&lt;ref&gt;The statutory text of the rule can be found at section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, codified at 15 U.S.C. section 78p(b).&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the profit calculated is the maximum considering each pair of sales and purchases, a larger trade could be paired with trades up to six month prior as well as up to six months later and the correct calculation is a linear programming problem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://16b.law.unc.edu/frontend/home.html|title=Short-Swing Profit Liability Calculator for Insider Trading Under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934|website=16b.law.unc.edu|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated by a federal circuit court of appeals: {{quote|In order to achieve its goals [of curbing the evils of insider trading], Congress chose a relatively arbitrary rule capable of easy administration. The objective standard of Section 16(b) imposes [[strict liability]] upon substantially all transactions occurring within the statutory time period, regardless of the [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] of the insider or the existence of actual [[speculation]]. This approach maximized the ability of the rule to eradicate speculative abuses by reducing difficulties in [[Evidence (law)|proof]]. Such arbitrary and sweeping coverage was deemed necessary to insure the optimum prophylactic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Bershad v. McDonough, 428 F.2d 693, 696 (7th Cir. 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Forms of government}}
{{Democracy}}

'''Sociocracy''', also known as '''dynamic governance''', is a system of governance which seeks to achieve solutions that create harmonious social environments as well as productive organizations and businesses.  It is distinguished by the use of consent rather than majority voting in decision-making, and decision-making after discussion by people who know each other. 

The Sociocratic Circle-Organization Method (SCM) was developed in the Netherlands by electrical engineer and entrepreneur [[Gerard Endenburg]] and is based on the work of peace activists and educators Betty Cadbury and [[Kees Boeke]] and is a recent instantiation of the approach.

== Origins ==
The word sociocracy is derived from the [[Latin]] ''socius'' meaning companions, colleagues, or associates; and c''ratia'' which refers to the ruling class, as in the aristocracy, plutocracy, democracy, and sociocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was coined in 1851 by French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neerlandistiek.nl/publish/articles/000078/article.html|language=dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a parallel to sociology, the science that studies how people organize themselves into social systems. Comte believed that a government led by sociologists would use scientific methods to meet the needs of all the people, not just the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte|last=Comte|first=Auguste|publisher=London: Bell &amp; Sons|year=1896|isbn=|location=Library of Congress|pages=|translator-last=Martineau|translator-first=Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[Lester Frank Ward]] in an 1881 paper for the ''Penn Monthly'' was an active advocate of a sociocracy to replace the political competition created by majority vote.

Ward expanded his concept of sociocracy in ''Dynamic Sociology'' (1883) and ''The Psychic Factors of Civilization'' (1892). Ward believed that a highly educated public was essential if a country was to be governed effectively, and he foresaw a time when the emotional and partisan nature of contemporary politics would yield to a much more effective, dispassionate, and scientific discussion of issues and problems. Democracy would thus eventually evolve into a more advanced form of government, sociocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Lester F. (1893). "Sociocracy," from The Psychic Factors of Civilization.

The Dutch pacifist, educator, and peace worker [[Kees Boeke]] and his wife, English peace activist [[Beatrice Cadbury]], updated and expanded Ward's ideas in the mid-20th century by implementing the first sociocratic organizational structure in a school in [[Bilthoven]], Netherlands. The school still exists: the Children's Community Workshop (Werkplaats Kindergemeenschap). Boeke saw sociocracy (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Sociocratie'') as a form of governance or [[management]] that presumes equality of individuals and is based on consensus. This equality is not expressed with the '[[one man, one vote]]' law of democracy but rather by a group of individuals reasoning together until a decision is reached that is satisfactory to each one of them.

To make sociocratic ideals operational, Boeke used consensus decision-making based on the practices of the [[Quakers]], which he described as one of the first sociocratic organizations. The other being his school of approximately 400 students and teachers in which decisions were made by everyone working together in weekly "talkovers" to find a mutually acceptable solution. The individuals in each group would then agree to abide by the decision. "Only when common agreement is reached can any action be taken, quite a different atmosphere is created from that arising from majority rule." Boeke defined three "fundamental rules": (1) That the interests of all members must be considered and the individual must respect the interests of the whole. (2) No action could be taken without a solution that everyone could accept, and (3) all members must accept these decisions when unanimously made. If a group could not make a decision, the decision would be made by a "higher level" of representatives chosen by each group. The size of a decision-making group should be limited to 40 with smaller committees of 5-6 making "detailed decisions." For larger groups a structure of representatives is chosen by these groups to make decisions.&lt;ref name="Boeke, Kees 1945"&gt;Boeke, Kees (1945). Sociocracy:Democracy as It Might Be. Online at worldteacher.faithweb.com/sociocracy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This model placed a high importance on the role of trust. For the process to be effective, members of each group must trust each other, and it is claimed that this trust will be built over time as long as this method of decision-making is used. When applied to civic governance, people "would be forced to take an interest in those who live close by." Only when people had learned to apply this method in their neighborhoods could the next higher level of sociocratic governance be established. Eventually representatives would be elected from the highest local levels to establish a "World Meeting to govern and order the world." &lt;ref name="Boeke, Kees 1945"/&gt;

"Everything depends on a new spirit breaking through among men. May it be that, after the many centuries of fear, suspicion and hate, more and more a spirit of reconciliation and mutual trust will spread abroad. The constant practice of the art of sociocracy and of the education necessary for it seem to be the best way in which to further this spirit, upon which the real solution of all world problems depends."&lt;ref name="Boeke, Kees 1945"/&gt;

== In contemporary practice ==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s [[Gerard Endenburg]], an electrical engineer and former student of Boeke's, further developed and applied Boeke's principles in the electrical engineering company he first managed for his parents and then owned. Endenburg wanted to replicate in a business environment the atmosphere of cooperation and harmony he had experienced in the Boekes school. He also recognized that in industrial production with a diverse and changing workforce, he couldn't wait for workers to trust each other before they could make decisions. To solve this problem, Endenburg worked by analogy to integrate his understanding of physics, [[cybernetics]], and systems thinking to further develop the social, political, and educational theories of Comte, Ward, and Boeke. Since he understood how mechanical and electrical systems worked, he applied these principles to human systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociocracy: A Deeper Democracy|last=Buck|first=John|last2=Villines|first2=Sharon|publisher=Washington DC: Sociocracy.info Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0979282706|location=|pages=31-50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of experimentation and application, Endenburg developed a formal organizational method named the "Sociocratische Kringorganisatie Methode" (Sociocratic Circle Organizing Method). Endenburg's method was based on the circular feedback process, then called the "circular causal feedback process," now referred to commonly as the circular process and feedback loops. The Sociocratic Circle Organization Method uses a hierarchy of circles corresponding to units or departments of an organization, but it is a circular hierarchy—the links between each circle combine to form feedback loops up and down the organization. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

All policy decisions, those that pertain to the allocation of resources and constrain operational decisions, require the consent of all members of a circle. Day-to-day operational decisions are made by the operations leader within the policies established in circle meetings. Policy decisions affecting more than one circle's domain are made by a higher circle formed by representatives from each circle. This structure of linked circles that make decisions by consent maintains the efficiency of a hierarchy while preserving the equivalence of the circles and their members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Endenburg began testing and modifying his application of Boeke's principles in the mid-sixties. By the mid-seventies, Endenburg began consulting with other businesses to apply his methods and eventually began working with all kinds organizations.

In the nineteen eighties, Endenburg and his colleague Annewiek Reijmer founded the Sociocratisch Centrum (Sociocratic Center) in Rotterdam, and began helping other organizations in the Netherlands to adopt the approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website of The Sociocracy Group|url=http://www.sociocratie.nl/global/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2|publisher=Sociocratisch Centrum|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
=== Essential principles ===
Endenburg's policy decision-making method was originally published as based on four essential principles in order to emphasize that the process of selecting people for roles and responsibilities was also subject to the consent process. As explained below, it is now taught as Endenburg originally developed the method as three principles:&lt;ref&gt;Endenburg, Gerard (1998). Sociocracy: The organization of decision-making. Eburon. {{ISBN|90-5166-605-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consent governs policy decision making (principle 1) ====
Decisions are made when there are no remaining "paramount objections", that is, when there is informed consent from all participants. Objections must be [[reason]]ed and argued and based on the ability of the objector to work productively toward the goals of the organization. All [[policy|policy decisions]] are made by consent, although the group may consent to use another [[Group decision making|decision-making method]]. Within these policies, day-to-day operational decisions are normally made in the traditional manner. Generally, objections are highly valued to hear every stakeholder's concern. This process is sometimes called "objection harvesting".&lt;ref name="sociocracy30.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociocracy30.org/the-details/circles-and-decision-making/|title=A Practical Guide|date=28 January 2017|website=sociocracy30.org|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is emphasized that focusing on objections first leads to more efficient decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sociocracy.info/moving-objections/|title=Moving Objections to the Beginning|date=24 December 2014|website=sociocracy.info|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Organizing in circles (principle 2) ====
The sociocratic organization is composed of a hierarchy of semi-[[Autonomy|autonomous]] circles. This hierarchy, however, does not constitute a power structure as [[Autocracy|autocratic]] hierarchies do. Each circle has the responsibility to execute, measure, and control its own processes in achieving its goals. It governs a specific domain of responsibility within the policies of the larger organization. Circles are also responsible for their own [[Self-determination theory#Competence|development]] and for each member's development. Often called "[[Self-determination theory#Intrinsic motivation|integral education]]," the circle and its members are expected to determine what they need to know to remain competitive in their field and to reach the goals of their circle.

==== Double-linking (principle 3) ====
Individuals acting as links function as full members in the decision-making of both their own circles and the next higher circle. A circle's operational leader is by definition a member of the next higher circle and [[Organizational communication#Direction of communication|represents the larger organization]] in the decision-making of the circle they lead. Each circle also elects a representative to represent the circles' interests in the next higher circle. These links form a feedback loop between circles.

At the highest level of the organization, there is a “top circle”, analogous to a [[board of directors]], except that it works within the policies of the circle structure rather than ruling over it. The members of the top circle include external experts that connect the organization to its environment. Typically these members have expertise in law, government, finance, community, and the organization's mission. In a corporation, it might also include a representative selected by the shareholders. The top circle also includes the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and at least one representative of the general management circle. Each of these circle members participates fully in decision-making in the top circle.

==== Elections by consent (principle 4) ====
This fourth principle extends principle 1. Individuals are elected to roles and responsibilities in open discussion using the same consent criteria used for other policy decisions. Members of the circle nominate themselves or other members of the circle and present reasons for their choice. After discussion, people can (and often do) change their nominations, and the discussion leader will suggest the election of the person for whom there are the strongest arguments. Circle members may object and there is further discussion. For a role that many people might fill, this discussion may continue for several rounds. When fewer people are qualified for the task, this process will quickly converge. The circle may also decide to choose someone who is not a current member of the circle.

==== The "three principles" ====
In the first formulations of the Sociocratic Circle-Organizing Method, Endenburg had three principles and regarded the fourth, elections by consent, not as a separate principle but as a method for making decisions by consent when there are several choices. He considered it part of the first principle, consent governs policy decisions, but many people misunderstood that elections of people to roles and responsibilities are allocations of resources and thus policy decisions. To emphasize the importance of making these decisions by consent in the circle meetings, Endenburg separated it into a fourth principle.

====Consent vs. consensus====
Sociocracy makes a distinction between "consent" and "consensus" in order to emphasize that circle decisions are not expected to produce "a consensus". It doesn't mean agreement or solidarity. In sociocracy consent is defined as "no objections," and objections are based on one's ability to work toward the aims of the organization. Members discussing an idea in consent based governance commonly ask themselves if it is "good enough for now, safe enough to try".&lt;ref name="sociocracy30.org"/&gt; If not, then there is an objection, which leads to a search for an acceptable adaptation of the original proposal to gain consent.

Sociocratisch Centrum co-founder Reijmer has summarized the difference as follows:&lt;ref name="Quarter2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Quarter|title=Beyond the Bottom Line: Socially Innovative Business Owners|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zc_jw8hsoFIC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-56720-414-8|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; "By consensus, I must convince you that I am in the right; by consent, you ask whether you can live with the decision."

===Interdependence and transparency===
The principles are interdependent and the application of all of them is required for an organization to function sociocratically. Each one supports the successful application of the others. The principles also require transparency in the organization. Since decision-making is distributed throughout the organization, all members of the organization must have access to information. The only exception to this is proprietary knowledge and any information that would jeopardize the security of the organization or its clients. All financial transactions and policy decisions are [[radical transparency|transparent]] to members of the organization and to the organization's clients.

In addition to the principles, sociocratic organizations apply the circular feedback process of directing-doing-measuring to the design of work processes, and in business organizations, compensation is based on a market rate salary plus long-term and short-term payments based on the success of the circle. The operational practices of sociocratic organizations are compatible with the best practices of contemporary management theory.

'''''Ted 2''''' is a 2015 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Seth MacFarlane]] and written by MacFarlane, [[Alec Sulkin]] and [[Wellesley Wild]], and is a [[sequel]] to the 2012 film ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]''. The film stars [[Mark Wahlberg]] and MacFarlane, and follows the talking teddy bear Ted as he fights for civil rights in order to be recognized as a person. The film also stars [[Amanda Seyfried]] (who replaces [[Mila Kunis]] as Wahlberg's love interest), with [[Giovanni Ribisi]] and [[Jessica Barth]] reprising their roles and [[John Slattery]] and [[Morgan Freeman]] joining the cast.

[[Principal photography]] began in [[Massachusetts]] in July 2014. ''Ted 2'' was released on June 26, 2015, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film grossed over $216 million and received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
John Bennett has been divorced from Lori Collins for five months. Meanwhile, his best friend Ted marries his girlfriend, Tami-Lynn. One year later, following a heated argument, they decide to have a child. As Ted can not have children, John agrees to help Ted find a sperm donor. They ask [[Sam J. Jones]] but he refuses due to a low sperm count. Then they unsuccessfully try to break into [[Tom Brady]]'s house and steal his sperm. Ultimately, John offers to donate his sperm.

Despite Ted and John's efforts, Tami-Lynn's historical drug use has rendered her infertile and the couple decide to adopt. As background checks are carried out, Ted 's legal status as a person is brought into question. The state authorities of [[Massachusetts]] declare Ted property rather than a person, resulting in the loss of his job at a grocery store - shortly after reassuring a customer that buying a box of [[Trix (cereal)|Trix]], as an adult, will not bring him to any harm. Furthermore, Ted's credit card and bank accounts are frozen and his marriage to Tami-Lynn is annulled.

John suggests that they take the state to court, and their case is assigned to a novice lawyer [[pro-bono]], Samantha Leslie Jackson. They are initially reluctant, especially due to her lack of knowledge on modern culture, but they take a liking to Samantha after finding out she also uses illegal drugs and disagrees with the [[War on Drugs]]. The three bond over their love of [[marijuana]] as they prepare to present the case.

Meanwhile, Donny, Ted's life-long stalker and would-be abductor, is now employed as a janitor at the headquarters of toy company [[Hasbro]], in [[New York City]]. He convinces the company CEO to hire an expert attorney to ensure that Ted maintains his status as property, therefore leaving him open to seizure by the firm to create more living teddy bears.

Despite Samantha's best efforts, the court rules against Ted. Disheartened but desperate, the trio contact Patrick Meighan, a highly respected civil rights attorney, hoping he'll take the case and overturn the court's decision. Driving to Manhattan to meet him, Ted crashes into a hidden marijuana patch, where Samantha and John realize their attraction for each other. The next day, the trio meet Meighan, who is sympathetic to Ted's plight but ultimately refuses the case, as he believes he has not significantly contributed to humanity due to his juvenile slacker lifestyle.

Ted, angry at the injustice and jealous of Samantha and John's new relationship, wanders off. Donny follows him as he wanders into the [[New York Comic-Con]]. Once inside, Donny attempts to kidnap Ted, who flees and contacts John for help. John and Samantha arrive at Comic-Con and search for Ted, arriving as Donny is about to cut him open. As they make their escape, Donny cuts the cables holding up a model of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS Enterprise]]'' and it swings towards Ted. John pushes Ted out of the way, takes the hit, and is knocked unconscious. Ted identifies Donny and he is arrested.

At the hospital, Samantha, Ted and Tami-Lynn rejoice when John recovers. Patrick Meighan decides to take the case, telling them he has been inspired by John's selflessness and Ted's emotions over his fallen friend. Meighan gets the ruling overturned by demonstrating that Ted is self-aware, that he feels complex emotions, and is capable of empathy. Outside the court, Ted re-proposes to Tami-Lynn. After they are re-married, Ted and Tami-Lynn, adopting the surname of "[[Clubber Lang|Clubberlang]]", adopt a baby boy, whom they name [[Apollo Creed]], while John and Samantha happily pursue their own relationship.

During the 2012 ''[[American Dad!]]'' [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] panel, MacFarlane stated that he would be open to a sequel to ''Ted''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patten |first=Dominic |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/comic-con-mad-mens-jon-hamm-on-american-dad-next-season-seth-macfarlane-says-flintstones-reboot-still-delayed |title=Comic-Con - Seth MacFarlane Says "I'd Be Open To Making Ted 2" |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=July 14, 2012 |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, chief executive [[Steve Burke (businessman)|Steve Burke]] said that the studio would be looking to make a sequel to ''Ted'' "as soon as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19597043 |title=BBC News - Bourne Legacy sequel confirmed |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=September 14, 2012 |accessdate=July 12, 2014|newspaper=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, on ''[[Anderson Live]]'', Wahlberg confirmed that a sequel was in the works and that it would be the first sequel in his career, while also revealing that he and Ted (as voiced by MacFarlane) would appear at the [[85th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franich |first=Darren |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/01/17/mark-wahlberg-ted-oscars-video/ |title=Mark Wahlberg and Ted to appear at Oscars - VIDEO |publisher=Insidemovies.ew.com |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2, 2013, it was announced ''Ted 2'' would be released on June 26, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/10/ted-2-release-date-june-26-2015/ |title='Ted 2′ Gets June 2015 Release Date |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=October 2, 2013 |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the storyline for the film was quite different and involved John and Ted's attempt to smuggle pot across the country,&lt;ref name=Northsouth&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radish|first1=Christina|title=Seth MacFarlane Talks TED 2 and 3, the Cast, and Political Correctness|url=http://collider.com/seth-macfarlane-talks-ted-2-3-sequels-the-cast-and-political-correctness/|website=Collider|accessdate=August 14, 2015|date=2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, due to concerns that the concept was too similar to then recently released ''[[We're the Millers]]'', the concept was scrapped and the storyline was overhauled to one inspired by [[John Jakes]]' ''[[North and South (trilogy)|North and South]]'' series as well as the life of [[Dred Scott]].&lt;ref name=Northsouth/&gt;
During the period when the film was about drug smuggling, Mila Kunis's character was still in the sequel; however, when the storyline was changed, it required a lawyer to be the female lead and there wasn't room for Kunis's character.&lt;ref name=Northsouth/&gt;

On February 14, 2014, [[Amanda Seyfried]] was cast as the female lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/amanda-seyfried-set-by-seth-macfarlane-for-ted-sequel/ |title=Amanda Seyfried Set By Seth MacFarlane For 'Ted' Sequel |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=February 24, 2014 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 2014, [[Jessica Barth]] was confirmed to reprise her role as Tami-Lynn.&lt;ref name="thewrap1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/jessica-barth-set-to-return-as-tami-lynn-in/ |title=Jessica Barth Set to Return as Foul-Mouthed Girlfriend Tami-Lynn in 'Ted 2' (Exclusive) |publisher=TheWrap |date=June 17, 2014 |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August and September 2014, it was announced that [[Patrick Warburton]] would return as John's co-worker Guy,&lt;ref name=Warburton&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming Jr|first1=Mike|title=Patrick Warburton Back For ‘Ted’ Sequel|url=http://deadline.com/2014/08/patrick-warburton-back-for-ted-sequel-822526/|accessdate=August 21, 2014|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Morgan Freeman]],&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/morgan-freeman-ted-2-1201291079/ |title=Morgan Freeman Lands Juicy Role in 'Ted 2′ (EXCLUSIVE) |publisher=Variety |date=September 10, 2014 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nana Visitor]],&lt;ref name="NanaVisitor"/&gt; [[Michael Dorn]],&lt;ref name="MichaelDorn"/&gt; [[Dennis Haysbert]],&lt;ref name="DennisHaysbert"/&gt; [[Liam Neeson]]&lt;ref name="LiamNeeson"/&gt; and [[John Slattery]] had joined the cast.&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Ted 2'' grossed $81.5 million in North America and $135.2 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $216.7 million, against a budget of $68 million.&lt;ref name=BOM /&gt;

In the United States and Canada, ''Ted 2'' opened on the same day as the family adventure film ''[[Max (2015 film)|Max]]'', across 3,441 theaters. It made $2.6 million from its Thursday night showings from 2,647 theaters,&lt;ref name="THURS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-ted-2-opens-805316|title=Box Office: 'Ted 2' Opens to Strong $2.6M Thursday Night|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=June 26, 2015|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $13.2 million on its opening day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4074|title='Jurassic' and 'Inside' Adjust 'Ted''s Weekend|author=Keith Simanton|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=June 25, 2015|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its opening weekend, ''Ted 2'' earned $33.5 million, finishing third at the box office behind ''[[Jurassic World]]'' ($54.5 million) and ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' ($52.3 million).&lt;ref name="BOOM"/&gt; The opening total was a disappointment, considering the film's initial projected opening of $45–50 million, and its predecessor's $54.4 million opening three years prior.&lt;ref name="BOOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4075&amp;p=.htm|title='Jurassic' Holds Off Challengers|author=Keith Simanton|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=June 28, 2015|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was director MacFarlane's second consecutive underperforming opening, following 2014's ''[[A Million Ways to Die in the West]]'', which opened to $16.8 million.&lt;ref name="BOOM"/&gt;

Outside North America, the film earned an estimated $20 million in its opening weekend from 26 countries.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 46% based on 198 reviews with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Ted 2'' reunites Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane for another round of sophomoric, scatological humor -- and just as before, your enjoyment will depend on your tolerance for all of the above."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ted_2/ | title=Ted 2 | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=February 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 48 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ted-2 | title=Ted 2 | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/06/ted-2-max-jurassic-world-box-office-1201457325/|title=Pixar Girl In Staring Contest With Dinos For No. 1, 'Ted 2′ Falls Off The Wagon, 'Max' Is A Good Dog|author=Anthony D'Alessandro|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=June 27, 2015|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'' gave the film two out of four stars, saying "It would be disingenuous for me to claim that ''Ted 2'' isn't funny. Although I was often bored by the plodding direction of the story, I laughed from time-to-time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Berardinelli |url=http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/ted-2 |title=Ted 2 &amp;#124; Reelviews Movie Reviews |publisher=Reelviews.net |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a C+, saying "You realize what it must be like to be trapped in detention with a bunch of 15-year-old boys who think there's nothing more hilarious than repeating the same jokes about porn, pot, and pulling your pud over and over again. It's funny, until it's not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/24/ted-2-ew-review |title='Ted 2': EW review |publisher=EW.com |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Goodykoontz of ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' gave the film two out of five stars, saying "The film, like most of MacFarlane's work, is a mix of occasional laugh-out-loud moments - there are some here - and cringe-worthy misfires that play a lot more tone-deaf than he seems to intend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/06/24/review-ted-gives-us-less/29218979/ |title=Review: 'Ted 2' gives us more (and less) of the same |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=April 22, 2015 |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Truitt of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film two out of four stars, saying "MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild have a gift for referential riffs, but the plot is the thinnest of narratives just to connect all the comedy bits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/06/25/ted-2-movie-review/29205029/ |title=Review: Grin and bear 'Ted 2' hijinks |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=June 23, 2015 |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Whitty of the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying "Sure, MacFarlane can write simple jokes as long as the 'f' key on his laptop holds out. Some of them are even funny. But a lot of them don't pay off, and most trod the same well-worn territory -- potheads, practical jokes, politically-incorrect cliches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Whitty |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/ted_2_review_mark_wahlberg_grins_and_bears_it.html |title='Ted 2' review: Mark Wahlberg grins, and bears it |publisher=NJ.com |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey Bahr of the [[Associated Press]] gave the film a negative review, saying "In an admirable effort to go a different route, MacFarlane has instead done something hopelessly bizarre: He's given his film too much sincerity and story, and it practically crushes whatever fun does exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Associated Press |url=http://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/movie_review_sincerity_story_c.html |title=Movie review: Sincerity, story crush 'Ted 2' |publisher=masslive.com |date=May 27, 2015 |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "MacFarlane is cynical, but he's not a cynic, and there are moments in ''Ted 2'' where you can sense a longing for the gentler and more upbeat entertainment of an earlier generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mick LaSalle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Ted-2-lowdown-and-very-funny-6346815.php |title='Ted 2' — lowdown and very funny |publisher=SFGate |date=March 11, 2015 |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soren Anderson of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' gave the film two out of four stars, saying "In the midst of comedy, seriousness. The combination feels forced. A more disciplined and smarter director might have been able to successfully blend the two elements, but crude dude MacFarlane hasn't the skill to bring it off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andersen |first=Soren |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/ted-2-the-crude-little-dude-is-back/ |title='Ted 2': The crude little dude is back |publisher=The Seattle Times |date= 2015-06-25|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Callahan of ''[[The Wrap]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying "Bad taste needs to be more honest and more all-inclusive if it's to make a lasting impression, and MacFarlane's bad taste here is both too wishy-washy and too knee-jerk cruel to really make any impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/ted-2-review-seth-macfarlane-mark-wahlberg-amanda-seyfried/ |title='Ted 2' Review: Seth MacFarlane's Bad-Taste Humor Plays It Safe (and Sexist) |publisher=Thewrap.com |date= 2015-06-24|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying "Mr. MacFarlane can be funny, but ''Ted 2'' is insultingly lazy hack work that is worth discussing primarily because of how he tries and fails to turn race, and specifically black men, into comedy fodder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/movies/review-in-ted-2-the-foulmouthed-bear-tries-to-prove-hes-human.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0 |title=Review: In ‘Ted 2,’ the Foulmouthed Bear Tries to Prove He’s Human |publisher=The New York Times |date=June 23, 2015 |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Hall of ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave the film one out of five stars, saying "Once again, you will believe that a talking CGI stuffed animal can be a racist, hateful monster with no redeeming qualities ... but his greatest sin is that he's not funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/ted-2-review-seth-mcfarlane-scrapes-bottom-barrel-article-1.2269075 |title='Ted 2' review: Seth McFarlane scrapes bottom of barrel |publisher=NY Daily News |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' gave the film two out of four stars, saying "If you didn't see and laugh at the first ''Ted'', and maybe also at MacFarlane's button-pushing TV series ''Family Guy'', then another movie deserves your entertainment dollars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2015/06/25/ted-2-returns-with-unbearably-crude-humour-and-cheap-laughs-review.html |title=Ted 2 returns with unbearably crude humour and cheap laughs: review |publisher=Thestar.com |date=March 16, 2015 |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A.A. Dowd of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a C+, saying "''Ted 2'' strikes a sometimes-awkward balance between sincerity and cheap provocation. It also forgets that the real draw of the first film wasn’t Ted himself, but Wahlberg, whose sweet-lug routine scored a lot of belly laughs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A.A.

[[File:Ampel-Kassel-02.jpg|thumb|Traffic lights in [[Kassel]]]]
'''Traffic light coalition''' (direct translation of {{lang-de|Ampelkoalition}}) is a term originating in [[Germany|German]] politics where it describes a [[coalition government]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|the Greens]]. It arises from the fact that the parties' [[political colour|traditional colours]], respectively red, yellow, and green, resemble the normal colour sequence of a [[traffic light]] (''Ampel''). It has subsequently been used to describe similar coalitions between [[social democracy|social democrats]], [[liberalism|liberals]], and [[green politics|greens]] in other countries.

==History==
At a [[States of Germany|state]] level, there have been traffic light coalitions in [[Brandenburg]] between 1990 and 1994 and in [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] between 1991 and 1995. Negotiations to form such a coalition upon the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 Berlin state election]] were not successful, likewise, preliminary talks after the [[North Rhine-Westphalia state election, 2010|2010 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] led to no result. Recently, a traffic light coalition was formed upon the [[Rhineland-Palatinate state election, 2016|2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]].

At a [[Federal republic|federal]] level, however, to date no government has been formed on this basis. Historically, there have been '[[Red-green alliance|red-green]]' coalitions in the [[Bundestag]] between the SPD and the Greens, and [[social-liberal coalition]]s between the SPD and the FDP. However, whilst there may be common ground in terms of [[social progressivism]] between the three parties, the FDP's [[economic liberalism]] and long association at the federal level with the conservative [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) make such a coalition problematic at present and the FDP chairman [[Guido Westerwelle]] had specifically ruled out this option for the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,643586-2,00.html |title=SPIEGEL Interview With FDP Leader Westerwelle - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term became more widely used outside Germany when the inconclusive [[German federal election, 2005|2005 federal election]] led to its use in the international [[mass media|media]]. Other designations included "[[Pan-African colours|Africa]]" or "[[Flag of Senegal|Senegal]] coalition" (coined by Green politician [[Jürgen Trittin]]). The term [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]—sometimes called "black traffic light" (''Schwarze Ampel'')—was formed in a similar way, describing a hypothetical coalition between the CDU, FDP and Greens.

In [[Schleswig-Holstein]] a "Danish traffic light" (''Dänen-Ampel'') was formed after the [[Schleswig-Holstein state election, 2012|2012 state election]] by the SPD, Greens and the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]], a [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] minor party representing the Danish and Frisian minority in the state. Upon the [[Saxony-Anhalt state election, 2016|2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election]], an "[[Flag of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] or [[Flag of Kenya|Kenya]] coalition" between the CDU, SPD and Greens was formed.

==Traffic light coalitions in other countries==

===Austria===
In 1990s' [[Austria]], the term ''Ampelkoalition'' has been borrowed from Germany to describe a theoretical coalition of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ), the [[Liberal Forum]] (LiF) and [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|The Greens]]. However, as at this time the Liberal Forum's party colour was light blue, this is a reference to the political similarity between this coalition and a German traffic light coalition rather than to the party's actual symbolic colours. After the Liberal Forum lost its parliamentary representation in the [[Austria legislative election, 1999|1999 Austrian elections]] such a coalition remained highly theoretical, though later its party colour ''was'' yellow. In 2014 it merged into [[NEOS – The New Austria]], whose party colour is pink, however.

===Belgium===
The [[Verhofstadt I Government]] of [[Belgium]], headed by Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] from 1999 to 2003, comprised liberals (the [[Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] and French-speaking [[Liberal Reformist Party]]), socialists (the Flemish [[Socialist Party – Different|Socialist Party]] and the French-speaking [[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|Socialist Party]]), and greens (the Flemish [[Green!|Agalev]] and the French-speaking [[Ecolo]]). However, as the political colours of the liberal parties were blue instead of yellow, it was known as the "purple-green" coalition.

===Luxembourg===
Following the [[Luxembourgian general election, 2013|2013 general election in Luxembourg]], negotiations started with the aim of forming a three-party coalition government comprising the [[Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party]] (LSAP), the [[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|Democratic Party]] (DP) and [[The Greens (Luxembourg)|The Greens]] in order to oust the [[Christian Social People's Party]] (CSV) of the incumbent Prime Minister [[Jean-Claude Juncker]]. This variant on the traffic light coalition is known as a "Gambia coalition" ({{lang-de|Gambia-Koalition}}), as the party colours match the [[flag of the Gambia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wort.lu/en/view/three-way-gambia-coalition-a-first-for-luxembourg-52668327e4b0ff388169e7db&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.de/juncker-sidelined-as-luxembourgs-royal-palace-steps-in/a-17184023&lt;/ref&gt; as Luxembourg's liberal party (DP) uses blue as its party colour rather than yellow.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]] the term has been used to describe a coalition between the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], notably that which formerly ran the [[City of Lancaster]] [[non-metropolitan district|district council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardianpolitics/story/0,3605,1566749,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Delegates try to shake off image as single-issue party | first=Julian | last=Glover | date=10 September 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], a similar coalition in the [[Scottish Parliament]] involving the [[Scottish Labour Party|Scottish Labour]] and [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Scottish Liberal Democrat]] parties with the [[Scottish Green Party]] was mooted following the [[Scottish parliamentary election, 2003|2003 Scottish Parliament election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/politics/coxall/update2.htm |title=Palgrave Macmillan - Contemporary British Politics 4th Edition |publisher=Palgrave.com |date=2003-05-03 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year Labour and the Liberal Democrats continued their coalition with a slender majority, and it was again the stated position of the Scottish Greens to aim for such a coalition in 2007, despite possible tension between the [[Unionists (Scotland)|unionist]] Labour and the Liberal Democrats and the [[Scottish independence|pro independence]] Scottish Greens.  However, Green support collapsed in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliament election]] rendering the Greens non-viable as a coalition partner, although they supported [[Alex Salmond]]'s election as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]].

{{Apartheid}}
{{distinguish|United Democratic Movement}}
The '''United Democratic Front''' ('''UDF''') was a major anti-[[apartheid]] organisation of the 1980s. The non-racial coalition of about 400 civic, church, students', [[trade union|workers']] and other organisations was formed in 1983, initially to fight the new [[Tricameral Parliament]]. The UDF's goal was to establish a "non-racial, united South Africa in which segregation is abolished and in which society is freed from institutional and systematic racism."{{Sfn|Vorster|2015|p=4}} Its slogan was "UDF Unites, Apartheid Divides."

== Background ==
Involvement in [[trade union]]s, beginning in [[Durban]] in 1973, helped create a strong, democratic political culture for black people in South Africa.{{Sfn|Swilling|1987|p=2}} Mass urban protest could also be traced to the student upsurge in [[Soweto]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neocosmos|first=Michael|date=1996|title=From People's Politics to State Politics: Aspects of National Liberation in South Africa, 1984-1994|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=11627|journal=Politeia|volume=15|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030428053604/http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=11627|archive-date=28 April 2003|access-date=17 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1982 brought the effects of a world [[Financial crisis|economic crisis]] to South Africa, and the price of gold fell in 1985.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The result of these things and other economic problems caused mass unemployment, especially for young black South Africans.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The apartheid state wrote a new constitution in 1983 "in an attempt to allay criticism against apartheid and to set a new course."{{Sfn|Vorster|2015|p=2-3}} The new form of government created a [[Tricameral Parliament]] which allowed [[Coloured]] (mixed-race) and [[Asian South Africans]] "nominal representation."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6646940//|title=Botha Blocks Anti-Apartheid Donations|last=|first=|date=10 October 1986|work=The Daily Herald|access-date=14 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black people were still not allowed to participate in the government.{{Sfn|Vorster|2015|p=2-3}}&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

During a demonstration in [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]] in 1984, police shot the participants which led to further insurrection.{{Sfn|Sitas|1992|p=631}} This led to a "black youth uprising" by 1985 in South Africa.{{Sfn|Sitas|1992|p=631}}

==History==

=== Formation ===
The plans for a new political organisation were introduced by Rev. [[Allan Boesak]] at a conference of the Transvaal Anti-South African Indian Council Committee (TASC) on 23 January 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-08-22-the-udf-at-30-an-organisation-that-shook-apartheids-foundation/ The UDF at 30: An organisation that shook Apartheid's foundation], by J. Brooks Spector, ''The Daily Maverick'', 22 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The part of his speech calling for a "united front" of "churches, civic associations, trade unions, student organizations, and sports bodies" was unplanned, but well received.{{Sfn|Vorster|2015|p=3}} He also called for black people to have full participation in the government.{{Sfn|Swilling|1987|p=3}}

The UDF then formed regional committees, which established relationships with local organizations. The [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] UDF was launched first, in May, and then the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] region (in June) and the [[Cape Province]] (July).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/united-democratic-front-udf|title=United Democratic Front (UDF)|last=|first=|date=30 March 2011|website=South African History Online|publisher=|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of the regions formed the Interim National Committee, which also included outside activists.

At the end of July, the committee held a two-day meeting where they discussed a national launch date. Although most delegates wanted time to organise the regions before the national launch, they decided the best date was 20 August, the day the government planned to introduce the [[Tricameral Parliament|Tricameral Constitution]]. UDF sent out over 400,000 letters, flyers and brochures to advertise the launch of the group.{{Sfn|Vorster|2015|p=3}} The UDF's symbols &amp;mdash; logo and slogan &amp;mdash; were also selected at the meeting. Both the logo and slogan portray the widespread support the UDF hoped to achieve by incorporating a wide range of South Africans of all races. Some member organisations adapted the "UDF Unites, Apartheid Divides" slogan; for example, the [[Soweto]] Civic Association used "Soweto Civic Association Unites &amp;mdash; [[Piet Koornhof]] Divides".
&lt;!-- include logo and Soweto Civic poster --&gt;

On 20 August 1983 the UDF was launched in the Rocklands community hall, [[Mitchell's Plain]], near [[Cape Town]]. After a conference of delegates from 575 organisations, a public rally was held, attended by about 10,000 people.{{Sfn|Vorster|2015|p=3}} [[Frank Chikane]], the first major speaker, called the day "a turning point in the struggle for freedom."

=== Activities of UDF ===
The UDF and its affiliates promoted rent boycotts, school protests, worker stay-away and a boycott of the [[Tricameral Constitution|tricameral system]]. These activities took place in earnest after September 1984.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 1989, UDF sent delegates to the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to discuss what foreign countries could do to help end apartheid.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Women in the delegation "were the ones that dictated the conversation," with [[Albertina Sisulu]] conveying a strong message of nonviolence and compassion.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Banning and imprisonment ===
In 1986, President [[P. W. Botha|Pieter Botha]] prohibited the UDF from receiving foreign funds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The UDF was under a government ban as of February 1987 restricting its actions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-16/news/mn-238_1_south-africa|title=Convictions Overturned for 5 Leading South African Black Activists|last=Kraft|first=Scott|date=16 December 1989|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=14 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1987, a Natal provincial Supreme Court justice, [[John Didcott]], ruled that the ban on the UDF's ability to receive foreign funding should be lifted.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-09/news/mn-4811_1_foreign-funds|title=Foreign Gifts Allowed for Apartheid Foes : Court Clears Way for United Democratic Front to Solicit Abroad|last=Parks|first=Micahael|date=9 May 1987|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=14 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign contributions made up more than half of the group's budget.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

By late 1987, the UDF had a majority of its activists imprisoned.{{Sfn|Good|2011|p=322}}

=== Treason Trials ===
{{Main|Delmas Treason Trial}}

On February 19, 1985, several UDF members, including [[Albertina Sisulu]], [[Frank Chikane]] and [[Cassim Saloojee]] were arrested on high treason warrants.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6646588//|title=Six Anti-Apartheid Leaders Are Arrested in South Africa On High Treason Charges|last=|first=|date=19 February 1985|work=Santa Cruz Sentinel|access-date=14 September 2016|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDF was accused of being a "shadow organization for the African National Congress."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In November 1988, eight of those accused of treason were acquitted of all charges, while four activists were found guilty of terrorism.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6647432//|title=Activists Convicted of Treason|last=|first=|date=19 November 1988|work=The Salina Journal|access-date=14 September 2016|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge also ruled that the UDF was a "'revolutionary organization.' that incited violence in black townships in 1984 in a bid to render South Africa ungovernable."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The convictions were overturned by the Appeal Court in [[Bloemfontein]] in 1989, releasing five activists, including [[Popo Molefe]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Disbanding ===
When the ANC, the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC) and other organizations were unbanned in February 1990, the UDF faced a change and "it became clear that the need for the UDF no longer existed."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/disbanding-1990-1991|title=Disbanding, 1990-1991|last=|first=|date=30 March 2011|website=South African History Online|publisher=|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1991, the decision to disband was made and the UDF held its last meeting on August 14, 1991 in Johannesburg.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Organisational structure==
The UDF was an umbrella organisation that had a "federal structure" and a decentralized method of employing tactics.{{Sfn|Vorster|2015|p=4}} By 1986, there were 700 different organizations working under the umbrella which were often youth movements, community organizations, unions, professional societies and churches.{{Sfn|Vorster|2015|p=4}} Eventually there would be nearly "1,000 affiliated groups."{{Sfn|Good|2011|p=315}}  UDF embraced a philosophy of "[[African nationalism]], [[socialism]] and [[Christianity]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4W4fg2xZAOwC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;ots=W-g5oE-hNC&amp;dq=%22mary%20bernard%20ncube%22&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mary%20bernard%20ncube%22&amp;f=false|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Religion and Social Justice|last=DeYoung|first=Curtiss Paul|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2012|isbn=9781405195478|editor-last=Palmer|editor-first=Michael D.|location=|pages=73|chapter=Christianity: Contemporary Expressions|editor-last2=Burgess|editor-first2=Stanley M.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common goal of ending apartheid and systematic racism allowed different types of groups to work together.{{Sfn|Vorster|2015|p=4}} Any type of organization, regardless of race, sex or religion was welcome as long as they promoted an end to apartheid.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/strong-and-unnoticed-women-udf-reid-arnold|title=Strong and Unnoticed: The Women of the UDF|last=Arnold|first=Reid|date=13 May 2015|website=South African History Online|publisher=|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; UDF helped many of the smaller organizations have access to a source of funding.{{Sfn|Good|2011|p=316}}

The leadership structure included a National Executive Committee (NEC) at the top level which had three presidents, secretaries, a treasurer and representatives of the various regions.{{Sfn|Good|2011|p=315}} Despite the NEC leadership, much of the "momentum for action came from the bottom levels of the organisation and from its youngest members."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Because members of UDF faced frequent arrests due to their activities, the leaders were "cautious and secretive."{{Sfn|Sitas|1992|p=632}}

=== UDF Women's Congress ===
[[Feminism|Feminists]] involved in the UDF felt that the organization was not seriously promoting issues relating to women and that women "had a second-class status within the organization."{{Sfn|Hassim|2006|p=73}} The Women's Congress was formed on April 23, 1987 and included women's organizations affiliated with the UDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/udf-womens-congress|title=UDF Women's Congress|last=|first=|date=30 March 2011|website=South African History Online|publisher=|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations, such as the [[Natal Organisation of Women]] (NOW), the [[Federation of Transvaal Women]] (FEDTRAW), [[Port Elizabeth Women's Organisation]], [[Port Alfred Women's Organisation]] and the [[Gompo Women's Congress]] sent delegates to that first meeting.{{Sfn|Hassim|2006|p=73}} During the first meeting, the delegates created a list of issues and problems facing women involved in the UDF which included an absence of women in leadership roles and "UDF's failure to address issues of gender discrimination, and sexual harassment within the organization."{{Sfn|Hassim|2006|p=74}} Delegates elected [[Albertina Sisulu]] to the national council for the UDF Women's Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8562219/Albertina-Sisulu.html|title=Albertina Sisulu|last=|first=|date=7 June 2011|work=The Telegraph|access-date=14 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, women were heavily involved in the mine worker's strike.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Mostly working-class women protested the mining management's support of the government and at the rally, presented a petition.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Some women attended "carrying babies on their backs."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Critics of the UDF Women's Congress believed that focusing on women's issues "had the potential to weaken the overall liberation struggle."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yamTAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;ots=qLFpT3w-oq&amp;dq=%22UDF%20Women%E2%80%99s%20Congress%20%22&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q=%22UDF%20Women%E2%80%99s%20Congress%20%22&amp;f=false|title=Gendering Global Transformations: Gender, Culture, Race and Identity|last=Schwarzer|first=Beatrix|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=9781135893859|editor-last=Chima J.|editor-first=Korieh|location=|pages=|chapter=Discourses on Race and Gender in South Africa's Transition Process: A Challenging Liaison|editor-last2=Okeke-Ihejirika|editor-first2=Philomina|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagreed, stating that "our struggle from freedom can only be won if men and women fight side by side."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Relationship with the ANC===
Early in its life, the UDF adopted the [[Freedom Charter]], a statement of the aims for a free South Africa and basis for a democratic constitution. At first, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) did not welcome UDF's involvement.{{Sfn|Good|2011|p=315}}

Throughout its existence, the UDF demanded the release of imprisoned [[African National Congress|ANC]] leaders, as well as other [[political prisoners]]. In 1985, the UDF announced at a rally of 2,500 people, their campaign to see the release of [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-16/news/mn-758_1_united-democratic-front|title=Anti-Apartheid Front Launches New Campaign to Free Mandela|last=Parks|first=Michael|date=16 December 1985|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=14 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the UDF was never formally attached to the [[African National Congress|ANC]], and did not participate in the armed struggle. The UDF did not want to be associated with violent tactics or acts of sabotage against the government.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, the ANC over time, "showed an increasing intolerance for the values upheld by the UDF."{{Sfn|Good|2011|p=311}}

===Relationship with the Black Consciousness Movement===
The [[Black Consciousness Movement]] disagreed with the UDF on the issue of whether whites should be welcomed into the struggle against apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-02-03/news/mn-13202_1_black-unity/2|title=Rivalries Hamper Anti-Apartheid Campaign : Splits Grow Among South Africa Blacks|last=Parks|first=Michael|date=3 February 1985|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=14 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Consciousness movement was based on the principle that the liberation struggle should be led by black people, whereas the UDF welcomed anyone who shared their goals and was willing to commit to them in struggle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Relationship with the Progressive Federal Party (PFP) ===
The [[Progressive Federal Party]] had vigorously opposed the introduction of the [[Tri-cameral system|tricameral system]] (in the referendum), but once introduced continued as the official opposition in the "White" Assembly. "Let us voice strong opposition and offer vigorous resistance both within and without the system that excludes Blacks and continues to imprison [[Nelson Mandela]]" argued [[Helen Suzman]],speaking at the Cape Town Conference of the PFP National Youth in 1984. At the same conference, a resolution was passed endorsing and supporting the recent establishment of the United Democratic Front and offer ' back office assistance". This support sponsored by [[Gordon Waddell]] and [[Harry Oppenheimer]] through the Western Province Regional PFP Youth Committee led by Stephen Drus ([[Stephen Darori]]) included frequently picking up the tabs for busing and  other transport, publicity, loud speaker systems and legal expenses when pro bono wasn't an option.

===Mass Democratic Movement (MDM)===
In 1989, the UDF and the Congress of South African Trade Unions ([[COSATU]]) began cooperating more closely in a loose alliance called the '''Mass Democratic Movement''', following restrictions on the UDF and COSATU by the apartheid government. The apartheid government described the MDM as a UDF/Cosatu/[[SACP]] alliance, although this was disputed by the MDM at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/mass-democratic-movement-mdm-begins-their-defiance-campaign|title=Mass Democratic Movement (MDM) Begins Their Defiance Campaign|last=|first=|date=16 March 2011|website=South African History Online|publisher=|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv02424/04lv02730/05lv03188/06lv03205.htm|title=Mass Democratic Movement (MDM)|last=|first=|date=|website=O'Malley: The Heart of Hope|publisher=Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/mass-democratic-movement-february-1988-january-1990|title=The Mass Democratic Movement, February 1988 - January 1990|last=|first=|date=30 March 2011|website=South African History Online|publisher=|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loose nature of the MDM made it difficult for the apartheid government to ban,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv03445/04lv03446/05lv03480.htm|title=Mass Democratic Movement (MDM)|last=|first=|date=|website=O'Malley: The Heart of Hope|publisher=Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MDM has been described as having been "the UDF in another guise".&lt;ref name="mgJacobs2018"&gt;https://mg.co.za/article/2018-04-12-how-do-we-write-about-winnies-life-sympathetically&lt;/ref&gt;

{{voting}}

'''Vote pairing''' occurs when two people [[Promise|commit]] to [[voting]] in a mutually agreed upon manner. '''Vote swapping''' is a common example of vote pairing, where a voter in one district agrees to [[tactical voting|vote tactically]] for a less-preferred candidate or party who has a greater chance of winning in their district, in exchange for a voter from another district voting tactically for the candidate the first voter prefers, because that candidate has a greater possibility of winning in that district.

Vote pairing occurs informally (i.e., without binding contracts) but sometimes with great sophistication in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.

In the UK and Australia, [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|pairing]] is the mechanism by which two members of parliament of opposing parties agree, with the consent of their party whips, to abstain from voting if the other one is unable to vote. Thus they maintain the balance of votes if one or the other is unable to attend. A three-line [[whip (politics)|whip]] would usually be excepted from this agreement. For MPs who are not paired a [[wikt:bisque|bisque]], a rota system allowing absence is used.

Using UK elections as an example, tactical voting is often between [[Labour Party (UK)|the Labour Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. There may be one constituency in which the Labour Party and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidates are running in a tight race, with the Liberal Democrat far behind. In another constituency, the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates may be in a tight race, with the Labour candidate far behind. A Liberal Democrat voter in the first constituency would agree to vote for the Labour candidate in exchange for a Labour voter from the second constituency voting for the Liberal Democrat candidate.

Tactical voting has been used since 2000 as a strategy for the [[U.S. presidential election]], with voters from "safe" states, or nonswing states, voting for [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] candidates, and voters from states with contested races, or [[swing state]], voting for the second-preference candidate of the voters from the third party. By the [[United States Electoral College]] for presidential elections, all of a state's votes go to the winning candidate for that state, no matter how close the margin was (Maine and Nebraska excepted). Often third-party candidates for president are unable to garner any Electoral College votes, but they can call attention to their causes by the total popular vote that they garner. In vote-pairing agreements, third-party supporters in swing states vote strategically with major-party supporters in nonswing states, in the hope that the third party candidate will get more of the popular vote, while the major-party candidate gets more of the Electoral College vote.

== Terminology ==
Through the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]], the concept was known in the United States as "vote swapping", while "vote pairing" originally had a somewhat different meaning—where people of opposing parties would agree to together vote for a third-party candidate instead of for their own candidates. For example, a disaffected [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and a disaffected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] both agreeing to vote for a third-party candidate instead of for the candidates of their own parties.  However, by the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] "vote swapping" had become "vote pairing", and the various people who had created vote swapping sites for the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] had banded together as VotePair.org.

== Mechanics ==
The concern often gets raised on whether vote pairing can be used by opposing parties to manipulate an election or sabotage a candidate. However, in practice, such ideas of manipulation turn out to be impractical and self-defeating.

For an example, suppose that in the 2004 election the former Republican [[Pat Buchanan]] had again run for President under the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] (as he did in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]]). Suppose that supporters of the 2004 Republican candidate, George W. Bush, had set up vote pairing web sites so that Buchanan supporters from [[swing state]]s in the United States (such as Ohio, where the Democrats and Republicans were in a close race) would get matched with Bush supporters in solidly Democrat states (such as Massachusetts). This was not actually done of course (since Buchanan did not run in 2004), but suppose that Republican supporters of George W. Bush had gotten concerned that Democratic supporters of [[John Kerry]] would try to sabotage these web sites or manipulate the election by posing as either Bush or Buchanan supporters. However, if such Democrats had done so, all they could do is pose as George W. Bush supporters in solidly Democratic states or as Buchanan supporters in swing states. In the former situation (Democrats posing as Bush supporters in solidly Democratic states such as Massachusetts), all they could do is trick Buchanan supporters in [[swing state]]s to cast their vote for Bush—which would only hurt the Democratic candidate, John Kerry. Similarly, in the latter situation (Democrats posing as |Buchanan supporters in swing states), all they could do is trick Bush supporters in solidly Democrat states to vote for Buchanan—which wouldn't change the election since the Democrat candidate, John Kerry, would very likely carry those states anyway.

One can work through this same issue in the opposite political direction—where it actually was a concern of Democrats in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]]. In the 2004 presidential election, votepair.org matched [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] supporters of John Kerry in staunchly Republican states with [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] supporters in swing states (including [[Ralph Nader]] supporters, [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] supporters of [[Michael Badnarik]], or [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] supporters of [[David Cobb]]). A common question was whether Republican supporters of George W. Bush could manipulate the election by posing as John Kerry supporters or as third-party supporters. However, if such people had posed as third-party supporters in swing states, all they could do is trick John Kerry supporters in staunchly Republican states to vote for a third-party candidate—which wouldn't change the outcome of the election (since [[George W. Bush]] would win those states anyway). Similarly if such people had posed as John Kerry supporters in staunchly Republican states, all they could do is trick third-party supporters in swing states to vote for John Kerry—which would have politically hurt George W. Bush, not helped him.

One can similarly think through the possibilities of say a left third-party supporter in a swing state trying to trick Democrats in red states into voting for third parties. In an extreme case, say a Ralph Nader supporter in Florida in 2004 had used different email addresses and names to register ten different times with votepair.org and then tried to manipulate ten different Texas Democrats to vote for Nader, while casting his own ballot in Florida not for John Kerry but for Nader as well. This is perhaps the point where the process is the most vulnerable to mistrust. However, the outcome in Texas would still have gone unchanged—all of the Texas electoral votes would have still gone to Bush. The outcome in Florida would have been more vulnerable. Arguably though, the Nader "supporter" in Florida would have done more to hurt third parties than help them. If he told anyone he had done this, he might have started a rumor that third-party supporters can't be trusted, driving Democrats in red states away from votepair.org and lowering the total votes third parties might get. Consequently, the best strategy for a third-party supporter to do in a swing state is to just enter into a vote pair honestly. They can then tell others about how they had done so in order to spread understanding of vote pairing. A similar reasoning would apply to Democrats in non-swing states not following through on a vote pair agreement, or to Republicans and supporters of politically right third parties not following through on vote pairs.

Ultimately the only real way to manipulate vote pairing, and its effect on an election outcome, is to prevent people from learning about it, not to pose as a different kind of voter. Arguably, this kind of manipulation—preventing people from learning about vote pairing—is what happened in the 2000 presidential election, as discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2290&amp;context=llr|title=The Constitutionality of Online Vote Swapping|last=Randazza|first=Marc|date=1 June 2001|website=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/|publisher=Law Reviews at Digital Commons @ Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
In the United States, the legality of vote pairing in public elections has been questioned. Opponents claim that it is illegal to give or accept anything that has pecuniary value in exchange for a vote. (Indeed, efforts to buy or sell votes are illegal, and in the 2000 presidential election, there was even a satirical web site for buying and selling votes, [[Voteauction|vote-auction.com]], which was shut down by an Illinois judge.) Proponents for vote pairing respond that vote pairing does not involve any pecuniary or monetary exchange; rather, simply informal, nonbinding agreements between people to vote strategically. Also, vote pairing is a routine practice in legislative bodies, city councils, etc.

According to Declan McCullagh, California Secretary of State Bill Jones even threatened to prosecute voteswap2000.com and votexchange2000.com (which immediately shut their virtual doors in response).&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9755958-7.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The site operators—Alan Porter, Patrick Kerr, Steven Lewis, and William Cody—took the state of California to court.

On 8-6-2007, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that "the websites' vote-swapping mechanisms as well as the communication and vote swaps they enabled were constitutionally protected" and California's spurious threats violated the First Amendment. The 9th Circuit did not decide whether the threats violated the U.S. Constitution's [[Commerce Clause]].

"Both the websites' vote-swapping mechanisms and the communication and vote swaps that they enabled were...constitutionally protected. At their core, they amounted to efforts by politically engaged people to support their preferred candidates and to avoid election results that they feared would contravene the preferences of a majority of voters in closely contested states. Whether or not one agrees with these voters' tactics, such efforts, when conducted honestly and without money changing hands, are at the heart of the liberty safeguarded by the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlrgCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA228&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=Both+the+websites'+vote-swapping+mechanisms+and+the+communication+and+vote+swaps+that+they+enabled+were...constitutionally+protected.+At+their+core,+they+amounted+to+efforts+by+politically+engaged+people+to+support+their+preferred+candidates+and+to+avoid+election+results+that+they+feared+would+contravene+the+preferences+of+a+majority+of+voters+in+closely+contested+states.+Whether+or+not+one+agrees+with+these+voters'+tactics,+such+efforts,+when+conducted+honestly+and+without+money+changing+hands,+are+at+the+heart+of+the+liberty+safeguarded+by+the+First+Amendment.%2522&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XChRzAoX6R&amp;sig=7681XayDRZju06gfBzP3o7yYjQ0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG4Iew8KrPAhVK1GMKHahXCC8Q6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Both%2520the%2520websites'%2520vote-swapping%2520mechanisms%2520and%2520the%2520communication%2520and%2520vote%2520swaps%2520that%2520they%2520enabled%2520were...constitutionally%2520protected.%2520At%2520their%2520core%252C%2520they%2520amounted%2520to%2520efforts%2520by%2520politically%2520engaged%2520people%2520to%2520support%2520their%2520preferred%2520candidates%2520and%2520to%2520avoid%2520election%2520results%2520that%2520they%2520feared%2520would%2520contravene%2520the%2520preferences%2520of%2520a%2520majority%2520of%2520voters%2520in%2520closely%2520contested%2520states.%2520Whether%2520or%2520not%2520one%2520agrees%2520with%2520these%2520voters'%2520tactics%252C%2520such%2520efforts%252C%2520when%2520conducted%2520honestly%2520and%2520without%2520money%2520changing%2520hands%252C%2520are%2520at%2520the%2520heart%2520of%2520the%2520liberty%2520safeguarded%2520by%2520the%2520First%2520Amendment.%2522&amp;f=false|title=Outlooks and Insights on Group Decision and Negotiation: 15th International Conference, GDN 2015, Warsaw, Poland, June 22-26, 2015, Proceedings|last=Kamiński|first=Bogumił|last2=Kersten|first2=Gregory|last3=Szapiro|first3=Tomasz|date=2015-06-11|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319195155|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], vote swapping with other people in Canada is legal per the [[Canada Elections Act|Elections Act]], as long as there is no money or "material benefit" that passes hands in the vote swap agreement. It's also illegal to trick someone using a false identity to influence someone to vote in a different way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/online-vote-swapping-legal-but-voter-beware-elections-canada-warns-1.715876|title=Online vote-swapping legal but voter beware, Elections Canada warns|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate regarding the legality of vote pairing peaked during the 2000 presidential election, when there was a strong effort to shut down the U.S. vote-pairing websites. However, the federal [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] eventually ruled against this action,&lt;ref&gt;For the February 6, 2003 federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision against Bill Jones, the [[Secretary of State of California]] in the 2000 election, who threatened criminal charges against the creators of vote pairing web sites {{cite web |url=http://www.nvri.org/library/cases/Porter_v_Jones/9th%20Cir%20opinion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027161513/http://nvri.org/library/cases/Porter_v_Jones/9th%20Cir%20opinion.pdf |archivedate=2005-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by the 2004 presidential election there was no such effort to shut down vote pairing.

The debate intensified in the final days of the 2000 election when six Republican state secretaries of state, led by the [[Secretary of State of California|California Secretary of State]] [[Bill Jones (California politician)|Bill Jones]], charged that vote-pairing web sites were illegal and threatened criminal charges against their creators. Multiple web sites had sprung up that were matching supporters of the Democratic presidential candidate, [[Al Gore]], in nonswing states, with supporters in [[swing state]]s of the strongest third party candidate, Ralph Nader. Some argued that Ralph Nader was drawing support from left leaning Democrats that would otherwise vote for Al Gore. This would have allowed Nader to get more of the popular vote, or at least his fair share of it, and at the same time allowed Gore to perhaps get more of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] vote.

There are multiple reasons it would be important for Ralph Nader to still get his share of the national popular vote. One is that if he got five percent or more, then he could get federally distributed public funding in the next election. Also, and perhaps more importantly, he could possibly get included in the [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]] for the [[United States presidential election debates, 2004|next election in 2004]]. Third parties have protested their exclusion from the presidential debates.

In 2000, many of the vote pairing web sites were hosted in California, and so when the California Secretary of State, Bill Jones, charged that the web sites were illegal and threatened their creators with criminal prosecution, some (but not all) of the sites reluctantly shut down. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) got involved to protect the web sites, seeking a restraining order against Jones and then a permanent injunction against him, alleging that he had violated the constitutional rights of the web site creators. However, the issue would only be resolved after the 2000 election had already occurred. The media at the time gave little coverage to vote pairing, except for how it was being charged as illegal.

It is possible that Jones's threats of criminal charges against the creators of the vote-pair web sites changed the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. One of the web sites, votetrader.org, tallied the number of people who had registered to pair their votes on all the vote-pairing websites. They tallied that 1,412 Nader supporters in Florida had gotten matched with Gore supporters from Republican states (although more likely vote paired with relatives and friends in other states—instead of over the Internet). [[George W. Bush]] was certified as winning Florida by only 537 votes—by Florida's Secretary of State, Katherine Harris. The Florida Supreme Court then changed this margin to just 193 votes at most, in their ruling on December 8, 2004. Approximately 2,900,000 people voted for George W. Bush and [[Al Gore]] each in Florida, while the number who voted for [[Ralph Nader]] was certified at 97,421. If only another 0.2% of the voters for Ralph Nader in Florida had vote paired (about 200 divided by 97,421)—if about 1,600 Nader supporters had vote paired instead of 1,400—Al Gore would have carried the election.

There were numerous other controversies in Florida's vote count: from the Palm Beach County butterfly ballots; to the question of whether Bush would have still won the state in a full recount; to how [[Katherine Harris]], a Republican, was the co-chair of the Bush campaign in Florida at the same time she was the Florida state secretary of state. Notably, the California state secretary of state, Bill Jones, who charged that the vote-pairing web sites were illegal, was also a Republican supporter of George W. Bush. The federal [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] would eventually rule against him, but this decision did not come down until February 6, 2003, long after the 2000 election was already over. In the next presidential election, in 2004, the legality of the vote-pairing web sites went unquestioned. Indeed, the California state secretary of state for the 2004 election (a successor to Bill Jones) publicly announced, before that election, that vote pairing was legal.

== United States presidential election, 2016 ==
{{Main article|Vote pairing in the United States presidential election, 2016}}
In [[United States presidential election]]s, vote pairing usually comes in the form of voters from "safe" states, or non-swing states, voting for [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] candidates, and voters from [[swing state]]s voting for their second-preference candidate. This form of vote pairing encourages third-party support while minimizing the risk that the more favored major-party candidate will lose [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in the nationwide election (i.e., the "[[spoiler effect]]"). In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]], this has usually manifested in the form of supporters in swing states of [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate [[Gary Johnson]] and [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Jill Stein]] swapping votes with supporters in [[Red states and blue states|blue states]] of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Hillary Clinton]].

== Single-winner elections ==
Vote pairing is a voter strategy for single-winner elections, but it is made moot by the election system of [[instant-runoff voting]], or ranked choice voting. Vote pairing allows a person to electorally support a candidate who is unlikely to win an election, without inadvertently preventing the election of another candidate whom they would otherwise prefer. Instant-runoff voting addresses this same problem within an official voting system. In instant-runoff voting, voters rank their choices. The vote counting runs through everyone's first choices and then the candidate who comes in last gets taken out. The votes of everyone who voted for that candidate then get redistributed to their second-choice candidates and the counting runs through everyone's new top choices again. The process repeats until there's only one candidate left. Advocates of vote pairing tend to simultaneously advocate instant-runoff voting in election reform.

Another alternative is approval voting, which does not use a rank ballot. In approval voting, voters vote for as many candidates as they approve of. The total number of approval votes can greatly exceed the number of voters, but the candidate with the most approval votes wins.

The '''Global Water Security and Sanitation Partnership''' ('''GWSP'''), formerly the '''Water and Sanitation Program''', is a [[trust fund]] administered by the [[World Bank]] geared at improving the accessibility and infrastructure of [[water]] and [[sanitation]] for underdeveloped countries. GWSP works in more than 25 countries through regional offices in [[Africa]], [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]], [[Latin America]], the [[Caribbean]], and an office in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsp.org/about|title=About {{!}} WSP|website=www.wsp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heath P.

Tarbert|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GWSP is best known for its work providing technical assistance, building partnerships and [[capacity building]]. GWSP focuses on both regulatory and structural changes and also [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] projects, such as a scaling up [[handwashing]] project and scaling up sanitation project. Another key aspect of GWSP's work is sharing knowledge and [[best practice]]s through multiple channels. The GWSP has determined five main focus areas: Sustainability, inclusion, institutions, financing, and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/global-water-security-sanitation-partnership#1|title=Global Water Security &amp; Sanitation Partnership (GWSP)|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Activities ==
In addition to other field projects, the program published 108 field notes and technical briefs in 2016. During this year, just under $40 billion US dollars was distributed worldwide, mostly in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/444801485298673631/WSP-EndYear2016-Report-02122016.pdf|title=Water and Sanitation Program: End of Year Report|last=|first=|date=November 2016|website=WSP.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program divides its efforts between the development of sanitation infrastructure and supplies and researching issues impacting the well-being of the communities lacking such facilities.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

=== Other Focus Areas ===

==== Ending open defecation ====
The program has devoted much of its influence to ending [[open defecation]] (OD) which affects 1 billion people worldwide and ultimately leading to an estimated  842,000 deaths annually. As part of the RWSP, the WSP began extensive collecting of data in several countries to explore the factors contributing to open defecation in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Influences Open Defecation and Latrine Ownership in Rural Households?: Findings from a Global Review|last=O’Connell|first=Kathryn|publisher=World Bank|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main methodology they have developed is dubbed the SaniFOAM framework. It is focused on identifying the specific practices or attitudes that need to be improved within a community and then finding solutions to influence them to ultimately end open defecation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing SaniFOAM: A Framework to Analyze Sanitation Behaviors to Design Effective Sanitation Programs|last=Devine|first=Jacqueline|publisher=World Bank|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rural Water and Sanitation Project (RWSP) ====
The Water and Sanitation Program focused mostly on metropolitan areas. The Rural Water and Sanitation Project focuses mainly on the rural areas that don't have access to the materials that the metropolitan areas do. The RWSP expands the water and sewage infrastructure in areas that only have it in a small part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.water-technology.net/projects/ruralwaterandsanitat/|title=Haiti Rural Water and Sanitation Project|website=Water Technology|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project utilizes techniques to shift behavioral habits and sanitation marketing to create a demand for products and services to improve water quality. Beginning in 2006 it was implemented India, Indonesia, and Tanzania. It has now spread to over a dozen countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Water Partnership Program (WPP) ====
The Water Partnership Program focuses on agricultural use of water. WPP recognizes that 70% of the freshwater is being used for agricultural usage. The WPP is researching into agriculture, and taking steps to preserve fresh water from being exploited for growing crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.worldbank.org/water/new-directions-economics-agricultural-water-conservation|title=New directions in the economics of agricultural water conservation|last=Scheierling|first=Susanne M.|date=2016-10-19|website=The Water Blog|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

=== Sustainability ===
The GWSP has stated that their goal is to promote and help fund private sector initiatives in countries with limited access to water. The reasoning of the GWSP behind promoting development in the private sector is that they claim private water suppliers are able to provide better access with less cost, and that the public sector lacks the resources to improve the access to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsp.org/content/domestic-private-sector-participation-dpsp|title=Domestic Private Sector Participation (DPSP) {{!}} WSP|website=www.wsp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been criticisms made about the practice of [[water privatization]] in developing nations. Some criticisms include how, for the sake of increasing profit for water corporations, these private water suppliers do not do an adequate job of developing infrastructure, and once programs to aid development end, many lower-income households are left without access to inexpensive water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/water-managementprivatizationworldbankgroupifc.html|title=OPINION: World Bank wants water privatized, despite risks|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GWSP takes steps to ensure the sustainability of water.
* Plan for the future of population growth, urbanization, and climate change
* Infrastructure built to last and be maintained&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/07/01/global-water-security-sanitation-partnership-launch|title=New Partnership Aims to Help Countries Achieve a Water-Secure World for All|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusion ===
The GWSP includes everyone and makes sure not to discriminate anyone from water.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

=== Institutions ===
There are set rules that institutes make. GWSP tries to figure out the rules to expand its services.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Financing ===
An estimate of $114 billion USD per year until 2030 has been made. To reach that goal, the GWSP is taking steps balancing sources of income, making water affordable, and keeping the viability of water is kept up.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Resilience ===
Extreme weather, and climate change will effect how the GWSP runs. The steps taken to help slow down the shock is to build buildings that are more resilient to temperature change while still providing water.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== History ==
In an effort to improve upon water and sanitation technology for impoverished nations, the [[World Bank]] and [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development program]] founded the program in 1978.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsp.org/about|title=About {{!}} WSP|website=www.wsp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program and its for bearer [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] invested most of its efforts to testing cost-effective technologies such as hand pumps and latrines for future implementation in the 1980s. However, as other world governments and organizations began developing systemic solutions and strategies to approach issues regarding safe water and sanitation, the program followed suit in widening its scope of impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beginning in the early 1990s the World Bank Water and Sanitation Program worked on sustainable solutions for communities to provide water for themselves. Their main objectives were to create systems that could stay in operation and help the communities be independent. By the end of the decade the program divided its efforts into both field projects and research and evaluation of the worlds water systems and practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Donors ==
The program is funded by several countries including [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]], as well as by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ifcextapps.ifc.org/ifcext/pressroom/ifcpressroom.nsf/0/44BCDFFD111F9FAB85257AD80034A58D?OpenDocument|title=Press Releases|website=ifcextapps.ifc.org|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
