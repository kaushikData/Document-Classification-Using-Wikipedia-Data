'''Afro-Paraguayan''' are Paraguayans of African descent. They can be found in Camba Cua outside [[Asuncion]]; Kamba Kokue outside [[Paraguari]], and the city of [[Emboscada, Paraguay|Emboscada]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Currently, the Afro-Paraguayan population accounts for 1% of the total population.

== History ==
The first African slaves arrived at Paraguay in 1556.&lt;ref name="ipsnoticias"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130221212230/http://ipsnoticias.net/print.asp?idnews=94476 Noticias: La otra historia] (in spanish: News: The other story)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the slaves were of Nigerian and [[Angola]]n origin, like other black people from  any South American country. Thus, according to Argentine historian José Ignacio Telesca, the slaves that entered legally came from the esclavistas ports of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Montevideo]] and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], while those that entered illegally came from [[Brazil]].  Thus, the Spanish explorer [[Pedro de Mendoza]] - who reached the [[Rio de Plata]] in the 16th century and was appointed its viceroy - brought enslaved Africans to Paraguay to settle them in that place. According to the aforementioned Telesca, more than 4% of the population were slaves in colonial times, keeping the same percentage in the 19th century after independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/artes-espectaculos/historia-de--esclavos-en-el-paraguay-94075.html Historia de esclavos en el Paraguay] (in Spanish: History of slaves in Paraguay)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to the Kamba Cuá "Afro Paraguayan Association", in 1782, the black population represented 11.2 percent of the total population of the then Province of Paraguay.&lt;ref name="ipsnoticias"/&gt;

This population continued to increase, as already in 1811, according to Telesca, half of the Paraguayan population was of African descent,&lt;ref name="ultimahora"&gt;[http://www.ultimahora.com/notas/117777-En-1811,-la-mitad-de-la-poblaci%C3%B3n-paraguaya-era-afrodescendiente. Ultima hora: "En 1811, la mitad de la población paraguaya era afrodescendiente"]. Retrieved December 3, 2012. written by Cristian Cantero. Editorial [[Última Hora (Asunción)|Última Hora]]&lt;/ref&gt; whether slave or free. So, several towns like Aregua, Emboscada (in English: "Ambush"), and Guarambare were established as black communities.&lt;ref name="dynonline"&gt;[http://www.dynonline.net/es/interior/noticias/kamba-kua/2009.html Día y noche: Arte y cultura sin frontera: La Comunidad Afro paraguaya Kamba Kua] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914031116/http://www.dynonline.net/es/interior/noticias/kamba-kua/2009.html |date=September 14, 2012 }} (in Spanish: Day and night: Art and culture without borders: the Kamba Kua Afro Paraguayan Community).&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, with the arrival of [[José Gervasio Artigas|Artigas]]' also arrived, curiously, people of [[Kamba people|Kamba]] ethnicity, a [[Kenya]]n ethnic group, from [[Uruguay]], who settled in Paraguay in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="infoluque"&gt;[http://www.infoluque.com.py/historia/vivencias/06kambakua.htm Info Zuque. com. Se los llama Kamba Kua] (in Spanish: They are call Kamba Kua)&lt;/ref&gt; They arrived in a regiment of 250 spearmen, men and women, who accompanied General Jose Gervasio Artigas, the revolutionary leader of the now Uruguay, in his exile in Paraguay.&lt;ref name="ipsnoticias"/&gt;
The Kamba Cua were dispossessed of their land by General [[Higinio Morinigo]] in the 1940s. Of his 100 hectares they stayed with 3 hectares.&lt;ref name="softcha"/&gt;

== Demography ==
Although according official estimates, the Afro-Paraguayan population accounts for 2% of the total population, the Afro Paraguayan Association Kamba Cuá, supported by the Department of Statistics, Surveys and Censuses (Dgeec) and the U.S. and state IAF, estimated the number of Afro-Paraguayan people at only 8,013, equivalent to 0.13 percent of the 6.1 million inhabitants of Paraguay.&lt;ref name="ipsnoticias"/&gt; This census indicates specifically that there are 422 people in Kamba Cua, 385 people in Kamba Kokué, and more than 7,000 people in Emboscada: 2,686 in urban areas and 4,524 in rural areas and 58% of the total population are of African descent.&lt;ref name="otramerica"&gt;[http://otramerica.com/comunidades/afroparaguayos-condenados-a-no-existir/720 Otra América: comunidades afroparaguayas condenadas a no existir] (in spanish: Another America: communities afroparaguayas sentenced to absence)&lt;/ref&gt;  So, of the total of African descent, 5.6 percent live in  Kamba Cuá, 4,9 percent in Kamba Kokue and 89.5 percent in Emboscada.&lt;ref name="ipsnoticias"/&gt;

The census also shows that they are virtually matched for sex and they have a predominantly young population: 63% at that time were under 30 years old. All those of African descent speak Guarani, like the rest of the Paraguayans. The illiteracy rate stands at 7.4%, and of that percentage, 58% are women. The number of people who have come to attend the first through to sixth grade accounted for 60% and those who have reached university level only 1%.

Note that the results are incomplete, since the census did not reach all residents, especially in Emboscada; in addition, some residents surveyed did not identify themselves as Afro apart from other concentrations of African descent Paraguayan and individuals of African descent throughout the country that were not included in the census.&lt;ref name="otramerica"/&gt;

As already mentioned, there are three communities of Afro-Paraguayan: the Kamba Cuá, in the [[Central Department]] (outside [[Asuncion]]), Kamba Kokue, meaning  "chacra de negros" (farm of blacks) in [[Guarani language]], and is situated in the [[Paraguarí Department]], and  [[Emboscada, Paraguay|Emboscada]],  in the [[Cordillera Department]]. The three communities are in the eastern region. The origins of these settlements dates back to the Spanish colonial period.

'''Kamba Cuá''' is the place having the most important Afro Paraguayan community. This place, in the [[Central Department]], is populated by so-called '''Artigas Cue''' -or "black of Kamba Cuá"-, which are descended from the [[Kamba people]] (a [[Kenyan]] ethnic group&lt;ref name="infoluque"/&gt;). They arrived in Paraguay as members of a regiment of 250 spearmen, men and women, who accompanied General [[Jose Gervasio Artigas]], the independence´s leading revolutionary of the Eastern Band (the current [[Uruguay]]) in his exile in Paraguay in 1820. After having arrived in Asunción, they settled in the [[Loma Pytá (Asunción)|Campamento Loma area]], practising dairy and secondary agriculture. However, in the 1940s, they were dispossessed of their land by General [[Higinio Morinigo]]. Of his 100 hectares they stayed with 3 hectares.&lt;ref name="softcha"/&gt; However, the community survived, kept his chapel and dances, created a football club ("Jan Six-ro") and one school of drum and dance for children. His ballet is the only Afro-Paraguayan expression, and premiered at the Folk Festival peach "Uruguay Yi sings in" 1992, where it won the "Golden charrúa". Their original lands at Campamento Loma remained vacant, and Kamba Cuá recently occupied them and planted manioc, but by the government decision of Was mosy (postStroessner), were accused of bring "terrorists" and were beaten and evicted.

Today, according official estimates, about 300 families (between 1,200 and 2,500 people) live in Kumba Cuá.&lt;ref name="dynonline"/&gt; However, according censuses of the Afro Paraguayan Association Kamba Cuá, this community consists of only 422 people.&lt;ref name="otramerica"/&gt; Religion is an integral part of daily life. Currently they are Catholic. His saint is San Benito of Palermo and King San Baltazar, who came from Uruguay. Their main festival is celebrated on 6 January each year at the community's social club named after the patron saint. The important ballet artistic expressions of the Kamba Kua and culinary arts of this community have been maintained for nearly 180 years. 
Their oral tradition recalls that many of them participated and died in the defensive war against the Triple Alliance (1865–69), which destroyed Paraguay.
They keep memories of their history, passed down from generation to generation, hold dances like "candombe", dedicated to San Baltasar, and drumming.&lt;ref name="dynonline"/&gt; So, this community is the best known of African descent in Paraguay for having preserved their identity and culture, promoted through its traditional festivals.&lt;ref name="softcha"&gt;[http://adm4840.softcha.com/kambakua/comunidad.htm La comunidad Afro Paraguaya Kamba Kua] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417204312/http://adm4840.softcha.com/kambakua/comunidad.htm |date=April 17, 2009 }} (the Afro-Paraguayan community Kamba Kua&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emboscada''' (in Spanish: "Ambush"), a city that now has about 14,000 inhabitants, was founded in 1740 under the name of "Emboscada de Pardos libres "(Free Pardos ambush), because it was a point of frequent ambushes and because early settlers were 500 brown (black and mestizos) freedmen.

'''Kamba Kokue''', in the [[Paraguarí Department]], was also founded by black communities, from ranches of slaves of the religious missionaries of the Catholic Society of Jesus, better known as the Jesuit order.&lt;ref name="ipsnoticias"/&gt; Also towns or villages as Aregua, Emboscada, and Guarambaré were established as black communities.&lt;ref name="softcha"/&gt;

== Year of African descent ==
The [[United Nations]] declared 2011 the International Year of People of African Descent in order to strengthen national policies and international cooperation for the benefit of this group to achieve, in theory, the satisfaction of all their rights, their participation and integration in all political, economic, social and cultural aspects of society, and promote greater understanding and respect for the diverse heritage and culture of these people.

In this context in Paraguay has been developing the tour of a show called "Negritud de colores" (Negritude Colors) that runs different cities. It is a show of Afro-Latin American music and dance scene that rises to 25 artists to develop a wide repertoire of songs, chants and dances with rescued African roots of this continent. The Paraguayan singer Mariví Vargas, the team of musicians and a group of drummers and dancers Kamba Cua led by Lazaro Medina offer a show that aims to bring African culture and make visible the collective African descent.

Showing and themes from Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, Mexico and Cuba and of course of Paraguay, with the presentation of the galloping "San Baltasar" and "Kamba la Merce," a rich description of the dances related popular culture afroparaguaya, plus rhythms Kamba Cua group like-Pitiki Guarimba pitiki and gallops.&lt;ref name="otramerica"/&gt;

==Notable Afro-Paraguayans==
* '''Lázaro Medina''', Director of the Ballet Camba Cua
* '''[[José Carlos Medina]]''', General Secretary of the Kamba Kuá (“black people’s hollow,” or “cave,” in Guaraní) Afro-Paraguayan Association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">'''Al-Mansur al-Qasim''' (November 13, 1559 – February 19, 1620), with the cognomen ''al-Kabir'' (the Great), was an [[Imam]] of [[Yemen]], who commenced the struggle to liberate Yemen from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupiers. He was the founder of a [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] kingdom that endured, under many vicissitudes, until 1962.

==Proclamation of the imamate==

Al-Qasim bin Muhammad was a fourteenth-generation descendant of the imam [[ad-Da'i Yusuf]] (d. 1012).&lt;ref&gt;The line of descent is: ad-Da'i Yusuf - al-Qasim - Yusuf - Muhammad - Yahya - Ali - al-Husayn - Ahmad - ar-Rashid - Ali - Muhammad - Ali - Muhammad - al-Mansur al-Qasim.&lt;/ref&gt; His father supported the imam al-Mutahhar (d. 1572), who fought the encroaching Ottomans with partial success but who was finally defeated in 1569-1570. Al-Qasim was a religious teacher at the Dawud [[mosque]] in [[San'a]] at a time when the Ottoman grip on Yemen was severely felt. The Turks promoted the [[Sunni]] legal tradition of [[Hanafi]], at the expense of the [[Zaydiyyah]] which dominated in the highlands of Yemen. One of al-Qasim's pupils suggested him to claim the Zaidi [[imamate]], which he first declined. The suspicions of the Turks were however raised, and al-Qasim fled San'a, finally setting forth his claim ([[da'wah]]) to the imamate in Hajur in the north-west in September 1597.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological position==

In his theological thinking al-Mansur al-Qasim upheld the [[Shia]] foundations of [[Zaydiyyah]] by stressing the eighth-century Jarudi position to the [[imamate]] which considered the first two [[caliph]]s as usurpers. He emphasized the differences between Zaydiyyah and the [[Mu'tazila]] school of theology, which laid stress on reason and rational thought, whereas some previous Yemeni imams had noted the similarities. He argued that the early imams had limited their prescriptions to what could be traced to reason, the unambiguous [[Qur'an]] text, and the generally accepted [[Sunnah]]. These imams, he argued, did not follow the Mu'tazila in their speculations and fantasies. Al-Mansur al-Qasim was also hostile to [[Sufism]], one reason being that the Sufi orders supported the Ottoman occupants. He branded the Sufis as heretics and likened them to [[Ismaili]]tes, traditional enemies of the Zaidis.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. XI, Leiden 2002, p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The struggle against the Ottoman Turks==

Although supported by the Ahnumi tribesmen, al-Qasim's first years of struggle were difficult. Strong action by the Ottoman forces reduced the imam to despair by 1604. Then, however, the [[emir]] of the important stronghold [[Hajjah]] in the western mountains chose to support al-Qasim. From this point the forces of the imamate held the initiative. In 1607 the Ottoman governor Sinan made an agreement with al-Qasim, where the latter was granted possession of the areas in the northern highlands which he had subdued. Infighting among the Turkish administrators in 1613 left the north of the country exposed to the forces of the imam, and the important city [[Sa'dah]] fell in 1617. Two years later a new truce was concluded that confirmed the expanded realm of al-Qasim. By this time he controlled the entire area between [[Sana'a]] and Sa'dah. When he died in 1620, the city of San'a and the coastal region [[Tihamah]] were still in Ottoman hands. It was left to his son and successor [[al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad]] (r. 1620-1644) to expel them entirely. By this time the Yemenis possessed firearms which, together with the poor quality of local Ottoman soldiery and strong local discontent with taxation, ensured military successes against the occupiers. Although the Zaidi imamate is not strictly speaking hereditary, but depends on the qualifications and [[Sayyid]] ancestry of the claimant, al-Mansur al-Qasim actually founded a dynasty, known after him as the [[Qasimids]].&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, pp. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bisu''' ({{zh|毕苏语}}) is a [[Loloish language]] of [[Thailand]], with a couple thousand speakers in China. Varieties are Bisu proper (Mbisu) and Laomian (Guba), considered by Pelkey to be distinct languages.

The Laomian are classified within the [[Lahu people|Lahu]] ethnic group; the Lahu proper call them the "Lawmeh" (Bradley 2007).

==Distribution==
According to ''Bisuyu Yanjiu'' 毕苏语研究 (2002), there are over 5,000 Bisu speakers in [[Yunnan]], China, and a total of nearly 10,000 Bisu speakers in all countries combined. Within Yunnan, it is spoken mostly in [[Puer City|Pu'er]] Prefecture, as well as neighboring parts of [[Xishuangbanna]].

In Thailand, two dialects of Bisu are spoken in the following villages of [[Phan District]], [[Chiang Rai Province]] (''Bisuyu Yanjiu'' 2002:152).
*''Dialect 1'': Huai Chomphu village (also called Ban Huaisan) and Doi Pui village
*''Dialect 2'': Phadaeng village

Another variety of Bisu differing from the Phayao variety is spoken in Takɔ (Ban Thako), [[Mae Suai District]], [[Chiang Rai Province]].

In Laos, Bisu (''pi33 su44''; also called Lao-Phai) is spoken in Phudokcham village, [[Phongsaly District|Phongxaly District]].&lt;ref&gt;Kingsadā, Thō̜ngphet, and [[Shintani Tadahiko|Tadahiko Shintani]]. 1999.

'''Cacaopera''' is an extinct language belonging to the [[Misumalpan languages|Misumalpan]] family, formerly spoken in the department of Morazán in [[El Salvador]]. It was closely related to [[Matagalpa language|Matagalpa]], and slightly more distantly to [[Sumo language|Sumo]], but was geographically separated from other Misumalpan languages.

The last [[semi-speaker]]s of Cacaopera lived in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ailla.utexas.org/search/resource.html?r_id=2551|title=MesoAmerican Languages Collection of Lyle Campbell|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|date=1973|website=Archive of the Indigenous Language of Latin America|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|access-date=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[First language|native speakers]] had died before this time.

The '''East Fijian languages''' are a subgroup of the [[Central Pacific languages|Central Pacific (Fijian–Polynesian)]] languages. They are four: [[Fijian language|Fijian]], [[Gone Dau language|Gone Dau]], [[Lauan language|Lauan]] and [[Lomaiviti language|Lomaiviti]] all spoken within [[Fiji]].

The [[West Fijian languages]] are more closely related to [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]], and East Fijian to the [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]], than they are to each other, but contact has caused them to converge.

In [[sociology]], a [[social institution]] has '''eufunctions''' (or ''helpful functions''; the Greek word ''eu'' means ''well'') when some of its aspects contribute to the maintenance or survival of another social activity. In the complexity of a society, any particular activity can have good and/or bad consequences and it can be associated to eufunctions or [[:wikt:dysfunction|dysfunction]]s.
In the last decades the term '''eufunction''' is becoming [[obsolete]], because the notion of function refers to any kind of activity helping or disturbing the maintenance of social stability.

'''Euskal Herriak Bere Eskola''' (''The Basque Country its own School'' in [[Basque language]]) or '''EHBE''' is a [[Basque people|Basque]] [[education]] organization that works for a school system based on [[Basque language]] and culture. It wants to engage with other historical Basque educational organizations, as [[Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea|UEU]], [[ikastola]]s or [[student activism]]. It was created in 2002.

==Main campaigns==
Since 2002 EHBE has been involved in many campaigns, specially on mobilization on different topics:
* Primary school in Basque language.
* [[Euskal Unibertsitatea]], or Basque University.
* [[Euskal Curriculuma]], or the development of a Basque Curricula.
* Promoting debate between different projects and sensibilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">'''Experimental epidemiology''' is a type of [[epidemiological]] investigation that uses an experimental model to confirm a causal relationship suggested by observational studies. It studies the relationships of various factors determining the frequency and distribution of diseases in a community.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology and Public Health"&gt;{{cite web|title=Epidemiology and Public Health|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/epidemiology-and-public-health/|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=experimental epidemiology|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/experimental+epidemiology|website=medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case types ==

There are three case types in experimental epidemiology: randomized controlled trial, typically used for new medicine or drug testing; field trial, which is conducted on those at high risk of contracting a disease; and community trial, in which research is conducted on an entire community or neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology and Public Health"/&gt;  Randomized controlled trial determines the efficacy of a particular treatment, while other trials may be preventive intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m39gomigh5YC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Handbook of Epidemiology|isbn= 9783540265771|author1= Ahrens|first1= Wolfgang|last2= Pigeot|first2= Iris|date= 2007-07-26 |page=7|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

Experimental epidemiology employs prospective population experiments designed to test epidemiological hypotheses, and usually attempts to relate the postulated cause to the observed effect. Trials of new [[anthelmintics]] are an example.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology and Public Health"/&gt; Intervention or experimentation involves attempting to change a variable in one or more groups of people. This could mean eliminating a dietary factor thought to cause allergy, or testing a new treatment on a selected group of patients. The effects of an intervention are measured by comparing the result in the experimental group with that in a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonita|first1=R.|last2=Beaglehole|first2=R.|last3=Kjellström|first3=Tord|title=Basic Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=AAZGobMNTXgC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22Experimental+Epidemiology%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sxBdw8GZnZ&amp;sig=iYhVEXLBJdWRqfWXM0gA58VIt40&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc0Ibmu4HaAhXJWpAKHUDpDLY4ChDoAQhZMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Experimental%20Epidemiology%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''footpath''' (also pedestrian way, [[walking trail]], [[nature trail]]) is a type of [[thoroughfare]] that is intended for use only by [[pedestrian]]s and not other forms of traffic such as [[Motor vehicle|motorized vehicles]], cycles, and [[horseback|horses]]. They can be found in a wide variety of places, from the centre of cities, to farmland, to mountain ridges. Urban footpaths are usually paved, may have steps, and can be called [[alleys]], lanes, steps, etc.

[[National parks]], [[nature preserve]]s, [[conservation area]]s and other protected [[wilderness]] areas may have footpaths ([[trail]]s) that are restricted to pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/vafo/planyourvisit/hikingtrails.htm |title=Trails - Valley Forge National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term footpath can also describe a pavement/[[sidewalk]] in some English-speaking countries (such as Australia and the Republic of Ireland).

A footpath can also take the form of a [[footbridge]], linking two places across a river. 
==Origins and history==
Public footpaths are [[rights of way]] originally created by people walking across the land to work, market, the next village, church, and school. This includes [[Mass path]]s and [[Corpse road]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampsteadramblers.org.uk/history/14-history-highways.html |title=History - footpaths, highways and public rights of way |publisher=Hampsteadramblers.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cambswalks.blogspot.ca/2014/04/history-of-footpaths.html |title=Cambridgeshire walks: History of footpaths |publisher=Cambswalks.blogspot.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some footpaths were also created by those undertaking a [[pilgrimage]]. Examples of the latter are the [[Pilgrim's Way]] in England and [[Pilgrim's Route]] (St. Olav's Way or the Old Kings' Road) in Norway. Some landowners allow access over their land without dedicating a right of way. These permissive paths are often indistinguishable from normal paths, but they are usually subject to restrictions. Such paths are often closed at least once a year, so that a permanent right of way cannot be established in law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/2011/08/rights-of-way/ |title=Everything you need to know about Rights of Way &amp;#124; Ordnance Survey Blog |publisher=Ordnancesurvey.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Corpse Road - geograph.org.uk - 72907.jpg|thumb|Corpse road in the English [[Lake District]]]]

A mass path is a [[pedestrian]] track or road connecting destinations frequently used by rural communities, most usually the destination of [[Sunday Mass]]. They were most common during the centuries that preceded motorised transportation in Western Europe, and in particular the British Isles and the Netherlands (where such a path is called "kerkenpad" (lit. Church path). Mass paths typically included stretches crossing fields of neighboring farmers and were likely to contain [[stile]]s, when crossing fences or other boundaries, or plank [[footbridge]]s to cross ditches. Some mass paths are still used today in the [[Republic of Ireland]], but are usually subject to Ireland's complicated [[rights of way]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/index.php?id=54&amp;trail=126&amp;no_cache=1 |title=Coillte Outdoors: Mass Path/River Walk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129150107/http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/index.php?id=54&amp;trail=126&amp;no_cache=1 |archive-date=2007-11-29 |date=2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpse roads provided a practical means for transporting corpses, often from remote communities, to [[cemetery|cemeteries]] that had burial rights, such as parish churches and [[chapel of ease|chapels of ease]].&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;Muir, Richard (2008), ''Woods, Hedgerows and Leafy Lanes.'' Tempus, Chalford. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-4615-8}}; p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Great Britain]], such routes can also be known by a number of other names: bier road, burial road, coffin road, coffin line, lyke or lych way, funeral road, procession way, corpse way,&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; etc.

Nowadays footpaths are mainly used for recreation and have been frequently linked together, along with bridle paths and newly created footpaths, to create [[long distance trails]]. Also organizations have been formed in various countries to protect the right to use public footpaths, including the [[Ramblers Association]] in England. Footpaths are now also found in [[botanic garden]]s, [[arboretum]]s, [[regional park]]s, [[conservation area]]s, [[wildlife garden]]s, and [[open-air museum]]s. There are also [[educational trail]]s, [[themed walk]]s, [[sculpture trail]]s and historic interpretive trails.

==Rights of way==
[[File:Thottu Varambu.jpg|thumbnail|Footpath in [[Kuttippuram]], India.]]
In [[England and Wales]], public footpaths are [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights of way]] on which pedestrians have a legally protected right to travel. Other public [[Right of way (public throughway)|rights of way]] in England and Wales, such as [[bridleway]]s, [[byway (road)|byway]]s, [[towpath]]s, and [[Green lane (road)|green lanes]] are also used by pedestrians. In Scotland there is no legal distinction between a footpath and a [[bridleway]] and it is generally accepted that cyclists and horse riders may follow any right of way with a suitable surface. The law is different in both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] and there are far fewer rights of way in Ireland as a whole (see [[Keep Ireland Open]]).

===Definitive path maps===
Footpaths and other rights of way in England and Wales are shown on [[definitive map]]s. A definitive map is a record of public [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights of way]] in England and Wales. In law it is the definitive record of where a right of way is located. The highway authority (normally the [[county council]], or unitary authority in areas with a one-tier system) has a statutory duty to maintain a definitive map, though in national parks the [[national park authority]] usually maintains the map. The [[Inner London]] boroughs are exempt from the statutory duty though they have the powers to maintain a map: currently none does so.&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.ramblers.org.uk/footpaths/law/definitivemap.html Public Paths and the Definitive Map] from the [[Ramblers Association]] and 
[http://www.planning-inspectorate.gov.uk/pins/appeals/rights_of_way/rights_way.htm Definitive Map Orders: Consistency Guidelines] from the [[Planning Inspectorate]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland different legislation applies and there is no legally recognised record of rights of way. However, there is a National Catalogue of Rights of Way (CROW), compiled by the Scottish Rights of Way and Access Society (Scotways), in partnership with Scottish Natural Heritage, and the help of local authorities.&lt;ref name="Rights of way in Scotland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/access/sr-sprow.pdf|format=PDF|title= Rights of way in Scotland|publisher=Snh.org.uk|accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open Spaces Society===
[[File:Stepping Stones - geograph.org.uk - 5528.jpg|left|thumb|[[Step-stone bridge|Stepping stones]] in the [[River Rothay]], [[Lake District]], England.]]
The [[Open Spaces Society]] is a charitable British organisation that works to protect public rights of way and open spaces in the United Kingdom, such as [[common land]] and [[village green]]s. It is Britain's oldest national conservation body. The society was founded as the Commons Preservation Society and merged with the National Footpaths Society in 1899, and adopted their present name.&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;[http://www.oss.org.uk/ Open Spaces Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the Open Spaces Society's work is concerned with the preservation and creation of public paths. Before the introduction of  [[definitive map]]s of public paths in the early 1950s, the public did not know where paths were, and the Open Spaces Society helped the successful campaign for paths to be shown on [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. It advises the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] and National Assembly for Wales on applications for works on common land. Local authorities are legally required to consult the society whenever there is a proposal to alter the route of a public right of way.&lt;ref name="oss"/&gt;

[[The Ramblers]] are another British organisation concerned with the protection of footpaths.

==Urban footpaths==
[[File:Grange farm map.png|thumb|250px|A map which shows a network of paths (dotted blue) created in the town of [[Kesgrave]], Suffolk, England, for walkers and cyclists]]
There are a variety of footpaths in urban settings, including paths along streams and rivers, through [[park]]s and across [[Common land|commons]]. Another type is the [[alley]], normally providing access to the rear of properties or connecting built-up roads not easily reached by vehicles. [[Towpath]]s are another kind of urban footpath, but they are often shared with cyclists. A typical footpath in a park is found along the [[seawall]] in [[Stanley Park]], [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. This is a segregated path, with one lane for skaters and cyclists and the other for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Kevin; Terri Clark (4 February 2005). "Grand Old Man of the Seawall". ''Vancouver Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA and Canada, where [[urban sprawl]] has begun to strike even the most rural communities, developers and local leaders are currently striving to make their communities more conducive to non-motorized transportation through the use of less traditional paths. The [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] has established the [[Active Living by Design]] program to improve the [[Quality of life|livability]] of communities in part through developing trails,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humpal.org/program-areas/active-living-primer |title=Active Living By Design |publisher=Humpal.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Upper Valley Trails Alliance]] has done similar work on traditional trails, while the [[Somerville Community Path]] and related paths, are examples of urban initiatives. In [[St. John’s, Newfoundland|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland]], Canada The [[Grand Concourse (St. John's)|Grand Concourse]], is an integrated [[walkway]] system that has over {{convert|160|km|mi|sp=us}} of footpaths which link every major park, river, pond, and green space in six municipalities.

In [[Walking in London|London]], England, there are several long-distance walking routes which combine footpaths and roads to link green spaces. These include the [[Capital Ring]], [[London Outer Orbital Path]] and the [[Jubilee Walkway]], the use of which have been endorsed by [[Transport for London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/top-walking-routes|title=Walk London|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alley and steps===
[[File:Marten-Trotzigs-Graend.jpg|170px|left|thumb|A typical urban footpath: [[Mårten Trotzigs Gränd]], {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide, the narrowest alley in [[Gamla stan]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden]]
An [[alley]] is a narrow, usually paved, pedestrian path, often between the walls of buildings in towns and cities. This type is usually short and straight, and on steep ground can consist partially or entirely of steps. In older cities and towns in Europe, alleys are often what is left of a medieval street network, or a [[right of way]] or ancient footpath. Similar paths also exist in some older North American towns and cities. In some older urban development in North America lanes at the rear of houses, to allow for deliveries and garbage collection, are called alleys. Alleys may be paved, or unpaved, and a blind alley is a [[cul-de-sac]]. Some alleys are roofed because they are within buildings, such as the [[traboule]]s of [[Lyon]], or when they are a pedestrian passage through railway embankments in Britain. The latter follow the line of [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights-of way]] that existed before the railway was built.

Because of  [[topography]], steps ([[stairs]]) are the predominant form of alley in hilly cities and towns. This includes [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] (see [[Steps of Pittsburgh]]), [[Cincinnati]] (see [[Steps of Cincinnati]]), [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlestairwalks.com/ |title=Seattle Stairway Walks |publisher=Seattlestairwalks.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[San Francisco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sisterbetty.org/stairways/ |title=Stairways of San Francisco |publisher=Sisterbetty.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, as well as [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abhk.org/ill-take-the-stairs%E2%80%A8/ |title=I’ll take the stairs : Alliance For a Beautiful Hong Kong |publisher=Abhk.org |date=2013-01-11 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://italiannotes.com/5-steps-to-rome/ |title=Steps to Rome - Top 5 of interesting steps and staircases in Rome |publisher=Italiannotes.com |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long distance paths==
Footpaths (and other rights of way) have been combined, and new paths created, so as to produce [[Long distance trail|long distance walking routes]] in a number of countries. These can be rural in nature, such as the [[Essex Way]], in southern England, which crosses farmland, or urban as with [[Walking in London|various routes in London, England]], or along a coastline like the [[South West Coast Path]] in the [[West of England]], or in the high mountains, like the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] in the USA, which reaches  {{convert|13153|ft|m|0}}{{refn|

[[File:Shaharah bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A footbridge in [[Shaharah District]], Yemen]]

==Maintenance==
Many footpaths require some maintenance. Most rural paths have an earth or grass surface with [[stile]]s, and or gates, including [[kissing gate]]s. A few will have [[Step-stone bridge|stepping stones]], fords, or bridges. Urban footpaths may be constructed of [[masonry]], [[brick]], [[concrete]], asphalt, cut [[stone]] or [[boardwalk|wood boardwalk]]. [[Crushed rock]], [[decomposed granite]], fine [[wood chips]] are also used. The construction materials can vary over the length of the footpath and may start with a well constructed hard surface in an urban area, and end with an inexpensive soft or loose surface in the countryside. Stairs or steps are sometimes found in urban [[alley]]s, or cliff paths to beaches.

==Issues==
The main issues in urban areas include maintenance, litter, crime, and lighting after dark. In the countryside there are issues relating to conflicts between walkers and livestock, and these occasionally result in people being injured or even killed. Dogs often contribute to such conflicts – see in [[England and Wales]] The [[Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953]]. Also footpaths in remote locations can be difficult to maintain and a route along a country path can be impeded by ploughing, crops, overgrown vegetation, illegal barriers (including [[barbed wire]]), damaged [[stile]]s, etc.

===Confrontation with landowners in the UK===
{{see also|Highways in England and Wales}}
There have been numerous problems over the years in England and Wales with landowners.

One notable example was with the millionaire property tycoon [[Nicholas Van Hoogstraten]] who had a long-standing dislike of and dispute with ramblers, describing them as "scum of the earth". In 1999 Mr Hoogstraten erected a large fence across a footpath on his country estate in East Sussex. Local ramblers staged a protest against the erection of the fence outside the boundary of Van Hoogstraten's estate. On 10 February 2003 and after a 13-year battle and numerous legal proceedings, the path was finally re-opened.&lt;ref&gt;Raath, Jan (3 July 2009). ''The Times'' (London).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Isle of Man====
Another conflict involved [[Jeremy Clarkson]], a TV presenter and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' host who lives on the [[Isle of Man]]. He became frustrated at the lack of privacy at his home when ramblers deviated from a pathway to take photographs of his dwelling. Clarkson's property bordered a small 250-metre strip of land that had no definitive status as a public right of way but was used by walkers regardless. Clarkson aimed to close access to this small strip of his land, thereby forcing ramblers to take a small diversion to stick to the official public [[right of way]] and therefore protecting his claimed right to privacy on his own property. In May 2010 the former transport minister, Hon. [[David Anderson (Manx politician)|David Anderson]] MHK, accepted the conclusions of a public inquiry that all except five of the paths claimed at the inquiry as public rights of way have been dedicated as public rights of way and should be added to the definitive map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/transport/highways/ViewNews.gov?menuid=18480&amp;page=lib/news/transport/highways/publicinquiryint.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002231815/http://www.gov.im/transport/highways/ViewNews.gov?menuid=18480&amp;page=lib%2Fnews%2Ftransport%2Fhighways%2Fpublicinquiryint.xml |archive-date=2012-10-02 |date=2012-10-02 |title=Public Inquiry into Public Rights of Way on the Langness Peninsula – Highways Division Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghulam Mohammad Farhad''' (1901–1984) was an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[engineer]] and [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Pashtun]] nationalist.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} He lived in [[Germany]] on a royal scholarship from 1921 to 1928, training as an [[electrician]] at the [[Technical University of Munich]]. During his studies in Germany, he came in contact with [[Nazi]] policy and became fascinated by some aspects of it.&lt;ref&gt;Th. Ruttig, ''"Afghanistan's Political Parties and where they come from (1902-2006)"'', [[Konrad Adenauer Stiftung]], Germany; with references to Abdulhamid Mubarez, ''Tahlil-e waqe’at.e siasi-ye Afghanistan 1919-1996'', Kabul, 1996: ''"... In 1948, Farhad was the first elected mayor of Kabul. &lt;u&gt;From 1934, he had studied in Nazi Germany and was fascinated by some aspects of its policy.&lt;/u&gt; ..."''; ([http://www.acsf.af/English/articles/KAS%20pol%20parties%20paper.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; After he returned to Afghanistan, Farhad was appointed to several electricity-related posts in the government, finally serving as president of the Kabul Electric Company from 1939 to 1966. He traveled to Germany in 1947 to acquire equipment; he was often accused of favoring German-manufactured products. From 1948 to 1954, he was mayor of [[Kabul]]. He notably installed the city's first traffic lights and declared a switch to right-hand driving. In 1966, Farhad created the [[Afghan Social Democratic Party]] (also known as ''Afghan Mellat'' or "Afghan Nation") on the bases of Pashtun nationalism, [[social democracy]], and [[anticommunism]]. He was elected to Parliament, representing the sixth district of Kabul, in 1968, but resigned his seat in 1970. He was later a [[political prisoner]] of the PDPA/[[Khalq]] government from 1979 to 1980, when he was freed in a general [[amnesty]].

The '''history of chemistry''' represents a time span from [[ancient history]] to the present. By 1000 BC, civilizations used technologies that would eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry. Examples include extracting [[metal]]s from [[ore]]s, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, rendering fat into [[soap]], making [[glass]],
and making [[alloy]]s like [[bronze]].

The protoscience of chemistry, [[alchemy]], was unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations. However, by performing experiments and recording the results, alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry. The distinction began to emerge 
when a clear differentiation was made between chemistry and alchemy by [[Robert Boyle]] in his work ''[[The Sceptical Chymist]]'' (1661). While both [[alchemy]] and [[chemistry]] are concerned with matter and its transformations, [[chemist]]s are seen as applying [[scientific method]] to their work.

[[Chemistry]] is considered to have become an established science with the work of [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed a law of [[conservation of mass]] that demanded careful measurement and quantitative observations of chemical phenomena.  The history of chemistry is intertwined with the [[history of thermodynamics]], especially through the work of [[Willard Gibbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/papers.html Selected Classic Papers from the History of Chemistry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==

=== Early humans ===

A 100,000-Year-Old ochre-processing workshop was found at Blombos Cave in South Africa. It indicates that early humans had an elementary knowledge of chemistry. Paintings drawn by early humans consisting of early humans mixing animal blood with other liquids found on cave walls also indicate a small knowledge of chemistry.&lt;ref name="CS Al. 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=A 100,000-year-old ochre-processing workshop at Blombos Cave, South Africa |journal=Science |volume=334 |issue=6053 |pages=219–22 |doi=10.1126/science.1211535 | date=2011-10-15 | pmid=21998386 | access-date=2018-10-04|last1=Henshilwood |first1=C.

===Early metallurgy===
{{Main|History of ferrous metallurgy|History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent}}

The earliest recorded metal employed by humans seems to be [[gold]] which can be found free or "native". Small amounts of natural gold have been found in Spanish caves used during the late [[Paleolithic]] period, ''c.'' 40,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gold-eagle.com/gold_digest/history_gold.html | title = History of Gold | publisher = Gold Digest | accessdate = 2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Silver]], [[copper]], [[tin]] and [[meteoric iron]] can also be found native, allowing a limited amount of [[metalworking]] in ancient cultures.&lt;ref name=ephotos&gt;Photos, E., 'The Question of Meteorictic versus Smelted Nickel-Rich Iron: Archaeological Evidence and Experimental Results' ''World Archaeology'' Vol. 20, No. 3, Archaeometallurgy (February 1989), pp. 403–421. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/124562 Online version] accessed on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian weapons made from [[meteoric iron]] in about 3000 BC were highly prized as "Daggers from Heaven".&lt;ref name=keller&gt;W. Keller (1963) ''The Bible as History'', p. 156 {{ISBN|0-340-00312-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the first chemical reaction used in a controlled manner was [[combustion|fire]]. However, for millennia fire was seen simply as a mystical force that could transform one substance into another (burning wood, or boiling water) while producing heat and light. Fire affected many aspects of early societies. These ranged from the simplest facets of everyday life, such as cooking and habitat lighting, to more advanced technologies, such as pottery, bricks, and melting of metals to make tools.

It was fire that led to the discovery of glass and the [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purification]] of metals which in turn gave way to the rise of [[metallurgy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmog.org/article/origins-glassmaking|title=THE ORIGINS OF GLASSMAKING|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=Corning Museum of Glass|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early stages of metallurgy, methods of purification of metals were sought, and [[gold]], known in [[ancient Egypt]] as early as 2900 BC, became a precious metal.

===Bronze Age===
{{Main|Bronze Age}}
Certain metals can be recovered from their ores by simply heating the rocks in a fire: notably [[tin]], [[lead]] and (at a higher temperature) copper, a process known as [[smelting]]. The first evidence of this extractive metallurgy dates from the 5th and 6th millennium&amp;nbsp;BC, and was found in the archaeological sites of [[Majdanpek]], [[Yarmovac]] and [[Plocnik]], all three in [[Serbia]]. To date, the earliest copper smelting is found at the Belovode site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.06.012|title=On the origins of extractive metallurgy: New evidence from Europe|year=2010|last1=Radivojević|first1=Miljana|last2=Rehren|first2=Thilo|last3=Pernicka|first3=Ernst|last4=Šljivar|first4=Dušan|last5=Brauns|first5=Michael|last6=Borić|first6=Dušan|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=37|issue=11|pages=2775}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; these examples include a copper axe from 5500 BC belonging to the [[Vinča culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002605.html Neolithic Vinca was a metallurgical culture] Stonepages from news sources November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other signs of early metals are found from the third millennium&amp;nbsp;BC in places like [[Palmela]] (Portugal), [[Los Millares]] (Spain), and [[Stonehenge]] (United Kingdom). However, as often happens with the study of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the ultimate beginnings cannot be clearly defined and new discoveries are ongoing. 
[[File:Metal production in Ancient Middle East.svg|thumb|Mining areas of the ancient Middle East. Boxes colors: [[arsenic]] is in brown, [[copper]] in red, [[tin]] in grey, iron in reddish brown, gold in yellow, silver in white and [[lead]] in black. Yellow area stands for [[arsenic bronze]], while grey area stands for tin [[bronze]].]]

These first metals were single ones or as found.  By combining copper and tin, a superior metal could be made, an [[alloy]] called [[bronze]], a major technological shift which began the [[Bronze Age]] about 3500 BC. The Bronze Age was period in human cultural development when the most advanced metalworking (at least in systematic and widespread use) included techniques for smelting [[copper]] and [[tin]] from naturally occurring outcroppings of copper ores, and then [[smelting]] those ores to cast bronze. These naturally occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity. Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in [[western Asia]] before 3000 BC.

After the Bronze Age, the history of metallurgy was marked by armies seeking better weaponry. Countries in [[Eurasia]] prospered when they made the superior alloys, which, in turn, made better armor and better weapons.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} This often determined the outcomes of battles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Significant progress in metallurgy and alchemy was made in [[History of India|ancient India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]] wrote in ''[[The Story of Civilization]] I: Our Oriental Heritage'':

{{quote|"Something has been said about the chemical excellence of [[cast iron]] in ancient India, and about the high industrial development of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] times, when India was looked to, even by [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]], as the most skilled of the nations in such chemical [[industry|industries]] as [[dye]]ing, [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], [[soap]]-making, glass and [[cement]]... By the sixth century the Hindus were far ahead of Europe in industrial chemistry; they were masters of [[calcination]]s, [[distillation]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], [[steaming]], [[Fixation (alchemy)|fixation]], the production of light without heat, the mixing of [[Anesthesia|anesthetic]] and [[Sleep|soporific]] powders, and the preparation of metallic [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, [[Chemical compound|compounds]] and [[alloy]]s.  The tempering of steel was brought in ancient India to a perfection unknown in Europe till our own times; [[King Porus]] is said to have selected, as a specially valuable gift from [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], not gold or silver, but thirty pounds of steel.  The Moslems took much of this Hindu chemical science and industry to the Near East and Europe; the secret of manufacturing [[Damascus steel|"Damascus" blades]], for example, was taken by the Arabs from the [[Persian people|Persians]], and by the Persians from India."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron Age===
{{Main|Iron Age}}
The extraction of [[iron]] from its ore into a workable metal is much more difficult than copper or tin. While iron is not better suited for tools than bronze (until [[steel]] was discovered), iron ore is much more abundant and common than either copper or tin. So iron was much more often available locally without have to trade for it.

Iron working appears to have been invented by the [[Hittites]] in about 1200&amp;nbsp;BC, beginning the [[Iron Age]]. The secret of extracting and working iron was a key factor in the success of the [[Philistines]].&lt;ref name=keller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. W. Anderson (1975) ''The Living World of the Old Testament'',  p. 154, {{ISBN|0-582-48598-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the Iron Age refers to the advent of [[ferrous metallurgy]]. Historical developments in ferrous metallurgy can be found in a wide variety of past cultures and civilizations. This includes the ancient and medieval kingdoms and empires of the Middle East and Near East, [[ancient Iran]], [[ancient Egypt]], ancient [[Nubia]], and [[Anatolia]] (Turkey), [[Nok culture|Ancient Nok]], [[Carthage]], the [[Greeks]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]]s of ancient Europe, medieval Europe, ancient and medieval China, ancient and medieval India, ancient and medieval Japan, amongst others. Many applications, practices, and devices associated or involved in metallurgy were established in ancient China, such as the innovation of the [[blast furnace]], [[cast iron]], [[hydraulic]]-powered [[trip hammer]]s, and double acting piston [[bellows]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

===Classical antiquity and atomism===
{{main|Atomism}}

[[File:Democritus2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Democritus]], Greek philosopher of atomistic school.]]
Philosophical attempts to rationalize why different substances have different properties (color, density, smell), exist in different states (gaseous, liquid, and solid), and react in a different manner when exposed to environments, for example to water or fire or temperature changes, led ancient philosophers to postulate the first theories on nature and chemistry. The history of such philosophical theories that relate to chemistry can probably be traced back to every single ancient civilization. The common aspect in all these theories was the attempt to identify a small number of primary [[classical element]] that make up all the various substances in nature. Substances like air, water, and soil/earth, energy forms, such as fire and light, and more abstract concepts such as ideas, aether, and heaven, were common in ancient civilizations even in absence of any cross-fertilization; for example in Greek, Indian, Mayan, and ancient Chinese philosophies all considered [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] as primary elements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

====Ancient world====
Around 420 BC, [[Empedocles]] stated that all matter is made up of [[Classical element|four elemental substances]]—earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of [[atomism]] can be traced back to [[ancient Greece]] and [[History of India|ancient India]].&lt;ref name = "Will"&gt;
[[Will Durant]] (1935), ''Our Oriental Heritage'':
     &lt;br&gt;{{quote|"Two systems of [[Hindu]] thought propound [[physics|physical]] theories suggestively similar to those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], founder of the [[Vaisheshika]] philosophy, held that the world was composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements. The [[Jainism|Jains]] more nearly approximated to [[Democritus]] by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations. Kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance; [[Udayana]] taught that all heat comes from the sun; and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vachaspati]], like [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye."}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible atoms around 380 BC. [[Leucippus]] also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] philosopher [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]] in his [[Vaisheshika]] [[sutra]]s around the same time period.&lt;ref name = Will/&gt; In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of [[gas]]es. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of [[empiricism|empirical]] data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. [[Aristotle]] opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to [[Polybus (physician)|Polybus]] argues that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, [[Epicurus]] postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life.

With the goal of explaining [[Epicureanism|Epicurean philosophy]] to a Roman audience, the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; in 50 BC. In the work, Lucretius presents the principles of [[atomism]]; the nature of the [[mind]] and [[soul]]; explanations of [[Sense|sensation]] and thought; the development of the world and its phenomena; and explains a variety of [[Celestial sphere|celestial]] and [[Earth|terrestrial]] phenomena.

Much of the early development of purification methods is described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]]. He made attempts to explain those methods, as well as making acute observations of the state of many minerals.

The three metallic principles: sulphur to flammability or combustion, mercury to volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] to solidity. became the ''tria prima'' of the Swiss alchemist [[Paracelsus]]. He reasoned that Aristotle's four-element theory appeared in bodies as three principles. Paracelsus saw these principles as fundamental and justified them by recourse to the description of how wood burns in fire. Mercury included the cohesive principle, so that when it left in smoke the wood fell apart. Smoke described the volatility (the mercurial principle), the heat-giving flames described flammability (sulphur), and the remnant ash described solidity (salt).&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, 2000.

===The philosopher's stone===
{{Main|Alchemy}}
[[File:William Fettes Douglas - The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|"The Alchemist", by Sir William Douglas, 1855]]

Alchemy is defined by the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] quest for the [[philosopher's stone]], the study of which is steeped in symbolic mysticism, and differs greatly from modern science.  Alchemists toiled to make transformations on an [[esoteric]] (spiritual) and/or [[exoteric]] (practical) level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E.J.|last=Holmyard|title=Alchemy|year=1957|location=New York|publisher=Dover, 1990|pages=15, 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the [[protoscience|protoscientific]], exoteric aspects of alchemy that contributed heavily to the evolution of chemistry in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]], the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and then in Europe.  Alchemy and chemistry share an interest in the composition and properties of matter, and prior to the eighteenth century were not separated into distinct disciplines. The term ''chymistry'' has been used to describe the blend of alchemy and chemistry that existed before this time.&lt;ref&gt;William Royall Newman. ''Atoms and Alchemy: Chymistry and the experimental origins of the scientific revolution.'' University of Chicago Press, 2006. p.xi&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Western alchemists, who lived in the first centuries of the common era, invented chemical apparatus.  The ''bain-marie'', or water bath is named for [[Mary the Jewess]]. Her work also gives the first descriptions of the tribikos and kerotakis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E.J.|last=Holmyard|title=Alchemy|year=1957|location=New York|publisher=Dover, 1990|pages=48, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cleopatra the Alchemist]] described furnaces and has been credited with the invention of the [[alembic]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton J. Linden. ''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'' Cambridge University Press. 2003. p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the experimental framework established by [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] influenced alchemists as the discipline migrated through the [[Islamic world]], then to Europe in the twelfth century.

During the Renaissance, exoteric alchemy remained popular in the form of [[Paracelsian]] [[iatrochemistry]], while spiritual alchemy flourished, realigned to its [[Platonism|Platonic]], Hermetic, and [[Gnostic]] roots. Consequently, the symbolic quest for the philosopher's stone was not superseded by scientific advances, and was still the domain of respected scientists and doctors until the early eighteenth century. Early modern alchemists who are renowned for their scientific contributions include [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Isaac Newton]].

===Problems encountered with alchemy===
There were several problems with alchemy, as seen from today's standpoint. There was no systematic naming scheme for new compounds, and the language was esoteric and vague to the point that the terminologies meant different things to different people. In fact, according to ''The Fontana History of Chemistry'' (Brock, 1992):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The language of alchemy soon developed an arcane and secretive technical vocabulary designed to conceal information from the uninitiated. To a large degree, this language is incomprehensible to us today, though it is apparent that readers of [[Geoffery Chaucer]]'s [[The Canon's Yeoman's Prologue and Tale|Canon's Yeoman's Tale]] or audiences of [[Ben Jonson]]'s [[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]] were able to construe it sufficiently to laugh at it.&lt;ref&gt;

  |isbn=978-0-00-686173-7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chaucer's tale exposed the more fraudulent side of alchemy, especially the manufacture of counterfeit gold from cheap substances. Less than a century earlier, [[Dante Alighieri]] also demonstrated an awareness of this fraudulence, causing him to consign all alchemists to the [[Divine Comedy|Inferno]] in his writings. Soon after, in 1317, the [[Avignon]] [[Pope John XXII]] ordered all alchemists to leave France for making counterfeit money. A law was passed in England in 1403 which made the "multiplication of metals" punishable by death. Despite these and other apparently extreme measures, alchemy did not die. Royalty and privileged classes still sought to discover the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also no agreed-upon scientific method for making experiments reproducible. Indeed, many alchemists included in their methods irrelevant information such as the timing of the tides or the phases of the moon. The esoteric nature and codified vocabulary of alchemy appeared to be more useful in concealing the fact that they could not be sure of very much at all. As early as the 14th century, cracks seemed to grow in the facade of alchemy; and people became sceptical.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Clearly, there needed to be a scientific method where experiments can be repeated by other people, and results needed to be reported in a clear language that laid out both what is known and unknown.

===Alchemy in the Islamic world===
[[File:Jabir ibn Hayyan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber), a [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Persian-Arab alchemist]] whose experimental research laid the foundations of chemistry.]]
{{Main|Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam}}

In the [[Islamic World]], the [[Muslim]]s were translating the works of the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] into Arabic and were experimenting with scientific ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://realscience.breckschool.org/upper/fruen/files/Enrichmentarticles/files/History.html The History of Ancient Chemistry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304162204/http://www.realscience.breckschool.org/upper/fruen/files/Enrichmentarticles/files/History.html |date=2015-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the modern [[scientific method]] was slow and arduous, but an early scientific method for chemistry began emerging among early Muslim chemists, beginning with the 9th-century chemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (known as "Geber" in Europe), who is sometimes regarded as "the father of chemistry".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Zygmunt S.|last1=Derewenda|year=2007|title=On wine, chirality and crystallography|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A|volume=64|pages=246–258 [247]|doi=10.1107/S0108767307054293|pmid=18156689|last2=Derewenda|first2=ZS|issue=Pt 1|bibcode = 2008AcCrA..64..246D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

For practitioners in Europe, alchemy became an intellectual pursuit after early Arabic alchemy became available through [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translation]], and over time, they improved. [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541), for example, rejected the 4-elemental theory and with only a vague understanding of his chemicals and medicines, formed a hybrid of alchemy and science in what was to be called [[iatrochemistry]].  Paracelsus was not perfect in making his experiments truly scientific. For example, as an extension of his theory that new compounds could be made by combining mercury with sulfur, he once made what he thought was "oil of sulfur". This was actually [[dimethyl ether]], which had neither mercury nor sulfur.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Practical attempts to improve the refining of ores and their extraction to smelt metals was an important source of information for early chemists in the 16th century, among them [[Georg Agricola]] (1494–1555), who published his great work ''[[De re metallica]]'' in 1556. His work describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores, metal extraction and metallurgy of the time. His approach removed the mysticism associated with the subject, creating the practical base upon which others could build. The work describes the many kinds of furnace used to smelt ore, and stimulated interest in minerals and their composition. It is no coincidence that he gives numerous references to the earlier author, Pliny the Elder and his ''Naturalis Historia''. Agricola has been described as the "father of metallurgy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Alfred von Zittel]] (1901) ''History of Geology and Palaeontology'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1605, [[Sir Francis Bacon]] published ''The Proficience and Advancement of Learning'', which contains a description of what would later be known as the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Asarnow | first = Herman | title = Sir Francis Bacon: Empiricism | work = An Image-Oriented Introduction to Backgrounds for English Renaissance Literature | publisher = University of Portland | date = 2005-08-08 | url = http://faculty.up.edu/asarnow/eliz4.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070201210445/http://faculty.up.edu/asarnow/eliz4.htm | archivedate = 2007-02-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1605, [[Michal Sedziwój]] publishes the alchemical treatise ''A New Light of Alchemy'' which proposed the existence of the "food of life" within air, much later recognized as oxygen. In 1615 [[Jean Beguin]] published the ''[[Tyrocinium Chymicum]]'', an early chemistry textbook, and in it draws the first-ever [[chemical equation]].&lt;ref&gt;Crosland, M.P. (1959). "The use of diagrams as chemical 'equations' in the lectures of [[William Cullen]] and [[Joseph Black]]." ''Annals of Science'', Vol 15, No. 2, June&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637 [[René Descartes]] publishes ''[[Discours de la méthode]]'', which contains an outline of the scientific method.

The Dutch chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]'s work ''Ortus medicinae'' was published posthumously in 1648; the book is cited by some as a major transitional work between alchemy and chemistry, and as an important influence on [[Robert Boyle]]. The book contains the results of numerous experiments and establishes an early version of the [[law of conservation of mass]]. Working during the time just after [[Paracelsus]] and [[iatrochemistry]], Jan Baptist van Helmont suggested that there are insubstantial substances other than air and coined a name for them - "[[gas]]", from the Greek word ''chaos''. In addition to introducing the word "gas" into the vocabulary of scientists, van Helmont conducted several experiments involving gases. Jan Baptist van Helmont is also remembered today largely for his ideas on [[spontaneous generation]] and his 5-year [[Jan Baptist van Helmont#Career as chemistry pioneer|tree experiment]], as well as being considered the founder of [[pneumatic chemistry]].

===Robert Boyle===
[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Robert Boyle]], one of the co-founders of modern chemistry through his use of proper experimentation, which further separated chemistry from alchemy]]
[[File:Sceptical chymist 1661 Boyle Title page AQ18 (3).jpg|thumb|right|Title page from ''The sceptical chymist'', 1661, [[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] ]]
Anglo-Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691) is considered to have refined the modern scientific method for alchemy and to have separated chemistry further from alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://understandingscience.ucc.ie/pages/sci_robertboyle.htm Robert Boyle]&lt;/ref&gt; Although his research clearly has its roots in the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] tradition, Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern [[chemistry]], and one of the pioneers of modern experimental [[scientific method]]. Although Boyle was not the original discoverer, he is best known for [[Boyle's law]], which he presented in 1662:&lt;ref name=acottLaw&gt;{{cite journal |author=Acott, Chris |title=The diving "Law-ers": A brief resume of their lives. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5990 |accessdate=17 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the law describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute [[pressure]] and [[volume]] of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a [[closed system]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Ira. N (1978). "Physical Chemistry" University of Brooklyn: [[McGraw-Hill]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levine_1"&gt;Levine, Ira. N. (1978), p12 gives the original definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle is also credited for his landmark publication ''[[The Sceptical Chymist]]'' in 1661, which is seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry. In the work, Boyle presents his hypothesis that every phenomenon was the result of collisions of particles in motion. Boyle appealed to chemists to experiment and asserted that experiments denied the limiting of chemical elements to only the classic four: earth, fire, air, and water. He also pleaded that chemistry should cease to be subservient to [[medicine]] or to alchemy, and rise to the status of a science. Importantly, he advocated a rigorous approach to scientific experiment: he believed all theories must be proved experimentally before being regarded as true. The work contains some of the earliest modern ideas of [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and [[chemical reaction]], and marks the beginning of the history of modern chemistry.

Boyle also tried to purify chemicals to obtain reproducible reactions. He was a vocal proponent of the mechanical philosophy proposed by [[René Descartes]] to explain and quantify the physical properties and interactions of material substances. Boyle was an atomist, but favoured the word ''corpuscle'' over ''atoms''. He commented that the finest division of matter where the properties are retained is at the level of corpuscles. He also performed numerous investigations with an [[air pump]], and noted that the [[Mercury barometer|mercury]] fell as air was pumped out. He also observed that pumping the air out of a container would extinguish a flame and kill small animals placed inside. Boyle helped to lay the foundations for the [[Chemical Revolution]] with his [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical]] corpuscular philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ursula Klein|title= Styles of Experimentation and Alchemical Matter Theory in the Scientific Revolution|journal=Metascience|issn=1467-9981|volume=16|issue=2|date=July 2007|doi=10.1007/s11016-007-9095-8|pages=247–256 [247]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle repeated the tree experiment of van Helmont, and was the first to use [[pH indicator|indicators]] which changed colors with acidity.

===Development and dismantling of phlogiston===
[[File:Priestley.jpg|thumb|185px|right|[[Joseph Priestley]], co-discoverer of the element oxygen, which he called "dephlogisticated air"]]
In 1702, German chemist [[Georg Stahl]] coined the name "[[phlogiston]]" for the substance believed to be released in the process of burning. Around 1735, Swedish chemist [[Georg Brandt]] analyzed a dark blue pigment found in copper ore. Brandt demonstrated that the pigment contained a new element, later named [[cobalt]]. In 1751, a Swedish chemist and pupil of Stahl's named [[Axel Fredrik Cronstedt]], identified an impurity in copper ore as a separate metallic element, which he named [[nickel]]. Cronstedt is one of the founders of modern [[mineralogy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbe/0487.html Nordisk familjebok – Cronstedt]: "''den moderna mineralogiens och geognosiens grundläggare''" = "''the modern mineralogy's and geognosie's founder''"&lt;/ref&gt; Cronstedt also discovered the mineral [[scheelite]] in 1751, which he named tungsten, meaning "heavy stone" in Swedish.

In 1754, Scottish chemist [[Joseph Black]] isolated [[carbon dioxide]], which he called "fixed air".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cooper | first = Alan | title = Joseph Black | work = History of Glasgow University Chemistry Department | publisher = University of Glasgow Department of Chemistry | year = 1999 | url = http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/dept/black.htm | accessdate = 2006-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060410074412/http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/dept/black.htm |archivedate = 2006-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757, [[Louis Claude Cadet de Gassicourt]], while investigating arsenic compounds, creates [[Cadet's fuming liquid]], later discovered to be [[cacodyl oxide]], considered to be the first synthetic [[organometallic]] compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Cadet's Fuming Arsenical Liquid and the Cacodyl Compounds of Bunsen | first = Dietmar  | last = Seyferth | journal = Organometallics | year = 2001 | volume = 20 | issue =8 | pages = 1488&amp;ndash;1498 | doi = 10.1021/om0101947 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/orgnd7/2001/20/i08/abs/om0101947.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1758, Joseph Black formulated the concept of [[latent heat]] to explain the [[thermochemistry]] of [[phase changes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Partington | first = J.R. | title = A Short History of Chemistry | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc | year = 1989 | isbn = 978-0-486-65977-0 | authorlink = J. R. Partington}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766, English chemist [[Henry Cavendish]] isolated [[hydrogen]], which he called "inflammable air". Cavendish discovered hydrogen as a colorless, odourless gas that burns and can form an explosive mixture with air, and published a paper on the production of water by burning inflammable air (that is, hydrogen) in dephlogisticated air (now known to be oxygen), the latter a constituent of atmospheric air ([[phlogiston theory]]).

In 1773, Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] discovered [[oxygen]], which he called "fire air", but did not immediately publish his achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 53–60; Schofield (2004), 112–13. The difficulty in precisely defining the time and place of the "discovery" of oxygen, within the context of the developing [[chemical revolution]], is one of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s central illustrations of the gradual nature of [[paradigm shift]]s in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774, English chemist [[Joseph Priestley]] independently isolated oxygen in its gaseous state, calling it "dephlogisticated air", and published his work before Scheele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Joseph Priestley | work = Chemical Achievers: The Human Face of Chemical Sciences | publisher = Chemical Heritage Foundation | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Carl Wilhelm Scheele | work = History of Gas Chemistry | publisher = Center for Microscale Gas Chemistry, Creighton University | date = 2005-09-11 | url = http://mattson.creighton.edu/History_Gas_Chemistry/Scheele.html | accessdate = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, Priestley's considerable scientific reputation rested on his invention of [[soda water]], his writings on [[electricity]], and his discovery of several "airs" (gases), the most famous being what Priestley dubbed "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen). However, Priestley's determination to defend phlogiston theory and to reject what would become the [[chemical revolution]] eventually left him isolated within the scientific community.

In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that a new [[acid]], [[tungstic acid]], could be made from Cronstedt's scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and [[Torbern Bergman]] suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid.&lt;ref name="SaundersN"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nigel|title=Tungsten and the Elements of Groups 3 to 7 (The Periodic Table)|publisher=Heinemann Library|location=Chicago|year=2004|isbn=978-1-4034-3518-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, [[Juan José Elhuyar|José]] and [[Fausto Elhuyar]] found an acid made from [[wolframite]] that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, in Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating the metal now known as [[tungsten]] by reduction of this acid with [[charcoal]], and they are credited with the discovery of the element.&lt;ref name="ITIAnews_0605"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itia.info/FileLib/Newsletter_2005_06.pdf |title=ITIA Newsletter |date=June 2005 |publisher=International Tungsten Industry Association |accessdate=2008-06-18 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721214335/http://www.itia.info/FileLib/Newsletter_2005_06.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITIAnews_1205"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itia.info/FileLib/Newsletter_2005_12.pdf |title=ITIA Newsletter |date=December 2005 |publisher=International Tungsten Industry Association |accessdate=2008-06-18 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721214335/http://www.itia.info/FileLib/Newsletter_2005_12.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volta and the Voltaic pile===
[[Image:VoltaBattery.JPG|thumb|199px|right|A voltaic pile on display in the ''[[Tempio Voltiano]]'' (the Volta Temple) near Volta's home in [[Como]].]]
Italian physicist [[Alessandro Volta]] constructed a device for accumulating a large charge by a series of inductions and groundings. He investigated the 1780s discovery "[[Galvanism|animal electricity]]" by [[Luigi Galvani]], and found that the [[electric current]] was generated from the contact of dissimilar metals, and that the frog leg was only acting as a detector. Volta demonstrated in 1794 that when two metals and brine-soaked cloth or cardboard are arranged in a circuit they produce an [[electric]] current.

In 1800, Volta stacked several pairs of alternating [[copper]] (or [[silver]]) and [[zinc]] discs ([[electrode]]s) separated by cloth or cardboard soaked in [[brine]] ([[electrolyte]]) to increase the electrolyte conductivity.&lt;ref name=Mottelay&gt;{{cite book |title=Bibliographical History of Electricity and Magnetism |first=Paul Fleury |last=Mottelay |page=247 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vzti90Q8i0C&amp;pg=PA247 |isbn=978-1-4437-2844-7 |publisher=Read Books |year=2008 |edition=Reprint of 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the top and bottom contacts were connected by a wire, an electric [[Current (electricity)|current]] flowed through the voltaic pile and the connecting wire. Thus, Volta is credited with constructing the first [[Battery (electricity)|electrical battery]] to produce [[electricity]]. Volta's method of stacking round plates of copper and zinc separated by disks of cardboard moistened with salt solution was termed a [[voltaic pile]].

Thus, Volta is considered to be the founder of the discipline of [[electrochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Inventor Alessandro Volta Biography | work = The Great Idea Finder | publisher = The Great Idea Finder | year = 2005 | url = http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/volta.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Galvanic cell]] (or voltaic cell) is an [[electrochemical cell]] that derives electrical energy from spontaneous [[redox]] reaction taking place within the cell. It generally consists of two different metals connected by a [[salt bridge]], or individual half-cells separated by a porous membrane.

===Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier ===
[[File:David - Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and His Wife.jpg|thumb|right|''Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and his wife'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]]]]
{{Main|Antoine Lavoisier|Chemical Revolution}}

Although the archives of chemical research draw upon work from ancient [[Babylonia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and especially the Arabs and [[Persian people|Persians]] after Islam, modern chemistry flourished from the time of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier]], a French chemist who is celebrated as the "[[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|father of modern chemistry]]". Lavoisier demonstrated with careful measurements that transmutation of water to earth was not possible, but that the sediment observed from boiling water came from the container. He burnt phosphorus and sulfur in air, and proved that the products weighed more than the original. Nevertheless, the weight gained was lost from the air. Thus, in 1789, he established the Law of [[conservation of mass|Conservation of Mass]], which is also called "Lavoisier's Law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Lavoisier.html Lavoisier, Antoine (1743-1794) -- from Eric Weisstein's World of Scientific Biography], ScienceWorld&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|150px|left|thumb|The world's first ice-calorimeter, used in the winter of 1782-83, by Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace, to determine the heat involved in various [[chemical change]]s; calculations which were based on Joseph Black's prior discovery of [[latent heat]].  These experiments mark the foundation of [[thermochemistry]].]] 
Repeating the experiments of Priestley, he demonstrated that air is composed of two parts, one of which combines with metals to form calxes. In ''Considérations Générales sur la Nature des Acides'' (1778), he demonstrated that the "air" responsible for combustion was also the source of acidity. The next year, he named this portion oxygen (Greek for acid-former), and the other azote (Greek for no life). Lavoisier thus has a claim to the discovery of oxygen along with Priestley and Scheele. He also discovered that the "inflammable air" discovered by Cavendish - which he termed [[hydrogen]] (Greek for water-former) - combined with oxygen to produce a dew, as Priestley had reported, which appeared to be water. In ''Reflexions sur le Phlogistique'' (1783), Lavoisier showed the [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion to be inconsistent. [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] independently established a tradition of chemistry in Russia in the 18th century. Lomonosov also rejected the phlogiston theory, and anticipated the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases. Lomonosov regarded heat as a form of motion, and stated the idea of conservation of matter.

Lavoisier worked with [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] and others to devise a system of [[chemical nomenclature]] which serves as the basis of the modern system of naming chemical compounds. In his ''Methods of Chemical Nomenclature'' (1787), Lavoisier invented the system of naming and classification still largely in use today, including names such as [[sulfuric acid]], [[sulfate]]s, and [[sulfite]]s. In 1785, Berthollet was the first to introduce the use of chlorine gas as a commercial bleach. In the same year he first determined the elemental composition of the gas [[ammonia]]. Berthollet first produced a modern bleaching liquid in 1789 by passing chlorine gas through a solution of [[sodium carbonate]] - the result was a weak solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]]. Another strong chlorine oxidant and bleach which he investigated and was the first to produce, [[potassium chlorate]] (KClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is known as Berthollet's Salt. Berthollet is also known for his scientific contributions to theory of [[chemical equilibrium|chemical]] equilibria via the mechanism of [[Reversible reaction|reverse chemical reactions]].

[[File:Lavoisier - Traité élémentaire de chimie, 1789 - 3895821 F.tif|thumb|''Traité élémentaire de chimie'']]
Lavoisier's  ''[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]'' (Elementary Treatise of Chemistry, 1789) was the first modern chemical textbook, and presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the Law of Conservation of Mass, and denied the existence of phlogiston. In addition, it contained a list of elements, or substances that could not be broken down further, which included oxygen, [[nitrogen]], hydrogen, [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]], and [[sulfur]]. His list, however, also included light, and [[Caloric theory|caloric]], which he believed to be material substances. In the work, Lavoisier underscored the observational basis of his chemistry, stating "I have tried...to arrive at the truth by linking up facts; to suppress as much as possible the use of reasoning, which is often an unreliable instrument which deceives us, in order to follow as much as possible the torch of observation and of experiment." Nevertheless, he believed that the real existence of atoms was philosophically impossible. Lavoisier demonstrated that organisms disassemble and reconstitute atmospheric air in the same manner as a burning body.

With [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], Lavoisier used a [[calorimeter]] to estimate the heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced. They found the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion. Lavoisier believed in the radical theory, believing that radicals, which function as a single group in a chemical reaction, would combine with oxygen in reactions. He believed all acids contained oxygen. He also discovered that [[diamond]] is a crystalline form of carbon.

While many of Lavoisier's partners were influential for the advancement of chemistry as a scientific discipline, his wife Marie-Anne Lavoisier was arguably the most influential of them all. Upon their marriage, Mme. Lavoisier began to study chemistry, English, and drawing in order to help her husband in his work either by translating papers into English, a language which Lavoisier did not know, or by keeping records and drawing the various apparatuses that Lavoisier used in his labs.&lt;ref name="humantouchofchemistry.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.humantouchofchemistry.com/marieanne-lavoisier.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417152425/http://www.humantouchofchemistry.com/marieanne-lavoisier.htm |archive-date=2015-04-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through her ability to read and translate articles from Britain for her husband, Lavoisier had access knowledge from many of the chemical advances happening outside of his lab.&lt;ref name="humantouchofchemistry.com"/&gt; Furthermore, Mme. Lavoisier kept records of Lavoisier's work and ensured that his works were published.&lt;ref name="humantouchofchemistry.com"/&gt; The first sign of Marie-Anne's true potential as a chemist in Lavoisier's lab came when she was translating  a book by the scientist Richard Kirwan. While translating, she stumbled upon and corrected multiple errors. When she presented her translation, along with her notes to Lavoisier &lt;ref name="humantouchofchemistry.com"/&gt;  Her edits and contributions led to Lavoisier's refutation of the theory of phlogiston.

Lavoisier made many fundamental contributions to the science of chemistry. Following Lavoisier's work, chemistry acquired a strict quantitative nature, allowing reliable predictions to be made. The [[chemical revolution|revolution in chemistry]] which he brought about was a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature. Lavoisier was beheaded during the [[French Revolution]].

==19th century==
In 1802, French American chemist and industrialist [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]], who learned manufacture of gunpowder and explosives under Antoine Lavoisier, founded a gunpowder manufacturer in Delaware known as [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]]. The [[French Revolution]] forced his family to move to the United States where du Pont started a gunpowder mill on the [[Brandywine River]] in Delaware. Wanting to make the best powder possible, du Pont was vigilant about the quality of the materials he used. For 32 years, du Pont served as president of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, which eventually grew into one of the largest and most successful companies in America.

Throughout the 19th century, chemistry was divided between those who followed the atomic theory of [[John Dalton]] and those who did not, such as [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] and [[Ernst Mach]].&lt;ref name="pullman"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Although such proponents of the atomic theory as [[Amedeo Avogadro]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] made great advances in explaining the behavior of [[gas]]es, this dispute was not finally settled until [[Jean Perrin]]'s experimental investigation of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s atomic explanation of [[Brownian motion]] in the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="pullman"/&gt;

Well before the dispute had been settled, many had already applied the concept of atomism to chemistry.  A major example was the [[ion]] theory of [[Svante Arrhenius]] which anticipated ideas about atomic substructure that did not fully develop until the 20th century. [[Michael Faraday]] was another early worker, whose major contribution to chemistry was [[history of electrochemistry|electrochemistry]], in which (among other things) a certain quantity of electricity during [[electrolysis]] or [[Underpotential deposition|electrodeposition]] of metals was shown to be associated with certain quantities of chemical elements, and fixed quantities of the elements therefore with each other, in specific ratios.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} These findings, like those of Dalton's combining ratios, were early clues to the atomic nature of matter.

===John Dalton===
[[File:John Dalton by Charles Turner.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[John Dalton]] is remembered for his work on partial pressures in gases, color blindness, and atomic theory]]
{{Main|John Dalton|Atomic theory}}
In 1803, English meteorologist and chemist [[John Dalton]] proposed [[Dalton's law]], which describes the relationship between the components in a mixture of gases and the relative pressure each contributes to that of the overall mixture.&lt;ref name=dalton&gt;{{cite web | title = John Dalton | work = Chemical Achievers: The Human Face of Chemical Sciences | publisher = Chemical Heritage Foundation | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovered in 1801, this concept is also known as Dalton's law of partial pressures.

Dalton also proposed a modern [[atomic theory]] in 1803 which stated that all matter was composed of small indivisible particles termed atoms, atoms of a given element possess unique characteristics and weight, and three types of atoms exist: simple (elements), compound (simple molecules), and complex (complex molecules). In 1808, Dalton first published ''New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808-1827), in which he outlined the first modern scientific description of the atomic theory. This work identified chemical elements as a specific type of atom, therefore rejecting [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theory of chemical affinities.

Instead, Dalton inferred proportions of elements in compounds by taking ratios of the weights of reactants, setting the atomic weight of hydrogen to be identically one. Following [[Jeremias Benjamin Richter]] (known for introducing the term ''[[stoichiometry]]''), he proposed that chemical elements combine in integral ratios. This is known as the [[law of multiple proportions]] or Dalton's law, and Dalton included a clear description of the law in his ''New System of Chemical Philosophy''. The law of multiple proportions is one of the basic laws of stoichiometry used to establish the atomic theory. Despite the importance of the work as the first view of atoms as physically real entities and introduction of a system of chemical symbols, ''New System of Chemical Philosophy'' devoted almost as much space to the caloric theory as to atomism.

French chemist [[Joseph Proust]] proposed the [[law of definite proportions]], which states that elements always combine in small, whole number ratios to form compounds, based on several experiments conducted between 1797 and 1804&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Proust, Joseph Louis (1754-1826) | work = 100 Distinguished Chemists | publisher = European Association for Chemical and Molecular Science | year = 2005 | url = http://www.euchems.org/Distinguished/19thCentury/proustlouis.asp | accessdate = 2007-02-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515224050/http://www.euchems.org/Distinguished/19thCentury/proustlouis.asp | archivedate = 2008-05-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the law of multiple proportions, the law of definite proportions forms the basis of stoichiometry. The law of definite proportions and constant composition do not prove that atoms exist, but they are difficult to explain without assuming that chemical compounds are formed when atoms combine in constant proportions.

===Jöns Jacob Berzelius===
[[File:Jöns Jacob Berzelius from Familj-Journalen1873.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]], the chemist who worked out the modern technique of [[chemical formula]] notation and is considered one of the fathers of modern chemistry]]
{{Main|Jöns Jacob Berzelius}}

A Swedish chemist and disciple of Dalton, [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] embarked on a systematic program to try to make accurate and precise quantitative measurements and insure the purity of chemicals. Along with Lavoisier, Boyle, and Dalton, Berzelius is known as the father of modern chemistry. In 1828 he compiled a table of relative atomic weights, where [[oxygen]] was set to 100, and which included all of the elements known at the time. This work provided evidence in favor of Dalton's atomic theory: that inorganic chemical compounds are composed of atoms combined in [[Whole number rule|whole number amounts]]. He determined the exact elementary constituents of large numbers of compounds. The results strongly confirmed Proust's Law of Definite Proportions. In his weights, he used oxygen as a standard, setting its weight equal to exactly 100. He also measured the weights of 43 elements. In discovering that atomic weights are not integer multiples of the weight of hydrogen, Berzelius also disproved [[Prout's hypothesis]] that elements are built up from atoms of hydrogen.
 
Motivated by his extensive atomic weight determinations and in a desire to aid his experiments, he introduced the classical system of chemical symbols and notation with his 1808 publishing of ''Lärbok i Kemien'', in which elements are abbreviated by one or two letters to make a distinct abbreviation from their Latin name. This system of chemical notation—in which the elements were given simple written labels, such as O for oxygen, or Fe for iron, with proportions noted by numbers—is the same basic system used today. The only difference is that instead of the subscript number used today (e.g., H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), Berzelius used a superscript (H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;O). Berzelius is credited with identifying the chemical elements [[silicon]], [[selenium]], [[thorium]], and [[cerium]]. Students working in Berzelius's laboratory also discovered [[lithium]] and [[vanadium]].

Berzelius developed the radical theory of chemical combination, which holds that reactions occur as stable groups of atoms called [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] are exchanged between molecules. He believed that salts are compounds of an [[acid]] and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]], and discovered that the anions in acids would be attracted to a positive electrode (the [[anode]]), whereas the cations in a base would be attracted to a negative electrode (the [[cathode]]). Berzelius did not believe in the [[Vitalism]] Theory, but instead in a regulative force which produced organization of tissues in an organism. Berzelius is also credited with originating the chemical terms "[[catalysis]]", "[[polymer]]", "[[isomer]]", and "[[allotrope]]", although his original definitions differ dramatically from modern usage. For example, he coined the term "polymer" in 1833 to describe organic compounds which shared identical empirical formulas but which differed in overall molecular weight, the larger of the compounds being described as "polymers" of the smallest. By this long superseded, pre-structural definition, [[glucose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) was viewed as a polymer of [[formaldehyde]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

{{Main|Humphry Davy}}
English chemist [[Humphry Davy]] was a pioneer in the field of [[electrolysis]], using Alessandro Volta's voltaic pile to split up common compounds and thus isolate a series of new elements. He went on to electrolyse molten salts and discovered several new metals, especially [[sodium]] and [[potassium]], highly reactive elements known as the [[alkali metal]]s. Potassium, the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis, was discovered in 1807 by Davy, who derived it from [[potassium hydroxide|caustic potash]] (KOH). Before the 19th century, no distinction was made between potassium and sodium. Sodium was first isolated by Davy in the same year by passing an electric current through molten [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH). When Davy heard that Berzelius and Pontin prepared calcium amalgam by electrolyzing lime in mercury, he tried it himself. Davy was successful, and discovered [[calcium]] in 1808 by electrolyzing a mixture of [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[mercuric oxide]].&lt;ref name=Enghag2004&gt;{{cite book|author=Enghag, P.|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of the elements|publisher=Wiley-VCH Weinheim|isbn=978-3-527-30666-4|chapter=11.

Davy also experimented with gases by inhaling them. This experimental procedure nearly proved fatal on several occasions, but led to the discovery of the unusual effects of [[nitrous oxide]], which came to be known as laughing gas. [[Chlorine]] was discovered in 1774 by Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], who called it ''"dephlogisticated marine acid"'' (see [[phlogiston theory]]) and mistakenly thought it contained [[oxygen]]. Scheele observed several properties of chlorine gas, such as its bleaching effect on litmus, its deadly effect on insects, its yellow-green colour, and the similarity of its smell to that of [[aqua regia]]. However, Scheele was unable to publish his findings at the time. In 1810, chlorine was given its current name by Humphry Davy (derived from the Greek word for green), who insisted that chlorine was in fact an [[Chemical element|element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Sir Humphry Davy |title = On a Combination of Oxymuriatic Gas and Oxygene Gas|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume = 101|pages = 155–162|year = 1811|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1811.0008|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Davy-Chlorine-1811.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also showed that [[oxygen]] could not be obtained from the substance known as [[Chlorine#History|oxymuriatic acid]] (HCl solution). This discovery overturned [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] definition of acids as compounds of oxygen. Davy was a popular lecturer and able experimenter.

[[File:Joseph louis gay-lussac.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], who stated that the ratio between the volumes of the reactant gases and the products can be expressed in simple whole numbers.]]
{{Main|Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac|Gay-Lussac's law}}

French chemist [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] shared the interest of Lavoisier and others in the quantitative study of the properties of gases. From his first major program of research in 1801–1802, he concluded that equal volumes of all gases expand equally with the same increase in temperature: this conclusion is usually called "[[Charles's law]]", as Gay-Lussac gave credit to [[Jacques Charles]], who had arrived at nearly the same conclusion in the 1780s but had not published it.&lt;ref name="GL02"&gt;{{citation | author = Gay-Lussac, J.

[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/gaygas.html English translation (extract).]&lt;br&gt;
On page 157, Gay-Lussac mentions the unpublished findings of Charles: "''Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois prévenir que quoique j'eusse reconnu un grand nombre de fois que les gaz oxigène, azote, hydrogène et acide carbonique, et l'air atmosphérique se dilatent également depuis 0° jusqu'a 80°, le cit. Charles avait remarqué depuis 15 ans la même propriété dans ces gaz ; mais n'avant jamais publié ses résultats, c'est par le plus grand hasard que je les ai connus''." (Before going further, I should inform [you] that although I had recognized many times that the gases oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid [i.e., carbon dioxide], and atmospheric air also expand from 0° to 80°, citizen Charles had noticed 15 years ago the same property in these gases; but having never published his results, it is by the merest chance that I knew of them.)&lt;/ref&gt; The law was independently discovered by British natural philosopher John Dalton by 1801, although Dalton's description was less thorough than Gay-Lussac's.&lt;ref&gt;J. Dalton (1802) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3qdJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA595#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Essay IV.

Not only did he gather magnetic measurements at various altitudes, but he also took pressure, temperature, and humidity measurements and samples of air, which he later analyzed chemically.

In 1808 Gay-Lussac announced what was probably his single greatest achievement: from his own and others' experiments he deduced that gases at constant temperature and pressure combine in simple numerical proportions by volume, and the resulting product or products—if gases—also bear a simple proportion by volume to the volumes of the reactants.  In other words, gases under equal conditions of temperature and pressure react with one another in volume ratios of small whole numbers. This conclusion subsequently became known as "[[Gay-Lussac's law]]" or the "[[Gay-Lussac's law#Law of combining volumes|Law of Combining Volumes]]". With his fellow professor at the [[École Polytechnique]], [[Louis Jacques Thénard]], Gay-Lussac also participated in early electrochemical research, investigating the elements discovered by its means. Among other achievements, they decomposed [[boric acid]] by using fused potassium, thus discovering the element [[boron]]. The two also took part in contemporary debates that modified Lavoisier's definition of acids and furthered his program of analyzing organic compounds for their oxygen and hydrogen content.

The element [[iodine]] was discovered by French chemist [[Bernard Courtois]] in 1811.&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Courtois, Bernard  |title=Découverte d'une substance nouvelle dans le Vareck |journal=[[Annales de chimie]] |volume=88 |page=304|year=1813 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGwri-w7sMAC&amp;pg=RA2-PA304}} In French, seaweed that had been washed onto the shore was called "varec", "varech", or "vareck", whence the English word "wrack".

In 1815, Humphry Davy invented the [[Davy lamp]], which allowed miners within [[coal mines]] to work safely in the presence of flammable gases. There had been many mining explosions caused by [[firedamp]] or [[methane]] often ignited by open flames of the lamps then used by miners. Davy conceived of using an iron gauze to enclose a lamp's flame, and so prevent the methane burning inside the lamp from passing out to the general atmosphere. Although the idea of the [[safety lamp]] had already been demonstrated by [[William Reid Clanny]] and by the then unknown (but later very famous) engineer [[George Stephenson]], Davy's use of wire gauze to prevent the spread of flame was used by many other inventors in their later designs. There was some discussion as to whether Davy had discovered the principles behind his lamp without the help of the work of [[Smithson Tennant]], but it was generally agreed that the work of both men had been independent. Davy refused to patent the lamp, and its invention led to him being awarded the [[Rumford medal]] in 1816.&lt;ref name="ODNB" &gt;David Knight, ‘Davy, Sir Humphry, baronet (1778–1829)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7314 accessed 6 April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avogadro Amedeo.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Amedeo Avogadro]], who postulated that, under controlled conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases contain an equal number of molecules. This is known as [[Avogadro's law]].]]
{{Main|Amedeo Avogadro|Avogadro's law}}

After Dalton published his atomic theory in 1808, certain of his central ideas were soon adopted by most chemists. However, uncertainty persisted for half a century about how atomic theory was to be configured and applied to concrete situations; chemists in different countries developed several different incompatible atomistic systems. A paper that suggested a way out of this difficult situation was published as early as 1811 by the Italian physicist [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (1776-1856), who hypothesized that equal volumes of gases at the same [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] contain equal numbers of molecules, from which it followed that relative [[molecular weight]]s of any two gases are the same as the ratio of the densities of the two gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure. Avogadro also reasoned that simple gases were not formed of solitary atoms but were instead compound molecules of two or more atoms. Thus Avogadro was able to overcome the difficulty that Dalton and others had encountered when Gay-Lussac reported that above 100&amp;nbsp;°C the volume of water vapor was twice the volume of the oxygen used to form it. According to Avogadro, the molecule of oxygen had split into two atoms in the course of forming water vapor.

Avogadro's hypothesis was neglected for half a century after it was first published. Many reasons for this neglect have been cited, including some theoretical problems, such as Jöns Jacob Berzelius's "dualism", which asserted that compounds are held together by the attraction of positive and negative electrical charges, making it inconceivable that a molecule composed of two electrically similar atoms—as in oxygen—could exist. An additional barrier to acceptance was the fact that many chemists were reluctant to adopt physical methods (such as vapour-density determinations) to solve their problems. By mid-century, however, some leading figures had begun to view the chaotic multiplicity of competing systems of atomic weights and molecular formulas as intolerable. Moreover, purely chemical evidence began to mount that suggested Avogadro's approach might be right after all. During the 1850s, younger chemists, such as [[Alexander William Williamson|Alexander Williamson]] in England, [[Charles Frédéric Gerhardt|Charles Gerhardt]] and [[Charles-Adolphe Wurtz]] in France, and [[August Kekulé]] in Germany, began to advocate reforming theoretical chemistry to make it consistent with Avogadrian theory.

===Wöhler and the vitalism debate===
[[File:Urea Structural Formula V2.svg|thumb|left|160px|Structural formula of [[urea]]]]
{{Main|Vitalism|Friedrich Wöhler|Wöhler synthesis}}
In 1825, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] and [[Justus von Liebig]] performed the first confirmed discovery and explanation of [[isomer]]s, earlier named by Berzelius. Working with [[cyanic acid]] and [[fulminic acid]], they correctly deduced that isomerism was caused by differing arrangements of atoms within a molecular structure. In 1827, [[William Prout]] classified biomolecules into their modern groupings: [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s. After the nature of combustion was settled, a dispute about [[vitalism]] and the essential distinction between organic and inorganic substances began. The vitalism question was revolutionized in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler synthesized [[urea]], thereby establishing that organic compounds could be produced from inorganic starting materials and disproving the theory of vitalism.

This opened a new research field in chemistry, and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The most important among them are [[mauve]], [[magenta]], and other synthetic [[dye]]s, as well as the widely used drug [[aspirin]]. The discovery of the artificial synthesis of urea contributed greatly to the theory of [[isomerism]], as the empirical chemical formulas for urea and [[ammonium cyanate]] are identical (see [[Wöhler synthesis]]). In 1832, Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig discovered and explained [[functional group]]s and [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]] in relation to organic chemistry, as well as first synthesizing [[benzaldehyde]]. Liebig, a German chemist, made major contributions to [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[biochemistry|biological chemistry]], and worked on the organization of [[organic chemistry]]. Liebig is considered the "father of the [[fertilizer]] industry" for his discovery of [[nitrogen]] as an essential plant [[nutrient]], and his formulation of the [[Law of the Minimum]] which described the effect of individual nutrients on crops.

===Mid-1800s===
In 1840, [[Germain Hess]] proposed [[Hess's law]], an early statement of the [[law of conservation of energy]], which establishes that [[energy]] changes in a chemical process depend only on the states of the starting and product materials and not on the specific pathway taken between the two states. In 1847, [[Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe|Hermann Kolbe]] obtained [[acetic acid]] from completely inorganic sources, further disproving vitalism. In 1848, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] (commonly known as Lord Kelvin) established the concept of [[absolute zero]], the temperature at which all molecular motion ceases. In 1849, [[Louis Pasteur]] discovered that the [[racemic]] form of [[tartaric acid]] is a mixture of the levorotatory and dextrotatory forms, thus clarifying the nature of [[optical rotation]] and advancing the field of [[stereochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Chirality | publisher = Stheno Corporation | year = 2006 | url = http://www.sthenocorp.com/history.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070307222010/http://www.sthenocorp.com/history.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852, [[August Beer]] proposed [[Beer's law]], which explains the relationship between the composition of a mixture and the amount of light it will absorb.

{{Main|Stanislao Cannizzaro|Karlsruhe Congress}}
Avogadro's hypothesis began to gain broad appeal among chemists only after his compatriot and fellow scientist [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]] demonstrated its value in 1858, two years after Avogadro's death. Cannizzaro's chemical interests had originally centered on natural products and on reactions of [[aromatic compound]]s; in 1853 he discovered that when [[benzaldehyde]] is treated with concentrated base, both [[benzoic acid]] and [[benzyl alcohol]] are produced—a phenomenon known today as the [[Cannizzaro reaction]]. In his 1858 pamphlet, Cannizzaro showed that a complete return to the ideas of Avogadro could be used to construct a consistent and robust theoretical structure that fit nearly all of the available empirical evidence. For instance, he pointed to evidence that suggested that not all elementary gases consist of two atoms per molecule—some were [[monatomic]], most were [[diatomic]], and a few were even more complex.

Another point of contention had been the formulas for compounds of the [[alkali metal]]s (such as [[sodium]]) and the [[alkaline earth metal]]s (such as [[calcium]]), which, in view of their striking chemical analogies, most chemists had wanted to assign to the same formula type. Cannizzaro argued that placing these metals in different categories had the beneficial result of eliminating certain anomalies when using their physical properties to deduce atomic weights. Unfortunately, Cannizzaro's pamphlet was published initially only in Italian and had little immediate impact. The real breakthrough came with an [[Karlsruhe Congress|international chemical congress]] held in the German town of [[Karlsruhe]] in September 1860, at which most of the leading European chemists were present. The Karlsruhe Congress had been arranged by Kekulé, Wurtz, and a few others who shared Cannizzaro's sense of the direction chemistry should go. Speaking in French (as everyone there did), Cannizzaro's eloquence and logic made an indelible impression on the assembled body. Moreover, his friend Angelo Pavesi distributed Cannizzaro's pamphlet to attendees at the end of the meeting; more than one chemist later wrote of the decisive impression the reading of this document provided. For instance, [[Julius Lothar Meyer|Lothar Meyer]] later wrote that on reading Cannizzaro's paper, "The scales seemed to fall from my eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = F. J. | title = A History of Chemistry | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1931 | pages = 182&amp;ndash;1184 | isbn = 978-0-07-148855-6 }} (2nd edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Cannizzaro thus played a crucial role in winning the battle for reform. The system advocated by him, and soon thereafter adopted by most leading chemists, is substantially identical to what is still used today.

===Perkin, Crookes, and Nobel===
In 1856, Sir [[William Henry Perkin]], age 18, given a challenge by his professor, [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]], sought to synthesize [[quinine total synthesis|quinine]], the anti-[[malaria]] drug, from [[coal tar]]. In one attempt, Perkin [[oxidation|oxidized]] aniline using [[potassium dichromate]], whose [[toluidine]] impurities reacted with the aniline and yielded a black solid—suggesting a "failed" organic synthesis. Cleaning the flask with alcohol, Perkin noticed purple portions of the solution: a byproduct of the attempt was the first synthetic dye, known as [[mauveine]] or Perkin's mauve. Perkin's discovery is the foundation of the dye synthesis industry, one of the earliest successful chemical industries.

German chemist [[August Kekulé|August Kekulé von Stradonitz]]'s most important single contribution was his structural theory of organic composition, outlined in two articles published in 1857 and 1858 and treated in great detail in the pages of his extraordinarily popular ''Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie'' ("Textbook of Organic Chemistry"), the first installment of which appeared in 1859 and gradually extended to four volumes. Kekulé argued that tetravalent [[carbon]] atoms - that is, carbon forming exactly four [[chemical bond]]s - could link together to form what he called a "carbon chain" or a "carbon skeleton," to which other atoms with other valences (such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and chlorine) could join. He was convinced that it was possible for the chemist to specify this detailed molecular architecture for at least the simpler organic compounds known in his day. Kekulé was not the only chemist to make such claims in this era. The Scottish chemist [[Archibald Scott Couper]] published a substantially similar theory nearly simultaneously, and the Russian chemist [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] did much to clarify and expand structure theory. However, it was predominantly Kekulé's ideas that prevailed in the chemical community.

British chemist and physicist [[William Crookes]] is noted for his [[cathode ray]] studies, fundamental in the development of [[atomic physics]]. His researches on electrical discharges through a rarefied gas led him to observe the dark space around the cathode, now called the Crookes dark space. He demonstrated that cathode rays travel in straight lines and produce phosphorescence and heat when they strike certain materials. A pioneer of vacuum tubes, Crookes invented the [[Crookes tube]] - an early experimental discharge tube, with partial vacuum with which he studied the behavior of cathode rays. With the introduction of [[Spectroscopy|spectrum analysis]] by [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] (1859-1860), Crookes applied the new technique to the study of [[selenium]] compounds. Bunsen and Kirchhoff had previously used spectroscopy as a means of chemical analysis to discover [[caesium]] and [[rubidium]]. In 1861, Crookes used this process to discover [[thallium]] in some seleniferous deposits. He continued work on that new element, isolated it, studied its properties, and in 1873 determined its atomic weight. During his studies of thallium, Crookes discovered the principle of the [[Crookes radiometer]], a device that converts light radiation into rotary motion. The principle of this radiometer has found numerous applications in the development of sensitive measuring instruments.

In 1862, [[Alexander Parkes]] exhibited [[Parkesine]], one of the earliest [[synthetic polymer]]s, at the International Exhibition in London. This discovery formed the foundation of the modern [[plastics industry]]. In 1864, [[Cato Maximilian Guldberg]] and [[Peter Waage]], building on Claude Louis Berthollet's ideas, proposed the [[law of mass action]]. In 1865, [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] determined the exact number of molecules in a [[mole (unit)|mole]], later named [[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]].

In 1865, August Kekulé, based partially on the work of Loschmidt and others, established the structure of benzene as a six carbon ring with alternating single and [[double bond]]s. Kekulé's novel proposal for benzene's cyclic structure was much contested but was never replaced by a superior theory. This theory provided the scientific basis for the dramatic expansion of the German chemical industry in the last third of the 19th century. Today, the large majority of known organic compounds are aromatic, and all of them contain at least one hexagonal benzene ring of the sort that Kekulé advocated. Kekulé is also famous for having clarified the nature of aromatic compounds, which are compounds based on the benzene molecule. In 1865, [[Adolf von Baeyer]] began work on [[indigo dye]], a milestone in modern industrial organic chemistry which revolutionized the dye industry.

Swedish chemist and inventor [[Alfred Nobel]] found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like ''kieselguhr'' ([[diatomaceous earth]]) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as [[dynamite]]. Nobel later on combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to [[collodion]], but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. [[Gelignite]], or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of [[potassium nitrate]] and various other substances.

===Mendeleev's periodic table===
{{Main|Dmitri Mendeleev|Periodic table|History of the periodic table}}
[[File:Mendeleev Photographische Gesellschaft 3.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Dmitri Mendeleev]], responsible for organizing the known chemical elements in a [[periodic table]].]]

An important breakthrough in making sense of the list of known chemical elements (as well as in understanding the internal structure of atoms) was [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]'s development of the first modern [[periodic table]], or the periodic classification of the elements. Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, felt that there was some type of order to the elements and he spent more than thirteen years of his life collecting data and assembling the concept, initially with the idea of resolving some of the disorder in the field for his students. Mendeleev found that, when all the known chemical elements were arranged in order of increasing atomic weight, the resulting table displayed a recurring pattern, or periodicity, of properties within groups of elements. Mendeleev's law allowed him to build up a systematic periodic table of all the 66 elements then known based on atomic mass, which he published in ''Principles of Chemistry'' in 1869. His first Periodic Table was compiled on the basis of arranging the elements in ascending order of atomic weight and grouping them by similarity of properties.

Mendeleev had such faith in the validity of the periodic law that he proposed changes to the generally accepted values for the atomic weight of a few elements and, in his version of the periodic table of 1871, predicted the locations within the table of unknown elements together with their properties. He even predicted the likely properties of three yet-to-be-discovered elements, which he called [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|ekaboron (Eb), ekaaluminium (Ea), and ekasilicon (Es)]], which proved to be good predictors of the properties of [[scandium]], [[gallium]], and [[germanium]], respectively, which each fill the spot in the periodic table assigned by Mendeleev.

At first the periodic system did not raise interest among chemists. However, with the discovery of the predicted elements, notably gallium in 1875, scandium in 1879, and germanium in 1886, it began to win wide acceptance. The subsequent proof of many of his predictions within his lifetime brought fame to Mendeleev as the founder of the periodic law. This organization surpassed earlier attempts at classification by [[Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois]], who published the telluric helix, an early, three-dimensional version of the periodic table of the elements in 1862, [[John Alexander Reina Newlands|John Newlands]], who proposed the law of octaves (a precursor to the periodic law) in 1864, and [[Julius Lothar Meyer|Lothar Meyer]], who developed an early version of the periodic table with 28 elements organized by [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] in 1864. Mendeleev's table did not include any of the [[noble gas]]es, however, which had not yet been discovered. Gradually the periodic law and table became the framework for a great part of chemical theory. By the time Mendeleev died in 1907, he enjoyed international recognition and had received distinctions and awards from many countries.

In 1873, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] and [[Joseph Achille Le Bel]], working independently, developed a model of [[chemical bonds|chemical bonding]] that explained the chirality experiments of Pasteur and provided a physical cause for [[optical activity]] in chiral compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff | work = Chemical Achievers: The Human Face of Chemical Sciences | publisher = Chemical Heritage Foundation | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; van 't Hoff's publication, called V''oorstel tot Uitbreiding der Tegenwoordige in de Scheikunde gebruikte Structuurformules in de Ruimte'', etc. (Proposal for the development of 3-dimensional chemical structural formulae) and consisting of twelve pages text and one page diagrams, gave the impetus to the development of [[stereochemistry]]. The concept of the "asymmetrical carbon atom", dealt with in this publication, supplied an explanation of the occurrence of numerous isomers, inexplicable by means of the then current structural formulae. At the same time he pointed out the existence of relationship between optical activity and the presence of an asymmetrical carbon atom.

===Josiah Willard Gibbs===
{{Main|Josiah Willard Gibbs|Statistical mechanics}}

[[File:Josiah Willard Gibbs -from MMS-.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]] formulated a concept of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] of a system in terms of energy and entropy. He also did extensive work on chemical equilibrium, and equilibria between phases.]]
American mathematical physicist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]'s work on the applications of [[thermodynamics]] was instrumental in transforming [[physical chemistry]] into a rigorous deductive science. During the years from 1876 to 1878, Gibbs worked on the principles of thermodynamics, applying them to the complex processes involved in chemical reactions. He discovered the concept of [[chemical potential]], or the "fuel" that makes chemical reactions work. In 1876 he published his most famous contribution, "[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]", a compilation of his work on thermodynamics and physical chemistry which laid out the concept of [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] to explain the physical basis of chemical equilibria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = O'Connor | first = J. J. | last2 = Robertson | first2 = E.F. | title = Josiah Willard Gibbs | work = MacTutor | publisher = School of Mathematics and Statistics University of St Andrews, Scotland | year = 1997 | url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Gibbs.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these essays were the beginnings of Gibbs’ theories of phases of matter: he considered each state of matter a phase, and each substance a component. Gibbs took all of the variables involved in a chemical reaction - temperature, pressure, energy, volume, and entropy - and included them in one simple equation known as [[Gibbs' phase rule]].

Within this paper was perhaps his most outstanding contribution, the introduction of the concept free energy, now universally called [[Gibbs free energy]] in his honor. The Gibbs free energy relates the tendency of a physical or chemical system to simultaneously lower its energy and increase its disorder, or [[entropy]], in a spontaneous natural process. Gibbs's approach allows a researcher to calculate the change in free energy in the process, such as in a chemical reaction, and how fast it will happen. Since virtually all chemical processes and many physical ones involve such changes, his work has significantly impacted both the theoretical and experiential aspects of these sciences. In 1877, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] established statistical derivations of many important physical and chemical concepts, including [[entropy]], and distributions of molecular velocities in the gas phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Weisstein | first = Eric W. | title = Boltzmann, Ludwig (1844–1906) | work = Eric Weisstein's World of Scientific Biography | publisher = Wolfram Research Products | year = 1996 | url = http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Boltzmann.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Boltzmann and [[James Clerk Maxwell]], Gibbs created a new branch of theoretical physics called [[statistical mechanics]] (a term that he coined), explaining the laws of thermodynamics as consequences of the statistical properties of large ensembles of particles. Gibbs also worked on the application of Maxwell's equations to problems in physical optics. Gibbs's derivation of the phenomenological laws of thermodynamics from the statistical properties of systems with many particles was presented in his highly influential textbook ''[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics]]'', published in 1902, a year before his death. In that work, Gibbs reviewed the relationship between the laws of thermodynamics and statistical theory of molecular motions. The overshooting of the original function by partial sums of [[Fourier series]] at points of discontinuity is known as the [[Gibbs phenomenon]].

===Late 19th century===
German engineer [[Carl von Linde]]'s invention of a continuous process of liquefying gases in large quantities formed a basis for the modern technology of [[refrigeration]] and provided both impetus and means for conducting scientific research at low temperatures and very high vacuums. He developed a [[dimethyl ether]] refrigerator (1874) and an ammonia refrigerator (1876). Though other refrigeration units had been developed earlier, Linde's were the first to be designed with the aim of precise calculations of efficiency. In 1895 he set up a large-scale plant for the production of liquid air. Six years later he developed a method for separating pure liquid oxygen from liquid air that resulted in widespread industrial conversion to processes utilizing oxygen (e.g., in [[steel]] manufacture).

In 1883, [[Svante Arrhenius]] developed an [[ion]] theory to explain conductivity in [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Svante August Arrhenius | work = Chemical Achievers: The Human Face of Chemical Sciences | publisher = Chemical Heritage Foundation | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] published ''Études de Dynamique chimique'' (Studies in Dynamic Chemistry), a seminal study on [[chemical kinetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jacobus H. van 't Hoff: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1901 | work = Nobel Lectures, Chemistry 1901–1921 | publisher = Elsevier Publishing Company | year = 1966 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/hoff-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, van 't Hoff entered for the first time the field of physical chemistry. Of great importance was his development of the general thermodynamic relationship between the heat of conversion and the displacement of the equilibrium as a result of temperature variation. At constant volume, the equilibrium in a system will tend to shift in such a direction as to oppose the temperature change which is imposed upon the system. Thus, lowering the temperature results in heat development while increasing the temperature results in heat absorption. This principle of mobile equilibrium was subsequently (1885) put in a general form by [[Henry Louis Le Chatelier]], who extended the principle to include compensation, by change of volume, for imposed pressure changes. The van 't Hoff-Le Chatelier principle, or simply [[Le Chatelier's principle]], explains the response of [[dynamic equilibrium|dynamic]] [[chemical equilibrium|chemical equilibria]] to external stresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Henry Louis Le Châtelier | work = World of Scientific Discovery | publisher = Thomson Gale | year = 2005 | url = http://www.bookrags.com/biography/henry-louis-le-chatelier-wsd/ | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] proposed the structure of [[purine]], a key structure in many biomolecules, which he later synthesized in 1898. He also began work on the chemistry of [[glucose]] and related [[sugar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Emil Fischer: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1902 | work = Nobel Lectures, Chemistry 1901–1921 | publisher = Elsevier Publishing Company | year = 1966 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, [[Eugene Goldstein]] named the [[cathode ray]], later discovered to be composed of electrons, and the [[canal ray]], later discovered to be positive hydrogen ions that had been stripped of their electrons in a [[cathode ray tube]]; these would later be named [[proton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Chemistry | work = Intensive General Chemistry| publisher = Columbia University Department of Chemistry Undergraduate Program | url = http://www.columbia.edu/itc/chemistry/chem-c2507/navbar/chemhist.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1885 also saw the publishing of J. H. van 't Hoff's ''L'Équilibre chimique dans les Systèmes gazeux ou dissous à I'État dilué'' (Chemical equilibria in gaseous systems or strongly diluted solutions), which dealt with this theory of dilute solutions. Here he demonstrated that the "[[osmotic pressure]]" in solutions which are sufficiently dilute is proportionate to the [[concentration]] and the absolute temperature so that this pressure can be represented by a formula which only deviates from the formula for gas pressure by a coefficient '''i'''. He also determined the value of ''i'' by various methods, for example by means of the [[vapor pressure]] and [[François-Marie Raoult]]'s results on the lowering of the freezing point. Thus van 't Hoff was able to prove that thermodynamic laws are not only valid for gases, but also for dilute solutions. His pressure laws, given general validity by the electrolytic dissociation theory of Arrhenius (1884-1887) - the first foreigner who came to work with him in Amsterdam (1888) - are considered the most comprehensive and important in the realm of natural sciences. In 1893, [[Alfred Werner]] discovered the octahedral structure of cobalt complexes, thus establishing the field of [[coordination chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Alfred Werner: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1913 | work = Nobel Lectures, Chemistry 1901–1921 | publisher = Elsevier Publishing Company | year = 1966 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1913/werner-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ramsay's discovery of the noble gases====
{{Main|William Ramsay|Noble gas}}
The most celebrated discoveries of Scottish chemist [[William Ramsay]] were made in inorganic chemistry. Ramsay was intrigued by the British physicist [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh]]'s 1892 discovery that the atomic weight of [[nitrogen]] found in chemical compounds was lower than that of nitrogen found in the atmosphere. He ascribed this discrepancy to a light gas included in chemical compounds of nitrogen, while Ramsay suspected a hitherto undiscovered heavy gas in atmospheric nitrogen. Using two different methods to remove all known gases from air, Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh were able to announce in 1894 that they had found a monatomic, chemically inert gaseous element that constituted nearly 1 percent of the atmosphere; they named it [[argon]].

[[File:J.J Thomson.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[J.J. Thomson]] ]]
The following year, Ramsay liberated another inert gas from a mineral called [[cleveite]]; this proved to be [[helium]], previously known only in the solar spectrum. In his book ''The Gases of the Atmosphere'' (1896), Ramsay showed that the positions of helium and argon in the periodic table of elements indicated that at least three more noble gases might exist. In 1898 Ramsay and the British chemist [[Morris Travers|Morris W. Travers]] isolated these elements—called [[neon]], [[krypton]], and [[xenon]]—from air brought to a liquid state at low temperature and high pressure. Sir William Ramsay worked with [[Frederick Soddy]] to demonstrate, in 1903, that alpha particles (helium nuclei) were continually produced during the radioactive decay of a sample of radium. Ramsay was awarded the 1904 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] in recognition of "services in the discovery of the inert gaseous elements in air, and his determination of their place in the periodic system."

In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]] discovered the [[electron]] using the [[cathode ray tube]]. In 1898, [[Wilhelm Wien]] demonstrated that canal rays (streams of positive ions) can be deflected by magnetic fields, and that the amount of deflection is proportional to the [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. This discovery would lead to the [[analytical chemistry|analytical]] technique known as [[mass spectrometry]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Alfred Werner: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1911 | work = Nobel Lectures, Physics 1901–1921 | publisher = Elsevier Publishing Company | year = 1967 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1911/wien-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marie and Pierre Curie====
[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|185px|right|[[Marie Curie]], a pioneer in the field of radioactivity and the first twice-honored Nobel laureate (and still the only one in two different sciences)]] 
{{Main|Marie Curie|Pierre Curie|Henri Becquerel}}

[[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]] was a Polish-born French physicist and chemist who is famous for her pioneering research on [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]]. She and her husband are considered to have laid the cornerstone of the nuclear age with their research on radioactivity. Marie was fascinated with the work of [[Henri Becquerel]], a French physicist who discovered in 1896 that uranium casts off rays similar to the [[X-ray]]s discovered by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]. Marie Curie began studying uranium in late 1897 and theorized, according to a 1904 article she wrote for Century magazine, "that the emission of rays by the compounds of uranium is a property of the metal itself—that it is an atomic property of the element uranium independent of its chemical or physical state." Curie took Becquerel's work a few steps further, conducting her own experiments on uranium rays. She discovered that the rays remained constant, no matter the condition or form of the uranium. The rays, she theorized, came from the element's atomic structure. This revolutionary idea created the field of [[atomic physics]] and the Curies coined the word ''radioactivity'' to describe the phenomena.

[[File:Pierre Curie by Dujardin c1906.jpg|thumb|185px|left|[[Pierre Curie]], known for his work on radioactivity as well as on [[ferromagnetism]], [[paramagnetism]], and [[diamagnetism]]; notably [[Curie's law]] and [[Curie temperature|Curie point]].]]

Pierre and Marie further explored radioactivity by working to separate the substances in uranium ores and then using the [[electrometer]] to make radiation measurements to ‘trace’ the minute amount of unknown radioactive element among the fractions that resulted. Working with the mineral [[Uraninite|pitchblende]], the pair discovered a new radioactive element in 1898. They named the element [[polonium]], after Marie's native country of Poland. On December 21, 1898, the Curies detected the presence of another radioactive material in the pitchblende. They presented this finding to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] on December 26, proposing that the new element be called [[radium]]. The Curies then went to work isolating polonium and radium from naturally occurring compounds to prove that they were new elements. In 1902, the Curies announced that they had produced a decigram of pure radium, demonstrating its existence as a unique chemical element. While it took three years for them to isolate radium, they were never able to isolate polonium. Along with the discovery of two new elements and finding techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, Curie oversaw the world's first studies into the treatment of [[neoplasm]]s, using radioactive isotopes. With Henri Becquerel and her husband, Pierre Curie, she was awarded the 1903 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]]. She was the sole winner of the 1911 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]]. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and she is the only woman to win the award in two different fields.

While working with Marie to extract pure substances from ores, an undertaking that really required industrial resources but that they achieved in relatively primitive conditions, Pierre himself concentrated on the physical study (including luminous and chemical effects) of the new radiations. Through the action of magnetic fields on the rays given out by the radium, he proved the existence of particles electrically positive, negative, and neutral; these [[Ernest Rutherford]] was afterward to call alpha, beta, and gamma rays. Pierre then studied these radiations by [[calorimetry]] and also observed the physiological effects of radium, thus opening the way to radium therapy. Among Pierre Curie's discoveries were that ferromagnetic substances exhibited a critical temperature transition, above which the substances lost their ferromagnetic behavior - this is known as the "[[Curie temperature|Curie point]]." He was elected to the Academy of Sciences (1905), having in 1903 jointly with Marie received the Royal Society's prestigious Davy Medal and jointly with her and Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics. He was run over by a carriage in the [[rue Dauphine]] in Paris in 1906 and died instantly. His complete works were published in 1908.

====Ernest Rutherford====
[[File:Ernest Rutherford 1908.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Ernest Rutherford]], discoverer of the nucleus and considered the father of nuclear physics]]
New Zealand-born chemist and physicist  [[Ernest Rutherford]] is considered to be "the father of [[nuclear physics]]." Rutherford is best known for devising the names [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]], and [[gamma ray|gamma]] to classify various forms of radioactive "rays" which were poorly understood at his time (alpha and beta rays are particle beams, while gamma rays are a form of high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]). Rutherford deflected alpha rays with both electric and magnetic fields in 1903. Working with [[Frederick Soddy]], Rutherford explained that [[radioactivity]] is due to the [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of elements, now known to involve [[nuclear reactions]].

[[File:Rutherford gold foil experiment results.svg|thumb|right|150px|Top: Predicted results based on the then-accepted plum pudding model of the atom. Bottom: Observed results. Rutherford disproved the plum pudding model and concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a small, central nucleus.]]
He also observed that the intensity of radioactivity of a radioactive element decreases over a unique and regular amount of time until a point of stability, and he named the halving time the "[[half-life]]." In 1901 and 1902 he worked with Frederick Soddy to prove that atoms of one radioactive element would spontaneously turn into another, by expelling a piece of the atom at high velocity. In 1906 at the University of Manchester, Rutherford oversaw an experiment conducted by his students [[Hans Geiger]] (known for the [[Geiger counter]]) and [[Ernest Marsden]]. In the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]], a beam of alpha particles, generated by the radioactive decay of [[radon]], was directed normally onto a sheet of very thin gold foil in an evacuated chamber. Under the prevailing [[plum pudding model]], the alpha particles should all have passed through the foil and hit the detector screen, or have been deflected by, at most, a few degrees.

However, the actual results surprised Rutherford. Although many of the alpha particles did pass through as expected, many others were deflected at small angles while others were reflected back to the alpha source. They observed that a very small percentage of particles were deflected through angles much larger than 90 degrees. The gold foil experiment showed large deflections for a small fraction of incident particles. Rutherford realized that, because some of the alpha particles were deflected or reflected, the atom had a concentrated centre of positive charge and of relatively large mass - Rutherford later termed this positive center the "[[atomic nucleus]]". The alpha particles had either hit the positive centre directly or passed by it close enough to be affected by its positive charge. Since many other particles passed through the gold foil, the positive centre would have to be a relatively small size compared to the rest of the atom - meaning that the atom is mostly open space. From his results, Rutherford developed a model of the atom that was similar to the solar system, known as [[Rutherford model]]. Like planets, electrons orbited a central, sun-like nucleus. For his work with radiation and the atomic nucleus, Rutherford received the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

==20th century==
[[File:1911 Solvay conference.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The first [[Solvay Conference]] was held in [[Brussels]] in 1911 and was considered a turning point in the world of [[physics]] and chemistry.]]

In 1903, [[Mikhail Tsvet]] invented [[chromatography]], an important analytic technique. In 1904, [[Hantaro Nagaoka]] proposed an early nuclear model of the atom, where electrons orbit a dense massive nucleus. In 1905, [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] developed the [[Haber process]] for making [[ammonia]], a milestone in industrial chemistry with deep consequences in agriculture. The Haber process, or Haber-Bosch process, combined [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] to form ammonia in industrial quantities for production of fertilizer and munitions. The food production for half the world's current population depends on this method for producing fertilizer. Haber, along with [[Max Born]], proposed the [[Born–Haber cycle]] as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. Haber has also been described as the "father of [[chemical warfare]]" for his work developing and deploying chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I.

[[File:Millikan.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert A. Millikan]], who is best known for measuring the charge on the electron, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1923.]]
In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] explained [[Brownian motion]] in a way that definitively proved atomic theory. [[Leo Baekeland]] invented [[bakelite]], one of the first commercially successful plastics. In 1909, American physicist [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] - who had studied in Europe under [[Walther Nernst]] and [[Max Planck]] - measured the charge of individual electrons with unprecedented accuracy through the [[oil drop experiment]], in which he measured the electric charges on tiny falling water (and later oil) droplets. His study established that any particular droplet's electrical charge is a multiple of a definite, fundamental value — the electron's charge — and thus a confirmation that all electrons have the same charge and mass. Beginning in 1912, he spent several years investigating and finally proving Albert Einstein's proposed linear relationship between energy and frequency, and providing the first direct [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] support for [[Planck's constant]]. In 1923 Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics.

In 1909, [[S. P. L. Sørensen]] invented the [[pH]] concept and develops methods for measuring acidity. In 1911, [[Antonius Van den Broek]] proposed the idea that the elements on the periodic table are more properly organized by positive nuclear charge rather than atomic weight. In 1911, the first [[Solvay Conference]] was held in Brussels, bringing together most of the most prominent scientists of the day. In 1912, [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] proposed [[Bragg's law]] and established the field of [[X-ray crystallography]], an important tool for elucidating the crystal structure of substances. In 1912, [[Peter Debye]] develops the concept of molecular dipole to describe asymmetric charge distribution in some molecules.

===Niels Bohr===
[[File:Niels Bohr.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Niels Bohr]], the developer of the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, and a leading founder of [[quantum mechanics]]]]
{{Main|Niels Bohr|Bohr model}}
In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]], a Danish physicist, introduced the concepts of [[quantum mechanics]] to atomic structure by proposing what is now known as the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, where electrons exist only in strictly defined circular orbits around the nucleus similar to rungs on a ladder. The Bohr Model is a planetary model in which the negatively charged electrons orbit a small, positively charged nucleus similar to the planets orbiting the Sun (except that the orbits are not planar) - the gravitational force of the solar system is mathematically akin to the attractive Coulomb (electrical) force between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons.

In the Bohr model, however, electrons orbit the nucleus in orbits that have a set size and energy - the energy levels are said to be ''quantized'', which means that only certain orbits with certain radii are allowed; orbits in between simply don't exist. The energy of the orbit is related to its size - that is, the lowest energy is found in the smallest orbit. Bohr also postulated that electromagnetic radiation is absorbed or emitted when an electron moves from one orbit to another. Because only certain electron orbits are permitted, the emission of light accompanying a jump of an electron from an excited energy state to ground state produces a unique [[emission spectrum]] for each element.

Niels Bohr also worked on the principle of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], which states that an electron can be interpreted in two mutually exclusive and valid ways. Electrons can be interpreted as wave or particle models. His hypothesis was that an incoming particle would strike the nucleus and create an excited compound nucleus. This formed the basis of his [[Semi-empirical mass formula|liquid drop model]] and later provided a theory base for the explanation of [[nuclear fission]].

[[File:Moseley step ladder.jpg|thumb|left| [[Moseley's law|Moseley's Staircase]]]]
In 1913, [[Henry Moseley]], working from Van den Broek's earlier idea, introduces concept of atomic number to fix inadequacies of Mendeleev's periodic table, which had been based on atomic weight. The peak of Frederick Soddy's career in radiochemistry was in 1913 with his formulation of the concept of [[isotope]]s, which stated that certain elements exist in two or more forms which have different atomic weights but which are indistinguishable chemically. He is remembered for proving the existence of isotopes of certain radioactive elements, and is also credited, along with others, with the discovery of the element [[protactinium]] in 1917. In 1913, J. J. Thomson expanded on the work of Wien by showing that charged subatomic particles can be separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, a technique known as [[mass spectrometry]].

===Gilbert N. Lewis===
{{Main|Gilbert N. Lewis}}
American physical chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] laid the foundation of [[valence bond theory]]; he was instrumental in developing a bonding theory based on the number of electrons in the outermost "valence" shell of the atom. In 1902, while Lewis was trying to explain valence to his students, he depicted atoms as constructed of a concentric series of cubes with electrons at each corner. This "cubic atom" explained the eight groups in the periodic table and represented his idea that chemical bonds are formed by electron transference to give each atom a complete set of eight outer electrons (an "octet").

Lewis's theory of chemical bonding continued to evolve and, in 1916, he published his seminal article "The Atom of the Molecule", which suggested that a chemical bond is a pair of electrons shared by two atoms. Lewis's model equated the classical [[chemical bond]] with the sharing of a pair of electrons between the two bonded atoms. Lewis introduced the  "electron dot diagrams" in this paper to symbolize the electronic structures of atoms and molecules. Now known as [[Lewis structures]], they are discussed in virtually every introductory chemistry book.

Shortly after publication of his 1916 paper, Lewis became involved with military research. He did not return to the subject of chemical bonding until 1923, when he masterfully summarized his model in a short monograph entitled Valence and the Structure of Atoms and Molecules. His renewal of interest in this subject was largely stimulated by the activities of the American chemist and General Electric researcher [[Irving Langmuir]], who between 1919 and 1921 popularized and elaborated Lewis's model. Langmuir subsequently introduced the term ''[[covalent bond]]''. In 1921, [[Otto Stern]] and [[Walther Gerlach]] establish concept of quantum mechanical spin in subatomic particles.

For cases where no sharing was involved, Lewis in 1923 developed the electron pair theory of [[acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|base]]: Lewis redefined an acid as any atom or molecule with an incomplete octet that was thus capable of accepting electrons from another atom; bases were, of course, electron donors. His theory is known as the concept of [[Lewis acids and bases]]. In 1923, G. N. Lewis and [[Merle Randall]] published ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'', first modern treatise on chemical [[thermodynamics]].

The 1920s saw a rapid adoption and application of Lewis's model of the electron-pair bond in the fields of organic and coordination chemistry. In organic chemistry, this was primarily due to the efforts of the British chemists [[Arthur Lapworth]], [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]], [[Martin Lowry|Thomas Lowry]], and [[Christopher Ingold]]; while in coordination chemistry, Lewis's bonding model was promoted through the efforts of the American chemist [[Maurice Huggins]] and the British chemist [[Nevil Sidgwick]].

{{Main|Louis de Broglie|Wolfgang Pauli|Erwin Schrödinger|Werner Heisenberg}}
In 1924, French quantum physicist [[Louis de Broglie]] published his thesis, in which he introduced a revolutionary theory of electron waves based on [[wave–particle duality]] in his thesis. In his time, the wave and particle interpretations of light and [[matter]] were seen as being at odds with one another, but de Broglie suggested that these seemingly different characteristics were instead the same behavior observed from different perspectives — that particles can behave like waves, and waves (radiation) can behave like particles.  Broglie's proposal offered an explanation of the restriction motion of [[electron]]s within the atom. The first publications of Broglie's idea of "matter waves" had drawn little attention from other physicists, but a copy of his doctoral thesis chanced to reach Einstein, whose response was enthusiastic. Einstein stressed the importance of Broglie's work both explicitly and by building further on it.

In 1925, Austrian-born physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] developed the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which states that no two electrons around a single nucleus in an atom can occupy the same [[quantum state]] simultaneously, as described by four [[quantum numbers]]. Pauli made major contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory - he was awarded the 1945 Nobel Prize for Physics for his discovery of the Pauli exclusion principle - as well as solid-state physics, and he successfully hypothesized the existence of the [[neutrino]]. In addition to his original work, he wrote masterful syntheses of several areas of physical theory that are considered classics of scientific literature.

[[File:Schrodinger Equation.png|thumb|left|180px|The [[Schrödinger equation]]]]
In 1926 at the age of 39, Austrian theoretical physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]] produced the papers that gave the foundations of quantum wave mechanics. In those papers he described his partial differential equation that is the basic equation of quantum mechanics and bears the same relation to the mechanics of the atom as [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's equations of motion]] bear to planetary astronomy. Adopting a proposal made by Louis de Broglie in 1924 that particles of matter have a dual nature and in some situations act like waves, Schrödinger introduced a theory describing the behaviour of such a system by a wave equation that is now known as the [[Schrödinger equation]]. The solutions to Schrödinger's equation, unlike the solutions to Newton's equations, are wave functions that can only be related to the probable occurrence of physical events. The readily visualized sequence of events of the planetary orbits of Newton is, in quantum mechanics, replaced by the more abstract notion of [[probability]]. (This aspect of the quantum theory made Schrödinger and several other physicists profoundly unhappy, and he devoted much of his later life to formulating philosophical objections to the generally accepted interpretation of the theory that he had done so much to create.)

German theoretical physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]] was one of the key creators of quantum mechanics. In 1925, Heisenberg discovered a way to formulate quantum mechanics in terms of matrices. For that discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for 1932. In 1927 he published his [[uncertainty principle]], upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known. Heisenberg was able to demonstrate that if you were studying an electron in an atom you could say where it was (the electron's location) or where it was going (the electron's velocity), but it was impossible to express both at the same time. He also made important contributions to the theories of the [[hydrodynamics]] of [[turbulent flow]]s, the atomic nucleus, [[ferromagnetism]], [[cosmic rays]], and [[subatomic particle]]s, and he was instrumental in planning the first West German [[nuclear reactor]] at [[Karlsruhe]], together with a [[research reactor]] in Munich, in 1957. Considerable controversy surrounds his work on atomic research during World War II.

===Quantum chemistry===
{{Main|Quantum chemistry}}

Some view the birth of quantum chemistry in the discovery of the [[Schrödinger equation]] and its application to the [[hydrogen atom]] in 1926.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  However, the 1927 article of [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Heitler|W. Heitler]] and [[Fritz London|F. London]], ''Wechselwirkung neutraler Atome und Homöopolare Bindung nach der Quantenmechanik'', Z. Physik, 44, 455 (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; is often recognised as the first milestone in the history of quantum chemistry. This is the first application of [[quantum mechanics]] to the diatomic [[hydrogen]] molecule, and thus to the phenomenon of the [[chemical bond]]. In the following years much progress was accomplished by [[Edward Teller]], [[Robert S. Mulliken]], [[Max Born]], [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], [[Linus Pauling]], [[Erich Hückel]], [[Douglas Hartree]], [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock]], to cite a few.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Still, skepticism remained as to the general power of quantum mechanics applied to complex chemical systems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The situation around 1930 is described by [[Paul Dirac]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Dirac|P.A.M. Dirac]], ''Quantum Mechanics of Many-Electron Systems'', Proc. R. Soc. London, A 123, 714 (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It therefore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation.}}

Hence the quantum mechanical methods developed in the 1930s and 1940s are often referred to as theoretical [[molecular physics|molecular]] or [[atomic physics]] to underline the fact that they were more the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry and [[spectroscopy]] than answers to chemically relevant questions. In 1951, a milestone article in quantum chemistry is the seminal paper of [[Clemens C. J. Roothaan]] on [[Roothaan equations]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clemens C. J. Roothaan|C.C.J. Roothaan]], ''A Study of Two-Center Integrals Useful in Calculations on Molecular Structure'', J. Chem. Phys., 19, 1445 (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;  It opened the avenue to the solution of the [[self-consistent field]] equations for small molecules like [[hydrogen]] or [[nitrogen]].  Those computations were performed with the help of tables of integrals which were computed on the most advanced computers of the time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

In the 1940s many physicists turned from [[molecular physics|molecular]] or [[atomic physics]] to [[nuclear physics]] (like [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] or [[Edward Teller]]). [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] was an American nuclear chemist best known for his work on isolating and identifying [[transuranium element]]s (those heavier than [[uranium]]). He shared the 1951 Nobel Prize for Chemistry with [[Edwin McMillan|Edwin Mattison McMillan]] for their independent discoveries of transuranium elements. [[Seaborgium]] was named in his honour, making him the only person, along [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Yuri Oganessian]], for whom a chemical element was named during his lifetime.

===Molecular biology and biochemistry===
{{Main|History of molecular biology|History of biochemistry}}

By the mid 20th century, in principle, the integration of physics and chemistry was extensive, with chemical properties explained as the result of the [[electron]]ic structure of the [[atom]]; [[Linus Pauling]]'s book on ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond'' used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce [[bond angle]]s in ever-more complicated molecules.  However, though some principles deduced from quantum mechanics were able to predict qualitatively some chemical features for biologically relevant molecules, they were, till the end of the 20th century, more a collection of rules, observations, and recipes than rigorous [[ab initio]] quantitative methods.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  
[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|right|200px|Diagrammatic representation of some key structural features of DNA]]
This heuristic approach triumphed in 1953 when [[James D. Watson|James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] deduced the double helical structure of [[DNA]] by constructing models constrained by and informed by the knowledge of the chemistry of the constituent parts and the [[X-ray diffraction]] patterns obtained by [[Rosalind Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf Watson, J. and Crick, F., "Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids"] ''Nature, April 25, 1953, p 737–8 ''&lt;/ref&gt;  This discovery lead to an explosion of research into the [[biochemistry]] of life.

In the same year, the [[Miller–Urey experiment]] demonstrated that basic constituents of [[protein]], simple [[amino acid]]s, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules in a [[simulation]] of primordial [[Process (science)|processes]] on Earth.  Though many questions remain about the true nature of the origin of life, this was the first attempt by chemists to study hypothetical processes in the laboratory under controlled conditions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

In 1983 [[Kary Mullis]] devised a method for the in-vitro amplification of DNA, known as the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), which revolutionized the chemical processes used in the laboratory to manipulate it.  PCR could be used to synthesize specific pieces of DNA and made possible the [[DNA sequencing|sequencing of DNA]] of organisms, which culminated in the huge [[human genome project]].

An important piece in the double helix puzzle was solved by one of Pauling's students [[Matthew Meselson]] and [[Frank Stahl]], the result of their collaboration ([[Meselson–Stahl experiment]]) has been called as "the most beautiful experiment in biology".

They used a centrifugation technique that sorted molecules according to differences in weight. Because nitrogen atoms are a component of DNA, they were labelled and therefore tracked in replication in bacteria.

==Mathematics and chemistry==
Classically, before the 20th century, chemistry was defined as the science of the nature of matter and its transformations. It was therefore clearly distinct from physics which was not concerned with such dramatic transformation of matter.  Moreover, in contrast to physics, chemistry was not using much of mathematics.  Even some were particularly reluctant to use mathematics within chemistry.  For example, [[Auguste Comte]] wrote in 1830:
{{quote|Every attempt to employ mathematical methods in the study of chemical questions must be considered profoundly irrational and contrary to the spirit of chemistry.... if mathematical analysis should ever hold a prominent place in chemistry -- an aberration which is happily almost impossible -- it would occasion a rapid and widespread degeneration of that science.}}
However, in the second part of the 19th century, the situation changed and [[August Kekulé]] wrote in 1867:
{{quote|I rather expect that we shall someday find a mathematico-mechanical explanation for what we now call atoms which will render an account of their properties.}}

==Scope of chemistry==
As understanding of the nature of matter has evolved, so too has the self-understanding of the science of chemistry by its practitioners. This continuing historical process of evaluation includes the categories, terms, aims and scope of chemistry. Additionally, the development of the social institutions and networks which support chemical enquiry are highly significant factors that enable the production, dissemination and application of chemical knowledge. (See [[Philosophy of chemistry]])

===Chemical industry===
{{Main|Chemical industry}}

The later part of the nineteenth century saw a huge increase in the exploitation of [[petroleum]] extracted from the earth for the production of a host of chemicals and largely replaced the use of [[whale oil]], [[coal tar]] and [[naval stores]] used previously. Large-scale production and [[oil refinery|refinement of petroleum]] provided feedstocks for  [[liquid fuels]] such as [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[solvents]], [[lubricants]], [[asphalt]], [[waxes]], and for the production of many of the common materials of the modern world, such as synthetic [[fibers]], plastics, [[paints]], [[detergent]]s, [[pharmaceuticals]], [[adhesives]] and [[ammonia]] as [[fertilizer]] and for other uses.  Many of these required new [[catalysts]] and the utilization of [[chemical engineering]] for their cost-effective production.

In the mid-twentieth century, control of the electronic structure of [[semiconductor]] materials was made precise by the creation of large ingots of extremely pure single crystals of [[silicon]] and [[germanium]]. Accurate control of their chemical composition by doping with other elements made the production of the solid state [[transistor]] in 1951 and made possible the production of tiny [[integrated circuit]]s for use in electronic devices, especially [[computers]].

The '''history of nudity''' involves social attitudes to [[nudity]] in different cultures in history. It is not known when humans began wearing clothes, although there is some archaeological evidence to indicate that clothing may have become commonplace in human society around 72,000 years ago.{{sfn|Arney|2003}} Nudity (or near-complete nudity) has traditionally been the social norm for both men and women in some hunter-gatherer cultures in warm climates and it is still common among many indigenous peoples. [[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] believe that animal skins and vegetation were adapted into coverings as protection from cold, heat and rain, especially as humans migrated to new climates; alternatively, covering may have been invented first for other purposes, such as magic, decoration, cult, or prestige, and later found to be practical as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The [[ancient Egypt]]ians wore the minimum of clothing, and in a number of ancient Mediterranean cultures, the athletic and/or cultist nudity of men and boys was a natural concept. In [[ancient Rome]], nudity could be a public disgrace and might be offensive or distasteful even in traditional settings, though it could be seen at the public baths or in erotic art. In Japan, public nudity was quite normal and commonplace until the [[Meiji Restoration]]. In Europe, taboos against nudity began to grow during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and by the [[Victorian era]], public nakedness was considered obscene. In the early years of the 20th century, the modern [[naturist]] movement began to develop.

== Paleolithic history ==

Because animal skins and vegetable materials decompose readily there is no archeological evidence of when and how clothing developed. However, recent studies of human [[lice]] suggest that clothing may have become commonplace in human society around 72,000 years ago.{{sfn|Arney|2003}} If that is correct, it would mean that for around 128,000 years and the majority of anatomically modern human history, humans may not have worn clothes. Some anthropologists believe that ''[[Homo habilis]]'' and even ''[[Homo erectus]]'' may have used animal skins for protection placing the origins of clothing at perhaps a million years or more.{{sfn|Sneed}}

== Ancient Egypt ==
{{main|Ancient Egyptian fashion}}

Fashions in [[ancient Egypt]] did not change much over the millennia. The ancient Egyptians wore the minimum of clothing. Both men and women of the lower classes were commonly bare chested and barefoot, wearing a simple loincloth around their waist. Slaves typically wore nothing. Richer women commonly wore a ''kalasiris'', a dress of loose draped or translucent linen which came to just above or below the breasts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/1037/ |title=Fashion and Dress in Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Women entertainers performed naked. Children went without clothing until [[puberty]], at about age 12.{{sfn|Altenmüller|1998|pp=406–7}}

Though the minimum amount of clothing was the norm in ancient Egypt, the custom was viewed as humiliating by some other ancient cultures.  For example, the [[Hebrew Bible]] records: "So shall the ''king of the Assyrians lead away the prisoners'' of Egypt, and the captivity of Ethiopia, young and old, ''naked and barefoot, with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt''".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|20:4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar images occur on many bas-reliefs, also from other empires.

== Ancient Greece ==
[[File:Young_boxers_fresco,_Akrotiri,_Greece.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] youths [[boxing]] nude but for a [[girdle]] ([[fresco]] on the Greek island of [[Santorini]])]]

In some ancient Mediterranean cultures, even well past the hunter-gatherer stage, athletic and/or cultist nudity of men and boys – and rarely, of women and girls – was a natural concept. The [[Minoan civilization]] prized athleticism, with [[bull-leaping]] being a favourite event. Both men and women participated wearing only a loincloth, as toplessness for both sexes was the cultural norm; men wore loincloths, whilst women wore an open-fronted dress.&lt;ref&gt;Bernice R. Jones - Ariadne’s Threads: The Construction and Significance of Clothes in the Aegean Bronze Age.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/The-Ancient-World-Greece/Minoan-Dress.html|title=Minoan Dress|author=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of Fashion|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greece had a particular fascination for [[aesthetics]], which was also reflected in clothing or its absence. [[Sparta]] had rigorous codes of training (''[[agoge]]'') and physical exercise was conducted in the nude. Athletes competed naked in public sporting events. Spartan women, as well as men, would sometimes be naked in public processions and festivals. This practice was designed to encourage virtue in men while they were away at war and an appreciation of health in the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html|title=Lycurgus by Plutarch|author=|date=|website=The Internet Classics Archive|accessdate=16 August 2017|translator=John Dryden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and goddesses were normally portrayed clothed in sculpture of the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], with the exception of the nude [[Aphrodite]].

[[File:Kouros anavissos.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|left|A ''[[kouros]]'', an [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] depiction of the ideal male nude]]

In general, however, concepts of either shame or offense, or the social comfort of the individual, seem to have been deterrents of public nudity in the rest of Greece and the ancient world in the east and west, with exceptions in what is now South America, and in Africa and Australia. [[Polybius]] asserts that [[Celts]] typically fought naked, "The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life."&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, ''Histories'' II.28&lt;/ref&gt;

In antiquity even before the Classical era, e.g., on [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]], athletic exercise was an important part of daily life. The [[Greece|Greeks]] credited several mythological figures with athletic accomplishments, and male [[Greek gods|gods]] (especially [[Apollo]] and [[Heracles]], patrons of sport) were commonly depicted as athletes. While Greek sculpture often showed males completely nude, a new concept for females, ''Venus Pudica'' (or partially nude) appeared, for example, the Greek "[[Nike of Samothrace]]".{{cn|date=February 2014}}

[[Nudity in sport]] was very common, with almost all sports performed naked. As a tradition it was probably  first introduced in the [[city-state]] of [[Sparta]], during the late archaic period.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

[[File:Aphrodite Braschi Glyptothek Munich 258.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|Example of the [[Cnidian Aphrodite]] type]]

The civilization of [[ancient Greece]] (Hellas), during the Archaic period, had an athletic and cultic aesthetic of nudity which typically included adult and teenage males, but at times also boys, women and girls. The love for beauty had also included the human body, beyond the love for nature, philosophy, and the arts. The [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|"gymnasium"]] means 'a place to train naked'. Male athletes competed naked, but most city-states of the time allowed no female participants or even spectators at those events, [[Sparta]] being a notable exception.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

Nudity in religious ceremonies was also practiced in Greece. The statue of the [[Moscophoros]] (the 'calf-bearer'), a remnant of the archaic [[Acropolis of Athens]], depicts a young man carrying a calf on his shoulders, presumably taking the animal to the altar for sacrifice. The ''Moschophoros'' is ''not'' completely nude: a piece of very fine, almost transparent cloth is carefully draped over his shoulders, upper arms and front thighs, which nevertheless left his genitals purposely exposed. In this case the garment apparently fulfilled a purely ceremonial, priestly function in which modesty was not an issue.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

In Greek culture, depictions of erotic nudity were considered normal. The Greeks were conscious of the exceptional nature of their nudity, noting that "generally in countries which are subject to the barbarians, the custom is held to be dishonourable; lovers of youths share the evil repute in which philosophy and naked sports are held, because they are inimical to tyranny;"&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium;'' 182c&lt;/ref&gt; In both ancient Greece and [[ancient Rome]], public nakedness was also accepted in the context of [[public bathing]]. It was also common for a person to be punished by being partially or completely stripped and lashed in public; in some legal systems judicial [[physical punishment|corporal punishment]]s on the bare buttocks persisted up to or even beyond the feudal age, either only for minors or also for adults, even until today but rarely still in public. In [[Biblical]] accounts of the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] era, prisoners were often stripped naked, as a form of [[humiliation]].{{cn|date=February 2014}}

[[File:Discobulus.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.75|[[Myron]]'s 5th century [[Discobolos]], in the British Museum]]

The origins of nudity in ancient Greek sport are the subject of a legend about the athlete, [[Orsippus of Megara]].&lt;ref name="bustle2016" /&gt;{{sfn|Golden|2004|p=290}} There are various myths regarding these origins; in one Orsippus loses his loin cloth during the stadion-race of the 15th Olympic Games in 720 BC which gives him an advantage and he wins. Other athletes then emulate him and the fashion is born.

Nudity in sport spread to the whole of Greece, Greater Greece and even its furthest colonies, and the athletes from all its parts, coming together for the [[Olympic Games]] and the other [[Panhellenic Games]], competed naked in almost all disciplines, such as [[boxing]], [[amateur wrestling|wrestling]], [[pankration]] (a free-style mix of boxing and wrestling, serious physical harm was allowed) &amp;ndash; in such martial arts equal chances in terms of grip and body protection require a non-restrictive uniform (as presently common) or none. [[Stadion (ancient sports)|Stadion]] and various other foot races including relay race, and the [[pentathlon]] (made up of wrestling, stadion, [[long jump]], [[javelin throw]], and [[discus throw]]). However, even though [[chariot racing|chariot racers]] typically wore some clothing while competing, there are depictions of naked chariot racers as well.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

It is believed to be rooted in the religious notion that athletic excellence was an "esthetical" offering to the gods (nearly all games fitted in religious festivals), and indeed at many games it was the privilege of the winner to be represented naked as a votive statue offered in a temple, or even to be immortalized as model for a god's statue. Performing naked certainly was also welcome as a measure to prevent foul play, which was punished publicly on the spot by the judges (often religious dignitaries) with a sound lashing. The offender was naked when he was whipped.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

Evidence of Greek nudity in sport comes from the numerous surviving depictions of athletes (sculpture, mosaics and vase paintings). Famous athletes were honored by statues erected for their commemoration (see [[Milo of Croton]]). A few writers have insisted that the athletic nudity in [[Greek art]] is just an artistic convention, finding it unbelievable that anybody would have run naked. This view could be ascribed to late-Victorian prudishness applied anachronistically to ancient times. Other cultures in antiquity did not practice athletic nudity and condemned the Greek practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Their rejection of naked sports was in turn condemned by the Greeks as a token of tyranny and political repression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

Greek athletes, even though naked, seem to have made a point of avoiding exposure of their [[glans penis|glans]], for example by [[infibulation#Male|infibulation]], or wearing of a [[kynodesme]].{{cn|date=February 2014}}

While statues of males often showed complete nudity, female statues often were shown with the concept of ''Venus Pudica'' (partially clothed or modest). A prime example is the [[Nike of Samothrace]] female statue.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male nudity|Ancient Roman attitudes toward male nudity]] differed from those of the Greeks, whose ideal of masculine excellence was expressed by the nude male body in art and in such real-life venues as athletic contests. The [[toga]], by contrast, distinguished the body of the adult male [[Roman citizenship|citizen at Rome]].{{sfn|Habinek|1997|p=39}} The poet [[Ennius]] (c. 239–169&amp;nbsp;BC) declared that "exposing naked bodies among citizens is the beginning of public disgrace (''flagitium''),{{efn|Originally, ''flagitium'' meant a public shaming, and later more generally a disgrace}}" a sentiment echoed by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;''Flagiti principium est nudare inter civis corpora'': Ennius, as quoted by Cicero, ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'' 4.33.70&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Younger|2004|p=134}}{{sfn|Goldhill|2007|p=2}}{{sfn|Graf|2005|pp=195–197}}{{sfn|Williams|2009|pp=64, 292 note 12}}

Public nudity might be offensive or distasteful even in traditional settings; Cicero derides [[Mark Antony]] as undignified for appearing near-naked as a participant in the [[Lupercalia]] festival, even though it was ritually required.{{sfn|Heskel|2001|p=138}}{{sfn|Bonfante|1989}} Negative connotations of nudity included defeat in war, since captives were stripped and sold into slavery. Slaves for sale were often displayed naked to allow buyers to inspect them for defects, and to symbolize that they lacked the right to control their own bodies.{{sfn|Blanshard|2010|p=24}}{{sfn|Harper|2011|pp=293–294}} The disapproval of nudity was less a matter of trying to suppress inappropriate sexual desire than of dignifying and marking the citizen's body.{{sfn|Williams|2009|pp=69–70}} Thus the ''[[retiarius]]'', a type of [[gladiator]] who fought with face and flesh exposed, was [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|thought to be unmanly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]], ''Satires'' 2 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Carter|2008|pp=120–121}} The influence of Greek art, however, led to [[Heroic nudity|"heroic" nude portrayals]] of Roman men and gods, a practice that began in the 2nd century BC. When statues of Roman generals nude in the manner of [[Hellenistic religion#Ruler cults|Hellenistic kings]] first began to be displayed, they were shocking—not simply because they exposed the male figure, but because they evoked concepts of royalty and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Intermediate forms|divinity]] that were contrary to [[Roman Republic|Republican]] ideals of citizenship as embodied by the toga.{{sfn|Zanker|1990|p=5ff}} In art produced under [[Augustus Caesar]], the adoption of [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] and [[Neo-Attic|Neo-Attic style]] led to more complex signification of the male body shown nude, partially nude, or costumed in a [[muscle cuirass]].{{sfn|Zanker|1990|pp=239–240, 249–250}} Romans who competed in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] presumably followed the Greek custom of nudity, but athletic nudity at Rome has been dated variously, possibly as early as the introduction of Greek-style games in the 2nd century BC but perhaps not regularly until the time of [[Nero]] around 60&amp;nbsp;AD.{{sfn|Crowther|1980}}

At the same time, the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|phallus]] was depicted ubiquitously. The phallic [[amulet]] known as the ''[[fascinum]]'' (from which the English word "fascinate" ultimately derives) was supposed to have powers to ward off the [[evil eye]] and other malevolent supernatural forces. It appears frequently in the archaeological remains of [[Pompeii]] in the form of  ''[[tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|tintinnabula]]'' (wind chimes) and other objects such as lamps.{{sfn|Richlin|2002}} The phallus is also the defining characteristic of the imported Greek god [[Priapus]], whose statue was used as a "scarecrow" in gardens. A penis depicted as erect and very large was laughter-provoking, grotesque, or [[wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]].{{sfn|Clarke|2002|p=156}}{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=18}} Roman art regularly features nudity in mythological scenes, and sexually explicit art appeared on ordinary objects such as serving vessels, lamps, and mirrors, as well as among the art collections of wealthy homes.

 }}Respectable [[Women in Ancient Rome|Roman women]] were portrayed clothed. Partial nudity of goddesses in Roman Imperial art, however, can highlight [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Breasts|the breasts]] as dignified but pleasurable images of nurturing, abundance, and peacefulness.{{sfn|Cohen|2003|p=66}}{{sfn|Cameron|2010|p=725}}{{sfn|Bonfante|1989}} The completely nude female body as portrayed in sculpture was thought to embody a universal concept of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], whose counterpart [[Aphrodite]] is the goddess most often depicted as a nude in Greek art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''Protrepticus'' 4.50&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sharrock|2002|p=275}} By the 1st century AD, Roman art showed a broad interest in the female nude engaged in varied activities, including sex.

The erotic art found in Pompeii and [[Herculaneum]] may depict women, performing sex acts either naked or often wearing a ''strophium'' (strapless bra) that covers the breasts even when otherwise nude.{{sfn|Clarke|2002|p=160}} [[Latin literature]] describes prostitutes displaying themselves naked at the entrance to their brothel cubicles, or wearing see-through silk garments.{{sfn|Blanshard|2010|p=24}}{{sfn|Harper|2011|pp=293–294}}

The display of the female body made it vulnerable; [[Varro]] thought the Latin word for "sight, [[gaze]]", ''visus'', was etymologically related to ''vis'', "force, power". The connection between ''visus'' and ''vis'', he said, also implied the potential for violation, just as [[Actaeon]] gazing on the naked [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] violated the goddess.{{efn|Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 6.8, citing a fragment from the Latin tragedian [[Lucius Accius|Accius]] on Actaeon that plays with the verb ''video, videre, visum'', "see," and its presumed connection to ''vis'' ([[ablative]] ''vi'', "by force") and ''violare'', "to violate": "He who saw what should not be seen violated that with his eyes" ''(Cum illud oculis ''vi''olavit is, qui in''vi''dit in''vid''endum)''}}{{efn|Ancient etymology was not a matter of scientific [[linguistics]], but of associative interpretation based on similarity of sound and implications of theology and philosophy{{sfn|Fredrick|2002|pp=1-2}} }}{{sfn|Del Bello|2007|p=}}

One exception to public nudity was [[thermae|the baths]], though attitudes toward nude bathing also changed over time. In the 2nd century BC, [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] preferred not to bathe in the presence of his son, and [[Plutarch]] implies that for Romans of these earlier times it was considered shameful for mature men to expose their bodies to younger males.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Cato'' 20.5&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zanker|1990|p=6}}{{sfn|Williams|2009|pp=69–70}} Later, however, men and women might even bathe together.{{sfn|Fagan|2002|pp=26–27}} Some Hellenized or Romanized Jews resorted to [[Foreskin restoration#History|epispasm]], a surgical procedure to restore the foreskin "for the sake of decorum".{{efn|''Causa decoris'': [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]], ''De medicina'' 7.25.1A, {{sfn|Crowther|1980|p=122}} }}{{efn|noting that some had themselves circumcised again later.{{sfn|Schäfer|2003|p=151}} }}

[[Sumo]] wrestling, practiced by men in ceremonial dress of loincloth size that exposes the buttocks like a jock strap, in general is considered sacred under [[Shintō]]. Public, communal bathing of mixed sexes also has a long history in [[Japan]]. Public toplessness was generally considered acceptable as well until the post-WWII US occupation when General [[Douglas MacArthur]] passed edicts requiring women to cover their breasts and banning pornography that contained close-up shots of genitalia.

Public nudity was quite normal and commonplace in Japan until the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]]'s interpreter Rev. S. Well Williams wrote "Modesty, judging from what we see, might be said to be unknown, for the women make no attempt to hide the bosom, and every step shows the leg above the knee; while men generally go with the merest bit of rag, and that not always carefully put on. Naked men and women have both been seen in the streets, and uniformly resort to the same bath house, regardless of all decency. Lewd motions, pictures and talk seem to be the common expression of the viler acts and thoughts of the people, and this to such a degree as to disgust everybody."

After the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government began a campaign to institute a uniform national culture and suppress practices such as public nudity and urination that were unsightly, unhygienic, and disturbing to foreign visitors. Mixed gender bathing was banned. Enforcement of these rules was not consistent and most often occurred in Tokyo and other major cities with a high number of foreign visitors.

Despite the lack of taboos on public nudity, traditional Japanese art seldom depicted nude individuals except for paintings of bathhouses. When the first embassies opened in Western countries in the late 19th century, Japanese dignitaries were shocked and offended at the European predilection for nude statues and busts. However, Japanese students traveling to Europe to study became exposed to Western art and its frequent nudity. In 1894, Kuroda Seikia was the first Japanese artist to publicly exhibit a painting of a nude woman grooming herself. The work caused a public uproar, but gradually nudity became more accepted in Japanese art and by the 1910s, it was commonplace and acceptable as long as pubic hair was not shown. By the 1930s, pubes were accepted as long as they were not overly detailed or the main focus of the picture. However, pornographic art that featured graphic depictions of nudity and sexual acts already existed in Japan for centuries, called [[Shunga]].

In traditional Japanese culture, nudity was typically associated with the lower class of society, i.e. those who performed manual labor and frequently wore little when the weather permitted. The upper class, for comparison, were expected to be modest and fully clothed, with fine clothing in particular considered more erotic than nudity itself. After the Meiji Restoration, upper-class Japanese began adopting Western clothing, which included underwear, something not part of the traditional Japanese wardrobe except for loincloths worn by men.

Underwear was, however, not commonly worn in Japan until after WWII despite the government's attempts to impose Western standards. The disastrous [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|1923 earthquake]] in Tokyo was widely used as a pretext to enforce them, as government propaganda claimed that many women perished because they were afraid to jump or climb out of ruined or burning buildings due to their kimonos flying open and exposing their privates. In reality, it had more to do with lack of proper building standards and traditional Japanese homes being constructed with flammable paper and wood; moreover, there was no evidence that women were concerned about accidentally exposing themselves, especially since the majority of Japanese at this time still wore traditional outfits with no undergarments.

After WWII, when Japan was occupied by the Allied military, public nudity was more extensively suppressed and Western clothing, which included boxer shorts, briefs, brassieres, and panties, became normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/g/j/gjs4/textbooks/MJ/ch4_main.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313160433/http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/g/j/gjs4/textbooks/MJ/ch4_main.htm|title=Chapter Four: Making Japanese by Putting on Clothes|archive-date=13 Mar 2013|website=Penn State Personal Web Server}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures in warm climates, nudity (or near-complete nudity) has been, until the introduction of [[Western culture]] or [[Islam]], or still is, the social norm for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://activenaturists.net/how-it-used-to-be/ Nudity throughout history] at activenaturists.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Complete nudity among men and complete or near-complete nudity among women is still common for [[Mursi people|Mursi]], [[Surma people|Surma]], [[Nuba peoples|Nuba]], [[Karimojong]], [[Kirdi]], [[Dinka]] and sometimes [[Maasai people]] in Africa, as well as [[Matses]], [[Yanomami]], [[Suruwaha]], [[Xingu peoples|Xingu]], [[Matis]] and Galdu people in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/nudity-ok/|title=what if nudity were a norm?|author=|date=14 October 2011|website=Active Naturists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many indigenous peoples in Africa and South America train and perform sport competitions naked&lt;ref name="activenaturists.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/nudity-ok2/|title=what if nudity were a norm?

In some [[Africa]]n and [[Melanesia]]n cultures, men going completely naked except for a string tied about the waist are considered properly dressed for hunting and other traditional group activities. In a number of tribes in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] island of [[New Guinea]], men use hard gourdlike pods as ''[[Koteka|penis sheath]]s''. Yet a man without this "covering" could be considered to be in an embarrassing state of nakedness. Among the [[Chumash people]] of southern [[California]], men were usually naked, and women were often [[toplessness|topless]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of the [[Amazon Basin]] usually went nude or nearly nude; in many native tribes, the only clothing worn was some device worn by men to clamp the [[foreskin]] shut. However, other similar cultures have had different standards. For example, other native North Americans avoided total nudity, and the Native Americans of the mountains and west of [[South America]], such as the [[Quechuas]], kept quite covered. These taboos normally only applied to adults; Native American children often went naked until puberty if the weather permitted (a 10-year-old [[Pocahontas]] scandalized the Jamestown settlers by appearing at their camp in the nude).{{cn|date=February 2014}}

[[Ibn Battuta]] (1304–1369) judges the character of the people of [[Mali Empire|Mali]]:

{{quote|Among their bad qualities are the following. The women servants, slave-girls, and young girls go about in front of everyone naked, without a stitch of clothing on them. Women go into the sultan's presence naked and without coverings, and his daughters also go about naked.{{sfn|Chughtai}} }}

In 1498, at Trinity Island, [[Trinidad]], [[Christopher Columbus]] found the women entirely naked, whereas the men wore a light girdle called ''guayaco''. At the same epoch, on the Para Coast of [[Brazil]], the girls were distinguished from the married women by their absolute nudity. The same absence of costume was observed among the Chaymas of [[Cumaná]], [[Venezuela]], and Du Chaillu noticed the same among the Achiras in [[Gabon]].{{sfn|Dr. Jacobus X (pseud.)|1937|p=183}}

== Recent history ==
[[File:London WNBR 2011 3.jpg|thumb|right|A man nude in public at the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] in London, 2011]]
In Europe up until the 18th century, non-segregated bathing in rivers was the norm. In addition, toplessness was widely accepted among all social classes and women from queens to prostitutes commonly wore outfits designed to bare the breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |title=Historian Reveals Janet Jackson's 'Accidental' Exposing of Her Breast was the Height of Fashion in the 1600s|date=5 May 2004|publisher=University of Warwick |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040803155530/http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |archivedate = 3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], taboos against nudity began to grow and by the [[Victorian era]], [[public nudity|public nakedness]] was considered [[obscene]]. In addition to beaches being [[Sex segregation|segregated]] by gender, [[bathing machine]]s were also used to allow people who had changed into [[bathing suits]] to enter directly into the water. During the 1860s, nude swimming became a public offense in Great Britain. In the early 20th century, even exposed male chests were considered unacceptable. During this period, women's bathing suits had to cover at least the thighs and exposure of more than that could lead to arrests for public lewdness. Swimwear began to move away from this extreme degree of modesty in the 1930s after Hollywood star [[Johnny Weissmuller]] began going to beaches in just shorts, after which people quickly began copying him. After WWII, the bikini was first invented in France and despite the initial scandal surrounding it, was widespread and normal by the 1960s.

Sport in the modern sense of the word became popular only in the 19th century. Nudity in this context was most common in Germany and the Nordic countries.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

In 1924, in the [[Soviet Union]], an informal organization called the "Down with Shame" movement held mass nude marches in an effort to dispel earlier, "bourgeois" morality.{{sfn|Siegelbaum|1992|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,719155,00.html |title=Russia:  Down With Shame|work=Time Magazine|date=22 September 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the following decade, Stalin rose to power and quickly suppressed the radical ideas which had circulated in the early years of the Soviet Union. Nudism and pornography were prohibited, and Soviet society would remain rigidly conservative for the rest of the USSR's existence. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, a much more liberated social climate prevailed in Russia and naturist clubs and beaches reappeared.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

The geographically isolated Scandinavian countries were less affected by Victorian social taboos and continued with their [[sauna]] culture. Nude swimming in rivers or lakes was a very popular tradition. In the summer, there would be wooden [[Public bathing|bathhouse]]s, often of considerable size accommodating numerous swimmers, built partly over the water; hoardings prevented the bathers from being seen from outside. Originally the bathhouses were for men only; today there are usually separate sections for men and women.

For the [[1912 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Stockholm]] in 1912, the official poster was created by a distinguished artist. It depicted several naked male athletes (their genitals obscured) and was for that reason considered too daring for distribution in certain countries.  Posters for the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in [[Paris]], and the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] also featured nude male figures, evoking the classical origins of the games.  The poster for the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]] featured the [[Discobolus]], a nude sculpture of a discus thrower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Discobolus gets dressed up|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/the-discobolus-gets-dressed-up/|author=Mary Beard|date=18 May 2012|newspaper=Times Literary Supplement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the 20th century, a nudist movement began to develop in Germany which was connected to a renewed interest in classical Greek ideas of the human body. So-called [[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK) clubs sprung up during this period and started moving the German public away from much of the Victorian modesty codes they had inherited. During the 1930s, the Nazi leadership either banned naturist organizations or placed them under the control of the party, and opinion on them seems to have been divided. Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] considered nudity decadent while [[Heinrich Himmler]] and the SS endorsed it.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

Male nudity in the US and other Western countries was not a taboo for much of the 20th century. Social attitudes maintained that it was healthy and normal for men and boys to be nude around each other and schools, gymnasia, and other such organizations typically required nude male swimming in part for sanitary reasons due to the use of wool swimsuits. Movies, advertisements, and other media frequently showed nude male bathing or swimming. There was less tolerance for female nudity and the same schools and gyms that insisted on wool swimwear being unsanitary for males did not make an exception when women were concerned. Nonetheless, some schools did allow girls to swim nude if they wished. To cite one example,  [[Detroit]] public schools began allowing nude female swimming in 1947, but ended it after a few weeks following protests from parents. Other schools continued allowing it, but it was never a universally accepted practice like nude male swimming.

During the 1960s, there was a growing body of opinion that boys should not be required to swim nude if they didn't want to, partially from higher postwar living standards that created more expectations of privacy and also from complaints that the supposed unsanitary nature of wool swimwear did not seem to pose a problem with girls. By the 1970s, most schools and gyms in the US had become gender-integrated which put an end to nude swimming.

After WWII, communist [[East Germany]] became famous for its nude beaches and widespread FKK culture, a rare freedom allowed in a regimented society. By comparison, naturism was not as popular in West Germany, one reason being that the churches had more influence than the secularized DDR. Following the reunification of Germany in 1990, FKK declined in popularity due to an influx of more prudish West Germans to the East as well as increased immigration of Turks and other socially conservative Muslims.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

In 1957, Arkansas passed a law to make it illegal to "advocate, demonstrate, or promote nudism." The law applies to both public spaces and private property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.UnconstitutionalArkansas.org |title=Arkansas Law § 5-68-204 Violates First Amendment Rights |publisher=UnconstitutionalArkansas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s-70s, feminist groups in France and Italy lobbied for and obtained the legalization of topless beaches despite opposition from the Roman Catholic Church. Spain would eventually permit toplessness on its beaches, but only after the death of ultra-conservative Catholic dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in 1975. While public nudity is not a major taboo in continental Europe, Britain and the United States tend to view it less favorably, and naturist clubs are not as family-oriented as in Germany and elsewhere, with nude beaches being often seen as meetup locations for homosexual men [[cruising for sex#Regional usage variants|cruising for sex]].  Nowadays, most European countries permit toplessless on normal beaches with full nudity allowed only on designated nude beaches. Despite this, it is quite normal in many parts of Europe to change clothing publicly even if the person becomes fully naked in the process, as this is taken to not count as public nudity.

An occasional—often illegal—naked sideshow is when a member of the public uses a sports venue to perform as a [[streaking|streaker]]. Streaking became more popular in the 1970s. It was not until the 1990s (and after) that nudity became expected at major public events, such as [[Bay to Breakers]] and the [[World Naked Bike Ride]].{{cn|date=February 2014}} Due to the desexualized and sex-negative approach by some contemporary nudist groups, some observers have suggested that 21st-century nudism has experienced a tinge of prudification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Górnicka|first=Barbara|chapter=Chapter 7: Nakedness and the theory of taboo|title=Nakedness, Shame, and Embarrassment: A Long-Term Sociological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vXdCDQAAQBAJ|publisher=Springer|volume=12|series=Figurationen. Schriften zur Zivilisations und Prozesstheorie|year=2016|page=165-178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
In many cultures in history, there were few taboos on children being publicly naked although the point at where it becomes unacceptable has varied between the toddler stage and up until puberty is attained around the ages of 11-12 (see the above example of Pocahontas). In some Western countries since the late 20th century, public attitudes have come to consider any child nudity past the infant stage unacceptable. This has even extended to the idea of covering prepubescent girls' chests at all times in spite of the absence of breasts. As a consequence, in the US and Britain, nude babies and children have largely disappeared from advertisements and other forms of media even though they were commonplace prior to the 1970s. In one of the more notable advertising examples, the famous [[Coppertone sign|Coppertone Logo]], which depicted a small girl having her swimsuit pulled down by a dog to expose her tan lines, was changed during the 1990s–2000s to reveal far less skin.

'''Indonesians in the Philippines''' consist of expatriates and immigrants from [[Indonesia]] residing in the [[Philippines]], and their descendants. Among them were many formerly stateless people, legally called '''Persons of Indonesian descent''' ('''PID'''), whom the United Nations and the governments of the two countries helped to acquire citizenship.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;

According to the 2000 [[Philippines census]], there were 43,871 Indonesians in the Philippines, making them the 5th-largest group of foreigners in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt; Most reside in [[Mindanao]] region, especially in [[Davao del Sur]], [[Davao del Norte]], [[Davao Oriental]], [[Sarangani]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[North Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], [[General Santos]] and [[Davao City]],&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurights"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/focus/section3/2016/06/indonesians-in-mindanao.html|title=Indonesians in Mindanao|year=2016|accessdate=2019-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is also a sizable Indonesian population in Metro Manila.&lt;ref name="Miralao"&gt;{{citation|date=2007|title=Exploring transnational communities in the Philippines|last=Miralao|first=Victoria A.|last2=Makil|first2=Lorna P.|isbn=971-8514-26-0|pages=18–19|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001530/153053e.pdf|publisher=Philippine Social Science Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the two countries are neighbors, there have been many historical migrations between the islands that today make up their national territories, and migrants from what is today [[Indonesia]] helped form many historical dynasties in the Philippines.

==Migration and settlement==

===Ancient and Islamic eras===
Migrations between the territories that today make up [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]] were extremely common during the ancient-era. The people of [[Indonesia]] are descendants of a common migration from the [[Philippines]] and [[Taiwan]]. Certain tribes, mostly from [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]] back-migrated to the Philippines, particularly to the central and southern parts. According to Visayan legend, Sri Lumay, a [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]]-[[Tamil people|Tamil]] prince from [[Sumatra]] was among one of the earliest major settlers to [[Visayas]]. He found the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]], and his descendants played a key role in the Spanish conquest of the Philippines.

The [[Sulu Archipelago]] was under the jurisprudence and sphere of influence of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Majapahit Empire]]. The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]], the Philippines' oldest document found, also records interactions between the Classical Tagalog kingdoms in [[Luzon]] to that of those in modern-day [[Indonesia]]. The people of the two countries also spoke the Malay language as a lingua franca.

During the age of Islamic sultanates and states, preachers from Sumatra helped spread [[Islam]]. [[Rajah Baguinda]], a [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] prince from Sumatra, spread Islam to the people of the Sulu Archipelago. He became a founding father for the [[Sultanate of Sulu]]. Islam in Mindanao was also introduced by the Ternateans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Borschberg |first=Peter |date=2015 |title=Journal, Memorials and Letters of Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge: Security, Diplomacy and Commerce in 17th-century Southeast Asia |url= |location=Singapore |publisher=National University of Singapore Press |page=562 |isbn=9789971695279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Spanish colonial era, most if any migrants or descendants of migrants from modern-day Indonesia were assimilated either into the Hispanized Catholic population or the Moro Muslim population. For a while, the Spanish had tried to colonize eastern Indonesia, particularly the [[Maluku Islands]], sharing it with the Portuguese. In 1606, the Spanish conquered the [[Ternate Sultanate]], deporting the Sultan and his family to Manila. The Spanish colonists shared it with the Dutch, and abandoned it in 1663.

===Modern-day===
From 1925 to 1926, famous Indonesian national hero and ex-PKI member [[Tan Malaka]] lived in Manila. There he became a correspondent of the nationalist newspaper ''El Debate'', edited by Francisco Varona. Publication of Malaka's works, such as a second edition of ''Naar de Republiek Indonesia'' (December 1925) and ''Semangat Moeda'' (''Young Spirit''; 1926) might have been supported by Varona. There Malaka also met Mariano de los Santos, [[José Abad Santos]], and [[Crisanto Evangelista]].{{sfn|Jarvis|1987|p=46}}{{sfn|McVey|1965|p=206}}

Some Indonesians, mostly from [[Sangirese people|Sangirs]] background, came to Mindanao as early as the 1970s, settling down and married local women.&lt;ref name="Ramirez"&gt;{{citation|last=Ramirez|first=Jun|url=http://www.articlearchives.com/international-relations/national-security/197975-1.html|title=1,738 Indons to be repatriated|periodical=Manila Bulletin|date=3 August 2000|accessdate=2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rappler.com/world/specials/southeast-asia/52543-indonesian-sangirs-mindanao The Indonesian Sangirs in Mindanao]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://manadopostonline.com/read/2016/08/06/Agusto-Mereka-Hampir-Tiga-Generasi-Hidup-di-Mindanao/16137/1 Agusto: Mereka Hampir Tiga Generasi Hidup di Mindanao | manadopostonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the largest influx, consisting of fishermen and petty traders, began settling illegally in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gulfnews"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Gulfnews|title=Manila to send back 12,000 Indonesians|date=22 September 2002|accessdate=2008-10-08|url=http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/02/09/22/63741.html}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They continue to maintain consciousness of their separate ethnic identity, as well as material links with Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Miralao"/&gt; Illegal entry and settlement is easy due to the Philippines' long coastline and insufficient personnel in the Border Crossing Office. More recently, many of the fishermen in fact have landing permits which allow them to move freely around the area where their boats are docked.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=300 JI members operating in RP|first=Edith|last=Regalado|first2=Christina|last2=Mendez|periodical=The Philippine Star|date=11 April 2003|url=http://www.intellnet.org/news/2003/04/10/19511-1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registration, residency, and repatriation==
As early as 1990, the Philippine government had been attempting to get Indonesians to register with the authorities, holding out the possibility that they might be granted citizenship as an incentive.&lt;ref name="Hurights"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jowel F.|last=Canuday|title=RP citizenship proposed for Indons|periodical=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=11 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey the next year, which counted 7,200 Indonesians living illegally in the area, found that few wanted to be naturalized in the Philippines, though they hoped to obtain permanent residency in order to regularize their living situation, while 30-35% hoped to be repatriated to Indonesia. That survey found the largest community of Indonesians in [[Sarangani province]], with others in [[South Cotabato]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Davao City]], [[Davao del Norte]], [[Davao Oriental]], and [[North Cotabato]]. At that time, they planned to deport 1,738 of them.&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt; In 2002, the Philippine government, alarmed by the number of Indonesian nationals implicated in recent [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] bombings in the Philippines, drew up a plan to deport a further 12,000 Indonesians from Mindanao; however, the implementation of the plan stalled due to disagreements between the Philippine and Indonesian governments over who would pay for it.&lt;ref name="Gulfnews"/&gt; Indonesians in the Philippines are often stereotyped as terrorists as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Jangan Labelkan Kami Teroris|date=21 July 2003|accessdate=2008-10-07|url=http://www2.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0307/21/sorotan/439481.htm|periodical=Kompas|publication-place=Indonesia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122021816/http://kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0307/21/sorotan/439481.htm|archivedate=22 January 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The militants responsible for the [[2005 Indonesian beheadings of Christian girls|2005 beheadings of Christians]] were also trained in the southern Philippines.

In 2003 and again in 2005, the Philippine government initiated another survey and registration drive; that one registered 2,448 Philippine-born Indonesians, including 247 in General Santos, 371 in Glan-Sarangani, 265 in Davao del Sur, 108 in Davao City, 339 in Kiamba, Tupi and Malapatan, another 253 in Sarangani Island, 341 in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat and Kidapawan, and an additional 154 in Sarangani and Davao del Sur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gov.ph/news/printerfriendly.asp?i=9576|title=Native-born Indonesians in Mindanao Registered|date=11 May 2005|accessdate=2008-10-07|periodical=Official Government Portal of the Republic of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian government is also attempting to convince them to register with the local Indonesian consulate and with the Philippine government, and offered to pay their registration fees for identity documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Sun.Star Davao|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2005/01/27/news/most.indonesians.in.mindanao.are.illegal.residents.html|date=27 January 2005|accessdate=2008-10-07|title=Most Indonesians in Mindanao are illegal residents|first=Aurea A.|last=Gerundio|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825144648/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2005/01/27/news/most.indonesians.in.mindanao.are.illegal.residents.html|archivedate=25 August 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, UNHCR recorded at least 8,756 registered Indonesians in Mindanao are at risk of statelessness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/protection/operations/50001d879/philippines-fact-sheet.html?query=Indonesian Philippines Factsheet August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, 664 stateless people of Indonesian descent in Mindanao were granted Philippine or Indonesian citizenship. It was part of a joint program between the Philippine government and Indonesian consulate in the Philippines to end statelessness for people of Indonesian descent living in the country. They were given a choice of either Indonesian or Filipino citizenship. Of the 664, 536 people were confirmed to have become Filipino citizens, and 128 chose to become Indonesian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/local-news/2016/03/15/664-people-mindanao-get-citizenship-confirmed-462771&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2016/03/664-persons-of-indonesian-descent-pids-in-mindanao-end-statelessness/ 664 persons of Indonesian descent (PIDs) in Mindanao end statelessness - MindaNews]&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2016, there are 8,745 registered PIDs in Southern Philippines, consist of 3,155 in Sarangani, 2,777 in Davao Del Sur, 859 in General Santos, 688 in South Cotabato, 679 in Davao Oriental, 279 in Davao City, 176 in Sultan Kudarat, and 133 in North Cotabato.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;

==Education==
According to the study conducted by the UNHCR in 2012, more than 6,000 persons of Indonesian descent in southern Philippines are having problematic access to education, due to their unclear citizenship status and poverty they experienced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2014/9/5416d3519/stateless-philippines-indonesian-descendants-feel-torn-lands.html UNHCR - Stateless in the Philippines: Indonesian descendants feel torn between two lands]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Philippines is becoming an increasingly popular destination for Indonesian [[international student]]s, both those in short term courses, and those studying for university degrees. [[English as a foreign or second language|English as a foreign language]] courses are one well-known draw for students from all over Asia, but other subject areas are gaining in popularity as well. In particular, [[flight training]] courses are much cheaper in the Philippines than in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=679362&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=108|periodical=Philippine Star|title=Indonesians prefer to study in PHL|last=Dagooc|first=Ehda M.|date=2011-04-25|accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asian Institute of Management]] also attracts many Indonesian students.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/316083/phl-|periodical=Manila Bulletin|date=2011-04-29|accessdate=2011-06-20|first=Malou M.|last=Mozo|title=PHL seen as ideal education destination in ASEAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an Indonesian school (with dormitory for boarding students) and Indonesian Cultural Center called "House of Indonesia" in [[Davao City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=194092|periodical=Philippine Star|title=Fire hits Indonesian Cultural Center in Davao City|date=2003-02-04|accessdate=2011-06-20|first=Edith|last=Regalado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many Indonesians in Metro Manila, mostly Chinese-Indonesian, who are either university students or medical residents (mostly Dermatology and Pediatrics).

==Religion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Indonesians in the Philippines residing in Mindanao are split between Muslims and Protestants, while the majority of them settle freely with local Filipinos and adopts local cultures and customs while maintaining their distinct Indonesian identity at the same time.

Indonesians of Sangirese descent are split between Muslims and Protestants, while [[Minahasan people|Minahasan]] or Chinese descent are mostly Protestants.

The '''Kenyah''' people are an indigenous, [[Austronesian]]-speaking people of [[Borneo]], living in the remote [[Baram (federal constituency)|Baram]] ([[Lio Matoh]], [[Long Selaan]], [[Long Moh]], [[Long Anap]], [[Long Mekaba]], [[Long Jeeh]], [[Long Belaong]], [[Long San]], [[Long Silat]], [[Long Tungan]], etc.), [[Data Kakus]], Data Surau, Senap River, [[Long Dungan]], [[Long Busang]], [[Long Beyak]], [[Bintulu]], [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], Asap River resettlement for [[Bakun Dam]], Long Bulan, Long Jawe and [[Belaga, Sarawak|Belaga]] regions in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]] and the remote Apau Kayan, Bahau (Bau), Benua Lama, Benua Baru and Mahakam regions in [[East Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]].

Kenyah people are divided into various tribes including the [[Uma Baka' people|Uma Bakah]], Lepo Anan, Lepo Tau, Lepu Jalan, Lepo' Tepu, Uma Kelap, Badeng ,Jamok, Lepo Agak, Bakung, Lebu Kulit, Uma Alim, Uma Timai, Uma Lasan, Lepo Ma-ut, Sambop, Lepo Ke', Lepo Ngao, Ngurek, Kiput, Long Ulai, Long Tikan, Long Sabatu, Lepo Ga, Lepo Dikan, and Lepo Pua

Kenyah people lived in longhouses in a small communities. Each longhouse consists of families who choose their own leader (headman). When they have any event or celebration such as [[harvest festival]] they will normally use the longhouse verandah (''oseh bi'o'') to gather and deliver speeches to guide their youngsters. Normally this harvest festival celebration (''tau bio Ramay o o Ajau'', ''pelepek uman'') is a major festival because most of them are still farmers.

Kenyah people are very creative and they also have composed their popular songs and melody such as ''Lan e Tuyang'', ''Kendau bimbin'', ''Ilu Kenyah Kua Lo Te'a'', ''Pabat Pibui'', ''Atek Lan'' and ''Leleng Oyau Along Leleng''. Popular traditional Kenyah musical instruments are such as ''jatung utang'' (wooden xylophone),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|editor=Terry Miller &amp; Sean Williams|title=The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=11-359-0155-4|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sapeh|sampe]]'' (a type of guitar),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret J.

== Religion ==
[[Christianity]] is the predominant religion of Kenyah people, with the majority belonging to the Roman Catholic faith. Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Kenyah people practice a traditional form of [[animism]] called 'Bungan Malan Peselong Luan'. However, today are only a small number of Kenyah people who still practice the Bungan faith. It is believed that a person will ascend to ''Alo Malau'' (seven heavens) with their [[ancestor]]s (''tepun'') after death.&lt;ref&gt;http://rensraul.blogspot.com/2008/12/penganut-kristen-long-busang.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
Statistical figures, based on the Indonesian and Malaysian national censuses collected in 2000, recorded a total of 44,350 Kenyah people in [[East Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]] and 24,906 in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;See 2000 National Census, Jawatan Perangkaan Malaysia, 2000 and 2000 Population Census /Sensus Penduduk 2000, Central Bureau of Statistics Indonesia, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-ethnic groups ==
The Kenyah people are also divided into various sub-ethnic groups such as:-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesianhistory.info/map/borneolang.html?zoomview=1 |title=Languages of Borneo |publisher=Digital Atlas of Indonesian History |accessdate=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Usun Apau (aka Usun Apo) plateau (in the Plieran river valley) or Apo Kayan Highlands (a remote forested plateau in Malaysian and Indonesian border) in the present-day Indonesian province of [[East Kalimantan]] and [[Malaysia]]'s [[Sarawak]] is believed by the Kenyah people to be their place of origin;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugo Steiner|title=Sarawak: people of the longhouse and jungle|year=2007|publisher=Opus Publications|isbn=98-339-8701-X|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the largest concentration site of Kenyah populations between the late 19th century to the early 1980s.

== Languages ==
The [[Kenyah languages]] are a small family of [[Austronesian languages]]. Their language is called Kenyah.

The '''Kosovo Maiden''' or '''Maiden of the Blackbird Field''' ({{lang-sr|Косовка девојка}} / ''Kosovka devojka'') is the central figure of a poem with the same name, part of the [[Serbian epic poetry#Corpus|Kosovo cycle]] in the [[Serbian epic poetry]]. In it, a young beauty searches the battlefield for her [[Betrothal|betrothed husband]] and helps wounded Serbian warriors with water, wine and bread after the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389 between [[Serbia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. She finally finds the wounded and dying warrior [[Pavle Orlović]] who tells her that her fiancé [[Milan Toplica]] and his blood-brothers [[Miloš Obilić]] and [[Ivan Kosančić]] are dead. Before the battle they had given her a cloak, golden ring and veil for the wedding as a promise of safe return, but they were slain and Pavle pointed to the direction of the bodies. The poem finishes with; &lt;blockquote&gt;
"O wretch! Evil is your fortune!&lt;br&gt;If I, a wretch, were to grasp a green pine,&lt;br&gt;Even the green pine would wither."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poem became greatly popular as a symbol of womanly [[compassion]] and charity. [[Uroš Predić]] took up the theme in 1919 with an oil [[Kosovo Maiden (painting)|painting of the same title]]. In 1907, the sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]] created a marble relief of the subject as a part of his Kosovo cycle. Another Croatian artist, [[Mirko Rački]], painted a version of Kosovo Maiden.

Many '''retirement issues for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) and [[intersex]] people''' are unique from their non-[[LGBTI]] counterparts and these populations often have to take extra steps addressing their employment, health, legal and housing concerns to ensure their needs are met. Throughout the United States, " 2 million people age 50 and older identify as LGBT, and that number is expected to double by 2030", estimated in a study done by the Institute for Multigenerational Health at the University of Washington.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = For LGBT seniors, affordable housing is scarce and often unwelcoming|url = http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-gay-elder-housing-20140420-story.html|website = latimes.com|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, the [[Stonewall Riots]] marked the start of the modern gay rights movement and increasingly LGBTQ+ people have become more visible and accepted into mainstream cultures.&lt;ref name="pewreport"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pew Global Attitudes Project |title=Views of a Changing World |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=185 |format=.PDF |date=June 2003 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Pew Research Center For The People &amp; The Press | oclc=52547041 |accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBTQ+ elders and retirees are still considered a newer phenomenon creating challenges and opportunities as a range of [[Ageing|aging]] issues are becoming more understood as those who live open lives redefine commonly held beliefs and as retirees newly [[coming out|come out]] of the closet.

LGBTQ+ individuals are less likely to have strong [[family]] support systems in place to have relatives to care for them during aging. They are twice as likely to enter old age living as a single person; and two and a half times more likely to live alone. Because institutionalized [[homophobia]] as well as cultural [[discrimination]] and [[harassment]] still exist, they are less likely to access health care, housing, or social services or when they do, find the experience stressful or demeaning.&lt;ref name="LGBT Health Care Movement Gains"/&gt;

Joel Ginsberg, executive director of the Gay Lesbian Medical Association,  asserts "only by pursuing both strategies, encouraging institutional change and encouraging...and empowering individuals to ask for what they want will we end up with quality care for LGBT people."&lt;ref name="LGBT Health Care Movement Gains"&gt;{{cite web

LGBTQ+ Aging Centers have opened in several major metropolitan areas with the goal of training long-term care providers about LGBT-specific issues, an area of frequent discrimination.  Legislative solutions are available as well: "[[California]] is the only state with a law saying the gay elderly have special needs, like other members of minority groups. A new law encourages training for employees and contractors who work with the elderly and permits state financing of projects like gay senior centers."&lt;ref name="nyt2007"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/us/09aged.html|work = The New York Times|title = Aging and Gay, and Facing Prejudice in Twilight|first = Jane|last = Gross|date = October 9, 2007|accessdate = May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty states prohibit discrimination in housing and public accommodation on the basis of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="nyt2007" /&gt;

== Aging in the LGBT+ community ==

=== “[[Baby boomers|Baby Boomer]]” aging ===
[[Baby boomers|Baby Boomers]] are putting significant visibility on the elderly population of the United States, as well as significant stressors. The overall U.S. population age rises with the retirement of Baby Boomers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.equalrightscenter.org/site/DocServer/Senior_Housing_Report.pdf?docID=2361|title = Opening Doors: An Investigation of Barriers to Senior Housing for Same-Sex Couples|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = The Equal Rights Center|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024334/http://www.equalrightscenter.org/site/DocServer/Senior_Housing_Report.pdf?docID=2361|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are about three million LGBT seniors above 65, with that number jumping to over six million by 2030.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to a 2010 study of over a thousand LGBTQ+ 45- to 64-year-olds and a comparative group of the same amount of baby boomers, drawn randomly from the general population, "all boomers have the same fears about aging, are struggling to finance their retirement, have similar caregiving patterns, and similar desires for end-of-life care. However, in some respects, LGBT boomers will approach retirement differently. They have withstood many years of discrimination and say their approach to retirement and aging has been shaped by their experiences. They express concerns about being dependent on others when they become infirm. Largely single and living alone, they will rely more on close friends than family for support as they age".&lt;ref&gt;Timmermann, Sandra. "Planning for Retirement: What Financial Service Professionals Need to Know about Their LGBT Boomer Clients." ''Journal of Financial Service Professionals'' 66, no. 5 (September 2012): 24-26. ''Business Source Complete'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 1, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Familial issues ===
Homosexual senior citizens are cited as being four times less likely to have children or grandchildren, signaling less of a support system for later-life circumstances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the [[National LGBTQ Task Force|National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], homosexuals are also twice as likely to live alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many in such a community faced adulthood before the normalcy of same-sex partnerships and the legalization of same-sex marriage, and as such, never sought partnership status, benefits, or a long-term relationship in general.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== HIV ===
As more people continue to live with [[HIV]] and [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] into old age, there are new points brought to light in terms of complications, needs, and services. stigma, especially among older people living with HIV, often affects the quality of life lived. It also leads to greater isolation in old age.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aging With HIV/AIDS|url = https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/staying-healthy-with-hiv-aids/taking-care-of-yourself/aging-with-hiv-aids/|website = www.aids.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stigma specifically can lessen quality of life and negatively affect self-image and behaviors, leading to the inability or lack of wanting to disclose HIV status or to seek care.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There is also an increase in mental illness compared to the general aging population, often associated with the same reasonings along with a lack of specified care.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, it is very integral that HIV care is provided in terms of mental health and other services to the affected elderly population at large. Administering necessary medications and coverage for such medications and cocktails is a concern and a necessity for the elderly community living with HIV/AIDs, to which there is a disproportionate amount of LGBTQ+ persons.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Modern History ==
LGBTQ+ persons were not regarded in a distinctly positive light until the advent of the 21st century, with previous portrayals being less than favorable. Seniors were even more disregarded, with most of the literature and knowledge throughout the latter half of the 20th century being focused on youth. As Berger and Kelly noted in ''Gay men and Lesbians Grown Older,'' published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in 1996, "The older lesbian...is purported to be a cruel witch. Cold, unemotional, and heartless, she despises men. Devoted solely to masculine  interests  and  career  pursuits,  she  has  no  friends  and  is repeatedly  frustrated  by  the  rejections  of younger  women.  The older gay man is said to become increasingly isolated and effeminate as he ages. Lacking family and friends, he is portrayed as desperately lonely. He must settle for no sex life at all, or he must prey upon young boys to satisfy his lust."&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Raymond M., and James J. Kelly. "Gay men and lesbians grown older." (1996), 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination ==
There is a fear of discrimination on various counts within the LGBTQ+ community, characterized by "GLBT people [growing] older and [relying] more and more on public programs and social services for care and assistance. They may have less independence from heterosexist institutions. The fear of experiencing discrimination can reinforce social isolation, placing people at higher risk for self-neglect, decreased long-term quality life, and increased mortality risk".&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, Sean, Ken South, and Jane Spade.

By 2030, there will be about 120,000 to 300,000 older LGBT+ retirees in nursing homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Older Lesbians and Gay Men: Long-Term Care Issues|url = http://www.annalsoflongtermcare.com/article/8315|website = www.annalsoflongtermcare.com|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite seemingly rapid change in the national perception of LGBT+ people in America, LGBTQ+ seniors face a unique set of challenges in housing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Yearly, about four million fair housing violations occur, but even more so for those discriminated against via their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nationalfairhousing.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=GBv0ZVJp6Gg%3D&amp;tabid=3917&amp;mid=5321|title = Fair Housing in a Changing Nation: 2012 Fair Housing Trends Report|date = April 30, 2012|accessdate = |website = National Fair Housing Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170406083753/http://www.nationalfairhousing.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=GBv0ZVJp6Gg%3D&amp;tabid=3917&amp;mid=5321|archivedate = April 6, 2017|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lgbtdata.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10884149/ds020_ksso_report.pdf|title = Inside-Out: A Report on the Experiences of Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexuals in America and the Public’s View on Issues and Politics Related to Sexual Orientation|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Kaiser Family Foundation|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released findings of discrepancies among the provisions given by housing providers, resulting in higher response rates for heterosexual rather than homosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huduser.org/portal/Publications/pdf/Hsg_Disc_against_SameSexCpls_v3.pdf|title = An Estimate of Housing Discrimination Against Same Sex Couples|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = U.S. Department of Housing and Development|publisher = M.

=== Medical ===
In 1973, same-sex orientation was no longer viewed as a disorder, however, there has been much medical discrimination nonetheless.&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; A 2002 survey found only three fourths of practicing physicians felt “very comfortable” taking care of an out LGB patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kff.org/minorityhealth/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=13955|title = National Survey of Physicians, Part 1: Doctors on Disparities in Medical Care|date = 2002|accessdate = |website = Kaiser Family Foundation|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130405091600/http://www.kff.org/minorityhealth/loader.cfm?url=%2Fcommonspot%2Fsecurity%2Fgetfile.cfm&amp;PageID=13955|archivedate = 2013-04-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 LAIN survey of LGBT baby boomers, less than fifty percent had confidence that healthcare workers would treat them with “dignity and respect” on account of their sexual orientation, tainting the doctor-patient relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.asaging.org/networks/lgain/outandaging.pdf|title = Out and aging: The MetLife study of lesbian and gay baby boomers: Lesbian and Gay Aging Issues Network of the American Society on Aging and Zogby International|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = MetLife Mature Market Institute|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091123011352/http://www.asaging.org/networks/LGAIN/OutandAging.pdf|archivedate = 2009-11-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of politics and policy ==

=== [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] ===
The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] (2011) allows many LGBTQ+ elderly to afford health care and apply for [[Medicaid]] or more affordable private health insurance, regardless of state. They also cannot be denied coverage based on pre-existing conditions when ill, as well as helping seniors under 65 gain access to Medicaid, providing free [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in certain cases, and lowering drug costs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There is also the added implementation of the Elder Justice Act, providing a platform against mistreatment by providers and caregivers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The law also includes spousal protections for those receiving [[Medicaid]], to which the Obama Administration issued guidance to state directors that same-sex partners be treated the same in terms of the [[Medicaid]] coverage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== [[Defense of Marriage Act]] &amp; [[Obergefell v. Hodges|Obergefell v Hodges]] ===
Elder benefits are heavily defined by benefits falling under the "elder safety net" such as social security, medicate, medicare, and retirement plans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dubois, Matthew R. "Introduction to Legal Concerns of LGBT Elders." ''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender aging: Research and clinical perspectives''(2006): 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The Defense of Marriage Act, passed in 1996, prevented same sex couples from attaining some of those benefits, among others, that are often given to heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]] was in effect, LGBTQ+ people had lower rates of health insurance coverage than the general population due to higher costs from insurers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Federal law treated a partner's insurance as taxable income, and therefore the retirees would have to pay taxes on it; heterosexual couples would be able to get such benefits tax free, without the employers having to further pay payroll taxes on them as would employers of LGBTQ+ employees.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Therefore, a lot of LGBTQ+ adults aren't offered such health care plans or simply can't afford them in the first place.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As such, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]-led dissolution of section three of said act in 2013, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, opened up benefits to LGBTQ+ elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supreme Court Rules DOMA Unconstitutional|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/26/supreme-court-doma-decision_n_3454811.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only states that had already legalized same sex marriage could gain access to such benefits thereafter, but [[Obergefell v. Hodges|Obergefell v Hodges]] (2015) then legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, therefore giving marriage rights and the retirement abilities that come with that to LGBTQ+ citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Obergefell v. Hodges|url = http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/|website = SCOTUSblog|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transgender-specific issues ==
The transgender population of the United States has been fairly hidden until the late 20th century, not being exposed to the national spotlight until recently, and only being declassified as a mental illness in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DSM-5 Reflects Shift In Perspective On Gender Identity|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/04/gender-dysphoria-dsm-5_n_3385287.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the earlier set of transgender population reaches retirement age, or as older persons come out as transgender, there are certain issues that have arisen. There is a large variance in medical treatment across the United States, for example; a lasting issue is the fact that many health insurance agencies  “exclude coverage of transgender-specific health care, particularly surgery”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reading: The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People: Building a Foundation for Better Understanding {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/read/13128/chapter/1|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is discrimination in this regard and in others, with The National Transgender Discrimination Survey having cited that almost thirty percent of respondents faced verbal harassment in a medical setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About half of the respondents also had providers who did not fully cover or understand certain transgender needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In another issue, biological sex can contribute to certain diseases or health issues, providing a doubling of health issues compiled with the latter attained sex in correlation with their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Fenway Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health|last = Appelbaum|first = Jonathan|publisher = American College of Physicians|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 135–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical ===
As transgender elders retire, they are often disadvantaged in the health care system. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and many private health insurance coverages "carry specific exclusions for transition-related care, which are sometimes interpreted in practice to deny coverage to transgender people for even basic medical care".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Baker, Kellan, and Jeff Krehely. "How Health Care Reform Will Help LGBT Elders." ''Public Policy &amp; Aging Report'' 21, no. 3, 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|The Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)]] has reiterated the provision of "hormone replacement therapy and routine preventive care such as prostate screenings, mammograms, and pelvic exams, regardless of the gender marker in the individual’s Social Security record".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These providers and the transgender patients are often unaware of such rules or of condition code 45, created by [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]] in order to avoid automatic coverage denials in cases of gender discrepancies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Harley, Debra A. "Impact of Healthcare Reform on LGBT Elders." In ''Handbook of LGBT Elders'', pp. 375-389. Springer International Publishing, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare also excludes sex reassignment surgery from its coverage, basing it as solely cosmetic.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The policy "also encourages private insurers, state Medicaid plans, and the veterans’ health care system to continue to allow similar exclusions that target care for transgender people".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Transgender Equality. (2011). Medicare benefits and transgender people. Washington, DC: National Center for Transgender Equality. Retrieved October 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lesbophobia''' (sometimes '''lesbiphobia''') comprises various forms of negativity towards [[lesbian]]s as individuals, as couples, or as a [[Group (sociology)|social group]]. Based on the categories of [[sex differences in humans|sex]], [[sexual orientation]], lesbian [[Identity (social science)|identity]], and [[gender]] expression, this negativity encompasses [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], and abuse, in addition to [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and feelings ranging from disdain to hostility. As such, lesbophobia is [[sexism]] against women that [[Intersectionality|intersects]] with [[homophobia]] and vice versa.

==Related terminology==
While some people use only the more general term ''[[homophobia]]'' to describe this sort of prejudice or behavior, others believe that the terms ''[[homosexual]]'' and ''homophobia'' do not adequately reflect the specific concerns of lesbians, because they experience the double discrimination of both homophobia and sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=18 December 2006 |title=What is "Lesbophobia"? |publisher=ILGA |url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=1&amp;FileID=997 |accessdate=7 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192524/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/997 |archivedate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Czyzselska"&gt;{{cite news|last=Czyzselska|first=Jane|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/09/lesbophobia-homophobia-side-order-sexism|title=Lesbophobia is homophobia with a side-order of sexism|work=The Guardian|date=9 July 2013|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[bisexual]] women may prefer to use the term [[biphobia]] to refer to prejudice or abuse that they encounter which is based on their bisexual identity or behaviour, and people who identify as [[transgender]] often prefer to use the word [[transphobia]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Extent==
The idea that lesbians are dangerous—while [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] interactions are natural, normal, and spontaneous—is a common example of beliefs which are lesbophobic. Like homophobia, this belief is classed as [[heteronormative]], as it assumes that heterosexuality is dominant, presumed, and normal, and that other sexual or relationship arrangements are abnormal and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Jillian Todd Weiss, [http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/tulane.pdf "The Gender Caste System – Identity, Privacy, and Heteronormativity"] ''10 Law &amp; Sexuality 123'' (Tulane Law School, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; A stereotype that has been identified as lesbophobic is that female athletes are always or predominantly lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Peper, Karen, "Female athlete=Lesbian: a complex myth constructed from gender role expectations and lesbiphobia", ''Queer words, queer images: communications and the construction of homosexuality'', pages 193–208 (New York University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Plymire and Pamela Forman, "Breaking the Silence: Lesbian Fans, the Internet, and the Sexual Politics of Women's Sport", ''International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies'', pages 1566–1768 (Springer Netherlands, April 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbians encounter lesbophobic attitudes not only in straight men and women, but from gay men, as well as bisexual people.&lt;ref&gt;Megan Radclyffe, ''Lesbophobia!: Gay Men and Misogyny'' (Continuum, October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbophobia in gay men is regarded as manifest in the perceived subordination of lesbian issues in the campaign for [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Raizada, "An Interview with the Guerrilla Girls, Dyke Action Machine (DAM!), and the Toxic Titties", ''NWSA Journal'', pages 39–58 (Volume 19, Number 1, Spring 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lesbophobic violence===
[[File:Justice For Sizakhele &amp; Salome (8036300204).jpg|thumb|left|Soweto Pride 2012 participants remember two lesbians who were raped and murdered in 2007.]]
Lesbophobia is sometimes demonstrated through crimes of violence, including [[corrective rape]] and even [[murder]].

==Erotic plasticity and sexual fluidity ==
Many lesbians have expressed the view that there has been an emergence of a new kind of prejudice against lesbians that is distinct from the traditional form. They feel that the use of the notion of innate sexual orientation as an argument for homosexual rights, especially in the form that claim that people on average become more accepting towards homosexuality if they think it is biological, is demonizing the notion that the individual is to be respected in his or her choices regardless of origin by falsely lumping the latter notion with homophobia. They also feel that this denigration of the concept of respect for individual choice, an artificial societal polarization that fixates homosexual rights to the concept of innateness, is leaving lesbian rights more vulnerable to being attacked by the argument that women are more [[Erotic plasticity|erotically plastic]] or [[sexually fluid]] than men. Because of this argument, some lesbians report that gay men and sexologists who state that they are aligned with gay rights are demeaning lesbians because the argument is akin to stating that women do not have the same right to their sexual orientation as men because of female erotic plasticity.

Some propose that information about the problems with statistics as evidence for correlations between attitudes, such as people being socially excluded from groups with a view on one matter for a different opinion on an unrelated view and being forced into other groups or forced to lie about their attitudes, making unrelated opinions falsely appear to be linked, and argue that it may help rehabilitate the notion of respect for individual choice. Others argue that since sexual orientation change efforts aimed at women often include rape, they are worse than those aimed at men. Others suggest that the notion of female erotic plasticity is wishful thinking on the part of men who want to have sex with lesbians, and should be criticized for not being objective.&lt;ref&gt;Lesbophobia, Agnes F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4555">There are eight '''capital cities in [[Australia]]''', each of which functions as the seat of government for the [[States and territories of Australia|state or territory]] in which it is located. [[Melbourne]] was the initial capital following the 1901 [[Federation of Australia]]. In 1927, the seat of national government was moved to the newly created city of [[Canberra]], which continues to serve as the [[list of national capitals|national capital]].

Each capital city hosts the judicial, administrative and legislative functions for its jurisdiction.  In each state and internal territory, the capital is also the jurisdiction's most populous city.

The Australian external territory of [[Norfolk Island]] has its official capital at [[Kingston, Norfolk Island|Kingston]], although this acts merely as the administrative centre of government; its ''[[de facto]]'' capital is [[Burnt Pine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Norfolk Island - Kingston'' http://www.pitcairners.org/vt_kingston.html Norfolk Island's Home on the Web&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3275">The '''Moose International of Great Britain Association''' (formerly known as '''The Grand Lodge of the Loyal Order of Moose in Great Britain''') is a fraternal service organisation, which was run by the Grand Council from 1926 to 2013 until it was replaced by the National Management Committee. The current National President is Albert Skeates.

The first [[Director-General]] [[James J. Davies]] founded the Grand Lodge at his birthplace of [[Tredegar]] in [[Wales]]. The aims are the same as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]] in the [[United States]], which are to help the orphaned and the widowed. The organisation runs many fundraising programmes for various worthy causes. The British Headquarters of [[Moose International]] are to be found in [[Burnham-on-Sea]], [[Somerset]]. There are twenty-four chartered lodges active throughout England and Wales.

Riehle et al. define open collaboration as collaboration based on three principles of [[egalitarianism]], [[meritocracy]], and [[self-organization]].&lt;ref name="Riehel et al"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1109/MS.2009.44| issn = 0740-7459| volume = 26| issue = 2| pages = 52–58| last1 = Riehle| first1 = D.| last2 = Ellenberger| first2 = J.| last3 = Menahem| first3 = T.| last4 = Mikhailovski| first4 = B.| last5 = Natchetoi| first5 = Y.| last6 = Naveh| first6 = B.| last7 = Odenwald| first7 = T.| title = Open Collaboration within Corporations Using Software Forges| journal = IEEE Software| date = March 2009|url=http://dirkriehle.com/uploads/2009/02/open-collaboration-within-corporations-using-software-forges.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine and Prietula define open collaboration  as "any system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who interact to create a product (or service) of economic value, which they make available to contributors and noncontributors alike." &lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; This definition captures multiple instances, all joined by similar principles. For example, all of the elements — goods of economic value, open access to contribute and consume, interaction and exchange, purposeful yet loosely coordinated work — are present in an open source software project, in Wikipedia, or in a user forum or community. They can also be present in a commercial website that is based on [[user-generated content]]. In all of these instances of open collaboration, anyone can contribute and anyone can freely partake in the fruits of sharing, which are produced by interacting participants who are loosely coordinated.

An annual conference dedicated to the research and practice of open collaboration is the [[International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration]] (OpenSym, formerly WikiSym).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensym.org/about-us/|title=About|work=The International Symposium on Open Collaboration}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per its website, the group defines open collaboration as "collaboration that is egalitarian (everyone can join, no principled or artificial barriers to participation exist), meritocratic (decisions and status are merit-based rather than imposed) and self-organizing (processes adapt to people rather than people adapt to pre-defined processes)."&lt;ref name="Opensym"&gt;".

Open manufacturing combines the following elements of a production process: new open production tools and methods (such as [[3D printer]]s), new value-based movements (such as the [[maker movement]]), new institutions and networks for manufacturing and production (such as [[FabLab]]s), and open source methods, software and protocols.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Good our Future: Exploring the New Boundaries of Open &amp; Social Innovation in Manufacturing.|last=Ramsden|first=P.|publisher=Policy paper for the European Commission|year=|isbn=|location=http://uk.ukwon.eu/File%20Storage/4970285_7_SIE-Making-Good-our-Future-May-2015.pdf|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kostakis|first1=Vasilis|last2=Niaros|first2=Vasilis|last3=Dafermos|first3=George|last4=Bauwens|first4=Michel|title=Design global, manufacture local: Exploring the contours of an emerging productive model|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328715001214|journal=Futures|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2015.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open manufacturing may also include digital modeling and fabrication and [[computer numeric control]] (CNC) of the machines used for production through [[open source software]] and [[open source hardware]].

The philosophy of open manufacturing is close to the [[open-source movement]], but aims at the development of physical products rather than software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adciv.org/Open_collaborative_design |title=Open collaborative design |publisher=AdCiv |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is linked to the notion of democratizing technology&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as embodied in the [[Maker culture]], the [[DIY ethic]], the [[open source appropriate technology]] movement, the Fablab-network  and other rooms for grassroot innovation such as [[hackerspace]]s.

According to scholar [[Michel Bauwens]], Open Manufacturing is "the expansion of [[peer production]] to the world of physical production".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Redlich and Bruns define "Open Production" as "a new form of coordination for production systems that implies a superior broker system coordinating the information and material flows between the stakeholders of production", and which will encompass the entire value creation process for physical goods: development, manufacturing, sales, support etc.&lt;ref&gt;Redlich, T.; Bruhns, F.-L.: Open Production - a new broker-based approach to interactive value creation and user manufacturing. In: 2008 Proceedings of the ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE) Vol. 4, Design and Manufacturing, {{ISBN|9780791848654}}, pp. 181-189 [http://www.openproduction.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Open-Production-a-new-broker-based-approach-to-interactive-value-creation-an-user-manufacturing.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A policy paper commissioned by the European Commission uses the term "maker manufacturing" and positions it between social innovation, open source ICT and manufacturing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Principles ==

The Openness of "open manufacturing" may relate to the nature of the product ([[open design]]), to the nature of the production machines and methods (e.g. open source [[3D printing|3D-printers]], open source [[Numerical control|CNC]]), to the process of production and innovation ([[commons-based peer production]] / collaborative / [[distributed manufacturing]]), or to new forms of value creation (network-based bottom-up or hybrid versus business-centric top down).&lt;ref&gt;Dickel, Sascha, Ferdinand, Jan-Peter, Petschow, Ulrich: The Multiple Applications of 3D Printing: Between Maker Movements and the Future of Manufacturing. In: Ferdinand, Jan-Peter, Petschow, Ulrich, Dickel, Sascha (2016): The Decentralized and Networked Future of Value Creation. 3D Printing and its Implications for Society, Industry, and Sustainable Development, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Rifkin]] argues, that open production through 3D-printing "will eventually and inevitably reduce marginal costs to near zero, eliminate profit, and make property exchange in markets unnecessary for many (though not all) products".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism|last=Rifkin|first=J.|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socioeconomic implications ==

The following points are seen as key implications of open manufacturing:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Anna Waldman Brown: Exploring the Maker-Industrial Revolution: Will the Future of Production be local? BRIE Working Paper 2016-07. Online: [http://www.brie.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BRIE-Working-Paper-2016-7.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* a democratization of (the means of) production, 
* a decentralization of production and local value creation (global cooperation – local manufacturing), 
* the possibility to produce high quality prototypes and products in small quantities at moderate (to increasingly low) prices, 
* the closing of the gap between the formal and informal sector and opportunities for  bottom-up [[open innovation]], and 
* a transition from consumer to producer for manufactured goods.
In the context of [[socioeconomic development]], open manufacturing has been described as a path towards a more sustainable industrialization on a global scale, that promotes "social sustainability" and provides the opportunity to shift to a "collaboration-oriented industrialization driven by stakeholders from countries with different development status connected in a global value creation at eye level".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;S. Basmer; S. Buxbaum-Conradi; P. Krenz; T. Redlich; J. P. Wulfsberg; F.-L. Bruhns (2015): Open Production: Chances for Social Sustainability in Manufacturing. Page 50 Online at:http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2212827114009159/1-s2.0-S2212827114009159-main.pdf?_tid=3d0c576e-b71a-11e6-9389-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1480523580_ed36ad5c40d2a496eccdaf40697b74d2&lt;/ref&gt;

For developing countries, open production could notably lead to products more adapted to local problems and local markets and reduce dependencies on foreign goods, as vital products could be manufactured locally.&lt;ref&gt;Ramalingam, B.; Hernandez, K.; Prieto Martin, P. and Faith, B. (2016) Ten Frontier Technologies for International Development. Brighton: IDS. Page 43. Online: [https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/12637/Main_Report_2016_Ten_Frontier_Tecnologies_for_International_Development.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y]&lt;/ref&gt; In such a context, open manufacturing is strongly linked to the broader concept of [[Open Source Appropriate Technology]] movement.

==Criticism==

A number of factors are seen to hamper the broad-based application of the model of "open manufacturing" and / or to realize its positive implications for more sustainable global production pattern.

The first factor is the sustainability of commons-based peer production models: "Empowerment happens only, if the participants are willing to share their knowledge with their colleagues. The participation of the actors cannot be guaranteed, thus there are many cases known, where participation could only be insufficiently realized".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other problems include missing or inadequate systems of quality control, the persistent paradigm of high-volume manufacturing and its cost-efficiency, the lack of widely adopted platforms to share hardware designs, as well as challenges linked to the joint-ownership paradigm behind the open licences of open manufacturing and the fact, that hardware is much more difficult to share and to standardize than e.g. software.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In developing countries, a number of factors need to be considered in addition to the points above. Scholar Waldman-Brown names the following: lack of manufacturing expertise and informality of current SMMs in emerging markets as an obstacle to quality control for final products and raw material as well as universities and vocational training programs not apt to react rapidly enough to provide the necessary knowledge and qualifications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Dialects==
Paiwan variants can be divided into the following dialect zones (Ferrell 1982:4–6).

*'''A1''' – southern and central
**Kuɬaɬau (Kulalao) – used in Ferrell's 1982 ''Paiwan Dictionary'' due to its widespread intelligibility and preservation of various phonemic distinctions; also spoken in Tjuabar Village, [[Taitung County]], where Tjariḍik and "Tjuabar" (closely related to Tjavuaɬi) are also spoken.
**Kapaiwanan (Su-Paiwan)
**Tjuaqatsiɬay (Kachirai) – southernmost dialect
*'''A2''' – central

==Phonology==
Kuɬaɬau Paiwan has 23–24 consonants ({{IPA|/h/}} is found only in loanwords, and {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is uncommon) and 4 vowels (Ferrell 1982:7). Unlike many other [[Formosan languages]] that have merged many Proto-Austronesian phonemes, Paiwan preserves most Proto-Austronesian phonemes and is thus highly important for reconstruction purposes.

The four Paiwan vowels are {{IPA|/i ə a u/}}. {{IPA|/ə/}} is written ''e'' in the literature.

In Northern Paiwan the palatal consonants have been lost, though this is recent and a few conservative speakers maintain them as allophonic variants (not as distinct phonemes). {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is robust, unlike in other Paiwan dialects where its status is uncertain, as it derives from *q.

'''Pavlo Ivanovych Lazarenko''' ({{lang-uk|Павло Іванович Лазаренко}}; born 23 January 1953) is a former [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] politician and former [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] who in August 2006 was convicted and sentenced to prison in the [[United States]] for [[money laundering]], [[wire fraud]] and [[extortion]]. According to [[United Nations]], approximately US$200 million was embezzled by Lazarenko during 1996–97 from the government of Ukraine.&lt;ref name=KraUNLaz&gt;Kravets, David.  "Former Ukraine leader ordered to prison." ''Associated Press'', 25 August 2006, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/25/AR2006082500897.html (Accessed: 4 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Pavlo Lazarenko was born in a village of Karpivka ([[Shyroke Raion]]) that is located just outside a former Inhulets city (today part of [[Kryvyi Rih]]) on 23 January 1953 in peasant family (gardener). In 1970 he worked as a driver in the [[kolkhoz]] "Zoria Komunizma" (Dawn of Communism) in [[Shyroke Raion]]. From May 1971 to June 1973 Lazarenko served in the [[Soviet Army]] on the border with [[Afghanistan]]. After that in 1973-1978 he studied at the [[:uk:Дніпропетровський державний аграрний університет|Dnipropetrovsk State Agrarian University]] in Agronomic Department.

==Career==
After graduating Lazarenko received a specialty of [[agronomist]]. From 1978 to 1983 he worked as agronomist, chief agronomist, and head of kolkhoz administration in the Kalinin kolkhoz, [[Novomoskovsk Raion]].

In 1984, Lazarenko was appointed a head of agricultural department of [[Tsarychanka Raion]]. From 1985 to 1987 he worked as a Communist party functionary in Tsarychanka Raion. In 1987-90 Lazarenko worked for the Communist Party of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnipropetrovsk region]] in agricultural production and food industry sectors. In February 1990 he was elected a head of Agro-Industrial Complex of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. In August 1991 Lazarenko was elected as the first deputy of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor office, while he also was appointed a director of the regional department of agriculture.

In March 1992, the [[President of Ukraine]] [[Leonid Kravchuk]] appointed Lazarenko the representative of President of Ukraine in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.&lt;ref name=patriot&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/54842/ Hometown might not vote for Tymoshenko], [[Kyiv Post]] (11 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarenko's candidacy was nominated by the council of working groups conference of the Dnipropetrovsk State Agrarian University whose decision was supported by over 200 groups. [[Leonid Kuchma]] at that time was proposing another candidacy of [[Valeriy Pustovoitenko]]. Lazarenko stayed at the governor position until June 1994. Although he sided with incumbent Kravchuk in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1994|1994 elections]] (June–July), he managed to establish close ties with the election winner, [[Leonid Kuchma]]. Upon recommendation of the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] [[Yevhen Marchuk]], the [[President of Ukraine]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] appointed Pavlo Lazarenko the First Vice Prime Minister (in Energy Affairs)&lt;ref name="rutland_173"&gt;Rutland, 173&lt;/ref&gt; on 5 September 1995. As the government official in energy affairs, he was charged with a task of negotiating gas supplies with [[Russia]] and [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref name="rutland_173"/&gt; Already next year in 1996 Ukraine reported no debts to the Russian [[Gazprom]] (Gas Industries) for the first since its independence.&lt;ref name="rutland_173"/&gt; In 1996 Lazarenko became Doctor of Economic Sciences.

==Prime minister==
On 28 May 1996, Kuchma confirmed Lazarenko as the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] within the powers stipulated by the current "Constitutional Agreement". On 10 July 1996, less than two weeks after adopting a new [[Constitution of Ukraine]], the [[Verkhovna Rada]] approved the appointment of prime-minister. On 16 July 1996 Lazarenko survived an attempt on his life when a bomb exploded near his blocked car en route from [[Kiev]] to [[Boryspil]] airport.&lt;ref&gt;Kolomayets, Marta. "Lazarenko escapes assassination attempt." ''Ukrainian Weekly'', 21 July 1996, [http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1996/299601.shtml (Accessed: 25 August 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

While in charge of the Cabinet, Lazarenko reportedly exercised control over many lucrative business projects and speculatively charged 50 percent of profits for his patronage. At that time, he maintained a close business relationship with [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], then the CEO of ''Yedyni Energosystemy Ukrayiny'' ([[United Energy Systems of Ukraine]]), a monopoly that imported Russian natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uHHWDreGPZsC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Lazarenko+Tymoshenko&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=fiYITaLBB8aSOvyp4a0C&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lazarenko%20Tymoshenko&amp;f=false Annual Survey of Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union 1997: The Challenge of Integration] by [[Peter Rutland]], [[M.E. Sharpe]], 1998, {{ISBN|0765603594}}/{{ISBN|978-0765603593}} (page 174)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lazarenko was involved in a prolonged and bitter struggle for economic domination with the emerging "Donetsk clan" (an industrial group based in [[Donetsk]]). Some Ukrainian media indirectly accused [[Yevhen Shcherban]], the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Ukraine]], of the 1996 assassination attempt on Lazarenko.&lt;ref&gt;"Ukraine Tycoon Shot Dead." ''The New York Times'', 5 November 1996 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3D81238F936A35752C1A960958260 (Accessed:26 August 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, others speculated that Shcherban's murder was a tit-for-tat order by the Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

He may have also plotted against Oleksandr Volkov, a close associate of President Kuchma. Reportedly, Volkov became aware of the planned assassination and made a phone call to Lazarenko threatening appropriate revenge.&lt;ref name="pravda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.pravda.ru/economics/2004/03/02/60874.html |title=Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Lazarenko appeared to be a killer |accessdate=25 April 2007 |date=2 March 2004 |work=[[Pravda]] |language=Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1997, Lazarenko had fallen out of favor with Kuchma, who suspected him of making plans to run for presidency in 1999. Kuchma later regretted Lazarenko's appointment as "my gravest mistake".{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Lazarenko, who had no previous record of serious illness, was unexpectedly hospitalized in late June 1997. It is speculated that he spent the two weeks of the leave for his supposed sickness in vain attempts to mend fences with Kuchma. Technically, under the Ukrainian labor code law, a hospitalized individual may not be terminated from his position. However, when his dismissal became imminent, Lazarenko resigned on 2 July 1997, on his own initiative.

On [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1998|12 May 1998, he was elected to the parliament]] again from the N40 electoral district of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] as part of [[Hromada (political party)|Hromada]] opposition party. In parliament Lazarenko became a leader of the Hromada parliamentary faction. Hromada frequently sided with [[Socialist Party of Ukraine#1998 parliamentary election|the Socialist parliamentary faction]] of [[Oleksandr Moroz]].

==Imprisonments and trials==
Lazarenko was detained in December 1998 on money-laundering charges as he crossed by car from France into [[Switzerland]]. He was released on bail a few weeks later after giving surety of three million dollars. Details of his arrest in Switzerland led to a political scandal in Ukraine as rumours spread about Lazarenko attempting to cross the Swiss border with a [[Panamanian passport]]. The public uproar was in part instigated by President Kuchma's administration, who pressed for Lazarenko's arrest.

The [[Verkhovna Rada]] voted to waive Lazarenko's [[parliamentary immunity]] on 17 February 1999; however, Lazarenko fled the country on the eve of the parliamentary vote. He initially stopped in [[Greece]] but was detained in New York at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]] airport on 20 February 1999, on suspicion of illegally entering the United States. Lazarenko was reported to have a large amount of documents with him, including a Ukrainian diplomatic passport with an outdated U.S. visa, and he requested political asylum. Lazarenko was transferred to a jail in San Francisco, since his family owned a ranch in California. Ukrainian authorities requested his extradition in 2000, after charging him over the 1996 killing of [[Yevhen Shcherban]] and two attempts on the lives of high-ranking officials. The office of the [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]] also claimed that Lazarenko instigated the assassination of [[Vadym Hetman]] in late April 1998.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the United States, Lazarenko was put on trial for [[money-laundering]], corruption, and fraud. Attorney [[Daniel Horowitz]] represented Lazarenko on charges arising out of his operation of the Ukrainian gas business, Doron Weinberg represented him regarding charges of extortion of a business partner. The judge dismissed more than half the charges, but allowed the remaining charges to be presented to the jury for decision. In late May 2004 a federal jury in San Francisco found him guilty of using his position to get rich through a series of business schemes; with [[Transparency International]] naming Lazarenko the eighth most corrupt political leader in recent history that the same year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, Lazarenko stated his intention to return to Ukraine in order to run in the March 2006 [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|parliamentary elections]]; however Lazarenko remained under house arrest at an undisclosed location on $86&amp;nbsp;million bail from June 2004 until August 2006 after being convicted by a twelve-member jury.

Lazarenko was sentenced to 9 years in federal prison on 25 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;" Former Ukraine PM is jailed in US." ''BBC News'', 25 August 2006 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5287870.stm (Accessed: 26 August 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2006 an appeal stemming from Lazarenko's conviction (but not the appeal of the conviction) was heard by a three judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which included former [[Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] sitting [[by designation]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/9th/0610273ap.pdf United States v.

Breyer|Charles Breyer]] cut Lazarenko's sentence from 108 to 97 months in prison on 19 November 2009. The court took into account that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had dismissed approximately half the counts he was convicted of, leaving convictions only for acts committed 17 years previously. In November 2009 [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Ukrainian Interior Minister]] [[Yuriy Lutsenko]] stated that if Lazarenko returns to Ukraine he will be detained as he is on the international wanted list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/24656/ Lazarenko to be detained if he returns to Ukraine, says interior minister], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (12 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Pshonka]] suspected the involvement of Lazarenko (with [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]) in the murder of Donetsk businessman [[Yevhen Shcherban]] and [[Alexander Momot]] in 1996, and the assassination of banker [[Vadym Hetman]] in 1998; Lazarenko has denied involvement in all these cases.&lt;ref name=BBCUkr752012&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ukrainian/politics/2012/04/120407_tymoshenko_momot_ko.shtml Генпрокуратура перевіряє Тимошенко на причетність до ще одного вбивства], [[BBC Ukrainian]] (7 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size of corruption==
According to an official count by the [[United Nations]], approximately $200,000,000 was looted by Lazarenko during 1996–1997 from the government of Ukraine.&lt;ref name=KraUNLaz/&gt;

Lazarenko is reported to have abused his official authority as the Ukrainian Prime Minister to extort nearly 50 percent of businessman Peter Kiritchenko's $60 million in profits.  Lazarenko then ordered him to assist in laundering the proceeds to accounts in Poland, Switzerland, Antigua, and eventually in the United States, where a shell company was used to conceal his property pucrchases. Kiritchenko pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of stolen property and agreed to testify against Lazarenko.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

In 1998, he made unlawful transfers of $2.3 million from one Dugsbery account at WestAmerica Bank, which can be traced back to Mr. Lazarenko’s Lady Lake bank account in the Bahamas, to an account at Bank Boston Robertson Stevens.  Both the funds in this account and those in a  San Francisco EuroFed can be traced back to Lazarenko’s CARPO-53 account, where he deposited funds from the Naukovy fraud and from his extortion of Mr. Kiritchenko's funds.  In total, Lazarenko was found to have laundered over $15 million from his Swiss bank account which ultimately ended up in  Kiritchenko's EuroFed accounts in San Francisco.  A Geneve court in June 2000 tried and convicted in absentia Lazarenko for laundering $6.6 million in illicit proceeds.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Pavel I. Lazarenko| work =Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative| url =https://star.worldbank.org/corruption-cases/node/18662| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140314234939/https://star.worldbank.org/corruption-cases/node/18662| archivedate =14 March 2014| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a special investigative report conducted by [[Kelly Carr]] and [[Brian Grow]], two [[Reuter]]'s journalists, it is stated that Lazarenko "was once ranked the eighth-most corrupt official in the world by watchdog group [[Transparency International]]" and that "Court records submitted in Lazarenko's criminal case and documents from a separate civil lawsuit, as well as interviews with lawyers familiar with the matter, indicate Lazarenko controls a shelf company incorporated in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] that owns an estimated $72&amp;nbsp;million in real estate in Ukraine through other companies".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/06/28/uk-usa-shell-companies-idUKTRE75R4FT20110628 Special Report – A little house of secrets on the Great Plains]''&lt;/ref&gt; That [[shelf company]], a special type of [[shell company]], is named Capital Investments Group.

He acquired majority of his illegal funds through his activities in the gas and energy sector of Ukraine, where he was Energy Minister in the mid-1990s.  He was reported by Radio Free Europe to have been guilty of money  laundering in the United States and has routinely been on Transparency International's lists of most corrupt officials.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web| last =Soldak| first =Katya| title =Out of Prison in California, Former Prime Minister Lazarenko is Not in a Rush to Go to Ukraine| work=Forbes|date=2 November 2012|url =https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2012/11/02/ukraines-prison-prone-prime-ministers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 [[Global Corruption Report]], Lazarenko made it into the list of the World's Most Corrupt Leaders. He was listed eighth and was said to have amassed between $114 million to $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |title=World's Ten Most Corrupt Leaders1 |publisher=Infoplease.com Source: Transparency International Global Corruption Report 2004.|date= |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |date= |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, US authorities confiscated his $6.75 million California mansion in connection with his money laundering conviction from a decade before.  Authorities have also sanctioned the seizure of a [[Pablo Picasso]] lithograph he is rumored to possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =U.S. Seizes Lazarenko's $6M California Mansion| work =Moscow Times| date =5 November 2013| url =http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/us-seizes-lazarenkos-6m-california-mansion/488956.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crown of João VI.png|thumb|right|The [[Crown of João VI]] with the [[Sceptre of the Armillary]]; [[Ajuda National Palace]].]]
The '''Portuguese Crown Jewels''' were the pieces of jewelry, regalia, and vestments worn by the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Monarchs of Portugal]] during the time of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese Monarchy]]. Over the nine centuries of [[Portuguese history]], the Portuguese Crown Jewels have lost and gained many pieces. Most of the current set of the Portuguese Crown Jewels are from the reigns of King [[João VI of Portugal|João VI]] and King [[Luís I of Portugal|Luís I]].

== History ==
[[File:SMF Manoel II.jpg|thumb|left|King [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], wearing the [[Mantle of Luís I]], with the [[Crown of João VI]].]]
[[File:Royal Mantle of João VI.jpg|thumb|The [[Mantle of João VI]].]]
[[File:Mantel of Luís I.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mantle of Luís I]].]]
By the reign of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] (1495–1521), Portugal had already a lavish set of jewels, the king having been one of the most powerful men in the world at the time and having been known to show off.

In early 1581 King [[António I of Portugal|António I]] fled to France after King [[Philip I of Portugal|Philip I]] was made the [[King of Portugal]]. António I took with him the Portuguese Crown Jewels, including many valuable diamonds.&lt;ref name="Brewer2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewer|first=Ebenezer Cobham|title=Character Sketches Of Romance, Fiction And The Drama, Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iyk7ERe8fgC&amp;lpg=PA347|accessdate=1 July 2012|year=1906|publisher=The Minerva Group|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being well received by the French Queen Consort, [[Catherine de' Medici]], he sold her some of the pieces of the Portuguese Crown Jewels in return for [[France]]'s support in his plans to reclaim the throne of Portugal and depose Philip I.

After several failed attempts to reclaim the Portuguese Crown, António I fell into poverty. His poverty led him to sell many of the remaining diamonds. The last and finest diamond of the Portuguese Crown Jewels, the [[Sancy]], would be acquired by [[Nicolas de Harlay, seigneur de Sancy]],&lt;ref name="Harlow1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harlow|first=George E.|title=The Nature of Diamonds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_WI86J88ydAC&amp;lpg=PA107|accessdate=1 July 2012|year=1906|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Maximilien, the diamond would finally go to join the [[French Crown Jewels]].

During the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], [[João IV of Portugal|João II of Braganza]] sold many of the Portuguese Crown Jewels to finance the war with Spain. When João II became King of Portugal as João IV and deposed the [[Philippine Dynasty]] in 1640, he placed his crown with a statue of [[Our Lady of Immaculate Conception]] and said that she was the "true Queen of Portugal". Since then, Portuguese monarchs did not have a [[coronation]] but instead an [[Coronations in Europe#Portugal|acclamation]]. Before the assumption of the Portuguese throne by the Philippine Dynasty, the Kings of Portugal used to be anointed and crowned in the [[Jeronimos Monastery]] in [[Lisbon]].

In 1755 the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great Lisbon earthquake]] destroyed Lisbon and the [[Paço da Ribeira]], the Portuguese royal residence of the time. With the destruction of the palace, innumerable pieces of the Portuguese Crown Jewels of the time were destroyed, lost, or stolen.

While his court was in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[João VI of Portugal|João VI]] had a new set of Portuguese Crown Jewels made. Constructed by the royal jewelers at the workshop of António Gomes da Silva, the set most notably included a new crown and sceptre, among a plethora of jewelry pieces. The pieces from this era are the majority of the current set of jewels.

When [[Maria Pia of Savoy]] became [[List of Portuguese consorts|Queen Consort of Portugal]], King [[Luís I of Portugal|Luís I]] ordered many pieces of jewelry to be made, as it was a passion of his wife. Alongside this, he had a new royal mantle produced.

When the Portuguese Royal Family [[5 October 1910 revolution|was exiled]], many of the jewels were taken with Queen [[Amélie of Orléans]] and Queen Mother [[Maria Pia of Savoy]] on their respective exiles.

In 2002 a large part of the Portuguese Crown Jewels were stolen from the [[Museon]] in [[The Hague]], where they were on loan for an exhibition on European Crown Jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://binnenland.nieuws.nl/50350|title=Museon: Portugese kroonjuwelen grootste verlies|work=Nieuws.nl|date=3 December 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023002618/http://binnenland.nieuws.nl/50350|archivedate=23 October 2012|deadurl=y|accessdate=17 June 2015|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation by the museum and Dutch authorities, the Dutch government paid a sum of six million euros to the Portuguese government for reparation.

The Portuguese Crown Jewels are currently kept in a secured vault at the [[Ajuda National Palace]], in [[Lisbon]]. While the palace is a popular and important museum, the crown jewels are not open to the public. The crown jewels are now only seen at special events concerning them or the palace specifically, a repercussion of the 2002 Hague theft.

== Current Crown Jewels ==

Though the Portuguese Crown Jewels have had a long history, wars, theft, and devastation have reduced the jewels mainly to those produced under the reigns of [[João VI]] and [[Luís I of Portugal|Luís I]]. The current set of crown jewels includes numerous pieces of jewelry, gold, gems, robes, and other regalia, but most notably:

=== Crown of João VI ===
{{Main|Crown of João VI}}
The Crown of João VI is an imperial format crown. A unique feature of the crown is that it is composed only of pure gold and red velvet, without a single precious stone or gem &amp;mdash; an oddity amongst European crowns of the time. The crown was made in 1817 for the acclamation of King [[João VI]]. It was created in the workshop of the Royal Jeweler, Dom António Gomes da Silva, in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

=== Sceptre of the Armillary ===
{{Main|Sceptre of the Armillary}}
The Sceptre of the Armillary is the sceptre that was created for the acclamation of King João VI, in the workshop of the Royal Jeweler, Dom António Gomes da Silva, in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The sceptre bears the symbols of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarve]], Portugal's designation during João VI's [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|stay in Brazil]].

=== Mantle of João VI ===
[[File:Sceptre of the Carta Constituicional.jpg|thumb|right|130px|The [[Sceptre of the Dragon]].]]
{{Main|Mantle of João VI}}
The Mantle of João VI is the royal robe that was fashioned for the acclamation of King João VI. The mantle was fashioned in Portugal, even though João VI's court was in Brazil. The royal robe bears many symbols of the Kingdom of Portugal and was only used by João VI.

=== Sceptre of the Dragon ===
{{Main|Sceptre of the Dragon}}
The Sceptre of the Dragon is the sceptre that was created for the acclamation and use of Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]], in [[London]], [[England]]. The sceptre bears many symbols pertaining to Portugal's new constitution, though Portugal would commence its [[War of the Two Brothers (Portugal)|War of the Two Brothers]] later the year the sceptre was created.

=== Mantle of Luís I ===
{{Main|Mantle of Luís I}}
The Mantle of Luís I is the royal robe that was fashioned for the acclamation of King Luís I. The mantle was fashioned in Portugal and bears many symbols of the Kingdom of Portugal. Though originally made for Luís I, it was used by all the [[monarchs of Portugal]] afterwards.
[[File:Tiara of the Stars.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Diadem of the Stars]].]]

=== Diadem of the Stars ===
{{Main|Diadem of the Stars}}
The Diadem of the Stars is a famous Portuguese diamond tiara. It was commissioned by the Consort of King [[Luís I]], Queen [[Maria Pia of Savoy]]. The tiara is just a piece of a whole set of jewelry, famed for its precious diamonds and sapphires, commissioned by Maria Pia, famous for her love in the arts of fashion and jewelry.

=== Necklace of the Stars ===
[[File:Necklace of the Stars.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Necklace of the Stars]].]]
{{Main|Necklace of the Stars}}
The Necklace of the Stars is a famous diamond necklace. It was commissioned by Queen [[Maria Pia of Savoy]], the Consort of King [[Luís I]]. The necklace is a piece the set of jewelry commissioned by the queen, which includes the famed Diadem of the Stars, the counterpart of the necklace.

== Jewels of the House of Braganza ==
When the [[Portuguese First Republic]] was proclaimed, the Portuguese Royal family went into exile. Only having an extremely short time to pack up and go, the family brought only a fraction of the personal jewels they owned. The jewels that were left and were private possession to the family, not the official crown jewels, were given to [[House of Braganza]] Foundation. Many years after her exile, Queen [[Amélie of Orléans]] sold some of her jewels, such as her famous ruby and diamond tiara to American socialite, Barbara Hutton. The remainder of her jewels were either left to members of her family in France, or to the House of Braganza Foundation.

The current Portuguese Royal Family has a set of jewels that can be divided into two sets. The first set are the jewels that [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]] inherited from his mother, Princess [[Francisca of Orléans-Braganza, Duchess of Braganza|Maria Francisca de Orleães e Bragança]], great-granddaughter of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] and great-great-granddaughter of King [[Pedro IV of Portugal]]. The second set are jewels that are owned by House of Braganza Foundation. These jewels, though not owned by the Duke, are at the disposal of the Duke and [[Isabel, Duchess of Braganza|Duchess]].

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Ethiopia}}
Ethiopia is a source and, to a lesser extent, destination and transit country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. [[Saudi Arabia]] remains the primary destination for irregular migrants; reportedly, over 400,000 Ethiopians reside there. Saudi officials regularly deport Ethiopians in large numbers, and many of the deportees reported instances of [[sexual exploitation]]. Ethiopian women who migrate for work or flee abusive employers in the Middle East are also vulnerable to sex trafficking. An international organization assesses that most traffickers are small local operators, often from the victims’ own communities, but that well-organized crime groups are also responsible for irregular migrants becoming highly susceptible to trafficking. Labor recruiters target young people from Ethiopia’s vast rural areas with promises of a better life. Although reports remain anecdotal, the severe drought in 2015-2016 may have resulted in an increase in internal trafficking. Girls from Ethiopia’s impoverished rural areas are exploited in [[commercial sex]] within the country. [[Addis Ababa]]’s central market is the site of numerous brothels, where some young girls are exploited in commercial sex. Ethiopian girls are exploited in commercial sex in neighbouring African countries, particularly [[Sudan]]. Child sex tourism continues to be a problem in major hubs, including Addis Ababa, [[Bahir Dar]], [[Hawassa]], and [[Bishoftu]]; reports identify mostly Ethiopian-born perpetrators, including members of the [[diaspora]], with known links to local hotels, brokers, and taxi drivers.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271186.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=10 March 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, federal and regional justice officials investigated 1,392 potential trafficking cases and convicted 640 traffickers under the 2015 anti-trafficking law, a significant increase from 69 convictions in 2015.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Ethiopia as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |variants}}

'''Protofeminism''' is a philosophical tradition that anticipates modern [[feminism]] in an era when the concept of feminism was still unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Botting Eileen H, Houser Sarah L. "Drawing the Line of Equality: Hannah Mather Crocker on Women's Rights". ''American Political Science Review'' (2006), 100, pp. 265–278.&lt;/ref&gt; i. e. before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy F. Cott]], 1987. ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen M. Offen, 2000. European Feminisms, 1700–1950: A Political History. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Precise usage is disputed, as [[18th-century feminism]] and [[19th-century feminism]] are subsumed under "feminism". The usefulness of the term ''protofeminist'' has been rejected by some modern scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Margaret. Feminism in time. Modern Language Quarterly 2004 65(1), pp. 7–27&lt;/ref&gt; as has the term [[postfeminism|''postfeminist'']].

==History==
{{see also|History of feminism}}

===Ancient Greece===
[[Plato]], according to Elaine Hoffman Baruch, "[argued] for the total political and sexual equality of women, advocating that they be members of his highest class,&amp;nbsp;... those who rule and fight".&lt;ref&gt;Baruch, Elaine Hoffman, ''Women in Men's Utopias'', in Rohrlich, Ruby, &amp; Elaine Hoffman Baruch, eds., ''Women in Search of Utopia'', ''op. cit.'', p. [209] and see p. 211 (Plato supporting "child care" so women could be soldiers), citing, at p. [209] n. 1, Plato, trans. Francis MacDonald Cornford, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (N.Y.: Oxford Univ. Press, 1973), Book V.&lt;/ref&gt; Book five of [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' discusses the role of women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Are dogs divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? Or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave the females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Republic'' states that women in Plato's ideal state should work alongside men, receive equal education, and share equally in all aspects of the state. The sole exception involved women working in capacities which required less physical strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Plato |others=Translated by Benjamin Jowett |title=The Republic  |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.6.v.html |website=classics.mit.edu |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic world===
{{see also|Islamic feminism|Women in Islam}}

While in the pre-modern period there was no formal feminist movement in Islamic nations, there were a number of important figures who argued for improving women's rights and autonomy. The medieval mystic and philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] argued that while men were favored over women as prophets, women were just as capable of [[Wali|sainthood]] as men.&lt;ref name=Hakim-2002&gt;{{citation |title=Ibn 'Arabî's Twofold Perception of Woman: Woman as Human Being and Cosmic Principle |first=Souad |last=Hakim |journal=Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society |volume=31 |year=2002 |pages=1–29 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 12th century, the [[Sunni]] scholar [[Ibn Asakir]] wrote that women could study and earn ''[[ijazah]]s'' in order to transmit religious texts like the [[hadiths]]. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World |first=James E. |last=Lindsay |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-313-32270-8 |pages=196 &amp; 198 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some men did not approve of this practice, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336), who was appalled by women speaking in loud voices and exposing their ''[[Awrah|'awra]]'' in the presence of men while listening to the recitation of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World |first=James E. |last=Lindsay |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-313-32270-8 |page=198 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, the [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and ''[[qadi]]'' (judge) [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] wrote a commentary on Plato's ''Republic'' in which he examined Plato's views on equality between the sexes. He concluded that while men were stronger than women, it was still possible for women to perform the same duties as men. In his ''Bidayat al-mujtahid'' (The Distinguished Jurist's Primer), he added that these duties could include participation in warfare, and he expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that women in his society were typically limited to being mothers and wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Some Considerations on Averroes' Views Regarding Women and Their Role in Society |last1=Belo |first1=Catarina |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |year=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=6-15 |doi=10.1093/jis/etn061}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of women are said to have participated in or helped direct battles during the [[Muslim conquests]] and [[Fitna (word)|fitnas]], including [[Nusaybah bint Ka'ab]] and [[Aisha]].&lt;ref name="Baghdad"&gt;{{Citation |last=Black |first=Edwin |title=Banking on Baghdad: Inside Iraq's 7,000 Year History of War, Profit, and Conflict |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year= 2004 |isbn=0-471-70895-X |page=34 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
In medieval Europe, the dominant view of women was that they were intellectually and morally weaker than men, tainted by Eve's original sin according to the biblical tradition. This was used as a justification for many restriction placed on women, such as not being allowed to own property or the obligation to obey their fathers or husbands at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/the-middle-ages/articles/women-in-medieval-society |title=Women in medieval society |last=|first= |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this view, along with the restrictions derived from it, raised objections already in medieval times. Protofeminists from the [[Middle Ages]] recognized as important participants in the development of feminism include [[Marie de France]], [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], [[Bettisia Gozzadini]], [[Nicola de la Haye]], [[Christine de Pizan]], [[Jadwiga of Poland]], [[Laura Cereta]], and [[La Malinche]].&lt;ref&gt;Blain, Virginia, et al. ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'' (Yale UP, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women's role in the Peasants' Revolt====
The [[Peasants’ Revolt]] of 1381 was a rebellion of the late [[Middle Ages]] against British serfdom, and many women played prominent roles in it. On June 14, 1381, [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] Simon of Sudbury was dragged from the Tower of London and beheaded. The leader of the group was Johanna Ferrour, who ordered this violent action due to Sudbury's harsh poll taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peasants' Revolt: The Time When Women Took Up Arms |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18373149 |accessdate=8 April 2013}},&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrour also ordered the beheading of the Lord High Treasurer, Sir Robert Hales, for his role in the poll tax.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peasants' Revolt: The Time When Women Took Up Arms |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18373149 |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to leading these rebels, Ferrour burned down the Savoy Palace and stole a duke’s chest of gold. The Chief Justice [[John Cavendish]] was beheaded by Katherine Gamen, another female leader.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

According to an Associate Professor of English at Bates College, Sylvia Federico, women often had the strongest desire to participate in revolts, especially this one in particular. These women did everything that the men did; they were just as violent, if not more, in their actions in order to rebel against the government. Johanna Ferrour was not the only female who was a leader within this revolt; there were quite a few more involved—one woman was indicted for encouraging an attack against a prison at Maidstone in Kent, while another female leader was responsible for the robbing of a multitude of mansions, which frightened servants so much that they did not feel safe enough to return afterwards. Although there were not many female leaders within this rebellion, there was a surprisingly large number of women who were a part of the crowd. For instance, there were seventy female rebels in Suffolk.&lt;ref name="Hogenboom, Melissa 2012"&gt;Hogenboom, Melissa. "Peasants' Revolt: The time when women took up arms." ''BBC News.'' BBC News Magazine, 14 June 2012. Web. 7 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women who were involved in this rebellion had valid reasons for desiring to participate, and in some instances, to take on the role of leader. The poll tax of 1380 was much tougher on married women, so it is not the least bit surprising that women were as violent as men, if not more so, in their involvement in the peasants' revolt. The various extreme acts of violence displayed by them exhibited their mounting hatred towards the government.&lt;ref name="Hogenboom, Melissa 2012"/&gt;

===European Renaissance===
==== Restrictions on women ====
[[File:Christine de Pisan - cathedra.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christine de Pizan]] lecturing to a group of men.]]At the beginning of the renaissance, women's sole role and social value was held to be reproduction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Becoming_Visible.html?id=Ve8pAAAAYAAJ |title=Becoming Visible: Women in European History |last=Bridenthal |first=Renate |last2=Koonz |first2=Claudia |last3=Stuard |first3=Susan Mosher |date=1987-01-01 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year= |isbn=9780395419502 |location= |pages=167 |language=en |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gender role defined a woman's main identity and purpose in life. [[Socrates]], a well-known exemplar of the love of wisdom to the [[Renaissance]] humanists, said that he tolerated his first wife [[Xanthippe]], because she bore him sons, in the same way one tolerated the noise of geese because they produce eggs and chicks.&lt;ref&gt;[Manetti, Giannozzo. "Life of Socrates"]&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy perpetuated the claim that a woman's sole role was reproduction.

Marriage during the [[Renaissance]] defined a woman: she was whom she married. An unmarried woman was the property of her father, and once married, she became the property of her husband. She had few rights, except for privileges granted by her husband or father. Married women were required to obey their husbands and were expected to be chaste, obedient, pleasant, gentle, submissive, and, unless sweet-spoken, silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Becoming_Visible.html?id=Ve8pAAAAYAAJ |title=Becoming Visible: Women in European History |last=Bridenthal |first=Renate |last2=Koonz |first2=Claudia |last3=Stuard |first3=Susan Mosher |date=1987-01-01 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year= |isbn=9780395419502 |location= |pages=159–160 |language=en |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[William Shakespeare]]'s 1593 play, [[The Taming of the Shrew]], Katherina is considered unmarriageable due to her headstrong and outspoken nature, in contrast to her mild-mannered sister Bianca. Katherina is seen as a wayward woman{{spaced ndash}}a shrew{{spaced ndash}}who needs to be tamed into submission. When Petruchio tames her, she readily goes to him when he summons her, almost like a dog. Her submissiveness is applauded, and the crowds at the party accept her as a proper woman since she is now "conformable to other household Kates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ9lAjbtd_YC&amp;dq=The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew&amp;f=false |title=Taming of the shrew |last=Shakespeare |first=William |date=1898-01-01 |publisher=American Book Co. |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that most women were barely educated. In a letter to Lady Baptista Maletesta of Montefeltro in 1424, the humanist [[Leonardo Bruni]] wrote: "While you live in these times when learning has so far decayed that it is regarded as positively miraculous to meet a learned man, let alone a woman."&lt;ref name="Bruni, Leonardo 1494"&gt;[Bruni, Leonardo. "Study of Literature to Lady Baptista Maletesta of Montefeltro," 1494.]&lt;/ref&gt; Bruni himself thought that women had no need of an education because they were not engaged in the social forums in which educated discourse is required. In the same letter he wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;
For why should the subtleties of...a thousand...rhetorical conundra consume the powers of a woman, who never sees the forum? The contests of the forum, like those of warfare and battle, are the sphere of men. Hers is not the task of learning to speak for and against witnesses, for and against torture, for and against reputation.... She will, in a word, leave the rough-and-tumble of the forum entirely to men."&lt;ref name="Bruni, Leonardo 1494"/&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The famous [[Renaissance]] salons that held intelligent debate and lectures were not welcoming to women. This denial of access to public forums led to problems for educated women, and contributed to the unlikelihood that a woman would obtain an education in the first place.

===="Witch literature"====
Starting with the [[Malleus Maleficarum]], Renaissance Europe saw the publication of numerous treatises on witches: their essence, their characteristics, ways to spot, prosecute and punish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Discours Execrable Des Sorciers: Ensemble leur Procez, faits depuis 2. ans en çà, en diuers endroicts de la France. Avec une instruction pour un Juge, en faict de Sorcelerie... |last=Boguet |first=Heneri |publisher= |year=1603 |isbn= |location=Rouen |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Compendium maleficarum |last=Guazzo |first=Francesco |publisher= |year=1608 |isbn= |location=Milan |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped to reinforce and perpetuate the view of women as morally corrupt sinners as well as keep in place the restrictions placed on them.

====Advocating women's education and learning====
However, not everyone agreed with this negative view of women and the restrictions placed on them. [[Simone de Beauvoir]] wrote that "the first time we see a woman take up her pen in defense of her sex" was when [[Christine de Pizan]]  wrote ''Épître au Dieu d'Amour'' (Epistle to the God of Love) and ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'', at the turn of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=de Beauvoir, Simone |first=English translation 1953 |title=The Second Sex |pages=105 |year=1989 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0-679-72451-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early male advocate of women's superiority was [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] wrote ''The Superior Excellence of Women Over Men''.&lt;ref name="Schneir-1994"&gt;{{Citation |author=Schneir, Miram |first=1972 |title=Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings |page=xiv |year=1994 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0-679-75381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catherine of Aragon]], the first official female ambassador in European history, commissioned a book by [[Juan Luis Vives]] arguing that women had a right to an education, and encouraged and popularized education for women in England during her time as Henry VIII's wife.

[[Joan Lluís Vives|Vives]] and fellow [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] [[Rodolphus Agricola|Agricola]] argued that aristocratic women at least required education. [[Roger Ascham]] educated [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], who read Latin and Greek and wrote [[occasional poems]], such as ''[[On Monsieur's Departure]]'', that are still anthologized. Elizabeth I was described as having talent without a woman's weakness, industry with a man's perseverance, and the body of a weak and feeble woman, but with the heart and stomach of a king.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The only way she could be seen as a good ruler was for her to be described with manly qualities. Being a powerful and successful woman during the [[Renaissance]], like [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] meant in some ways being male, a perception that gravely limited women's potential as women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While women of the aristocracy had greater chances of receiving an education, it was not impossible for lower-class women to become literate. A woman named Margherita, living during the [[Renaissance]], learned to read and write at the age of about 30, so there would be no mediator for the letters exchanged between her and her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Becoming_Visible.html?id=Ve8pAAAAYAAJ |title=Becoming Visible: Women in European History |last=Bridenthal |first=Renate |last2=Koonz |first2=Claudia |last3=Stuard |first3=Susan Mosher |date=1987-01-01 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year= |isbn=9780395419502 |location= |pages=160 |language=en |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Margherita did defy [[gender role]]s, she became literate not in order to become a more enlightened person, but because she wanted to be a better wife by gaining the ability to communicate with her husband directly. 

====Learned women of Early Modern Europe====
Women who did receive an education often achieved high standards of learning and wrote in defence of women and their rights. One example is the 16th century [[Venice, Italy|Venetian]] author [[Moderata Fonte|Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi]], who wrote about the superiority of women.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Anna Garlin and Mitchell Kennerly, eds. ''The Drama of a Woman of Genius''. NY: Forum Publications, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] (c. 1532-1625) was born into an enlightened family in [[Cremona]]. She and her sisters were educated to male standards, and four out of five sisters became professional painters. Sofonisba was the most successful of all, crowning her career as court painter to the Spanish king [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].

====The Reformation====
The [[Reformation]] was an important milestone for the development of women's rights and education. As the protestant faith was based on each believer's direct interaction with God, the ability to read the [[Bible]] and prayer books suddenly became a necessity for everybody, including women and girls. Therefore, protestant communities started to set up schools where ordinary boys and girls were taught basic literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/the-protestant-education-in-the-xvith-century/ |title=The protestant education in the 16th century |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Protestantism]] no longer saw women as weak and evil sinners; rather, women were worthy companions of men and should be educated in order to become capable wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://faithmatters.us/women-in-the-protestant-reform/ |title=Women in the Protestant reform |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventeenth century===
====Nonconformism, protectorate and restoration====
[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645), the last love of [[Michel de Montaigne]], edited the third edition of Montaigne's ''[[Essays (book)|Essays]]'' after his death. She also wrote two feminist essays, ''The Equality of Men and Women'' (1622) and ''The Ladies' Grievance'' (1626). In 1673, [[François Poullain de la Barre]] wrote ''De l'égalité des deux sexes'' (On the equality of the two sexes).&lt;ref name=Schneir-1994 /&gt;

The 17th century saw the development of many [[nonconformist]] sects, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], which allowed more freedom of expression to women than the established religions. Noted feminist writers on religion and spirituality included [[Rachel Speght]], Katherine Evans, Sarah Chevers, [[Margaret Fell]] (a founding member of the Quakers), and [[Sarah Blackborow]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonia Fraser|Fraser, Antonia]]. The weaker vessel: Women's lot in seventeenth century England. Phoenix, London 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall-Wyatt, Sherrin. Women in the Reformation era. In, Becoming visible: Women in European history, Renate Bridenthal and [[Claudia Koonz]] (eds.) Houghton-Mifflin, Boston 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, K. Women and the Civil War sects. 1958 Past and Present 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency continued in the prominence of some female ministers and writers such as [[Mary Mollineux]] and [[Barbara Blaugdone]] in the early decades of Quakerism.&lt;ref&gt;''Persecution and Pluralism: Calvinists and Religious Minorities in Early....''  By Richard Bonney, David J. B. Trim. [https://books.google.hu/books?id=jQJuObBQerIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Persecution+and+Pluralism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=afmGVanxD4roywPwpIrwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Persecution%20and%20Pluralism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, though, women who preached or expressed opinions on religion were in danger of being suspected of lunacy or witchcraft, and many, like [[Anne Askew]], who was burned at the stake for heresy,&lt;ref name="lerner"&gt;[http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/articles/lerner.html Lerner, Gerda. "Religion and the creation of feminist consciousness". Harvard Divinity Bulletin November 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506000541/http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/articles/lerner.html |date=2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; died "for their implicit or explicit challenge to the patriarchal order".&lt;ref&gt;Moses, Claire Goldberg. ''French Feminism in the 19th Century''. 1984, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Persecution of witches.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Burning of witches]]]] In France and England, feminist ideas were attributes of [[heterodoxy]], such as the [[Waldensians]] and [[Catharism|Catharists]], rather than orthodoxy. Religious egalitarianism, such as that embraced by the [[Levellers]], carried over into gender equality, and therefore had political implications. Leveller women mounted large-scale public demonstrations and petitions for equal rights, although dismissed by the authorities of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofwomen.org/politicalpre1850.html/ |title=British Women's Emancipation Since the Renaissance |accessdate=7 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426092251/http://www.historyofwomen.org/politicalpre1850.html |archivedate=26 April 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th century also saw more women writers emerging, such as [[Anne Bradstreet]], [[Bathsua Makin]], [[Margaret Cavendish]], Duchess of Newcastle, Lady [[Mary Wroth]],&lt;ref&gt;The poems of Lady Mary Roth. Roberts, Josephine A (ed.) Louisiana State University 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Germaine Greer|Greer, Germaine]]. Slip-shod sybils Penguin 1999, at 15-6&lt;/ref&gt;, the anonymous [[Eugenia (Lady of Quality)|Eugenia]], [[Mary Chudleigh]], and [[Mary Astell]], who depicted women's changing roles and made pleas for their education. However, they encountered considerable hostility, as exemplified by the experiences of Cavendish, and Wroth whose work was not published till the 20th century.

Seventeenth-century France also saw the rise of [[salon (gathering)|salon]]s, cultural gathering places of the upper-class intelligentsia, which were run by women and in which they participated as artists.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Claire Moses. ''French Feminism in the 19th Century''. Syracuse: State University of New York, 1985, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; But while women were granted salon membership, they stayed in the background, writing "but not for [publication]".&lt;ref&gt;Bodek, Evelyn Gordon. "Salonieres and Bluestockings: Educated Obsolescence and Germinating Feminism." ''Feminist Studies'' 3 (Spring-Summer 1976), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the limited role played by women in the salons, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] thought them a "threat to the 'natural' dominance of men".&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Claire Moses, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Astell is frequently described as the first feminist writer. However, this depiction fails to recognise the intellectual debt she owed to [[Anna Maria van Schurman]], [[Bathsua Makin]] and other women who preceded her. She was certainly one of the earliest feminist writers in English, whose analyses are as relevant today as in her own time, and moved beyond earlier writers by instituting educational institutions for women.&lt;ref name="kinnaird"&gt;Kinnaird, Joan. "Mary Astell: Inspired by ideas" in D.Spender, ed., ''Feminist Theories'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Astell and [[Aphra Behn]] together laid the groundwork for feminist theory in the seventeenth century. No woman would speak out as strongly again for another century. In historical accounts, Astell is often overshadowed by her younger and more colourful friend and correspondent [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].

The liberalization of social values and secularization of the [[English Restoration]] provided new opportunities for women in the arts, an opportunity that women used to advance their cause. However, female playwrights encountered similar hostility. These included [[Catherine Trotter Cockburn|Catherine Trotter]], Mary Manley and [[Mary Pix]]. The most influential of all&lt;ref name="walters"&gt;Walters, Margaret. "Feminism: A very short introduction". Oxford University 2005 ({{ISBN|0-19-280510-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goreau, Angeline. Aphra Behn: A scandal to modesty (c. 1640-1689) in Spender op. cit., pp. 8-27,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Woolf|Woolf, Virginia]]. A room of one's own. 1928, at 65.&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Aphra Behn]], the first Englishwoman to achieve the status of a professional writer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Todd]]. ''The Secret Life of Aphra Behn''. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 1997, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a novelist, playwright, and political propagandist.&lt;ref name="Janet Todd, p. 2"&gt;Janet Todd, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although successful during her lifetime, Behn was often vilified as "unwomanly" by 18th-century writers like [[Henry Fielding]] and [[Samuel Richardson]].&lt;ref name="Janet Todd, p. 2"/&gt; Likewise, the 19th-century critic Julia Kavanagh said that "instead of raising man to woman's moral standards [Behn] sank to the level of man's courseness".&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, Julia. ''English Women of Letters''. (London, 1863), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, Behn gained a wider readership and critical acceptance. [[Virginia Woolf]] praised her career and wrote, "All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the grave of Aphra Behn...for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds".&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia. ''A Room of One's Own''. NY: Penguin Books, 1989, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[continental Europe]], important feminist writers included [[Marguerite de Navarre]], [[Marie de Gournay]], and [[Anna Maria van Schurman]], who mounted attacks on misogyny and promoted the education of women. In [[Switzerland]], the first printed publication by a woman appeared in 1694: in ''Glaubens-Rechenschafft'', [[Hortensia von Moos]] argued against the precept that women should stay silent. The previous year, 1693, saw the publication of an anonymous tract entitled ''Rose der Freyheit'' (Rose of Freedom). In it, the author denounces male dominance and abuse of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Färber |first=Silvio |date=2011 |title="Die Rose der Freyheit": eine radikal-feministische Streitschrift von "Camilla" aus dem Jahre 1693 |url=https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?pid=jgr-003:2011:141::90#90 |journal=Jahrbuch der Historischen Gesellschaft Graubünden |volume= |pages=85-174 |via=e-periodica.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New World, the Mexican [[nun]], [[Juana Ines de la Cruz]] (1651–1695), advanced the education of women particularly in her essay "Reply to Sor Philotea."&lt;ref&gt;Juana Inés de la Cruz, Sor. Respuesta a Sor Filotea 1691. pub posthum. Madrid 1700&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the seventeenth century women's voices were becoming increasingly heard at least by educated women. The literature of the last decades of the century was sometimes referred to as the "Battle of the Sexes",&lt;ref&gt;Upman AH. "English femmes savantes at the end of the seventeenth century". ''Journal of English and Germanic Philology'' 12 (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; and was often surprisingly polemic, such as [[Hannah Woolley]]'s  "The Gentlewoman's Companion."&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, Hannah. ''The Gentlewoman's Companion''. London, 1675.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, women received mixed messages, for they also heard a strident backlash, and even self-deprecation by women writers in response.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} They were also subjected to conflicting social pressures, one of which was fewer opportunities for work outside the home, and education which sometimes reinforced the social order as much as inspired independent thinking.

==Notes==
[[New Year's Day]], [[Easter]], [[Labor Day]], [[Independence Day]], [[All Saints' Day]] and [[Christmas Day]] are widely recognized and celebrated holidays. The other holidays listed are officially recognized by the [[government]]'s [[Department of Labor (Congo)|Department of Labor]] (Direction Départementale du Travail) and are granted to government workers; the government requires that [[business]]es operating in the country also recognize them, though [[employee]]s, if even familiar with them, tend to prefer working as usual (with government-mandated overtime wages) on those days.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1518">'''Queens' Binder''' (or '''Queen's Binder''') is the name given to a small group of English [[Bookbinding|bookbinders]] active during the [[The Restoration|Restoration period]] (1660&amp;ndash;c.1700), often called the "Golden Age of English Bookbinding".

==Etymology==
The name derives from the fact that similar bookbindings were found in the libraries of both [[Catherine of Braganza]] and [[Mary of Modena]]. The term was first coined by [[G. D. Hobson]] in his book ''Bindings in Cambridge Libraries''&lt;ref&gt;*Hobson, G. D. ''Bindings in Cambridge Libraries''. Cambridge University Press, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a convenient term to refer to the characteristic drawer-handle tools and [[volute]]s with [[pointillé]] outlines rather than floral volutes much used by the other binders of the period.

==Subtypes==
[[H. M. Nixon]] subdivided the bindings into three groups, Queens' Binder A, B, and C, due to the slight variations between them.&lt;ref&gt;*Nixon, H. M. ''English Restoration Bookbindings: Samuel Mearne and His Contemporaries''. British Museum Publication, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Queens' Binder A is the most prolific of the three, but Queens' Binder B is considered the finer [[artisan]]. Although the bookbinders have not all been definitively identified, there is strong grounds for considering [[Samuel Mearne|Samuel]] &amp; [[Charles Mearne]], [[Roger Bartlett]], and [[William Nott (bookbinder)|William Nott]] as being at least partially responsible.

The main religion traditionally practiced in [[Latvia]] is [[Christianity]]. {{As of|2011}}, it is the largest religion (80%),&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt; though only about 7% of the population attends religious services regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/trust.in.religious.institutions.does.not.convey.to.church.attendance/1462.htm|title=Trust in Religious Institutions does not convey to Church Attendance|publisher=Christian Today|date=23 September 2004|accessdate=28 July 2007|author=Eunice K. Y. Or}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheranism]] is the main [[Christian denomination]] among ethnic [[Latvians]] due to strong historical links with the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Northern Germany]] (see [[Hanseatic League]]), while [[Catholicism]] is most prevalent in Eastern Latvia ([[Latgale]]), mostly due to [[Poland|Polish]] influence. The [[Latvian Orthodox Church]] is the third largest Christian church in Latvia, with adherents primarily among the [[Russians in Latvia|Russian-speaking minority]].

== History==
[[File:St. Peter's Church.JPG|thumb|right|[[St. Peter's Church, Riga]]]]
Latvia was one of the last regions in Europe to be [[Christianized]]. The inhabitants of the region that is now Latvia once practiced [[Finnic paganism]] and [[Baltic mythology]], but this practice gradually diminished through the course of the centuries. In the 12th to 13th centuries Latvia first fell under the influence of the Catholic Church, as the Christian kings of [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and the North German [[Livonian Order|Livonian]] and [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic military orders]] fought for influence in the region in what later became known as the [[Northern Crusades]].

Parts of Eastern Latvia (notably the [[Principality of Koknese|Koknese]] and [[Principality of Jersika|Jersika principalities]]) shortly came under the influence of the [[Viking]] rulers of the [[Rurik dynasty]], who had adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] as early as the 12th century. After succumbing to the Livonian Order in the 13th century, the influence of the Orthodox Church faded away until the [[History of Latvia#Russian period (1721-1918)|19th century]].

Despite the Christianization, the local populace in the countryside maintained their pagan belief system for several centuries, with pockets of paganism surviving in Latvia up until the 17th century. Along with the rest of the traditional holidays, Christmas ([[Ziemassvētki]]) and Easter ([[Lieldienas]]) in Latvia still largely retain their pagan roots.

During the [[Protestant Reformation]] the teachings of Lutheranism from northern Germany and Scandinavia completely changed the religious landscape in the country, and eventually only Latgale remained Catholic due to the influence of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Before [[World War II]], 2/3 of Latvia was [[Protestant]]; overwhelmingly [[Lutheran]] with scarce [[Calvinist]] population and individual cases of adhering to other Protestant confessions.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Global Religion by Mark Juergensmeyer, Wade Clark Roof; page 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;State Responses to Minority Religions by Dr David M Kirkham, p. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century by Richard Crampton, Benjamin Crampton; p. 90; "Inter-war Latvia: Religious composition"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[State atheism|state policy of atheism]] during the Soviet era and the general European trend of secularization, religiosity declined drastically, and today a growing percentage of Latvians claims [[Irreligion|not to follow any religion]], with low [[church attendance]].

== Religion in Latvia today ==

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia]] has 708,773 members.&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/labumi/TM.docx|title=Tieslietu ministrijā iesniegtie reliģisko organizāciju pārskati par darbību 2011. gadā|language=Latvian|accessdate=2012-07-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126013327/http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/labumi/TM.docx|archivedate=2012-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church in Latvia]] has 430,000 members.&lt;ref name="Religiju Enciklopedija"&gt;''Reliģiju Enciklopēdija'', [http://www.bibelesbiedriba.lv/religiju-enciklopedija/statistika.html Statistika] (in Latvian). Accessed 2009-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the west and central parts of the country have been predominantly Protestant, while the east – particularly the [[Latgale]] region – has been predominantly Catholic, although Catholics are now common in Riga and other cities due to migration from Latgale.&lt;ref name="latinst"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Valters |last=Ščerbinskis |year=1999 |title=Eastern Minorities |publisher=The Latvian Institute |url=http://www.li.lv/index.php?Itemid=471&amp;id=102&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Lutherans were the majority, but Communist rule weakened Lutheranism much more than Catholicism, with the result that there are now only slightly more Lutherans than Catholics. The [[Latvian Orthodox Church]] is semi-autonomous and has 370,000 members.&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt; Orthodoxy predominates among the [[Latvian Russian]] population.

{{As of|2011}}, the population of [[Jews in Latvia]] was 416;&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt; and there were several hundred [[Muslims in Latvia]].&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt; A modern neopagan movement is [[Dievturība]].

The [[Reformed Church in Latvia]] is a small Reformed denomination with two congregations in [[Riga]].

As of 2011, the Justice Ministry had registered 1145 congregations.&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt; This total included: Lutheran (294), Catholic (250), Orthodox (122), Baptist (94), Old Believer Orthodox (69), Pentecostal (52),  Seventh-day Adventist (51), Evangelical (39), New Generation (18), Muslim (17), Jehovah's Witnesses (15), Jewish (13), Methodist (12), New Apostolic (11), Hare Krishna (11), Dievturi (10), Buddhist (4), Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) (4), and 18 other congregations. In 2003, the Government also registered the Christian Scientists as a recognized religious congregation.

In 2011, churches in Latvia provided the following estimates of church membership to the Justice Ministry:&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt;

==Hinduism in Latvia==
Hinduism is a minority religion in [[Latvia]]. As of 2011, there were 190 Hindus in Latvia. As of 2011, the Justice Ministry had registered 11 [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] and two other Hindu congregations in Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20121126013327/http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/labumi/TM.docx&lt;/ref&gt;

Brahma Kumaris have three centres in Latvia: in [[Riga]], [[Daugavpils]], and [[Rēzekne]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bkwsu.org//whereweare/center&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nath]] traditions also exist in Latvia. [[Gorakhnath]] mandir was established in 2011. Masters of Nath tradition go there to hold public [[satsang]]s and educational programmes. The Hindu festivals ([[Shivaratri]], [[Navaratri]], etc) are celebrated in the mandir as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://heyevent.com/venue/olknkjetqzimca&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Dutch Touring Club'''  (Dutch, '''''Algemene Nederlandse Wielrijdersbond''''' or '''ANWB''') is a travelers' association in the [[Netherlands]], supporting all modes of travel.  It's responsible for [[traffic sign]]s and signage on roads and trails. It also offers test reports, travel services and [[roadside assistance]], comparable to the German [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club|ADFC]] / [[ADAC]].

ANWB has over four million members, and is the largest nonprofit association in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt; {{citation|title=The nonprofit sector in the Netherlands|author1=Ary Burger |author2=Paul Dekker |location= Den Haag|work=Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project|publisher=Netherlands Institute for Social Research — Social and Cultural Planning Office|date=April 2001 |page=62 |url= http://www.scp.nl/english/dsresource?objectid=22125|accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ANWB was formed July 1, 1883 as ''Nederlandsche Vélocipèdisten-Bond'' (Dutch bicyclists' club) and renamed two years later. In 1905 the name ''Koninklijke Nederlandse Toeristenbond'' (Royal Dutch Tourist Club) was adopted. 

In the 20th century, the association expanded to include motorists, hikers, [[Equestrianism|equestrian]]s, [[Motorcycling|motorcyclists]], as well as participants in [[water sports]], [[winter sport]]s and [[camping]].

'''Self-assembly''' is a process in which a disordered system of pre-existing components forms an organized structure or pattern as a consequence of specific, local interactions among the components themselves, without external direction. When the constitutive components are molecules, the process is termed [[molecular self-assembly]].

[[File:Molecular self-assembly.gif|255px|thumb|right|NC-AFM imaging of the molecular self-assembly process of 2-aminoterephthalic acid molecules on calcite(104).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Kling |first=Felix |date=2016 |title=Diffusion and structure formation of molecules on calcite(104) |publisher=Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz |url=https://publications.ub.uni-mainz.de/theses/frontdoor.php?source_opus=100002180&amp;la=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Self-assembly can be classified as either static or dynamic. In ''static'' self-assembly, the ordered state forms as a system approaches [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], reducing its [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].  However, in ''dynamic'' self-assembly, patterns of pre-existing components organized by specific local interactions are not commonly described as "self-assembled" by scientists in the associated disciplines. These structures are better described as "[[self-organization|self-organized]]", although these terms are often used interchangeably.

== Self-assembly in chemistry and materials science ==
[[File:DNA nanostructures.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[DNA]] structure at left ([[schematic]] shown) will self-assemble into the structure visualized by [[Atomic force microscope|atomic force microscopy]] at right. Image from Strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strong, M. |journal=[[PLoS Biology|PLoS Biol.]]|title=Protein Nanomachines|volume=2|issue=3|year=2004|pages=e73–e74|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020073|pmid=15024422|pmc=368168}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Self-assembly (SA) in the classic sense can be defined as ''the spontaneous and [[Reversible reaction|reversible]] organization of molecular units into ordered structures by non-[[covalent]] interactions''. The first property of a self-assembled system that this definition suggests is the [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|spontaneity]] of the self-assembly process: the interactions responsible for the formation of the self-assembled system act on a strictly local level—in other words, ''the [[nanostructure]] builds itself''.

Self-assembled nano-structure is an object that appears as a result of ordering and aggregation of individual nano-scale objects guided by some [[physics|physical]] principle.

Self-assembled [[nanostructure]] arises in the strong non-equilibrium conditions. The most famous example of self-assembly [[phenomenon]] is the occurrence of the life on Earth. It is plausible to hypothesize that it happens because the sun generates a strong temperate [[gradient]] in its environment. This general idea has been confirmed in the experiment of self-assembly of [[carbon nanotubes]].

Another interesting example of self-assembly is the phenomenon of electrostatic trapping. In this case an [[electric field]] is applied between two metallic nano-electrodes. The particles present in the environment are polarized by the applied electric field. Due to dipole interaction with the electric field gradient the particles are attracted to the gap between the electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bezryadin|first1=A.|last2=Westervelt|first2=R.|last3=Tinkham|first3=M|title=Self-assembled chains of graphitized carbon nanoparticles|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=1999|doi=10.1063/1.123941|volume=74|pages=2699–2701|arxiv=cond-mat/9810235|bibcode=1999ApPhL..74.2699B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabricating a [[crystal]] by placing atom after atom is not realistic. However self-assembly of crystals works well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=C.|last2=Hubler|first2=A.|title=Stability and conductivity of self assembled wires in a transverse electric field|journal=Scientific Reports |date=2015|doi=10.1038/srep15044|volume=5|page=15044|bibcode=2015NatSR...515044S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly fabricating a 3D nano-structure is not realistic as well. Self-assembly of 3D nano-structure becomes an easy and inexpensive way to fabricate them.

=== Distinctive features ===
At this point, one may argue that any chemical reaction driving atoms and molecules to assemble into larger structures, such as [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], could fall into the category of SA. However, there are at least three distinctive features that make SA a distinct concept.

==== Order ====
First, the self-assembled structure must have a higher [[Order (crystal lattice)|order]] than the isolated components, be it a shape or a particular task that the self-assembled entity may perform. This is generally not true in [[chemical reaction]]s, where an ordered state may proceed towards a disordered state depending on thermodynamic parameters.

==== Interactions ====
The second important aspect of SA is the key role of slack interactions (e.g. [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]], [[capillary action|capillary]], [[Pi-pi interaction|&lt;math&gt;\pi-\pi&lt;/math&gt;]], [[hydrogen bond]]s) with respect to more "traditional" covalent, [[ionic bond|ionic]], or [[metallic bond]]s. Although typically less energetic by a factor of 10, these weak interactions play an important role in materials synthesis. It can be instructive to note how slack interactions hold a prominent place in materials, especially in biological systems, although they are often considered marginal with respect to "strong" (i.e. covalent, etc.) interactions. For instance, they determine the physical properties of liquids, the [[solubility]] of solids, and the organization of molecules in biological membranes.

==== Building blocks ====
The third distinctive feature of SA is that the building blocks are not only atoms and molecules, but span a wide range of nano- and [[mesoscopic]] structures, with different chemical compositions, shapes and functionalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1202.2177|title=Structural Diversity and the Role of Particle Shape and Dense Fluid Behavior in Assemblies of Hard Polyhedra |last1= Damasceno |first1=Pablo F. |last2=Engel |first2=Michael |last3= Glotzer |first3=Sharon C. |class=cond-mat.soft |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Anchor|shapes2016-01-29}}Research into possible three-dimensional shapes of self-assembling micrites examines [[Platonic solids]] (regular polyhedral).

These nanoscale building blocks (NBBs) can in turn be synthesised through conventional chemical routes or by other SA strategies such as [[Entropic force#Directional Entropic Force|Directional Entropic Forces]].

=== Examples ===
Important examples of SA in materials science include the formation of molecular [[crystal]]s, [[colloid]]s, [[lipid bilayer]]s, [[phase-separated polymer]]s, and [[self-assembled monolayer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Whitesides, G.M. |author2=Boncheva, M. |title=Beyond molecules: Self-assembly of mesoscopic and macroscopic components|journal= PNAS |year=2002|volume= 99|doi=10.1073/pnas.082065899|pmid=11959929|issue=8|pmc=122665|pages=4769–74|bibcode=2002PNAS...99.4769W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitesides_2005_science"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|journal=Science Progress|volume=88|pages=17–48|author1=Whitesides, George M. |author2=Kriebel, Jennah K. |author3=Love, J.

Chen et al. demonstrated a microscale self-assembly method using the air-liquid interface established by [[Faraday wave]] as a template. This self-assembly method can be used for generation of diverse sets of symmetrical and periodic patterns from microscale materials such as [[hydrogels]], cells, and cell spheroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Pu|last2=Luo|first2=Zhengyuan|last3=Güven|first3=Sinan|last4=Tasoglu|first4=Savas|last5=Ganesan|first5=Adarsh Venkataraman|last6=Weng|first6=Andrew|last7=Demirci|first7=Utkan|title=Microscale Assembly Directed by Liquid-Based Template|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=26|issue=34|year=2014|pages=5936–5941|pmid=24956442|doi=10.1002/adma.201402079|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263393317_Microscale_Assembly_Directed_by_Liquid-Based_Template|pmc=4159433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Properties ===
SA extends the scope of chemistry aiming at [[chemical synthesis|synthesising]] products with order and functionality properties, extending chemical bonds to weak interactions and encompassing the self-assembly of NBBs on all length scales.&lt;ref name="ozin_2005_nanochemistry"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ozin, Geoffrey A. |author2=Arsenault, André C. |title=Nanochemistry: a chemical approach to nanomaterials|publisher=Cambridge: Royal Society of Chemistry|year= 2005|isbn=0-85404-664-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In covalent synthesis and polymerisation, the scientist links atoms together in any desired conformation, which does not necessarily have to be the energetically most favoured position; self-assembling molecules, on the other hand, adopt a structure at the thermodynamic minimum, finding the best combination of interactions between subunits but not forming covalent bonds between them. In self-assembling structures, the scientist must predict this minimum, not merely place the atoms in the location desired.

Another characteristic common to nearly all self-assembled systems is their [[thermodynamic stability]]. For SA to take place without intervention of external forces, the process must lead to a lower [[Gibbs free energy]], thus self-assembled structures are thermodynamically more stable than the single, unassembled components. A direct consequence is the general tendency of self-assembled structures to be relatively free of defects. An example is the formation of two-dimensional [[superlattice]]s composed of an orderly arrangement of micrometre-sized [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) spheres, starting from a solution containing the microspheres, in which the solvent is allowed to evaporate slowly in suitable conditions. In this case, the driving force is capillary interaction, which originates from the deformation of the surface of a liquid caused by the presence of floating or submerged particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/la00048a054|title=Mechanism of formation of two-dimensional crystals from latex particles on substrates|year=1992|author=Denkov, N.|journal=Langmuir|volume=8|pages=3183–3190|last2=Velev|first2=O.|last3=Kralchevski|first3=P.|last4=Ivanov|first4=I.|last5=Yoshimura|first5=H.|last6=Nagayama|first6=K.|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two properties—weak interactions and thermodynamic stability—can be recalled to rationalise another property often found in self-assembled systems: the ''sensitivity to perturbations'' exerted by the external environment. These are small fluctuations that alter thermodynamic variables that might lead to marked changes in the structure and even compromise it, either during or after SA. The weak nature of interactions is responsible for the flexibility of the architecture and allows for rearrangements of the structure in the direction determined by thermodynamics. If fluctuations bring the thermodynamic variables back to the starting condition, the structure is likely to go back to its initial configuration. This leads us to identify one more property of SA, which is generally not observed in materials synthesised by other techniques: ''reversibility''.

SA is a process which is easily influenced by external parameters. This can make synthesis more problematic due to the many free parameters that require control. On the other hand, self assembly has the exciting advantage that a large variety of shapes and functions on many length scales can be obtained.&lt;ref name=for&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1071063|date=Mar 2002|author=Lehn, Jm|title=Toward self-organization and complex matter|volume=295|issue=5564|pages=2400–3|pmid=11923524|journal=Science|bibcode=2002Sci...295.2400L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the fundamental condition needed for NBBs to self-assemble into an ordered structure is the simultaneous presence of long-range repulsive and short-range attractive forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020201)41:3&lt;457::AID-ANIE457&gt;3.0.CO;2-W|title=Open-Framework Nickel Succinate, [Ni&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]⋅2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O: A New Hybrid Material with Three-Dimensional Ni−O−Ni Connectivity|year=2002|author=Forster, Paul M.|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=41|pages=457–459|last2=Cheetham|first2=Anthony K.|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By choosing [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] with suitable physicochemical properties, it is possible to exert a fine control on the formation processes that produce complex structures. Clearly, the most important tool when it comes to designing a synthesis strategy for a material, is the knowledge of the chemistry of the building units. For example, it was demonstrated that it was possible to use [[block copolymer|diblock copolymers]] with different block reactivities in order to selectively embed [[maghemite]] nanoparticles and generate periodic materials with potential use as [[waveguides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gazit|first1=Oz|last2=Khalfin|first2=Rafail|last3=Cohen|first3=Yachin|last4=Tannenbaum|first4=Rina|title=Self-Assembled Diblock Copolymer "Nanoreactors" as "Catalysts" for Metal Nanoparticle Synthesis|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry C|volume=113|issue=2|year=2009|pages=576–583|doi=10.1021/jp807668h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''[[Advances in Colloid and Interface Science]]'' published a study in which it was concluded that every self-assembly process in reality presents a co-assembly, which makes the former term a misnomer of a kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uskoković|first1=Vuk|title=Isn't self-assembly a misnomer? Multi-disciplinary arguments in favor of co-assembly|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=141|issue=1–2|year=2008|pages=37–47|pmid=18406396|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2008.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis is built on the concept of mutual ordering of the self-assembling system and its environment.

== Self-assembly at the macroscopic scale ==
Self-assembly processes can be observed in systems of macroscopic building blocks. These building blocks can be externally propelled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/artl.1994.1.413|title=Dynamics of self-assembling systems: Analogy with chemical kinetics|year=1994|author=Hosokawa K.|journal=Artificial Life|volume=1|pages=413–427|last2=Shimoyama|first2=I.|last3=Miura|first3=H.|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or self-propelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TRO.2006.882919|title=Autonomous self-assembly in swarm-bots|first4=Marco|last4=Dorigo|year=2006|first3=Francesco|author=Groß R.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Robotics|last3=Mondada|volume=22|pages=1115–1130|last2=Dorigo|first2=M.|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, scientists have built self-assembly systems exhibiting centimeter-sized components ranging from passive mechanical parts to mobile robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2008.927352|title=Self-assembly at the macroscopic scale|year=2008|author=Groß R.|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=96|pages=1490–1508|last2=Dorigo|first2=M.|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For systems at this scale, the component design can be precisely controlled. For some systems, the components' interaction preferences are programmable. The self-assembly processes can be easily monitored and analyzed by the components themselves or by external observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Topological properties of a self-assembled electrical network via ab initio calculation|journal=Sci.

In April 2014, Skylar Tibbits of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, demonstrated a combination of [[3D printing|3D printed]] plastic with a "smart material" that self-assembles in water.&lt;ref&gt;D’Monte, Leslie (7 May 2014)

== Consistent concepts of self-organization and self-assembly ==
People regularly use the terms "[[self-organization]]" and "self-assembly" interchangeably.  As [[complex systems|complex system]] science becomes more popular though, there is a higher need to clearly distinguish the differences between the two mechanisms to understand their significance in physical and biological systems.  Both processes explain how collective order develops from "dynamic small-scale interactions", according to an article in a November/December 2008 issue of the journal [[Complexity (journal)|''Complexity'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Halley, J. D. |author2= Winkler, D.A. |year=2008|title=Consistent Concepts of Self-organization and Self-assembly|doi=10.1002/cplx.20235|journal=Complexity|volume=14|pages=10–17|issue=2|bibcode=2008Cmplx..14b..10H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-organization is a non-equilibrium process where self-assembly is a spontaneous process that leads toward equilibrium.  Self-assembly requires components to remain essentially unchanged throughout the process.  Besides the thermodynamic difference between the two, there is also a difference in formation.  The first difference is what "encodes the global order of the whole" in self-assembly whereas in self-organization these initial encodings are not necessary.  Another slight contrast refers to the minimum number of units needed to make an order.  Self-organization appears to have a minimum number of units whereas self-assembly does not.  The concepts may have particular application in connection with [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Shakil Afridi''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|شکیل آفریدی}}}}), or '''Shakeel Afridi''', is a [[Pakistanis|Pakistani]] physician who helped the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] run a fake hepatitis [[Vaccination schedule|vaccine program]]&lt;ref name=Animesh/&gt; in [[Abbottabad]], [[Pakistan]], to confirm [[Osama bin Laden]]'s presence in the city by obtaining [[DNA]] samples.&lt;ref name="BBC20111006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15206639|title=Bin Laden death: 'CIA doctor' accused of treason|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of his activities emerged during the Pakistani investigation of the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|deadly raid]] on bin Laden's residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saeed Shah|date=11 July 2011|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/07/11/117445/pakistan-holds-doctor-who-tried.html#storylink=misearch#storylink=cpy|title=Pakistan holds doctor who tried to collect bin Laden DNA|work=McClatchy DC|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Afridi comes from a humble background and in 1990 graduated from the [[Khyber Medical College]], Peshawar. He had been working as the doctor in-charge of Khyber Agency of the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan. The doctor has a family. Considered an American hero by many who believe his actions were altruistic, Afridi is currently serving a 33-year sentence in a Pakistani jail, convicted of charges unrelated to his alleged CIA connections. Sentenced for supporting a Pakistani warlord, many of Afridi's supporters appear to have abandoned him at home and abroad, including his alleged U.S. supporters within the CIA and the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]].&lt;ref name="at20120208"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NB08Df01.html | title=Pakistan snubs US over Osama informer | work=Asia Times Online | date=8 February 2012 | accessdate=3 June 2012 | author=Mir, Amir}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a native of [[Khyber Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C02%5C18%5Cstory_18-2-2012_pg3_6 ANALYSIS: Dr Shakil Afridi —Faruhat Taj]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, Afridi was described as being in his late 40s. There are numerous online petitions and web pages dedicated to freeing him, such as the "Free Dr. Shakil Afridi NOW" Facebook page with over 400 likes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/12/us-pressures-islamabad-cia-doctor |title=US pressures Islamabad to free doctor who helped CIA track down Bin Laden |author=Saeed Shah |date=12 July 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pakistan's accusations of Afridi==
Afridi was the chief surgeon at [[Jamrud]] Hospital in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber tribal region. His colleagues were suspicious of Afridi's absences, which he explained as "business" to attend to in Abbottabad. Afridi was accused of having taken a half-dozen [[World Health Organization]] cooler boxes without authorisation. The containers are for inoculation campaigns, but no immunisation drives were underway in Abbottabad or the Khyber Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/02/05/the-pakistani-doctor-who-helped-the-cia-nail-bin-laden.html# |title=The Pakistani Doctor Who Helped the CIA Nail Bin Laden |access-date=6 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306141713/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/02/05/the-pakistani-doctor-who-helped-the-cia-nail-bin-laden.html# |archive-date=6 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=12109&amp;Cat=13 |title=Abbottabad Commission orders treason case against Dr Afridi|date=30 January 2012 |newspaper=The News International, Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 2011, the Pakistani commission investigating bin Laden's death recommended that he be charged with "conspiracy against the state of Pakistan and high treason" on the basis of available evidence.&lt;ref name="NYT20111006" /&gt; Pakistan seized Afridi's assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2012/02/24/shakeel-afridis-property-sealedsources.html|title=Shakeel Afridi's assets siezed{{sic|hide=y}}: sources|work=dawn.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226001416/http://www.dawn.com/2012/02/24/shakeel-afridis-property-sealedsources.html|archivedate=26 February 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afridi's residence was sealed by Pakistani authorities and his family moved to an undisclosed location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012\03\05\story_5-3-2012_pg7_7 Dr Shakeel Afridi’s residence sealed in Peshawar]&lt;/ref&gt; The fifteen male and female health workers who assisted Afridi in the fake hepatitis vaccination program were also declared not fit for any future employment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C03%5C26%5Cstory_26-3-2012_pg7_19 KP govt disqualifies Dr Shakil Afridi for job]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani investigators said in a July 2012 report that Afridi met 25 times with "foreign secret agents, received instructions and provided sensitive information to them."&lt;ref name="wapo20120726"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistan-recounts-how-convicted-spy-helped-us-in-bin-laden-operation/2012/07/26/gJQAGyL1BX_story.html | title=Pakistan recounts in new report how doctor helped U.S. in bin Laden operation | work=The Washington Post | date=26 July 2012 | accessdate=27 July 2012 | author=Leiby, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pakistani reports, Afridi told investigators that the charity [[Save the Children]] helped facilitate his meeting with U.S. intelligence agents although the charity denies the charge. The report alleges that Save the Children's Pakistan director introduced Afridi to a western woman in Islamabad and that Afridi and the woman met regularly afterwards.&lt;ref name="guardian20120905"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://gu.com/p/3a8ct | title=Pakistan orders Save the Children foreign workers to leave |newspaper=The Guardian | date=5 September 2012 | accessdate=6 September 2012 | author=Boone, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/pakistan-orders-expulsion-save-children-staff-105312846.html Save the Children foreign staff told to leave Pakistan]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19500103|title=Save the Children foreign staff ordered out of Pakistan|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture===
In an interview with [[Fox News]], Afridi described being routinely [[torture]]d by the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) with cigarette burns and electric shocks while at ISI Headquarters at Abpara.&lt;ref name="foxnews20120910"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/09/10/exclusive-jailed-doc-who-helped-nail-bin-laden-warns-us-seen-as-pakistan-worst/ | title=EXCLUSIVE: Jailed doc who helped nail Bin Laden warns Pakistan sees U.S. as 'worst enemy' | work=foxnews.com | date=10 September 2012 | agency=FOX News Network | accessdate=11 September 2012 | author=Di Natale, Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing "very strict security," Afridi's lawyer told [[BBC News]] that he had doubts of the authenticity of the interview.&lt;ref name="bbc20120911"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19554551 | title=Bin Laden raid doctor Shakil Afridi speaks out | work=BBC News | date=11 September 2012 | accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di-Natale was blacklisted by Pakistan barring him from returning to the country and Fox News reporter/producer Sib Kaifee was grilled by the country's top intelligence agency and was forced to flee the country fearing reprisal.

Family members and a member of his legal counsel also stated Afridi had been tortured while in Pakistani custody during November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/11/hero-doctor-who-helped-nail-bin-laden-tortured-in-pakistani-prison-says-family/ | title=Hero doctor who helped nail Bin Laden tortured in Pakistani prison says family | date=11 December 2012 | agency=FOX | accessdate=12 December 2012 | work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waad ur Rahman]], an ''[[The Express Tribune|Express Tribune]]'' blogger argues that through a fair trial, Afridi would also have a chance to defend why he did not disclose the location of bin Laden to Pakistani authorities. He said, only denial of fair trial, makes him an absolute victim of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/20761/give-shakeel-afridi-a-fair-trial/ | title=Give Shakeel Afridi a Fair Trial | date=9 March 2014 | agency=Express Tribune | accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing==
On 28 May 2012, Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] said according to the law in Pakistan Afridi has the right to defend himself and should be granted access to higher courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=51272 Dr Shakil Afridi has the right to defend himself: PM Gilani] The News International, 29 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 2012, Afridi was sentenced to 33 years in prison for aiding banned militant group [[Lashkar-e-Islam]] and not for his links to the CIA, as officials had said earlier, according to a court document.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=51824 Dr Shakil Afridi jailed for ties with Lashkar-e-Islam: court] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601083213/http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=51824# |date=1 June 2012 }} Geo News Pakistan, 30 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The court sentenced Afridi under the [[Frontier Crimes Regulations|Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901]] a colonial era law. According to the verdict, Afridi would serve 33 years in prison and has to pay Rs. 230,000 as a fine. He was initially detained at the Apbara headquarters of the ISI in Islamabad before being moved to a Peshawar Central Jail in May 2012.&lt;ref name="foxnews20120910"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2012/05/201253015503713861.html "'Bin Laden doctor' jailed for 'fighter links'."] ''Al Jazeera'', 30 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2012, Afridi's lawyers appealed his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=52098 Lawyers appeal Dr Shakil Afridi's conviction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605013556/http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=52098# |date=5 June 2012 }}, Geo News, 1 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-7-111910-Dr-Shakil-Afridi-challenges-conviction-in-FCR-Commissioner-court Dr Shakil Afridi challenges conviction in FCR Commissioner court], The News, 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2013, senior Pakistani judicial official Sahibzada Mohammad Anis issued a ruling that overturned Afridi's sentence and ordered him a retrial. This was due to the decision that the original person who sentenced the doctor was not authorised to hear the case.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt;

In mid-November 2013, the Reuters news agency reported that he had just been charged with murder in regard to the death, eight years earlier, of a patient he had treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani doctor who helped U.S. find bin Laden charged with murder|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/22/us-pakistan-afridi-murder-idUSBRE9AL0F720131122|accessdate=22 November 2013 | work=Reuters|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Samiullah Khan Afridi, Afridi's former lawyer, was shot dead in Peshawar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/lawyer-bin-laden-hunt-doctor-killed-150317162119865.html|title=Ex-lawyer of 'Bin Laden hunt' doctor killed in Pakistan|work=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pakistani Taliban faction named Jamaatul Ahrar claimed responsibility for his murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=17 March 2015|title=Taliban Faction Kills Lawyer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/world/asia/taliban-faction-kills-lawyer.html?contentCollection=world&amp;action=click&amp;module=NextInCollection&amp;region=Footer&amp;pgtype=article|work=New York Times|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Afridi was moved from prison to a 'safer location' by [[Pakistani intelligence community|Pakistani intelligence]] officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1404218|title=Dr Shakil Afridi moved from prison 'to safer location'|last=AFP|date=2018-04-27|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hunger strike and current condition==
In late November 2012 Pakistani news provider, ''The Express Tribune'', reported that Afridi had gone on a hunger strike protesting his prison conditions in the Peshawar jail. News also reported that regarding his treatment the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] had "made their views well known to Pakistan and the public at large".&lt;ref name="Tribune PK"&gt;{{cite news|author=Huma Imtiaz|date=30 November 2012|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/473012/in-wake-of-shakil-afridis-hunger-strike-us-reiterates-calls-for-his-release/|title=In wake of Shakil Afridi's hunger strike, US reiterates calls for his release |newspaper=The Express Tribune|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Dominic Di-Natale, an Islamabad-based correspondent and Sib Kaifee, a producer/reporter for Fox News claimed that they had interviewed Afridi by phone from inside the jail and spoke to him thrice between five and 45 minutes. Two prison guards were arrested and a senior prison official was sacked for allegedly providing Afridi with cell phones.

He is isolated from the general population.&lt;ref name="Gannon"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=Gannon |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/doctor-who-aided-hunt-for-bin-laden-languishes-forgotten/2018/01/22/f41ab6bc-ff3a-11e7-86b9-8908743c79dd_story.html |title=Doctor who aided hunt for bin Laden languishes, forgotten |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=January 22, 2018 |first2=Riaz |last2=Khan |first3=Matthew |last3=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions to arrest and sentencing==
===U.S. response===
The [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]], who was then CIA Chief [[Leon Panetta]], has confirmed the role of Afridi in ascertaining the whereabouts of bin Laden inside the compound in Abbottabad. U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] has said that Pakistan has no justification for holding Afridi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-37643-No-justification-to-detain-Dr-Shakil--|title=No justification to detain Dr Shakil|date=1 March 2012|newspaper=The News International, Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Representative for the 48th District of California, [[Dana Rohrabacher]] asked President [[Barack Obama]] to intercede on Afridi's behalf,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=29 February 2012|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/us-congressman-to-obama-dont-abandon-doctor-who-helped-cia/918164/|title=US Congressman to Obama: Don't abandon doctor who helped CIA|work=indianexpress.com|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced two bills, H.R. 4069 to award a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] to Afridi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h4069/comments|title=H.R.4069: To award a Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Shakeel Afridi. - U.S. Congress - OpenCongress|work=opencongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and H.R. 3901 to declare Afridi a naturalised U.S. citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr3901ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr3901ih.pdf H.

The [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] panel cut $33 million in aid to Pakistan over the conviction of Afridi: $1 million for each of the 33 years of Afridi's sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=25 May 2012|title=Senate panel votes to cut $33M in Pakistan aid over bin Laden doctor's conviction|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/05/25/11873708-senate-panel-votes-to-cut-33m-in-pakistan-aid-over-bin-laden-doctors-conviction?lite|work=NBC News|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. authorities said that before his arrest, Afridi turned down an opportunity to leave his country and resettle overseas with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=30 May 2012|title=Afridi in OBL hunt rejected US escape: officials|url=http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=51703|work=Geo News Pakistan|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2012, U.S. authorities said that they sought clarification from Pakistan on the issue of Afridi's sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=31 May 2012|title=US seeks clarity on Dr Afridi reports|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=51878|work=The News International|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the U.S. State Department said that they would consider a prisoner exchange for [[Aafia Siddiqui]] but Pakistan refused the deal.

In May 2015 [[Seymour Hersh]] identified Afridi has been [[scapegoating|scapegoated]] by the CIA and the U.S. State Department of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]].

In June 2011, it was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and all over the Pakistani press that [[Amer Aziz|Amir Aziz]] had been held for questioning in Pakistan; he was, it was said, a CIA informant who had been spying on the comings and goings at the bin Laden compound. Aziz was released, but the retired official said that U.S. intelligence was unable to learn who leaked the highly classified information about his involvement with the mission. Officials in Washington decided they "could not take a chance that Aziz's role in obtaining bin Laden's DNA also would become known". A [[sacrificial lamb]] was needed, and the one chosen was Afridi, a 48-year-old Pakistani doctor and sometime CIA asset, who had been arrested by the Pakistanis in late May and accused of assisting the agency. "We went to the Pakistanis and said go after Afridi", the retired official said. "We had to cover the whole issue of how we got the DNA." It was soon reported that the CIA had organised a fake vaccination programme in Abbottabad with Afridi's help in a failed attempt to obtain bin Laden's DNA. Afridi's legitimate medical operation was run independently of local health authorities, was well financed and offered free vaccinations against [[hepatitis B]]. Posters advertising the programme were displayed throughout the area. Afridi was later accused of treason and sentenced to 33 years in prison because of his ties to an extremist. News of the CIA-sponsored programme created widespread anger in Pakistan, and led to the cancellation of other international vaccination programmes that were now seen as cover for American spying.

The retired official said that Afridi had been recruited long before the bin Laden mission as part of a separate intelligence effort to get information about suspected terrorists in Abbottabad and the surrounding area. "The plan was to use vaccinations as a way to get the blood of terrorism suspects in the villages." Afridi made no attempt to obtain DNA from the residents of the bin Laden compound. The report that he did so was a hurriedly put together "CIA cover story creating 'facts'" in a clumsy attempt to protect Aziz and his real mission. "Now we have the consequences", the retired official said. "A great [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] project to do something meaningful for the [[peasant]]s has been compromised as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] [[hoax]]." Afridi's conviction was overturned, but he remains in prison on a murder charge.&lt;ref name = "LRB OBL"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hersh | first = Seymour | year = 2015 | title = The Killing of Osama bin Laden | url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden | journal = London Review of Books | volume = 37 | number = 10 | pages = 3–12 | accessdate = 21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James W. Curran|James Curran]], dean of the [[Rollins School of Public Health]] at [[Emory University]], stated that spy agencies should consider the consequences of using health care institutions for their own ends: "It is always important to disassociate public health missions from wartime or spy missions that could disrupt the bonds of community trust".&lt;ref&gt;[https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/21/nsa-plan-find-osama-bin-laden-infiltrating-medical-supply-chain/ The NSA Plan to Find Bin Laden by Hiding Tracking Devices in Medical Supplies], [[The Intercept]], 21 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest by aid groups===
Humanitarian organisations, including [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], protested the use of a medical charity for espionage purposes believing it would cause suspicion of such organisations in the future and endanger personnel working on such projects claiming 'threatened immunisation work around the world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/14/cia-fake-vaccination-medecins-frontieres |title=CIA's fake vaccination programme criticised by Médecins Sans Frontières |date=14 July 2011 |author=Saeed Shah |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/03/02/140671/aid-groups-protest-to-cia-over.html#storylink=cpy|title=Aid groups protest to CIA over bin Laden scheme|work=McClatchy DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May 2012 the ''Access to Justice Through Legal Aid and Welfare Organisation Peshawar'' named a panel of lawyers to defend Dr Afridi in his appeal against his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-14999-NGO-names-lawyers-panel-to-defend-Dr-Shakil-Afridi NGO names lawyers' panel to defend Dr Shakil Afridi] The News International, 30 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lashkar-e-Islam reaction===
On 31 May 2012, [[Lashkar-e-Islam]] militants said they had nothing to do with Afridi and would kill him if given the chance. A commander in the militant organisation told the [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], "We have no link to such a shameless man. If we see him, we'll chew him alive."

The court said Afridi paid two million rupees (US$21,000) to Lashkar-e-Islam and helped to provide medical assistance to militant commanders in Khyber. But the commander said the $21,000 was a fine imposed for over-charging patients. "Afridi and his fellow doctor were fleecing tribesmen, giving them fake medicines and doing fake surgeries. We had a lot of complaints against them and imposed a fine of two million rupees on them," he said. Local residents have also told AFP that [[Mangal Bagh]] fined Afridi for performing "unnecessary surgeries and over-charging" patients at his private clinic in the town of [[Bara, FATA|Bara]].&lt;ref name="afp20120531"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=51914 | title=Militants deny link with Dr Shakil Afridi | work=www.geo.tv | date=31 May 2012 | agency=AFP | accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChaumetSimone 1953 Kabylie (alone).jpg|thumb|Simone Chaumet (1953)]]
'''Simone Tanner Chaumet''' (1916 - 25 May 1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/righteousName.html?language=en&amp;itemId=7009257|title=Chaumet Simone|last=|first=|date=|website=Yad Vashem|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[French people|French]] peace activist and was a volunteer for [[Service Civil International|SCI (Service Civil International)]] between 1943 and 1945 in [[France]] and between 1951 and 1956 in [[Algeria]]. She was honoured as ''[[Righteous Among the Nations]]'' by the [[State of Israel]] in 2011 for her actions to save [[Jewish]] children during [[World War II|the Second World War]].

==Early life ==
Chaumet was born during the 1914-1918 war, but her exact birth date and place are not known. She never knew her father. This situation affected her susceptibility in her youth years. Her mother got married again. Her step-father who was a lovely man took his wife and two daughters to Cannes to live there. The relationship between Chaumet and her step-father was intense. In 1942, she joined the CLAJ (Club loisirs action jeunesse) with her friend Jamy Bissérier and in 1943 she became the secretary of CLAJ which was associated with "Amitiés Chrétienne" in Col du Fanget in the [[French Alps]]. While she was working there, she saved the life of [[Jewish history|Jewish]] children (François Gelbert, Maurice and Charles Wrobel, Gilbert and Maxime Allouche) during [[World War II|the Second World War]] in [[France]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.sci.ngo/news/116/70/SCI-volunteer-recognized-as-Righteous-among-the-Nations.html|title=Service Civil International - Archives of Service Civil International|last=Rodriguez|first=Philipp|website=archives.sci.ngo|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yadvashem-france.org/les-justes-parmi-les-nations/les-justes-de-france/dossier-11693/|title={{!}} Le comité Français pour Yad Vashem|website=yadvashem-france.org|language=fr|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chaumet and SCI (Service Civil International) ==
SCI was very important for Chaumet and her life. She paid attention to SCI's calls and she decided to be a volunteer on behalf of SCI. She was very active in [[France]] between 1945 and 1950 for this group and she continued to be a long-term volunteer in [[Algeria]] between 1951 and 1956. She married with the SCI secretary Emile Tanner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chaumet who explored the useful aspects of education when she was a volunteer for SCI, set up a school in [[Bouzaréah|Bouzareah]]. She wanted to help the people who didn't know how to read and write and the children who needed education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Death and Commemoration ==
She was murdered on 25 May 1962 in the struggle of the [[Algerian War|Algerian Independence war.]] A commemorative plaque was installed on the Col du Fanget on 7 May 2005. The children; François Gelbert, Gilbert and Maxime Allouche that Chaumet saved their lives, attended the commemoration to honour her. Also, she was commemorated in [[Israel]] as she saved the lives of [[Jews|Jewish]] children during [[World War II|WWII]] in [[France]]. Finally, she was honoured on 24 October 2011 as [[Righteous Among the Nations|Righteous among the Nations]] in the ''Salle des Fêtes de la Mairie du 6e arrondissment'', 78 rue Bonaparte, in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajpn.org/juste-Simone-Chaumet-3183.html|title=Simone-Chaumet|last=France|first=ajpn, Hellen Kaufmann, Bernard Lhoumeau, Bordeaux, Aquitaine,|website=www.ajpn.org|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tanner-Chaumet is listed on plate 10 of the [[Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] ''Wall of the Missing'' of people lost during wars in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wall of the Missing List|url=http://www.cerclealgerianiste.fr/index.php/le-memorial-des-disparus/la-liste-du-mur-des-disparus|website=Cercle Algérianiste|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taheyya Kariokka''' ({{lang-arz|تحية كاريوكا}}) also '''Tahiya Mohamed''' (born as: '''Badaweya Mohamed Kareem Al Nirani'''), (February 22, 1915{{efn|Her year of birth was 1915 according to author [[Barbara Sellers-Young]], 1919 according to the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', and 1920 according to her ''New York Times'' obituary.}}  &amp;ndash; September 20, 1999) was an [[Egypt]]ian [[belly dancer]] and film actress.&lt;ref name="BSY"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sellers-Young|first1=Barbara|authorlink1=Barbara Sellers-Young|title=Belly Dance, Pilgrimage and Identity|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349949540|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeB0DQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Tahia%20Carioca&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=Tahia%20Carioca&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Tahia Carioca, 79, Dies; A Renowned Belly Dancer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/22/arts/tahia-carioca-79-dies-a-renowned-belly-dancer.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tahia Carioca - Egyptian actor and dancer|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tahia-Carioca|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=27 March 2018|language=en|date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Childhood and youth ==
Born in the Egyptian town of [[Ismaïlia]] to Ali Mohamed Elnidany and Fatima alzahraa. Her father was a boat merchant who had married 6 times. It is said{{by whom|date=August 2017}} Badawiya's father was over 60 years old while her mother was in her early twenties. Badawiya was barely able to speak when her father died. After the death of her father Badaweya was sent to live with her older brother Ahmed Elnidany. While there she was tortured, treated like a slave and locked in chains. Every time she tried to escape he would find her and torture her even more, till one day he shaved her hair.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Trajectory ==
With the help of her nephew Osman Elnidany she escaped. she moved to Cairo to stay with  Suad Mahasen, a night club owner and an artist.  Tahiya had asked several times for employment in Suad's nightclub but Suad refused to employ her due to the disreputability of working at a night club.  However, many of Suad's associates and friends became acquainted with Tahiya through various visits to Suad's home.  They all advised Suad to add her to one of the shows as a chorus girl but still she refused.  Soon, Tahiya was mentioned to [[Badia Masabni]], the owner of Casino Opera, one of the most prominent nightclubs of the time.  Badia offered a position in her troupe to Tahiya.  Tahiya accepted and was given the stage name Tahiya Mohamed.  She soon began gaining popularity as a solo dancer and as she became more experienced she learned a popular Samba dance from Brazil at the time called the Karioka.  After that she became known as Tahiya Karioca.  Tahiya began starring in movies during what is dubbed as the [[Egypt]]ian film industry's "Golden Age".  She was a talented dancer, singer, and actress. In 1972, the film “Watch out for Zouzou”, starring [[Soad Hosni]] with Tahiya performing the supporting role, was released to become the biggest box-office hit in Egyptian cinema to date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030510111825/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/540/cu5.htm], Al-Ahram Weekly Online, 28 June - 4 July 2001, Issue No.540, “Before the public gaze” by Mona Anis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://najatalsaghira.wordpress.com/2015/08/22/soad-hosni/], Articles on Soad Hosni, her sister Najat Al Saghira and her father the calligrapher&lt;/ref&gt;

Tahiya was married 14 times; among her husbands were actor [[Rushdy Abaza]] and playwright [[Fayez Halawa]].  Tahiya was unable to conceive any children of her own and hence adopted a daughter (Atiyat Allah).  Tahiya also was very involved with her sibling's children. Tahiya later moved to London.

Tahyia died of a heart attack on September 20, 1999, aged 84.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2822">'''Tangent''' is a social networking organisation for ladies aged over 45, primarily intended for former members of [[Ladies Circle]]. It is part of the Round Table Family of clubs, together with [[Round Table (club)]], [[Ladies Circle]] and [[41 Club]].

Ladies who are either (a) the wife or partner of a former member of Round Table or (b) a former member of Ladies Circle are eligible to join Tangent.  (From 2009 some Tangent clubs have open membership and accept women who were not previously members of Ladies Circle).

'''Round Table''' itself was formed in 1927, a social networking and community group exclusively for men aged under 40. Within three years, their wives had formed their own group, Ladies Circle. Like Round Table, Ladies Circle was specifically intended for younger ladies, and so was only open to under 40s. In 1953, former members of Bournemouth Ladies Circle formed their own group, Tangent.

In the 1990s, Ladies Circle opened up  membership to non wives/female partners of Tablers/ ex Tablers

Like the three other clubs in the movement, there are various Tangent clubs in towns and cities across the UK, and overseas.

Recently, some Tangent clubs have opened their doors to non ex Circlers.

Tangent clubs are affiliated to the National Association of Tangent Clubs (NATC). The members of each club will usually meet monthly, and organise various social events, and also activities to raise funds for charity or to support the community. Clubs will often hold Friendship or Fellowship evenings and invite other clubs in the neighbourhood to attend. Members of different clubs also have the opportunity to meet at a number of Regional Lunches held throughout the year.

A National AGM is held in April each year at a different venue. The members of the National Executive are elected at this meeting, and various proposals will be debated and voted on.

The Club motto is "Let Friendship Continue".

The Batetela live in the region between [[Lusambo]] and the [[Upper Congo River]], in the provinces of [[Sankuru District|Sankuru]] and [[Maniema]].&lt;ref name="Kisangani"/&gt;  They live by [[fishing]] and [[farming]], raising [[cassava]], [[banana]] and [[kola nuts]].  They are related to the Kusu people, only separating from them in the late 1800s after the arrival of [[Arabs]] and [[Belgians]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
According to [[Emil Torday]] (who studied the tribes of the Congo between 1908 and 1909),&lt;ref&gt;Turner 606&lt;/ref&gt; the Batetela originated on the right bank of the [[Lomami River]] and migrated to their present territory at some unknown date.&lt;ref&gt;Torday 372&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1869–70, some Tetela groups came into contact with [[Tippu Tip]], an [[Arab slave trade]]r from [[Zanzibar]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner 599; Note that Turner stresses the mutability of ethnic labels in this period, and argues that the term "Tetela" once referred to groups of the [[Songye people]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this, the chieftain [[Gongo Lutete]] began working with Tip and the Arabs to lead the Batetela in slave raids against the [[Luba people]] in [[Kasai region|Kasai]].&lt;ref name="Turner587"&gt;Turner 587&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Congo Arab war]] of 1892–1894, the Batetela fought for the Arabs, but later defected to the Belgians.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton 98&lt;/ref&gt;  Gongo Lutete was executed by the Belgians in 1893, however, and this caused the Batetela to revolt in 1895 in the first of the [[Batetela Rebellions]].  Successive uprisings followed, lasting until 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Renton, Seddon, and Zeilig 34&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period immediately following independence, [[Patrice Lumumba]], a Tetela, was a prominent politician and the first Prime Minister of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] before his assassination in 1961.  In 1975, many Batetela were [[purge]]d from the [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|military]].&lt;ref name="Kisangani"/&gt;

==Music==
"Three types of drum are used by the Batetela, a Bantu tribe situated between the [[Lomami River]] and the [[Sankuru River]] in the Kasai Province of central Belgian Congo. The ngomo skin drum is used for dancing, usually accompanying the lukumbi, the six-toned slit drum. The ekuli, a small cylindrical two-toned drum, formerly used to signal victory in battle, is now used to call people to church and classes. The lukumbi is the most interesting and intricate of the three, and constitutes a highly developed poetic and musical art form as well as a means of communication".&lt;ref name='Gilbert'&gt;Gilbert, Dorothy R. 1955.

The transition process is usually characterized by the changing and creating of institutions, particularly [[private enterprise]]s; changes in the role of the state, thereby, the creation of fundamentally different governmental institutions and the promotion of private-owned enterprises, markets and independent financial institutions.&lt;ref name=falke&gt;Falke, Mike.

Another transition mode is change the way that economy grows and practice mode. The relationships between these two transition modes are micro and macro, partial and whole. The truly transition economics should include both the micro transition and macro transition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Due to the different initial conditions during the emerging process of the transition from planned economics to market economics, countries uses different transition model. Countries like P.R.China and Vietnam adopted a gradual transition mode, however Russia and some other East-European countries, such as the former Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia,  used a more aggressive and quicker paced model of transition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The term "transition period" is often used to describe the process of transition from capitalism to socialism, preceding the establishment of fully developed socialism.

==Transition indicators==
The existence of private [[property rights]] may be the most basic element of a market economy, and therefore implementation of these rights is the key indicator of the transition process.

The main ingredients of the transition process are:
* ''Liberalization''&amp;nbsp;– the process of allowing most prices to be determined in free markets and lowering trade barriers that had shut off contact with the price structure of the world's market economies.
* ''Macroeconomic stabilization'' – bringing inflation under control and lowering it over time, after the initial burst of high inflation that follows from liberalization and the release of pent-up demand. This process requires discipline over the government budget and the growth of money and credit (that is, discipline in fiscal and monetary policy) and progress toward sustainable balance of payments.&lt;ref&gt;

* ''Legal and institutional reforms'' – redefining the role of the state in these economies, establishing the rule of law, and introducing appropriate competition policies.&lt;ref name=imf2000&gt;

According to [[Oleh Havrylyshyn]] and Thomas Wolf of the [[International Monetary Fund]], transition in a broad sense implies:
* liberalizing economic activity, prices, and market operations, along with reallocating resources to their most efficient use;
* developing indirect, market-oriented instruments for macroeconomic stabilization;
* achieving effective enterprise management and economic efficiency, usually through privatization;
* imposing hard budget constraints, which provide incentives to improve efficiency; and
* establishing an institutional and legal framework to secure property rights, the rule of law, and transparent market-entry regulations.&lt;ref name=imf1&gt;Havrylyshyn, Oleh; Wolf, Thomas.

The [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) developed a set of indicators to measure the progress in transition. The classification system was originally created in the EBRD's 1994 Transition Report, but has been refined and amended in subsequent Reports. The EBRD's overall transition indicators are:
* Large-scale privatization
* Small-scale privatization
* Governance and enterprise restructuring
* Price liberalization
* Trade and foreign exchange system
* Competition policy
* Banking reform and interest rate liberalization
* Securities markets and [[non-bank financial institution]]s
* Infrastructure reform&lt;ref&gt;EBRD's 1994 Transition Report&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
{{Further|Soviet-type economic planning}}

The economic malaise affecting the [[Comecon]] countries – low growth rates and diminishing returns on investment – led many domestic and Western economists to advocate market-based solutions and a sequenced programme of economic reform. It was recognized that micro-economic reform and macro-economic stabilization had to be combined carefully. Price liberalization without prior remedial measures to eliminate macro-economic imbalances, including an escalating fiscal deficit, a growing money supply due to a high level of borrowing by state-owned enterprises, and the accumulated savings of households ("[[monetary overhang]]") could result in macro-economic destabilization instead of micro-economic efficiency. Unless entrepreneurs enjoyed secure property rights and farmers owned their farms the process of Schumpeterian "[[creative destruction]]" would limit the reallocation of resources and prevent profitable enterprises from expanding to absorb the workers displaced from the liquidation of non-viable enterprises. A hardening of the budget constraints at state-owned enterprises would halt the drain on the state budget from subsidization but would require additional expenditure to counteract the resulting unemployment and drop in aggregate household spending. Monetary overhang meant that price liberalization might convert "repressed inflation" into open inflation, increase the price level still further and generate a price spiral. The transition to a market economy would require state intervention alongside market liberalization, privatization and deregulation. Rationing of essential consumer goods, trade quotas and tariffs and an active monetary policy to ensure that there was sufficient liquidity to maintain commerce might be needed.&lt;ref&gt;Padma Desai, ''The Soviet Economy: Problems and Prospects'', 1990, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, pp. xiii-xxii and 164 {{ISBN|0-631-17183-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to tariff protection, measures to control capital flight were also considered necessary in some instances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kaser]] on ''Privatization in the CIS'' in Alan Smith (editor), ''Challenges for Russian Economic Reform'', 1995, London: Royal Institute for International Affairs and Washington DC: The Brookings Institution, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition in practice==
The most influential strategy for the transition to a market economy was that adopted by Poland launched in January 1990. The strategy was strongly influenced by IMF and World Bank analyses of successful and unsuccessful stabilization programmes which had been adopted in Latin America in the 1980s. The strategy incorporated a number of interdependent measures including macro-economic stabilization; the liberalization of wholesale and retail prices; the removal of constraints to the development of private enterprises and the privatization of state-owned enterprises; the elimination of subsidies and the imposition of hard budget constraints; and the creation of an export-oriented economy that was open to foreign trade and investment. The creation of a social safety net targeted at the individual to compensate for the removal of job security and the removal of price controls on staple goods was also part of the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Smith, ''Introduction'' in Alan Smith (editor), ''Challenges for Russian Economic Reform'', 1995, London: Royal Institute for International Affairs and Washington DC: The Brookings Institution, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of the transition strategy was influenced by the critical state of most post-socialist countries. Policy-makers were persuaded that political credibility took precedence over a sequenced reform plan and to introduce macro-economic stabilization measures ahead of structural measures that would by their nature take longer to implement. The "credibility" of the transition process was enhanced by the adoption of the [[Washington Consensus]] favoured by the IMF and the World Bank. Stabilization was deemed a necessity in Hungary and Poland where state budget deficits had grown and foreign debts had become larger than the country's capacity to service. Western advisers and domestic experts working with the national governments and the IMF introduced stabilization programmes aiming to achieve external and internal balance, which became known as [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]. It was argued that "one cannot jump over a chasm in two leaps".&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 117-119, 121 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The many foreign advisers from, principally, the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden were often under contract to the international financial institutions and bilateral or multilateral technical assistance programmes. They favoured free trade and exchange rate convertibility rather than trade protection and capital controls, which might have checked capital flight. They tended to support privatization without prior industrial restructuring; an exception was to be found in Eastern Germany where the [[Treuhand]] (Trust Agency) prepared state-owned enterprises for the market at considerable cost to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kaser on ''Privatization in the CIS'' in Alan Smith (editor), ''Challenges for Russian Economic Reform'', 1995, London: Royal Institute for International Affairs and Washington DC: The Brookings Institution, pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Western technical assistance programmes were established by European Union – through the [[Phare]] and [[TACIS]] programmes – and other donors (including the US AID, the UK Know-how Fund and UNDP) and by the IMF, the World Bank, EBRD and KfW, which also advanced loans for stabilization, structural adjustment, industrial restructuring and social protection. Technical assistance was delivered through the exchange of civil servants and by management consultants, including Agriconsulting, Atos, COWI, Ernst &amp; Young, GOPA, GTZ, Human Dynamics, Idom, IMC Consulting, Louis Berger, NIRAS, PA Consulting, PE International, Pohl Consulting, PwC, and SOFRECO.

It had been expected that the introduction of current account convertibility and foreign trade liberalization would force a currency devaluation that would support [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 116-117, 121 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when prices were de-controlled enterprises and retailers raised their prices to match those prevailing in the black market or towards world price levels, earning them windfall profits initially. Consumers reacted by reducing their purchases and by substituting better quality imported goods in place of domestically produced goods. Falling sales led to the collapse of many domestic enterprises, with personnel lay-offs or reduced hours of work and pay. This further reduced effective demand. As imports grew and exporters failed to respond to opportunities in world markets due to the poor quality of their products and lack of resources for investment, the trade deficit expanded, putting downward pressure on the exchange rate. Many wholesalers and retailers marked prices according to their dollar values and the falling exchange rate fed inflation. The central banks in several countries raised interest rates and tightened credit conditions, depriving state agencies and enterprises of working capital. These in turn found it impossible to pay wages on time, dampening effective demand further.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 130-135, 121 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impacts of the conventional transition strategies proved to be de-stabilizing in the short-term and left the population impoverished in the long-term. Economic output declined much more than expected. The decline in output lasted until 1992-96 for all transition economies. By 1994, economic output had declined across all transition economies by 41 percent compared to its 1989 level. The Central and Eastern European economies began growing again around 1993, with Poland, which had begun its transition programme earliest emerging from recession in 1992. The Baltic States came out of recession in 1994 and the rest of the former Soviet Union around 1996. Inflation remained above 20 percent a year (except in the Czech Republic and Hungary) until the mid-1990s. Across all transition economies the peak annual inflation rate was 2632 percent (4645 percent in the CIS).&lt;ref&gt;IMF staff estimates in Stanley Fischer, Ratna Sahay and Carlos Vegh, ''Stabilization and growth in transition economies: The early experience'', April 1996, IMF Working Paper WP/96/31, Table 2, p. 8; downloaded from http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/20631/; retrieved on 1/11.2013; UNDP, ''Human Development Report for Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS'', 1999, New York: United Nations Development Programme, Table 2.1, p. 14 {{ISBN|92-1-126109-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment increased and wages fell in real terms, although in Russia and other CIS economies the rate of unemployment recorded at employment exchanges remained low. Labour force surveys undertaken by the International Labour Organization showed significantly higher rates of joblessness and there was considerable internal migration.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Clarke (editor), ''Structural Adjustment without Mass Unemployment? Lessons from Russia'', 1998, Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, pp. 40-41, 49 and 53 {{ISBN|1-85898-713-X}}; J L Porket, ''Unemployment in Capitalist, Communist and Post-Communist Economies'', 1995, London: Macmillan pp. 98-100 and 117 {{ISBN|0-312-12484-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; High interest rates induced a "credit crunch" and fuelled inter-enterprise indebtedness and hampered the expansion of small and medium-sized enterprises, which often lacked the connections to obtain finance legitimately.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 130, 146, 150-154 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time domestic producers were able to upgrade their production capacity and foreign direct investment was attracted to the transition economies. Local-manufactured higher quality consumer goods became available and won market share back from imports. Stabilization of the exchange rate was made more difficult by large-scale capital flight, with domestic agents sending part of their earning abroad to destinations where they believed their capital was more secure. The promise of
European Union membership and the adoption of the EU's legislation and regulations (the [[Community acquis]] or ''acquis communautaire'') helped secure trust in property rights and economic and governmental institutions in much of Central and Eastern Europe.

Some economists have argued that the growth performance of the transition economies stemmed from the low level of development, decades of trade isolation and distortions in the socialist planned economies. They have emphasized that the transition strategies adopted reflected the need to resolve the economic crisis besetting the socialist planned economies and the overriding objective was the transformation to capitalist market economies rather than the fostering of economic growth and welfare.&lt;ref&gt;László Csaba, ''Transformation as a subject of economic theory'' in Zbyněk Balandrán and Vít Havránek, ''Atlas of Transformation'', 2011 at [http://monumenttotransformation.org/atlas-of-transforamtion/html/t/transformation/transformation-as-a-subject-of-economic-theory-laszlo-czaba.hmtl]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 1/11/2013; Jeffrey Sachs, ''What I did in Russia'', posted 14 March 2012, at http://jeffsachs.org/2012/03/what-i-did-in-russia/ retrieved 1/11/2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

But by 2000, the EBRD was reporting that the effects of the initial starting point in each transition economy on the reform process had faded. Although the foundations had been laid for a functioning market economy through sustained liberalization, comprehensive privatization, openness to international trade and investment, and the establishment of democratic political systems there remained institutional challenges. Liberalized markets were not necessarily competitive and political freedom had not prevented powerful private interests from exercising undue influence.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2000'', London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, p. 13 {{ISBN|1-898802-17-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years on, in the ''Transition Report'' for 2010, the EBRD was still finding that the quality of market-enabling institutions continued to fall short of what was necessary for well-functioning market economies. Growth in the transition economies had been driven by trade integration into the world economy with "impressive" export performance, and by "rapid capital inflows and a credit boom". But such growth had proved volatile and the EBRD considered that governments in the transition economies should foster the development of domestic capital markets and improve the business environment, including financial institutions, real estate markets and the energy, transport and communications infrastructure. The EBRD expressed concerns about regulatory independence and enforcement, price setting, and the market power of incumbent infrastructure operators.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2010'', London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pp. 2-5. {{issn|1356-3424}} The ISBN printed in the document (978-1-898802-33-1) is invalid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Income inequality as measured by the [[Gini coefficient]] rose significantly in the transition economies between 1987 and 1988 and the mid-1990s. Poverty re-emerged with between 20 and 50 percent of people living below the national poverty line in the transition economies. The UN Development Programme calculated that overall poverty in Eastern Europe and the CIS increased from 4 percent of the population in 1988 to 32 percent by 1994, or from 14 million people to 119 million.&lt;ref&gt;The UNDP used a poverty line of $4 per person per day in 1990 dollars at purchasing power parity; UNDP, ''Human Development Report for Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS'', 1999, New York: United Nations Development Programme, Table 2.5, pp. 20-21 {{ISBN|92-1-126109-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment and rates of economic inactivity were still high in the late 1990s according to survey data.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2000'', London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Table 5.2, p. 103 {{ISBN|1-898802-17-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, the year before the global financial crisis hit, the index for GDP had reached 112 compared to 100 in 1989 for the transition economies. In other words, it took nearly 20 years to restore the level of output that had existed prior to the transition. The index of economic output (GDP) in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe was 151 in 2007; for the Balkans/ South-eastern Europe the index was 111, and for the Commonwealth of Independent States and Mongolia it was 102. Several CIS countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia as well as Moldova and Ukraine had economies that were substantially smaller than in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2008'', London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Table A.1.1.1, p. 13 {{ISBN|978-1-898802-31-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The global recession of 2008-09 and the Eurozone crisis of 2011-13 destabilized the transition economies, reduced growth rates and increased unemployment. The slowdown hit government revenues and widened fiscal deficits but almost all transition economies had experienced a partial recovery and had maintained low and stable inflation since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2013'', 2013, London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pp. 8 and 99-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Transition trajectories have varied considerably in practice. Some nations have been experimenting with market reform for several decades, while others are relatively recent adopters (e.g., [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]). In some cases reforms have been accompanied with political upheaval, such as the overthrow of a dictator ([[Romania]]), the collapse of a government (the [[Soviet Union]]), a declaration of independence ([[Croatia]]), or integration with another country ([[East Germany]]). In other cases economic reforms have been adopted by incumbent governments with little interest in political change ([[China]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]]).&lt;ref name=vn&gt;Vuong, Quan-Hoang.

Some countries, such as Vietnam, have experienced macro-economic upheavals over different periods of transition, even transition turmoil.&lt;ref name=vnturmoil&gt;Napier, Nancy K.; Vuong, Quan Hoang.

According to the World Bank's ''10 Years of Transition'' report "... the wide dispersion in the productivity of labour and capital across types of enterprises at the onset of transition and the erosion of those differences between old and new sectors during the reform provide a natural definition of the end of transition."&lt;ref name=wb1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Vito Tanzi, Director of the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department, gave definition that the transformation to a market economy is not complete until functioning fiscal institutions and reasonable and affordable expenditure programs, including basic social safety nets for the unemployed, the sick, and the elderly, are in place. Mr Tanzi stated that these spending programs must be financed from public revenues generated—through taxation—without imposing excessive burdens on the private sector.&lt;ref name=imf2&gt;Tanzi, Vito. [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1999/06/tanzi.htm Transition and the Changing Role of Government], Finance &amp; Development Magazine, June 1999, Volume 36, Number 2 by the [[International Monetary Fund]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EBRD a well-functioning market economy should enjoy a diverse range of economic activities, equality of opportunity and convergence of incomes. These outcomes had not yet been achieved by 2013 and progress in establishing well-functioning market economies had stalled since the 1990s. On the EBRD's measure of transition indicators the transition economies had become "stuck in transition". Price liberalization, small-scale privatization and the opening-up of trade and foreign exchange markets were mostly complete by the end of the 1990s. However economic reform had slowed in areas such governance, enterprise restructuring and competition policy, which remained substantially below the standard of other developed market economies.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2013'', 2013, London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pp. 8 and 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inequality of opportunity was higher in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia than in some other developed economies in Western Europe (except France, where inequality of opportunity was relatively high). The highest inequality of opportunity was found in the Balkans and Central Asia. In terms of legal regulations and access to education and health services, inequality of opportunity related to gender was low in Europe and Central Asia but medium to high in respect of labour practices, employment and entrepreneurship and in [[access to finance]]. In Central Asia women also experienced significant lack of access to health services, as was the case in Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2013'', 2013, London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pp. 6 and 78-96.&lt;/ref&gt; While many transition economies performed well with respect to primary and secondary education, and matched that available in many other developed economies, they were weaker when it came to training and tertiary education.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2013'', 2013, London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the decade 1994 to 2004, the transition economies had closed some of the gap in income per person with the average for the European Union in purchasing power parity terms. These gains had been driven by sustained growth in productivity as obsolete capital stock was scrapped and production shifted to take advantage of the opening-up of foreign trade, price liberalization and foreign direct investment. However the rapid growth rates of that period of catch-up had stalled since the late 2000s and the prospects for income convergence have receded according to the EBRD's prognosis, unless there are additional productivity-enhancing structural reforms.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2013'', 2013, London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pp. 4, 8 and 10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent history of transition suggested that weak political institutions and entrenched interest groups had hindered economic reform. The EBRD's ''Transition Report 2013'' looked at the relationship between transition and democratization.  The report acknowledged that the academic literature was divided on whether economic development fostered democracy but argued that there was nonetheless strong empirical support for the hypothesis. It suggested that countries with high inequality were less inclined to support a limited and accountable state. In general, the proportion of the population with an income of between US$10–50 a day (the so-called "middle class") correlated with the level of democracy; however this correlation disappeared in transition countries with high income inequality. Those countries with large natural resource endowments, for example oil and gas producers like Russia and Kazakhstan, had less accountable governments and faced less electoral pressure to tackle powerful vested interests because the government could rely on resource rents and did not have to tax the population heavily. Countries with a strong institutional environment – that is, effective rule of law, secure property rights and uncorrupted public administration and corporate governance – were better placed to attract investment and undertake restructuring and regulatory change.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2013'', 2013, London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pp. 5, 8-9, 34-35, 38-39 and 106. The ''Transition Report 2013'' assessed the level of democracy in terms of the Polity IV Index on the type of governance regime, published by the Center for Systemic Peace, which rates governance on the basis of whether states have institutionalized processes for open, competitive and deliberative political participation; chooses and replaces chief executives in open, competitive elections; and imposes checks and balances on the discretionary power of the executive; see [[Polity data series]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To spur further economic reform and break out of a vicious circle, the EBRD ''Transition Report 2013'' proposed that the transition economies should: 
*Open-up trade and finance, which made reform more resilient to popular pressure ("market aversion") and meant that countries could access the EU single market either as member states or through association agreements (such as those being negotiated with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia); 
*Encourage transparent and accountable government, with media and civil society scrutiny, and political competition at elections; 
*Invest in human capital, especially by improving the quality of tertiary education.&lt;ref&gt;EBRD, ''Transition Report 2013'', 2013, London: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, pp. 5, 34, 38 and 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries in transition==
Although the term "transition economies" usually covers the countries of [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and the [[Former Soviet Union]], this term may have a wider context. There are countries outside of Europe, emerging from a socialist-type command economy towards a market-based economy (e.g., China). Moreover, in a wider sense the definition of transition economy refers to all countries which attempt to change their basic constitutional elements towards market-style fundamentals. Their origin could be also in a post-colonial situation, in a heavily regulated [[Asian economics|Asian-style economy]], in a [[Latin American]] post-dictatorship or even in a somehow economically underdeveloped country in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=falke/&gt;

In 2000, the IMF listed the following countries with transition economies:&lt;ref name=imf2000/&gt;

==Branch of economics==
''Transition economics'' is a special branch of economics dealing with the transformation of a planned economy to a market economy. It has become especially important after the collapse of Communism in [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. Transition economics investigates how an economy should reform itself to endorse capitalism and democracy. There are usually two sides: one which argues for a rapid transformation and one which argues for a gradual approach. [[Gérard Roland (economist)|Gérard Roland]]'s book ''Transition and Economics. Politics, Markets and Firms'' (MIT Press 2000) gives a good overview of the field. A more recent overview is provided in ''Transition Economies: Political Economy in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia'' by Martin Myant and Jan Drahokoupil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Weyto''' is a speculative [[extinct language]] thought to have been spoken in the [[Lake Tana]] region of [[Ethiopia]] by the [[Weyto people|Weyto]], a small group of [[hippopotamus]] hunters who now speak [[Amharic language|Amharic]]. 

The Weyto language was first mentioned by the Scottish traveler [[James Bruce]], who spoke Amharic, passed through the area about 1770 and reported that "the Wayto speak a language radically different from any of those in Abyssinia," but was unable to obtain any "certain information" on it, despite prevailing upon the king to send for two Weyto men for him to ask questions, which they would "neither answer nor understand" even when threatened with hanging.  The next European to report on them, [[Eugen Mittwoch]], described them as uniformly speaking a dialect of Amharic (Mittwoch 1907).  This report was confirmed by [[Marcel Griaule]] when he passed through in 1928, although he added that at one point a Weyto sang an unrecorded song "in the dead language of the Wohitos" whose meaning the singer himself did not understand, except for a handful of words for hippopotamus body parts which, he says, had remained in use.  

This Amharic dialect is described by [[Marcel Cohen]] (1939) as featuring a fair number of words derived from Amharic roots but twisted in sound or meaning in order to confuse outsiders, making it a sort of [[argot]]; in addition to these, it had a small number of [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] [[loanword]]s not found in standard Amharic, and a large number of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanwords mainly related to [[Islam]].  Of the substantial wordlist collected by Griaule, Cohen only considered six terms to be etymologically obscure: ''šəlkərít'' "fish-scale", ''qəntat'' "wing", ''čəgəmbit'' "mosquito", ''annessa'' "shoulder", ''&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;nk&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;es'' "hippopotamus thigh", ''wazəməs'' "hippopotamus spine."  By 1965, the visiting anthropologist [[Frederick Gamst]] found "no surviving native words, not even relating to their hunting and fishing work tasks." (Gamst 1965.)

The paucity of the data available has not prevented speculation on the classification of their original language; Cohen suggested that it might have been either an [[Agaw languages|Agaw language]] or a non-Amharic [[Semitic language]], while Dimmendaal (1989) says it "probably belonged to Cushitic" (as does Agaw), and Gamst (1965) says "...it can be assumed that if the Wäyto did not speak Amharic 200 years ago, their language must have been Agäw..."  According to the [[Ethnologue]], Bender ''et al.'' (1976) saw it as Cushitic, while Bender 1983 saw it as either [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic]] or [[Awngi language|Awngi]].  It thus effectively remains [[unclassified language|unclassified]], largely for lack of data, but possibly related to Agaw.

Prior to 1994, immigrants from elsewhere faced [[discrimination]] and even violence in [[South Africa]]. After [[Post-apartheid South Africa|majority rule]] in 1994, contrary to expectations, the incidence of xenophobia increased.&lt;ref&gt;From 'Foreign Natives' to 'Native Foreigners': Explaining [[Xenophobia]] in Post-Apartheid South Africa'', Michael Neocosmos, CODESRIA, Dakar, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and March 2008, at least 67 people died in what were identified as xenophobic attacks. In May 2008, a series of attacks left 62 people dead; although 21 of those killed were South African citizens. The attacks were apparently motivated by xenophobia.&lt;ref&gt;See L.B. Landau (ed), 2011. [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09637494.2014.937165 Exorcising the Demons Within: Xenophobia, Violence and Statecraft in Contemporary South Africa]. Johannesburg: Wits University Press; Tokyo: United Nations University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, another nationwide spike in xenophobic attacks against immigrants in general prompted a number of foreign governments to begin repatriating their citizens.&lt;ref name="Afssawvf"/&gt;

==Xenophobia in South Africa before 1994==

===Attacks against Mozambican and Congolese immigrants===
Between 1984 and the end of hostilities in that country, an estimated 50,000 to 350,000 [[Mozambique|Mozambicans]] fled to South Africa. While never granted [[refugee]] status they were technically allowed to settle in the [[bantustan]]s or black homelands created during the apartheid system. The reality was more varied, with the homeland of [[Lebowa]] banning Mozambican settlers outright while [[Gazankulu]] welcomed the refugees with support in the form of land and equipment. Those in Gazankulu, however, found themselves confined to the homeland and liable for [[deportation]] should they officially enter South Africa, and evidence exists that their hosts denied them access to economic resources.&lt;ref name="Jonny Steinberg 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss.co.za/dynamic/administration/file_manager/file_links/117FULL.PDF |format=PDF |title=ISS Monograph No 117: Mozambican and Congolese Refugees in South Africa: A mixed reception |author=Jonny Steinberg |publisher=Institute for Security Studies |accessdate=5 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003222623/http://www.iss.co.za/dynamic/administration/file_manager/file_links/117FULL.PDF |archivedate=3 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrest and civil war likewise saw large numbers of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] people emigrate to South Africa, many illegally, in 1993 and 1997. Subsequent studies found indications of xenophobic attitudes towards these refugees, typified by them being denied access to the primary healthcare to which they were technically entitled.&lt;ref name="Jonny Steinberg 2008"/&gt;

==Xenophobia in South Africa after 1994==
Despite a lack of directly comparable data, xenophobia in South Africa is perceived to have significantly increased after the election of a Black majority government in 1994.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''From 'Foreign Natives' to 'Native Foreigners': Explaining [[Xenophobia]] in Post-Apartheid South Africa'', Michael Neocosmos, CODESRIA, Dakar, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2004 study published by the [[Southern African Migration Project]] (SAMP):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[African National Congress|ANC]] government – in its attempts to overcome the divides of the past and build new forms of social cohesion ... embarked on an aggressive and inclusive nation-building project. One unanticipated by-product of this project has been a growth in intolerance towards outsiders ... Violence against foreign citizens and African refugees has become increasingly common and communities are divided by hostility and suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queensu.ca/samp/sampresources/samppublications/policyseries/Acrobat30.pdf|title=South African Migration Project 30: Regionalizing Xenophobia? Citizen Attitudes to Immigration and refugee policy in Southern Africa|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Institute for Democracy in South Africa|author=Jonathan Crush and Wade Pendleton|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The study was based on a citizen survey across member states of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) and found South Africans expressing the harshest anti-immigrant sentiment, with 21% of South Africans in favour of a complete ban on foreign entry and 64% in favour of strict limitations on the numbers permitted. By contrast, the next-highest proportion of respondents in favour of a complete ban on immigration were in neighbouring Namibia, and Botswana, at 10%.

===Foreigners and the South African Police Service===

A 2004 study by the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR) of attitudes amongst police officers in the Johannesburg area found that 87% of respondents believed that most undocumented immigrants in Johannesburg are involved in crime, despite there being no statistical evidence to substantiate the perception. Such views combined with the vulnerability of [[Illegal immigration in South Africa|illegal aliens]] led to abuse, including violence and extortion, some analysts argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In a March 2007 meeting with Home Affairs Minister [[Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula]], a representative of [[Burundi]]an refugees in Durban; claimed that immigrants could not rely on police for protection, but instead found police mistreating them, stealing from them and making unconfirmed allegations that they sell drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Violence before May 2008===
According to a 1998 [[Human Rights Watch]] report, immigrants from Malawi, Zimbabwe and Mozambique living in the [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]] township were "physically assaulted over a period of several weeks in January 1995, as armed gangs identified suspected undocumented migrants and marched them to the police station in an attempt to 'clean' the township of foreigners."&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite web

The campaign, known as "Buyelekhaya" (go back home), blamed foreigners for crime, unemployment and sexual attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September 1998, a Mozambican national and two Senegalese citizens were thrown out of a train. The assault was carried out by a group returning from a rally that blamed foreigners for unemployment, crime and the  spread of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2000, seven foreigners were killed on the [[Cape Flats]] over a five-week period in what police described as xenophobic murders possibly motivated by the fear that outsiders would claim property belonging to locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, residents of the [[Zandspruit]] informal settlement gave Zimbabwean citizens ten days to leave the area. When the foreigners failed to leave voluntarily, they were forcefully evicted and their shacks were burned down and looted. Community members said they were angry that Zimbabweans were employed whilst locals remained jobless and blamed the foreigners for a number of crimes. No injuries were reported amongst the affected Zimbabweans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last week of 2005 and first week of 2006, at least four people, including two Zimbabweans, died in the [[Olievenhoutbosch]] settlement after foreigners were blamed for the death of a local man. Shacks belonging to foreigners were set alight and locals demanded that police remove all immigrants from the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In August 2006, Somali refugees appealed for protection after 21 Somali traders were killed in July of that year and 26 more in August. The immigrants believed the murders to be motivated by xenophobia, although police rejected the assertion of a concerted campaign to drive Somali traders out of townships in the Western Cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Attacks on foreign nationals increased markedly in late-2007&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and it is believed that there were at least a dozen attacks between January and May 2008.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; The most severe incidents occurred on 8 January 2008 when two [[Somalia|Somali]] shop owners were murdered in the [[Eastern Cape]] towns of [[Jeffreys Bay]] and [[East London, South Africa|East London]], then in March 2008 when seven people were killed including Zimbabweans, [[Pakistan]]is and a Somali national after their shops and shacks were set alight in [[Atteridgeville]] near [[Pretoria]].&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.za/PrintEdition/News/Article.aspx?id=768363 |title=Recent attacks tip of xenophobic iceberg |publisher=TheTimes.co.za |accessdate=19 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107073615/http://www.thetimes.co.za/PrintEdition/News/Article.aspx?id=768363 |archivedate=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread of violence===
On 12 May 2008 a series of riots started in the township of [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]] (in the north-eastern part of [[Johannesburg]]) when locals attacked migrants from [[Mozambique]], [[Malawi]] and [[Zimbabwe]], killing two people and injuring 40 others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news

In the following weeks the violence spread, first to other settlements in the [[Gauteng Province]], then to the coastal cities of [[Durban]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Popular opposition to xenophobia===
In [[Khutsong]] in [[Gauteng]] and the various shack settlements governed by [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] social movements were able to ensure that there were no violent attacks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ru.ac.za/politics/events/seminarseries "We are Gauteng People" Challenging the politics of xenophobia in Khutsong, South Africa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802111842/http://www.ru.ac.za/politics/events/seminarseries |date=2 August 2010 }}, Seminar Presentation, Joshua Kirshner, 23 February 2011, Rhodes University&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]] also organised campaigns against xenophobia. [[Pallo Jordan]] argues that "Active grass-roots interventions contained the last wave of xenophobia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2013/09/19/xenophobia-amounts-to-shooting-south-africa-in-both-feet|title=Xenophobia amounts to shooting South Africa in both feet|work=Business Day Live|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
A report by the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] identified four broad causes for the violence:
*[[relative deprivation]], specifically intense competition for jobs, commodities and housing;
*[[group processes]], including psychological categorisation processes that are nationalistic rather than superordinate&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, C. &amp; Rutland, A. (2008) A [[quasi-experiment]] on the effects of superordinate categorization on liking of people from other nations. Psychology and Developing Societies, 20(2), 183–208. http://pds.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/20/2/183&lt;/ref&gt;
*South African exceptionalism, or a feeling of superiority in relation to other Africans; and
*exclusive citizenship, or a form of nationalism that excludes others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent report, "Towards Tolerance, Law and Dignity: Addressing Violence against Foreign Nationals in South Africa" commissioned by the [[International Organisation for Migration]] found that poor service delivery or an influx of foreigners may have played a contributing role, but blamed township politics for the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Towards Tolerance, Law and Dignity: Addressing Violence against Foreign Nationals in South Africa|publisher=International Organisation for Migration|url=http://www.migration.org.za/sites/default/files/reports/2009/Addressing_Violence_against_Foreign_Nationals_IOM.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160711045229/http://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/shared/shared/mainsite/media/docs/reports/violence_against_foreign_nationals.pdf|archive-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It also found that community leadership was potentially lucrative for unemployed people, and that such leaders organised the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Local leadership could be illegitimate and often violent when emerging from either a political vacuum or fierce competition, the report said, and such leaders enhanced their authority by reinforcing resentment towards foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
1400 suspects were arrested in connection with the violence. Nine months after the attacks 128 individuals had been convicted and 30 found not guilty in 105 concluded court cases. 208 cases had been withdrawn and 156 were still being heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after the attacks prosecutors said that 137 people had been convicted, 182 cases had been withdrawn because witnesses or complainants had left the country, 51 cases were underway or ready for trial and 82 had been referred for further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, one year after the attacks the [[Consortium for Refugees and Migrants in South Africa]] (Cormsa) said that foreigners remained under threat of violence and that little had been done to address the causes of the attacks. The organisation complained of a lack of accountability for those responsible for public violence, insufficient investigations into the instigators and the lack of a public government inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Refugee camps and reintegration question====

After being housed in temporary places of safety (including police stations and community halls) for three weeks, those who fled the violence were moved into specially established temporary camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5ibeZeGJbRIF2sQiMsqquz3WRICMw |title=Foreigners displaced by violence in South Africa move into temporary camps |publisher=The Canadian Press |accessdate=30 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604041751/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5ibeZeGJbRIF2sQiMsqquz3WRICMw |archivedate=4 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions in some camps were condemned on the grounds of location and infrastructure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Xenophobia/0,,2-7-2382_2346122,00.html |title=Camp conditions alarm SACC |publisher=News24 |accessdate=30 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718081359/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Xenophobia/0%2C%2C2-7-2382_2346122%2C00.html |archivedate=18 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting their temporary nature.

The South African government initially adopted a policy of quickly reintegrating refugees into the communities they originally fled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=nw20080604125107561C769068|title=Reintegration the priority – government|publisher=Independent Online|accessdate=30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently set a deadline in July 2008, by which time refugees would be expected to return to their communities or countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.za/SpecialReports/Xenophobia/Article.aspx?id=780888 |title=Go home or go back: Home Affairs |publisher=The Times (SA) |accessdate=30 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612184150/http://www.thetimes.co.za/SpecialReports/Xenophobia/Article.aspx?id=780888 |archivedate=12 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an apparent policy shift the government vowed that there would be no forced reintegration of refugees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.za/SpecialReports/Xenophobia/Article.aspx?id=781999 |title=No 'forced reintegration' for immigrants |publisher=The Times (SA) |accessdate=30 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123233856/http://www.thetimes.co.za/SpecialReports/Xenophobia/Article.aspx?id=781999 |archivedate=23 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the victims would not be deported, even if they were found to be illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-06-20-govt-victims-of-xenophobia-wont-be-deported|title=Govt: Victims of xenophobia won't be deported|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, one year after the attacks, the City of Cape Town said it would apply for an eviction order to force 461 remaining refugees to leave two refugee camps in that city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Domestic political reaction===
On 21 May, then-President [[Thabo Mbeki]] approved a request from the [[South African Police Service|SAPS]] for deployment of [[South African National Defence Force|armed forces]] against the attacks in Gauteng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/show.asp?type=pr&amp;include=president/pr/2008/pr05211746.htm |title=President Mbeki approves request for SANDF involvement to stop attacks on foreign nationals |publisher=The Presidency – Republic of South Africa |accessdate=21 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610181937/http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/show.asp?type=pr&amp;include=president%2Fpr%2F2008%2Fpr05211746.htm |archivedate=10 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first time that the South African government has ordered troops out to the streets in order to quell unrest since the end of apartheid in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7412128.stm|title=SA leader orders army to deploy|publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 May 2008 | date=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several political parties blamed each other, and sometimes other influences, for the attacks. The Gauteng provincial branch of the ANC has alleged that the violence is politically motivated by a "third hand" that is primarily targeting the ANC for the [[South African general election, 2009|2009 general elections]].&lt;ref name="third hand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2008-05-23-third-force-allegations-abound|title='Third force' allegations abound|publisher=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|accessdate=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Minister of Intelligence, [[Ronnie Kasrils]], and the director general of the [[National Intelligence Agency (South Africa)|National Intelligence Agency]], [[Manala Manzini]], backed the Gauteng ANC's allegations that the anti-immigrant violence is politically motivated and targeted at the ANC.&lt;ref name="third hand" /&gt; Referring to published allegations by one rioter that he was being paid to commit violent acts against immigrants, Manzini said that the violence was being stoked primarily within hostel facilities by a third party with financial incentives.

[[Helen Zille]], leader of the official opposition party the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA), pointed to instances of crowds of rioters singing ''"[[Umshini wami]]"'', a song associated then-president of the ANC [[Jacob Zuma]],&lt;ref name="umshini wami" /&gt; and noted that the rioters also hailed from the rank and file of the [[African National Congress Youth League|ANC Youth League]]. She alleged that Zuma had promised years before to his supporters to take measures against the immigration of foreign nationals to South Africa and that Zuma's most recent condemnation of the riots and distancing from the anti-immigration platform was not enough of a serious initiative against the participation of fellow party members in the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.da.org.za/da/Site/Eng/satoday/satoday.asp|title=SA TODAY|publisher=Democratic Alliance|accessdate=23 May 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080314162652/http://www.da.org.za/da/Site/Eng/satoday/satoday.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Zille and the parliamentary leader of the DA, [[Sandra Botha]], slammed the ANC for shifting the blame concerning the violence to a "third hand", which is often taken in South African post-apartheid political discourse as a reference to pro-apartheid or allegedly pro-apartheid organisations.

Zuma, in turn, condemned both the attacks and the Mbeki government's response to the attacks; Zuma also lamented the usage of his trademark song ''[[Umshini wami]]'' by the rioters.&lt;ref name="umshini wami"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=vn20080519055011398C263403|title= Umshini isn't a song to kill, says Zuma|publisher=IOL|accessdate=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary-General [[Gwede Mantashe]] called for the creation of local committees to combat violence against foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/anctoday/2008/at20.htm#preslet|title="Xenophobia is a crime", Volume 8, No. 20 • 23 —29&amp;nbsp;May 2008|publisher=ANC Today|accessdate=23 May 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626031207/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/anctoday/2008/at20.htm#preslet |archivedate = 26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7417590.stm|title=ANC call to 'retake the streets'|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=23 May 2008 | date=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zille was also criticised by Finance Minister [[Trevor Manuel]] for being quoted in the [[Cape Argus]] as saying that foreigners were responsible for a bulk of the drug trade in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24.com/news/?p=tsa&amp;i=922076 |title=Manuel slams 'reckless' Zille |publisher=24.com |accessdate=23 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610154906/http://www.24.com/news/?p=tsa&amp;i=922076 |archivedate=10 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[KwaZulu-Natal]] province, [[Bheki Cele]], provincial community safety minister, blamed the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]], a nationalist Zulu political party, for stoking and capitalising on the violence in Durban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,169968,00.html |title=Fingerpointing after KZN hostel attack |publisher=SABC |accessdate=21 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612135400/http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0%2C2172%2C169968%2C00.html |archivedate=12 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Cele and premier [[S'bu Ndebele]] claimed that IFP members had attacked a tavern that catered to Nigerian immigrants en route to a party meeting. The IFP, which is based primarily in the predominantly ethnically-[[Zulu people|Zulu]] KwaZulu-Natal province, rejected the statements, and had, on 20 May, engaged in an anti-xenophobia meeting with the [[African National Congress|ANC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/politics/the_parties/0,2172,169940,00.html |title=ANC, IFP join forces to help fight xenophobia |publisher=SABC |accessdate=21 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612135349/http://www.sabcnews.com/politics/the_parties/0%2C2172%2C169940%2C00.html |archivedate=12 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical grassroots movements and organisations came out strongly against the 2008 xenophobic attacks calling them [[pogroms]] promoted by government and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abahlali.org/node/3582|title=Abahlali baseMjondolo Statement on the Xenophobic Attacks in Johannesburg|publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have claimed that local politicians and police have sanctioned the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.co.za/index/article.aspx?pDesc=85705,1,22 |title=Leadership blamed for xenophobic attacks |publisher=The Citizen }}&lt;/ref&gt; At they time they also called for the closure of the [[Lindela Repatriation Centre]] which is seen as an example of the negative way the South African government treats African foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apf.org.za/article.php3?id_article=319 |title=Shut down Lindela!

===International reaction===
The attacks were condemned by a wide variety of organisations and government leaders throughout Africa and the rest of the world.

The Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] expressed concerns about the violence and urged the South African government to cease deportation of Zimbabwean nationals and also to allow the refugees and asylum seekers to regularise their stay in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-05-23-voa40.cfm |title=UNHCR Concerned About Violence Against Immigrants in South Africa |publisher=Voice of America |accessdate=24 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527053317/http://voanews.com/english/2008-05-23-voa40.cfm |archivedate=27 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawi began repatriation of some of its nationals in South Africa. The Mozambican government sponsored a repatriation drive that saw the registration of at least 3 275 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=15&amp;art_id=nw20080521193649317C914062|title= Thousands of Mozambicans return home|publisher=IOL|accessdate=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks in 2009–12==
[[File:Fan Walk For Peace And Unity (4813216834) (2).jpg|thumb|Anti-xenophobia walk on [[Mandela Day]] 2010, Cape Town]]
In late May 2009, reports emerged regarding a possible resurgence of xenophobic related activity and the organising of attacks in the Western Cape.

In November 2009, a community of 1500-2500 Zimbabwean farm workers was forcibly evicted from their homes in the informal settlements of De Doorns, a grape-farming town in the Western Cape. No persons were physically assaulted but homes were trashed and looted and this led to the biggest displacement of foreign nationals since May 2008. The Zimbabweans were then housed in a displaced persons' camp where some remained for a year until it was closed. Researchers identified the role of a ward councillor, Mpumelelo Lubisi, in inciting the attack in possible collusion with informal labour brokers who had financial interests in getting rid of their Zimbabwean competitors. South African workers also accused farmers of employing the Zimbabweans at less than minimum wage (farmers and Zimbabwean workers denied this).&lt;ref&gt;(Misago, JP. (2009) Violence, Labour and the

In 2010 the press carried numerous articles claiming that there would be massive planned xenophobic violence at the end of the 2010 Football World Cup.

==="Fortress South Africa"===
South Africa's borders have been militarised. According to Christopher McMichael:

"This shared state-corporate project of building up a 'fortress South Africa' also reveals a deeply entrenched seam of xenophobia, in which undocumented migrants and refugees from African countries are painted as a security risk akin to terrorism and organised crime. Parliamentary discussions on border security are rife with claims that foreign nationals are attempting to drain social grants and economic opportunities from citizens. The packaging of illegal immigration as a national security threat, which often relies on unsubstantiated claims about the inherent criminality of foreign nationals, provides an official gloss on deeply entrenched governmental xenophobia, in which African immigrants are targets for regular harassment, rounding up and extortion by the police.  This normalisation of immigrants as figures of  resentment may also fuel outbreaks of xenophobic violence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/chris-mcmichael/re-militarisation-of-south-africa%E2%80%99s-borders The re-militarisation of South Africa’s borders], Christopher McMichael, ''Open Democracy'', July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 2015 attacks===
{{Main|2015 South African xenophobic riots}}
[[File:People's March Anti Xenophobia.jpg|thumb|March against xenophobia, Johannesburg, 23 April 2015]]
In April 2015, there was an upsurge in xenophobic attacks throughout the country. The attacks started in Durban and spread to Johannesburg. [[Zulu people|Zulu]] King [[Goodwill Zwelithini]] has been accused of fuelling the attacks by saying that foreigners should "go back to their countries".&lt;ref name="Afssawvf"&gt;{{cite news|title=Attacks on foreigners spread in South Africa; weekend violence feared|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-south-africa-foreigners-20150417-story.html|accessdate=18 April 2015|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hundreds/&gt;

Locals looted foreigners' shops and attacked immigrants in general, forcing hundreds to relocate to police stations across the country. The [[Malawi]]an authorities subsequently began repatriating their nationals, and a number of other foreign governments also announced that they would evacuate their citizens.&lt;ref name="Afssawvf"/&gt; More than 300 people were arrested.&lt;ref name=Hundreds&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32372501 | title=South Africa anti-immigrant violence: Hundreds held | work=BBC News | date=19 April 2015 | accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 2015 a photographer from the Sunday Times, [[James Oatway]], photographed a brutal attack on a Mozambican man.

===October 2015 Attacks===

In October 2015 there were sustained xenophobic attacks in [[Grahamstown]] in the [[Eastern Cape]]. It as reported than more than 500 people were displaced and more than 300 shops and homes looted and, in some cases, destroyed altogether. In these attacks Muslims were specifically targeted.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2015-10-29-xenophobia-in-grahamstown-we-are-not-leaving/  Xenophobia in Grahamstown: 'We are not leaving!'], KJ VAN RENSBURG, F MTHONTI &amp; M ERSKOG, ''The Daily Maverick'', 29 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2015-10-27-where-poverty-meets-xenophobia-grahamstown-a-city-in-crisis/ Where poverty meets xenophobia: Grahamstown, a city in crisis], Paddy O'Halloran, ''The Daily Maverick'', 27 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jas.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/08/30/0021909616664920.abstract Contested Space and Citizenship in Grahamstown, South Africa], Paddy O'Halloran, ''Journal of Asian &amp; African Studies'', 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10130950.2016.1215647 The languages of xenophobia in post-apartheid South Africa: Reviewing migrancy, foreignness, and solidarity], Camalita Naicker, ''Agenda: Feminist Magazine", 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grahamstown xenophobic attacks that took place on October 21, 2015, and coincided with the [[FeesMustFall]] protest at [[Rhodes University]],  lasted for several days.

The attacks were instigated by the taxi drivers' protests, where the drivers' were protesting over the terrible state of roads, the rise in crime and rumours of murders committed by foreigners. Their demands were that the mayor ought to do something about their grievances. Their grievances were not addressed by the mayor.

On  21 October 2015 taxi drivers attacked [[spaza shops]] owned by Pakistani, Somali, Bangladeshi and Ethiopian residents of Grahamstown. There was a mobilisation of people by the taxi drivers, with the aim of attacking and looting shops owned by foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;P O'Halloran. Contested space and citizenship in Grahamstown, South Africa2016.http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021909616664920&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rumour that insinuated that foreigners were responsible for the rampant murders in town: that an "Arab man had killed and mutilated women" around town and that the police had not done anything to address these rumours. Grahamstown residents in the townships were angry at the police for not doing anything to dispel the rumours, despite having been warned by the councillors that the residents might end up taking the law into their own hands. Thus, it was these rumours that incited the attacks on foreigners.

On the 23rd of October, the [[Makana]] Municipality held a town meeting at City Hall. The meeting was focused on how the municipality and the South African police would pacify the residents and address the situation. During that meeting, there was no representative from the police and one of the ward councillors further legitimized the attacks through xenophobic sentiments centred on not giving foreigners a platform to have their own shops.&lt;ref&gt;P. O'Halloran. Where Poverty meets Xenophobia: Grahamstown, a city in crisis. Daily Maverick.2016.https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2015-10-27-where-poverty-meets-xenophobia-grahamstown-a-city-in-crisis/#.WjDZHVWWZ0w&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks continued, with taxi drivers transporting looters for free, according to the residents of Grahamstown.&lt;ref name="Space and Citizenship in Grahamstown"&gt;P O'Halloran. Contested space and citizenship in Grahamstown, South Africa. 2016.http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021909616664920&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports from the residents allege that the police's attitudes were that of indifference, with some participating in the looting.&lt;ref name="Space and Citizenship in Grahamstown"/&gt; The policing of the attacks was elitist as there was a line on Beaufort street which pointed out where looting would be tolerated and where it would not be. Thus, looting was allowed in the township and not tolerated in town.&lt;ref name="Space and Citizenship in Grahamstown"/&gt; The police only pacified the situation and restored order after a week of attacks and looting. The xenophobic attacks in Grahamstown differed from the usual xenophobic attacks in [[South Africa]] as the ones in Grahamstown were mostly targeted at [[Muslims]]. The main reason why Muslims were targeted was mainly due to the rumour that an Arab man was responsible for the murder of women in the town.

===Reactions===

South African Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu said that foreign business owners cannot expect to co-exist peacefully with local business owners unless they share their trade secrets. According to Zulu, foreign business owners had an advantage over South African business owners due to marginalisation under apartheid. "They cannot barricade themselves in and not share their practices with local business owners," Zulu said.&lt;ref name=BDSECLIN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Magubane|first1=Khulekani|title=Reveal trade secrets, minister tells foreigners|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2015/01/28/reveal-trade-secrets-minister-tells-foreigners|website=Business Day|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments were met with widespread criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mind your own business, minister|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-01-29-mind-your-own-business-minister|website=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign business owners are not the enemy|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-02-02-00-foreign-business-owners-are-not-the-enemy-da|website=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small business minister wants spaza-shop trade secrets|url=http://www.thedailyvox.co.za/small-business-minister-wants-spaza-shop-trade-secrets/|website=The Daily Vox|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquiry by the Competition Commission – the country's anti-trust regulator, has indicated that a difference in performance between foreign and local business owners has created a perception that foreigners are more successful than locals. While there is nothing wrong with examining the dynamics of competition, the insinuation that foreign business owners were to blame for the decline of South African-owned small business was worrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small foreign-owned retailers in South Africa are more competitive than local rivals|url=http://qz.com/431733/small-foreign-owned-retailers-in-south-africa-are-more-competitive-than-local-rivals/|website=Quartz Africa|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanya Gastrow, a researcher from the African Centre for Migration in Johannesburg, published a case study on the economics of small traders in South Africa. The study titled "Somalinomics", outlined the trade practices of Somali traders in South Africa. According to Gastrow, most small foreign retailers set a low mark-up to make a high turnover, they locate their businesses in highly trafficked pedestrian areas, they open early and close late and have a wider product range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalinomics: A Case study on the economics of Somali informal trade in the Western Cape|url=https://www.academia.edu/6827880/Somalinomics_A_case_study_on_the_economics_of_Somali_informal_trade_in_Cape_Town|website=Academia|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
