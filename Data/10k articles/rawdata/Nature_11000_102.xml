      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2413">The '''Affleck–Dine mechanism''' ('''AD mechanism''') is a postulated mechanism for explaining [[baryogenesis]] during the primordial Universe immediately following the [[Big Bang]]. Thus, the AD mechanism may explain the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter in the current Universe. It was proposed in 1985 by [[Ian Affleck]] and [[Michael Dine]] of Princeton University.&lt;ref name=npbppB249_2_361/&gt;

In the [[supersymmetry]] theory of [[particle physics]], ordinary [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s have scalar partners that carry [[Baryon number|baryon]] and [[lepton number]]s. As the latter decay into [[fermion]]s during the early Universe, the net baryon number that they carry can then form the currently observed excess of ordinary baryons. This occurs due to interactions of the scalars with the [[inflaton]] field, resulting in [[CP violation]]s.&lt;ref name=muelmenstaedt2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=rmp76_1_1/&gt;

The AD mechanism must have occurred during or after the reheating event that followed [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]]. This may explain why the net mass of normal matter and [[dark matter]] are apparently so close to each other, rather than being widely different.&lt;ref name=rmp76_1_1/&gt;

'''Agrocarbon''' is the international brand name of biochar products produced by 3Ragrocabon. 3Ragrocarbon is owned and operated by Terra Humanities LTD, a Swedish ecological-innovation technology and engineering company. 3RAgrocarbon utilizes patented 3R zero-emission Pyrolysis to create environmentally friendly bio-char and soil-nutrient enrichment products. The firm is headquartered in Hungary where its main production facility is located. The company is supported by, and partnered with the European Union on several projects focused on eco-safe agricultural and soil nutrient initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ragrocarbon.com/project-reference|title=3R Project references {{!}} 3R Agrocarbon|website=www.3ragrocarbon.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Agrocarbon is applied in all formulations, from stand alone biofertilizer to any combination as compost or soil activator. The refined and formulated Agrocarbon products are multi effect used for sustainable soil&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Someus|first=Edward|title=Selection of phosphorus solubilizing bacteria with biocontrol potential for growth in phosphorus rich animal bone charcoal|year=2010|author2=J.

This includes economical food crop production and forest nursery, biological pest control, natural fertilization, soil moisture retention,  restoration of [[soil biodiversity]] and natural balance.

==Agrocarbon Production==

Agrocarbons are created using 3R slow pyrolysis. The process entails the input of high quality plant or animal biomass/waste in to a large horizontal rotating kiln. The kiln is specifically engineered for this process and is then heated between 450&amp;nbsp;°C - 850° with varying core temperatures. This causes the reductive thermal decomposition of the biomass input and creates Agrocarbons which can be utilized for a number of agricultural and industrial purposes ranging from soil enhancers to renewable energy. The 3R pyrolysis process is an original development and innovation of Terra Humana ltd. The development of this process is very substantial as most other pyrolysis methods are unable to operate efficiently on an industrial scale. 3R pyrolysis technology was proven and demonstrated at a technical readiness level of 8 and will soon reach level 9.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ragrocarbon.com/3r-pyrolysis-process-competitive-advantages-and-characteristics|title=The 3R Pyrolysis Process Competitive Advantages and Characteristics {{!}} 3R Agrocarbon|website=www.3ragrocarbon.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this process is to add value to otherwise wasted animal and plant byproducts.

==Zero Emission==

All of the materials and gases used in the Agrocarbon development process are reused and recycled. Gases resulting from the 3R pyrolysis process are captured and chemically processed to create liquid bio-fuels. 3r Agrocarbon meets all environmental standards of the European Union and United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Product differentiation==

3R agrocarbon is used as a soil nutrient enhancer to help recover phosphorus. Phosphorus is an element that is required for all organic life and is imperative to healthy plant growth. Most agricultural producers utilize phosphorus fertilizers, however these types of fertilizers are created using phosphate rocks which are non-renewable resources. 3R agrocarbon is rich in phosphorus due to its biomass inputs. In addition, the porous structure of the Agrocarbon bone-char is ideal for microbes beneficial to crop growth and can also be utilized to carry biological control agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/agriculture/success_protector_en.htm "http://ec.europa.eu/research/agriculture/success_protector_en.htm European Union Project Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830130718/http://ec.europa.eu/research/agriculture/success_protector_en.htm|date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4809">'''Ann Haymond Zwinger''' (1925–2014) was the author of many natural histories noted for detail and lyrical prose.

==Background==
Ann Haymond Zwinger was born March 12, 1925, in Muncie, [[Indiana]], the daughter of William and Ann Haymond. While young, she lived along the White River. She studied art history and was awarded two degrees, an A.B. in Arts in 1946 by [[Wellesley College]] with the designation "Wellesley College Scholar," now considered roughly equivalent to "cum laude," and an A.M. in Fine Arts by [[Indiana University]] in 1950. She married Herman H. Zwinger, a pilot, in 1952. She taught Southwest Studies and English at [[Colorado College]].

She died in Portland, Oregon on August 30, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hazlehurst|first1=John|title=Goodbye, Ann Zwinger|url=http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/goodbye-ann-zwinger/Content?oid=2937750|newspaper=Colorado Springs Independent|date=Sep 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ann Zwinger obituary|url=http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Ann-Zwinger&amp;lc=9588&amp;pid=172303298&amp;uuid=781fb471-efb6-440d-84f1-f58f540a06c8|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
She and co-author Beatrice Willard were finalists for the 1973 [[National Book Award]] in science for "Land Above the Trees." In 1976, she received the [[John Burroughs Medal|John Burroughs Memorial Association Gold Medal]] for a distinguished contribution in natural history, ''Run, River, Run''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Burroughs Medal Award List|url=http://www.johnburroughsassociation.org/index.php/literary-awards|website=John Burroughs Association|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same book, she also received the Friends of American Writers Award for non-fiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16359">{{Wiktionary|barycenter}}

The '''barycenter''' (or '''barycentre'''; from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|βαρύς}} ''heavy'' + {{lang|grc|κέντρον}} ''centre''&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[center of mass]] of two or more bodies that [[orbit]] each other and is the point about which the bodies orbit. It is an important concept in fields such as [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]]. The distance from a body's center of mass to the barycenter can be calculated as a [[two-body problem]].

If one of two orbiting bodies is much more massive than the other and the bodies are relatively close to one another, the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object. In this case, rather than the two bodies appearing to orbit a point between them, the less massive body will appear to orbit about the more massive body, while the more massive body might be observed to wobble slightly. This is the case for the [[Lunar theory|Earth–Moon system]], in which the barycenter is located on average {{convert|4671|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth's center, 75% of the Earth's radius of {{convert|6378|km|mi|abbr=on}}. When the two bodies are of similar masses, the barycenter will generally be located between them and both bodies will follow an orbit around it. This is the case for [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], as well as for many [[binary asteroid]]s and [[binary star]]s. When the less massive object is far away, the barycenter can be located outside the more massive object. This is the case for [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and the [[Sun]]; despite the Sun being thousandfold more massive than Jupiter, their barycenter is slightly outside the Sun due to the relatively large distance between them.&lt;ref name="MacDougal" /&gt;

In astronomy, '''barycentric coordinates''' are non-rotating coordinates with the origin at the barycenter of two or more bodies. The [[International Celestial Reference System]] is a barycentric coordinate system centered on the [[Solar System]]'s barycenter.

In [[geometry]], the term ''barycenter'' is synonymous with [[centroid]], the geometric center of a geometric figure.
&lt;!-- 
#transferred lead-content#
is the point between two objects where they balance each other. For example, it is the center of mass where two or more celestial bodies [[orbit]] each other. When a [[natural satellite|moon]] orbits a [[planet]], or a planet orbits a [[star]], both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that is not at the center of the primary (the larger body). For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the [[Earth]], but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately {{convert|1710|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface of the Earth ({{convert|4661|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Earth's center, about 74% of Earth's radius), where their respective masses balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the [[Sun]].

The barycenter is one of the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the [[elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]] of each body. This is an important concept in the fields of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]]. If ''a'' is the distance between the centers of the two bodies (the semi-major axis of the system), ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]] of the primary's orbit around the barycenter, and {{nowrap|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the semi-major axis of the secondary's orbit. When the barycenter is located ''within'' the more massive body, that body will appear to "wobble" rather than to follow a discernible orbit. In a simple two-body case, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the distance from the center of the primary to the barycenter is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 = a \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{a}{1 + \frac{m_1}{m_2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where :
:''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[distance]] from body 1 to the barycenter
:''a'' is the distance between the centers of the two bodies
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[mass]]es of the two bodies.

The following table sets out some examples from the [[Solar System]]. Figures are given rounded to three [[significant figures]]. The term primary–secondary is used to distinguish between involved participants; with the larger called "the primary", and the smaller called "the secondary".

=== Inside or outside the Sun? ===
[[File:Solar system barycenter.svg|thumb|Motion of the [[Solar System]]'s barycenter relative to the Sun]]

If {{nowrap|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} — which is true for the Sun and any planet — then the ratio {{sfrac|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} approximates to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{R_1} \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the barycenter of the Sun–planet system will lie outside the Sun only if:

:&lt;math&gt;{a \over R_\odot} \cdot {m_\mathrm{planet} \over m_\odot} &gt; 1 \; \Rightarrow \; {a \cdot m_\mathrm{planet}} &gt; {R_\odot \cdot m_\odot} \approx 2.3 \times 10^{11} \; m_\oplus \; \mbox{km} \approx 1530 \; m_\oplus \; \mbox{AU}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, where the planet is massive ''and'' far from the Sun.

If Jupiter had [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit ({{convert|57900000|km|AU|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), the Sun–Jupiter barycenter would be approximately 55,000&amp;nbsp;km from the center of the Sun ({{nowrap|{{sfrac|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} ≈ 0.08}}). But even if the Earth had [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris']] orbit ({{convert|68|AU|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), the Sun–Earth barycenter would still be within the Sun (just over 30,000&amp;nbsp;km from the center).

To calculate the actual motion of the Sun, you only need to consider the motions of the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). The contributions of all other planets, dwarf planets, etc. are negligible. If the four giant planets were on a straight line on the same side of the Sun, the combined center of mass would lie about 1.17 solar radii or just over 810,000&amp;nbsp;km above the Sun's surface.&lt;ref name=Meeus1997/&gt;

The calculations above are based on the mean distance between the bodies and yield the mean value ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But all celestial orbits are elliptical, and the distance between the bodies varies between the [[apsis|apses]], depending on the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]], ''e''. Hence, the position of the barycenter varies too, and it is possible in some systems for the barycenter to be ''sometimes inside and sometimes outside'' the more massive body. This occurs where:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-e} &gt; \frac{r_1}{R_1} &gt; \frac{1}{1+e}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the Sun–Jupiter system, with ''e''&lt;sub&gt;Jupiter&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.0484, just fails to qualify: {{nowrap|1.05 &lt; 1.07 &gt; 0.954}}.

== Relativistic corrections ==

In [[classical mechanics]], this definition simplifies calculations and introduces no known problems. In [[general relativity]], problems arise because, while it is possible, within reasonable approximations, to define the barycenter, the associated coordinate system does not fully reflect the inequality of clock rates at different locations. Brumberg explains how to set up barycentric coordinates in general relativity.&lt;ref name="Brumberg" /&gt;

The coordinate systems involve a world-time, i.e. a global time coordinate that could be set up by [[telemetry]]. Individual clocks of similar construction will not agree with this standard, because they are subject to differing [[gravitational potential]]s or move at various velocities, so the world-time must be slaved to some ideal clock that is assumed to be very far from the whole self-gravitating system. This time standard is called [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]], or TCB.

[[File:Bimetallic stripe.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a bimetallic strip showing how the difference in thermal expansion in the two metals leads to a much larger sideways displacement of the strip]]
[[File:Bimetal coil reacts to lighter.gif|frame|right|A bimetallic coil from a thermometer reacts to the heat from a lighter, by uncoiling and then coiling back up when the lighter is removed.]]
A '''bimetallic strip''' is used to convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement. The strip consists of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated, usually [[steel]] and [[copper]], or in some cases steel and [[brass]]. The strips are joined together throughout their length by [[rivet]]ing, [[brazing]] or [[welding]]. The different expansions force the flat strip to bend one way if heated, and in the opposite direction if cooled below its initial temperature. The metal with the higher [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] is on the outer side of the curve when the strip is heated and on the inner side when cooled.

The sideways displacement of the strip is much larger than the small lengthways expansion in either of the two metals. This effect is used in a range of mechanical and electrical devices. In some applications the bimetal strip is used in the flat form. In others, it is wrapped into a coil for compactness. The greater length of the coiled version gives improved sensitivity.

== History ==
[[File:John Harrison memorial 02.jpg|thumb|200px|John Harrison's Memorial in Westminster Abbey, London]]

The earliest surviving bimetallic strip was made by the eighteenth-century [[clockmaker]] [[John Harrison]] who is generally credited with its invention. He made it for his third [[marine chronometer]] (H3) of 1759  to compensate for temperature-induced changes in the [[balance spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sobel |first= Dava | authorlink= Dava Sobel |title= [[Longitude (book)|Longitude]] |year= 1995 |publisher= Fourth Estate |location= London |isbn= 0-00-721446-4 | pages= 103 | quote= One of the inventions Harrison introduced in H-3... is called... a bi-metallic strip.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the bimetallic mechanism for correcting for thermal expansion in his [[gridiron pendulum]]. His earliest examples had two individual metal strips joined by rivets but he also invented the later technique of directly fusing molten brass onto a steel substrate. A strip of this type was fitted to his last timekeeper, H5. Harrison's invention is recognized in the memorial to him in [[Westminster Abbey]], England.

==Applications==

===Clocks===
Mechanical [[clock]] mechanisms are sensitive to temperature changes as each part has tiny tolerance and it leads to errors in time keeping. A bimetallic strip is used to compensate this phenomenon in the mechanism of some timepieces. The most common method is to use a bimetallic construction for the circular rim of the [[balance wheel]]. What it does is move a weight in a radial way looking at the circular plane down by the balance wheel, varying then, the momentum of inertia of the balance wheel. As the spring controlling the balance becomes weaker with the increasing temperature, the balance becomes smaller in diameter to decrease the momentum of inertia and keep the period of oscillation (and hence timekeeping) constant.

Nowadays this system is not used anymore since the appearance of low temperature coefficient alloys like [[nivarox]], parachrom and many others depending on each brand.

===Thermostats===
[[File:WPThermostat new.jpg|thumb|Thermostat with bimetal coil at (2)]]

{{see also|Tipping point (physics)#Set-point thermostats|label 1=Tipping points and 'popping disc' bimetal thermostats}}
In the regulation of heating and cooling, [[thermostat]]s that operate over a wide range of temperatures are used. In these, one end of the bimetallic strip is mechanically fixed and attached to an electrical power source, while the other (moving) end carries an electrical contact. In adjustable thermostats another contact is positioned with a regulating knob or lever. The position so set controls the regulated temperature, called the ''set point''.

Some thermostats use a [[mercury switch]] connected to both electrical leads. The angle of the entire mechanism is adjustable to control the set point of the thermostat.

Depending upon the application, a higher temperature may open a contact (as in a [[heater]] control) or it may close a contact (as in a [[refrigerator]] or [[air conditioner]]).

The electrical contacts may control the power directly (as in a household iron) or indirectly, switching electrical power through a [[relay]] or the supply of [[natural gas]] or [[fuel oil]] through an electrically operated valve. In some natural gas heaters the power may be provided with a [[thermocouple]] that is heated by a pilot light (a small, continuously burning, flame). In devices without pilot lights for ignition (as in most modern gas clothes dryers and some natural gas heaters and decorative fireplaces) the power for the contacts is provided by reduced household electrical power that operates a relay controlling an electronic ignitor, either a resistance heater or an electrically powered [[spark gap|spark]] generating device.

===Thermometers===
A direct indicating dial [[thermometer]] really common in daily use devices (such as a patio thermometer or a meat thermometer) uses a bimetallic strip wrapped into a coil in its most used design. The coil changes the lineal movement of the metal expansion into a circular movement thanks to the helicoidal shape it draws. One end of the coil is fixed to the housing of the device as a fix point and the other drives an indicating needle inside a circular indicator. A bimetallic strip is also used in a [[recording thermometer]]. [[Breguet's thermometer]] consists of a tri-metallic helix in order to have a more accurate results.

===Heat engine===
Heat engines are not the most efficient ones, and with the use of bimetallic strips the efficiency of the heat engines is even lower as there is no chamber to contain the heat. Moreover, the bimetallic strips cannot produce strength in its moves, the reason why is that in order to achieve reasonables bendings (movements) both metallic strips have to be thin to make the difference between the expansion noticeable.  So the uses for metallic strips in heat engines are mostly in simple toys that have been built to demonstrate how the principle can be used to drive a [[heat engine]].&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

===Electrical devices===
Bimetal strips are used in miniature [[circuit breaker]]s to protect circuits from excess current. A coil of wire is used to heat a bimetal strip, which bends and operates a linkage that unlatches a spring-operated contact. This interrupts the circuit and can be reset when the bimetal strip has cooled down.

Bimetal strips are also used in time-delay relays, lamp flashers, and [[Fluorescent lamp#Starting|fluorescent lamp starters]]. In some devices the current running directly through the bimetal strip is sufficient to heat it and operate contacts directly.

==Calculations==
[[Curvature]] of a bimetallic beam:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \frac{6 E_1 E_2 (h_1 + h_2)h_1 h_2 \epsilon }{E_1^2 h_1^4 + 4 E_1 E_2 h_1^3 h_2 + 6 E_1 E_2 h_1^2 h_2^2 + 4 E_1 E_2 h_2^3 h_1 + E_2^2 h_2^4}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Young's modulus]] and height (thickness) of material one and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt; are the Young's modulus and height (thickness) of material two. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the misfit strain, calculated by:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = (\alpha_1-\alpha_2) \Delta T \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of thermal expansion of material one and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of thermal expansion of material two. ΔT is the current temperature minus the reference temperature (the temperature where the beam has no flexure).&lt;ref&gt;Clyne, TW. “Residual stresses in surface coatings and their effects on interfacial debonding.” Key Engineering Materials (Switzerland).

The '''Calymmian Period''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] κάλυμμα ''(kálymma)'', meaning "cover") is the first [[geologic]] [[geologic period|period]] in the [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[Era (geology)|Era]] and lasted from {{Period start|Calymmian}} [[annum|Mya]] to {{Period start|Ectasian}} Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on [[stratigraphy]], these dates are defined [[Absolute dating|chronometrically]].

The period is characterised by expansion of existing [[platform cover]]s, or by new [[continental shelf|platform]]s on recently [[craton]]ized [[Basement (geology)|basement]]s.

The [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] broke up during the Calymmian some 1500 Mya.

The '''Chhota Nagpur Plateau''' is a [[plateau]] in eastern India, which covers much of [[Jharkhand]] state as well as adjacent parts of [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Chhattisgarh]]. The [[Indo-Gangetic plain]] lies to the north and east of the plateau, and the basin of the [[Mahanadi River]] lies to the south. The total area of the Chota Nagpur Plateau is approximately {{convert|65000|km2}}.&lt;ref name=maps&gt;{{cite web   |url = http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/geography/chhota-nagpur-plateau.html   |title = Chhota Nagpur Plateau   |publisher = mapsofindia   |accessdate = 2010-05-02   |deadurl = yes   |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090917115436/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/geography/chhota-nagpur-plateau.html   |archivedate = 2009-09-17   |df =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Nagpur'' is probably taken from [[Nagavanshi]]s, who ruled in this part of the country. ''Chhota'' (=''small'' in Hindi and Urdu) is also the name of a village in the outskirts of [[Ranchi]], which has the remains of an old fort belonging to the [[Nagavanshi]]s.&lt;ref name=houlton&gt;Sir John Houlton, ''Bihar, the Heart of India'', pp. 127-128, Orient Longmans, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Damodarbksc.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Damodar River]] flows through Chota Nagpur Plateau]]
The Chhota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau&amp;mdash;an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth.&lt;ref name=yashplasingh&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-JtQE2FmsIkC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Ranchi+plateau#v=onepage&amp;q=Ranchi%20plateau&amp;f=false | title = Geography By Yash Pal Singh |publisher = |accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gondwana]] substrates attest to the plateau's ancient origin. It is part of the Deccan Plate, which broke free from the southern continent during the [[Cretaceous]] to embark on a 50-million-year journey that was violently interrupted by the northern Eurasian continent. The northeastern part of the [[Deccan Plateau]], where this ecoregion sits, was the first area of contact with Eurasia.&lt;ref name=ecoregion&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eoearth.org/article/Chhota-Nagpur_dry_deciduous_forests | title = Chhota-Nagpur dry deciduous forests |publisher = The Encyclopaedia of Earth |accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The Chhota Nagpur Plateau consists of three steps. The highest step is in the western part of the plateau, where ''pats'', as a plateau is locally called, are {{convert|3000|to|3500|ft|m|order=flip}} above sea level. The highest point is {{convert|3819|ft|m|order=flip}}. The next part contains larger portions of the old Ranchi and Hazaribagh districts and some parts of old Palamu district, before these were broken up into smaller administrative units. The general height is {{convert|2000|ft|m|order=flip}}. The topography in undulating with prominent gneissic hills, often dome-like in outline. The lowest step of the plateau is at an average level of around {{convert|1000|ft|m|order=flip}}. It covers the old Manbhum and Singhbhum districts. High hills are a striking part of this section - [[Parasnath Hills]] rise to a height of {{convert|4480|ft|m|order=flip}} and [[Dalma Hills]] to {{convert|3407|ft|m|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=houlton/&gt; The large plateau is subdivided into several small plateaux or sub plateaux.

===Pat region===
The western plateau with an average elevation of {{convert|1000|m}} above mean sea level merges into the plateau of [[Surguja district]] of Chhattisgarh. The flat topped plateaux, locally known as ''pats'' are characterized by level surface and accordance of their summit levels shows they are part of one large plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pzuBxr3AFp4C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Pat+region+Ranchi+plateau#v=onepage&amp;q=Pat%20region%20Ranchi%20plateau&amp;f=false | title = Perspectives in geomorphology By Hari Shanker Sharma |publisher = |accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Netarhat Pat, Jamira Pat, Khamar Pat, Rudni Pat etc. The area is also referred to as Western Ranchi Plateau. It is believed to be composed of Deccan lava.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web |url =http://jharenvis.nic.in/files/State%20Of%20Jharkhand-Overview.pdf |title =Jharkhand Overview |publisher = |accessdate =2010-05-02 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090410035843/http://jharenvis.nic.in/files/State%20Of%20Jharkhand-Overview.pdf |archivedate =2009-04-10 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ranchi plateau===
[[File:Dassam falls.jpg|thumb|270px|Dassam falls in the plateau]]
It is the largest part of the Chhota Nagpur Plateau. The elevation of the plateau land in this part is about {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} and gradually slopes down towards south-east into the hilly and undulating region of Singhbhum (earlier Singhbhum district or what is now [[Kolhan division]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Effects+of+Urbanisation+on+ground+water+in+Ranchi.-a0222519725 | title = Effects of Urbanisation on ground water in Ranchi. |publisher = |accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plateau is highly dissected. [[Damodar River]] originates here and flows through a rift valley.&lt;ref name=yashplasingh/&gt; To the north it is separated from the Hazaribagh plateau by the Damodar trough.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; To  the west is a group of plateaux called ''pat''&lt;ref name=yashplasingh/&gt;

There are many waterfalls at the edges of Ranchi plateau where rivers coming from over the plateau surface form waterfalls when they descend through the precipitous escarpments of the plateau and enter the area of significantly lower height. The [[North Karo River]] has formed a {{convert|17|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} high Pheruaghaugh Falls at the southern margin of Ranchi plateau. Such falls are called scarp falls. [[Hundru Falls]] (75 m) on [[Subarnarekha River]] near Ranchi, [[Dassam Falls]] (39.62 m) on Kanchi River, east of Ranchi, [[Sadni Falls]] (60 m) on Sankh River (Ranchi plateau) are examples of scarp falls. Sometimes waterfalls of various dimensions are formed when tributary streams join the master stream from great height forming hanging valleys. At [[Rajrappa]] (10 m), the Bhera river coming over from the Ranchi plateau hangs above the Damodar River at its point of confluence with the latter. The [[Jonha Falls]] (25.9 m) is another example of this category of falls. In fact the Gunga River hangs over its master stream, Raru River (to the east of Ranchi city) and forms the said falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1Y_Ytx9wp4C&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=Ranchi+plateau#v=onepage&amp;q=Ranchi%20plateau&amp;f=false |title=Physical Geography: Hydrosphere By K. Bharatdwaj |publisher= |accessdate=2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazaribagh plateau===
The Hazaribagh plateau is often subdivided into two parts – the ''higher plateau'' and the ''lower plateau''. Here the higher plateau is referred to as Hazaribagh plateau and the lower plateau as Koderma plateau. The Hazaribagh plateau on which [[Hazaribagh|Hazaribagh town]] is built is about {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} east by west and {{convert|15|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north by south with an average elevation of {{convert|2000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The north-eastern and southern faces are mostly abrupt; but to the west it narrows and descends slowly in the neighbourhood.of Simaria and Jabra where it curves to the south and connects with the Ranchi Plateau through Tori pargana.&lt;ref name=lister&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ROvfeX34PAC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Hazaribagh+plateau#v=onepage&amp;q=Hazaribagh%20plateau&amp;f=false |title=Hazaribagh By Edward Lister |publisher= |accessdate=2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally separated from the Ranchi plateau by the Damodar trough.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

The western portion of Hazaribagh plateau constitutes a broad watershed between the [[Damodar River|Damodar]] drainage on the south and the [[Lilajan River|Lilajan]] and [[Mohana River|Mohana]] rivers on the north. The highest hills in this area are called after the villages of Kasiatu, Hesatu and Hudu, and rise fronting the south {{convert|600|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} above the general level of the plateau. Further east along the southern face a long spur projects right up to the Damodar river where it ends in Aswa Pahar, elevation {{convert|2465|ft|m|order=flip}}. At the south-eastern corner of the plateau is Jilinga Hill at {{convert|3057|ft|m|order=flip}}. Mahabar Jarimo at {{convert|2185|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} and Barsot at {{convert|2180|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} stand in isolation to the east, and on the north-west edge of the plateau Sendraili at {{convert|2210|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} and [[Mahuda]] at {{convert|2409|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} are the most prominent features. Isolated on the plateau, in the neighbourhood of Hazaribagh town are four hills of which the highest Chendwar rises to {{convert|2810|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}. On all sides it has an exceedingly abrupt scarp, modified only on the south-east. In the south it falls almost sheer in a swoop of {{convert|2200|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the bed of [[Bokaro River]], below Jilinga Hill. Seen from the north the edge of this plateau has the appearance of a range of hills,&lt;ref name=lister/&gt; at the foot of which (on the Koderma plateau) runs the [[Grand Trunk Road]] and [[National Highway 2 (India, old numbering)|NH 2]] (new [[National Highway 19 (India)|NH19]]).

===Koderma plateau===
The Koderma plateau is also referred to as the Hazaribagh lower plateau&lt;ref name=lister/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nrdms.gov.in/acquifer_geometry.asp | title =Natural Resources Data Management System |publisher =Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India |accessdate = 2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as the Chauparan-Koderma-Girighi sub-plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jharkhandforest.com/files/Hazaribagh_Introduction.pdf |title = Forest Resources Survey, Hazaribagh 2004 |publisher =  |accessdate = 2010-05-02 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141028111157/http://www.jharkhandforest.com/files/Hazaribagh_Introduction.pdf |archivedate = 2014-10-28 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern face of the Koderma plateau, elevated above the plains of Bihar, has the appearance of a range of hills, but in reality it is the edge of a plateau, {{convert|800|ft|m|order=flip}} from the level of the Gaya plain. Eastward this northern edge forms a well-defined watershed between heads of the tributaries of [[Gaya district|Gaya]] and those of the [[Barakar River]], which traverses the [[Koderma district|Koderma]] and [[Giridih district|Giridih]] districts in an easterly direction. The slope of this plateau to the east is uniform and gentle and is continued past the river, which bears to the south-east, into the Santhal Parganas and gradually disappears in the lower plains of Bengal. The western boundary of the plateau is formed by the deep bed of the [[Lilajan River]].The southern boundary consists of the face of the higher plateau, as far as its eastern extremity, where for some distance a low and undistinguished watershed runs eastward to the western spurs of [[Parasnath Hills]]. The drainage to the south of this low line passes by the [[Jamunia River]] to the Damodar.&lt;ref name=lister/&gt;

===Damodar trough===
The Damodar basin forms a trough between the Ranchi and Hazaribagh plateaux resulting from enormous fractures at their present edges, which caused the land between to sink to a great depth and incidentally preserved from denudation the Karanpura, Ramgarh and Bokaro coalfields. The northern boundary of the Damodar valley is steep as far as the south eastern corner of the Hazaribagh plateau. On the south of the trough the Damodar keeps close to the edge of the Ranchi plateau till it has passed Ramgarh, after which a turn to the north-east leaves on the right hand a wide and level valley on which the [[Subarnarekha River|Subarnarekha]] begins to intrude, south of Gola till the Singhpur Hills divert it to the south. Further to the east the Damodar River passes tamely into the Manbhum sector of lowest step of the Chotanagpur plateau.&lt;ref name=lister/&gt;

===Palamu===
The [[Palamu division]] generally lies at a lower height than the surrounding areas of Chota Nagpur Plateau. On the east the Ranchi plateau intrudes into the division and the southern part of the division merges with the Pat region. On the west are the Surguja highlands of Chhattishgarh and Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh. The [[Son River]] touches the north-western corner of the division and then forms the state boundary for about {{convert|45|mi|km|order=flip}}. The general system of the area is a series of parallel ranges of hills running east and west through which the [[North Koel River]] passes. The hills in the south are the highest in the area, and the picturesque and isolated cup-like Chhechhari valley is surrounded by lofty hills on every side. [[Lodh Falls]] drops from a height of {{convert|150|m}} from these hills, making it the highest waterfall on the Chota Nagpur Plateau. [[Netarhat]] and Pakripat plateaux are physiographically part of the Pat region.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Houlton, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.palamu.nic.in/gazette/general_gazette.doc| title = Gazetteer of Palamu District|publisher = |accessdate = 2010-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manbhum-Singhbhum===
[[File:Joy chandi pahar.jpg|thumb|270px|Joychandi Pahar in [[Purulia district]] in [[West Bengal]]]]
In the lowest step of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, the Manbhum area covers the present [[Purulia district]] in [[West Bengal]], and [[Dhanbad district]] and parts of [[Bokaro district]] in Jharkhand, and the Singhbhum area broadly covers [[Kolhan division]] of Jharkhand. The Manbhum area has a general elevation of about {{convert|1000|ft|m|order=flip}} and it consists of undulating land with scattered hills – Baghmundi and Ajodhya range, Panchakot and the hills around Jhalda are the prominent ones.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Houlton, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent [[Geography of Bankura district|Bankura district]] of West Bengal has been described as the “connecting link between the plains of Bengal on the east and Chota Nagpur plateau on the west.”&lt;ref&gt;O’Malley, L.S.S., ICS, ''Bankura'', Bengal District Gazetteers, pp. 1-20, 1995 reprint, Government of West Bengal&lt;/ref&gt; The same could be said of the [[Asansol subdivision|Asansol]] and [[Durgapur subdivision|Durgapur]] subdivisions of [[Bardhaman district]].Recently a website launched for chotonagpur Manbhum-Singhbhum region specially with the mission to save wildlife and conserve the forest in plateau. Visit [http://www.chotonagpurplateau.in chotonagpurplateau.in] for a detail information and articles.

The Singhbhum area contains much more hilly and broken country. The whole of the western part is a mass of hill ranges rising to {{convert|3000|ft|m|order=flip}} in the south-west. Jamshedpur sits on an open plateau, {{convert|400|to|800|ft|m|order=flip}} above mean sea level, with a higher plateau to the south of it. The eastern part is mostly hilly, though near the borders of West Bengal it flattens out into an alluvial plain.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Houlton, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; In the Singhbhum area, there are hills alternating with valleys, steep mountains, deep forests on the mountain slopes, and, in the river basins, some stretches of comparatively level or undulating country. The centre of the area consists of an upland plateau enclosed by hill ranges. This strip, extending from the Subarnarekha River on the east to the Angarbira range to the west of Chaibasa, is a very fertile area.  [[Saranda forest]] is reputed to have the best Sal forests in Asia.&lt;ref name=forest&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jharkhandforest.com/files/Chaibasa_Introduction.pdf |title = The West Singhbhum District |work =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 2010-04-20 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713104524/http://www.jharkhandforest.com/files/Chaibasa_Introduction.pdf |archivedate = 2011-07-13 |df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The Chhota Nagpur Plateau has an attractive climate. For five to six months of the year, from October onward the days are sunny and bracing. The mean temperature in December is {{convert|73|F|C|order=flip}}. The nights are cool and temperatures in winter may drop below freezing point in many places. In April and May the day temperature may cross {{convert|100|F|C|order=flip}} but it is very dry and not sultry as in the adjacent plains. The rainy season (June to September) is pleasant.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Houlton, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The Chota Nagpur Plateau receives an annual average rainfall of around {{convert|1400|mm|in}}, which is less than the rainforested areas of much of India and almost all of it in the [[monsoon]] months between June and August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/cltech/Damodar/1.1.htm | title = Damodar Valley | accessdate = 2008-05-25 | last =  | first =  | work = About the Region – Damodar Basin | publisher = Ministry of Environments and Forests | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182506/http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/cltech/Damodar/1.1.htm | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Sal (Shorea robusta)- new leaves with flower buds at Jayanti, Duars W Picture 120.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sal tree]]s (''Shorea robusta'') are found in forests of Chota Nagpur Plateau]]
The ''Chhota Nagpur dry deciduous forests'', a [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] [[ecoregion]], encompasses the plateau. The ecoregion has an area of {{convert|122100|km2|mi2}}, covering most of Jharkhand state and adjacent portions of Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.

The ecoregion is drier than surrounding ones, including the [[Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests]] that covers the [[Eastern Ghats]] and [[Satpura Range]] to the south, and the [[Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests]] in the lowlands to the east and north.

The plateau is covered with a variety of various habitats of which [[Shorea robusta|Sal]] forest is predominant. The plateau is home to the [[Palamau Tiger Reserve]] and other large blocks of natural habitat which are among the few remaining refuges left in India for large populations of [[tiger]] and [[Asian elephant]]s.&lt;ref name=ecoregion/&gt;

Forests range from dry to wet and reach up to {{convert|25|m|ft}} tall. The plateau is also swampy in some places and in other parts is covered with bamboo grasslands and shrubs such as ''[[Holarrhena]]'' and ''[[Dodonaea]]''. The flora of the plateau is distinct from the wetter parts of India that surround it and includes a number of endemic plants such as ''[[Aglaia haslettiana]]'' and endangered plant species including ''[[Madhuca longifolia]]'' and ''[[Butea monosperma]].''

Tigers, Asian elephants, [[four-horned antelope]] (''Tetracerus quadricornis''), [[blackbuck]] (''Antilope cervicapra''), [[chinkara]] (''Gazella bennettii''), [[dhole]] wild dog (''Cuon alpinus'') and [[sloth bear]] (''Melursus ursinus'') are some of the animals found here while birds include the threatened [[lesser florican]] (''Eupodotis indica''), [[Indian grey hornbill]] and other hornbills.

More than half of the natural forest on the plateau has been cleared for grazing land and the scale of the mining operations on the plateau is disturbing to the movement and therefore the survival of wildlife including elephants and tigers.

===Protected areas===
About 6&amp;nbsp;percent of the ecoregion's area is within protected areas, comprising {{convert|6720|km2|mi2}} in 1997. The largest are [[Palamau Tiger Reserve]] and [[Sanjay National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002).

==Minerals==
Chhota Nagpur plateau is a store house of minerals like [[mica]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]], [[limestone]], [[iron ore]] and [[coal]].&lt;ref name=yashplasingh/&gt; The Damodar valley is rich in coal and it is considered as the prime centre of [[Coke (fuel)|coking coal]] in the country. Massive coal deposits are found in the central basin spreading over {{convert|2883|km2|mi2}}. The important coalfields in the basin are [[Jharia]], [[Raniganj Coalfield|Raniganj]], [[West Bokaro Coalfield|West Bokaro]], [[East Bokaro Coalfield|East Bokaro]], [[Ramgarh Coalfield|Ramgarh]], [[South Karanpura Coalfield|South Karanpura]] and [[North Karanpura Coalfield|North Karanpura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/cltech/Damodar/2.4.htm |title=Mineral Resources and Coal Mining |publisher= |accessdate=2010-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815182912/http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/cltech/Damodar/2.4.htm |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Climatotherapy''' refers to temporary or permanent relocation of a patient to a region with a [[climate]] more favourable to recovery from or management of a condition. Examples include:
* The [[partial pressure]] of oxygen is lower at high altitude, so person with [[sickle cell disease]] might move to a lower altitude to reduce the number of sickle crises.&lt;ref name="urlSickle Cell Disease-What Increases Your Risk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/sickle-cell-disease-what-increases-your-risk |title=Sickle Cell Disease-What Increases Your Risk |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This is ''awfully'' close to [[WP:SYN]], as the source does not make any connection to "climatotherapy". --&gt;
* Several sites around the world are advertised or studied as possibly of therapeutic benefit to patients with [[psoriasis]], most notably the [[Dead Sea]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psoriasis.org/treatment/psoriasis/sun/other_sites.php Climatotherapy sites] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050612073241/http://www.psoriasis.org/treatment/psoriasis/sun/other_sites.php |date=2005-06-12 }} National Psoriasis Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodak2003&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies''' ('''CIMSS''') is a [[research institute]] where scientists study the use of data from [[geostationary]] and [[polar orbit]] [[weather satellite]]s to improve forecasts of [[weather]] (including [[tropical cyclones]] and [[Severe weather|severe storms]]. CIMSS was formed through a Memorandum of Understanding between the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). CIMSS parent organization, the [[Space Science and Engineering Center]] (SSEC) is a primary developer and operator of [[environmental satellite]] technologies.

It is one of 16 NOAA Cooperative Institutes (CIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cooperative Institutes |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/ |accessdate = 2014-04-26 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
CIMSS develops and successfully implements techniques and products for using geostationary and polar-orbiting weather satellite visible and thermal radiation observations to improve [[Weather forecasting|forecasts]] of severe storms, including [[tornado]]es and [[tropical cyclone]]s. CIMSS plays a major role in the transfer of new technology into operational practice. CIMSS scientists conduct research using passive remote sensing systems for meteorological and surface-based applications.

CIMSS also plays a major role in instrument design and testing, and related software development for improved space-based measurements of the Earth's atmosphere. CIMSS is very active in national and international field programs, testing new instrumentation, data processing systems, and assessing the geophysical utility of measurements.

== Current research ==
Current research also focuses on the development and testing of computer-based analysis and forecast techniques that use observations from existing and planned spacecraft and ground-based weather observing systems as part of a national program to greatly improve weather forecast capabilities for the next decade. The optimal use of satellite data in climate and global change studies has become another essential part of the CIMSS mission.

CIMSS serves as an international center for research on the interpretation and uses of operational and experimental satellite observations and remote sensing data acquired from aircraft and the ground. These data are applied to a wide variety of atmospheric and oceanographic studies and evaluated for their potential operational utility. The CIMSS international role is further strengthened through its visiting scientist program that hosts sabbaticals for several foreign scholars each year.

== Staff ==
The CIMSS staff consists of over 100 associates, including administrative staff, principal investigators, federal employees stationed at CIMSS, scientific and programming staff, visiting scientists, and student hourly support. The federal employees consist of the 7 members of the NOAA Advanced Satellite Products Branch, 1 NOAA Office of Research and Applications employee, 1 NOAA Severe Storms Lab employee, and 1 NASA Langley Research Center employee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6692">'''Cruiser rules''' is a colloquial phrase referring to the conventions regarding the attacking of a merchant ship by an armed vessel.  Here ''cruiser'' is meant in its original meaning of a ship sent on an independent mission such as [[commerce raiding]].  A [[cruiser]] in modern naval terminology refers to a type of ship rather than its mission.  Cruiser rules govern when it is permissible to open fire on an unarmed ship and the treatment of the crews of captured vessels.  During both world wars the question was raised of whether or not submarines were subject to cruiser rules.  Initially submarines attempted to obey them, but abandoned them as the war progressed.

==Outline==
The essence of cruiser rules is that an unarmed vessel should not be attacked without warning.  It can be fired on only if it repeatedly fails to stop when ordered to do so or resists being boarded by the attacking ship.  The armed ship may only intend to search for [[contraband]] (such as war materials) when stopping a merchantman.  If so, the ship may be allowed on its way, as it must be if it is flying the flag of a non-belligerent, after removal of any contraband.  However, if it is intended to take the captured ship as a [[Prize (law)|prize of war]], or to destroy it, then adequate steps must be taken to ensure the safety of the crew.  This would usually mean taking the crew on board and transporting them to a safe port.  It is not usually acceptable to leave the crew in lifeboats.  This can only be done if  they can be expected to reach safety by themselves and have sufficient supplies and navigational equipment to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The cruiser rules evolved during the 17th century when the issuing of [[letters of marque]] to [[privateer]]s was at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;  They were initially an understanding of the honourable way to behave rather than formal international agreements.  A formal agreement between Great Britain and France at the end of the [[Crimean War]] was extended internationally at the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law]] in 1856.  It was signed by all maritime nations except the United States and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, p. 914&lt;/ref&gt;

A new international agreement was reached in 1909, the [[London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War]].  The participants in this treaty were the main European powers, the United States, and the Empire of Japan.  Article 50 of this treaty was what was meant by ''cruiser rules'' during [[World War I]].  Initially, the treaty was respected.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The first British merchant ship to be sunk by a German submarine was the [[SS Glitra|SS ''Glitra'']] in October 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan &amp; Nolan, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  The submarine, [[SM U-17 (Germany)|SM ''U-17'']], allowed the ''Glitra's'' crew to board lifeboats first and then towed them to shore.  Abiding by the cruiser rules in this way was particularly problematic for submarines.  They did not have the room to take captured crew on board and towing lifeboats in this way prevented the submarine from diving.  This put the submarine at considerable risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Gillespie, pp. 174-175|Nolan &amp; Nolan, pp. 38-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German submarines were further endangered by the British anti-submarine [[Q-ship]]s.  These were merchant ships armed with hidden weapons.  The idea was to tempt a submarine to surface and confront the Q-ship, then reveal the guns and open fire.  In German eyes, this meant that all British ships were potentially a danger and they started to move away from the cruiser rules.  At the beginning of 1915 Germany [[Declaration of war|declared a war zone]] around the British Isles in retaliation for the British blockade of Germany.  Henceforth, all neutral shipping within the declared zone was liable to attack without warning.  This led to a series of notorious attacks on passenger ships with the loss of civilian lives, some of them American.  These included [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] in May 1915, [[SS Arabic (1902)|SS ''Arabic'']] in August 1915, and [[SS Sussex|SS ''Sussex'']] in March 1916.  Fearing that American deaths would lead to the US entering the war, after each of these incidents Germany made a new pledge not to sink merchant ships until they had witnessed that life boats had been launched.  However, these pledges were never honoured for long, if at all, and finally Germany announced [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] in February 1917.  Germany believed that this strategy would win the war for them, but in reality it contributed to their defeat by causing the US to enter the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, pp. 175-176&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the experience of World War I, Britain initially expected that German submarines would fight under the cruiser rules in [[World War II]].  However, in September 1939 German submarine [[German submarine U-30 (1936)|''U-30'']] sunk the British passenger liner [[SS Athenia (1922)|SS ''Athenia'']] apparently mistaking it for a military ship.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Admiral [[Karl Dönitz|Dönitz]] pressed for unrestricted submarine warfare.  However, Dönitz was starved of resources until after the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940 when it became clear that Britain could not be successfully invaded.  After this, submarine attacks on British merchant shipping commenced in force in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;Griess, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dirty thunderstorm''' (also '''volcanic lightning''', '''thunder volcano'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronald_Thomas/publication/6484354_Electrical_Activity_During_the_2006_Mount_St_Augustine_Volcanic_Eruptions/links/0912f5139003a029c6000000.pdf|title=Electrical Activity During the 2006 Mount St. Augustine Volcanic Eruptions|last=Thomas|first=R.|date=February 23, 2007|website=Sciencemag.org|access-date=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[weather]] phenomenon that is related to the production of [[lightning]] in a [[eruption column|volcanic plume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article3889902.ece|title=Dirty thunderstorm shoots lightning from volcano|last=Simons|first=Paul|date=May 8, 2008|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2009-01-09 | location=London |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded observations of a dirty thunderstorm are from [[Pliny the Younger]], describing the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 AD. “There was a most intense darkness rendered more appalling by the fitful gleam of torches at intervals obscured by the transient blaze of lightning.”&lt;ref name="volcano.oregonstate.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/history-volcanic-lightning|title=History of Volcanic Lightning  {{!}} Volcano World {{!}} Oregon State University|website=volcano.oregonstate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first studies of volcanic lightning were also conducted at Mount Vesuvius by Professor Palmieri who observed the eruptions of 1858, 1861, 1868, and 1872 from the [[Vesuvius Observatory]]. These eruptions often included lightning activity.&lt;ref name="volcano.oregonstate.edu"/&gt;

Dirty thunderstorms earn their name from the ash, rock fragments, and other [[ejecta]] which collide during a volcanic eruption and generate static electricity within the [[Eruption column|volcanic plume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/03/flash-glass-lightning-inside-volcanic-ash-plumes-create-glassy-spherules|title=Flash glass: Lightning inside volcanic ash plumes create glassy spherules|date=2015-03-04|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study presented in the [[Bulletin of Volcanology]] stated that “27-35% of eruptions are accompanied by lightning, assuming one eruption per year per volcano.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McNutt|first=S.

A famous image of the phenomenon was photographed by Carlos Gutierrez and occurred in [[Chile]] above the [[Chaiten Volcano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/05/photogalleries/volcano-photos/|title=Chile Volcano Erupts with Ash and Lightning|date=May 6, 2008|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106184308/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/05/photogalleries/volcano-photos/|archive-date=2009-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It circulated widely on the internet.

==Causes==
'''Frictional Charging'''

[[Triboelectric effect|Triboelectric]] charging from fragmentation of rocks near the vent and within the plume of a volcano during eruption offers another mechanism for electrical charging.

A study in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' indicated that electrical charges are generated when rock fragments, [[Volcanic ash|ash]], and ice particles in a volcanic plume collide and produce [[Static electricity|static charges]], just as ice particles collide in regular [[thunderstorm]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/earth/2015/03/flash-glass-lightning-inside-volcanic-ash-plumes-create-glassy-spherules|title=Flash glass: Lightning inside volcanic ash plumes create glassy spherules|last=Perkins|first=Sid|date=March 4, 2015|publisher= American Association for the Advancement of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Handwerk" /&gt;

Volcanic eruptions are sometimes accompanied by flashes of lightning. However, this lightning doesn’t descend from storm clouds in the sky. It is generated within the ash cloud spewing from the volcano, in a process called charge separation.

As the plume started going downwind, it seemed to have a life of its own and produced some 300 more or less normal [lightning bolts] ... The implication is that it has produced more charge than it started with. Otherwise [the plume] couldn't continue to make lightning.

—[[Martin A. Uman]], co-director of the University of Florida Lightning Research program

'''Water Content'''

Large amounts of water are released as [[vapor]] during volcanic eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glaze|first=Lori S.|last2=Baloga|first2=Stephen M.|last3=Wilson|first3=Lionel|date=1997-03-01|title=Transport of atmospheric water vapor by volcanic eruption columns|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/96JD03125|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|volume=102|issue=D5|pages=6099–6108|doi=10.1029/96jd03125|issn=0148-0227|bibcode=1997JGR...102.6099G}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed by McNutt &amp; Williams in 2010 found that the water content of volcanic plumes is much greater than the water content of thunderstorms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This study also found “there may be a threshold of water substance concentration required in a plume for lightning to occur (…) this appears to be a function of the large amount of water in the magma and not the smaller amount in the entrained air”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Radioactive Charging'''

Naturally occurring [[radioisotopes]] within ejected rock particles may cause self-charging of volcanic plumes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electrostatics.org/images/ESA_2014_G_Aplin_et_al.pdf|title=Electronic Charging of Volcanic Ash|last=Alpin|first=Karen, et al.|date=2014|website=Electrostatics.org|access-date=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an eruption, a large amount of fragmented sub-surface rock is ejected into the atmosphere. In a study performed on ash particles from the [[Eyjafjallajökull]] and [[2011 eruption of Grímsvötn|Grímsvötn]] eruptions, scientists found that radioisotopes were an unlikely source of self-charging in the Eyjafjallajökull plume. However, there was the potential for greater charging near the vent where the particle size is larger.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A second study conducted on volcanic ash from the same eruptions found that both samples possessed a natural radioactivity above the background level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2012/EGU2012-5870-1.pdf|title=Electrical and radioactive properties of ash samples from Eyafjallajökull and Grimsvötn|last=Alpin|first=K.|last2=Mather|first2=T.|date=|website=Geophysical Research Abstracts|access-date=May 8, 2018|last3=Pyle|first3=T.|last4=Piper|first4=I.|last5=Shrimpton|first5=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plume Height'''

The height of the [[Eruption column|ash plume]] appears to be linked with the mechanism which generates the lightning. In taller ash plumes (7–12&amp;nbsp;km) it appears that the large concentrations of water vapor are contributing to lightning activity, while smaller ash plumes (1–4&amp;nbsp;km) appear to gain more of their electric charge from fragmentation of rocks near the vent of the volcano through charge separation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The atmospheric temperature also plays a role in the formation of lightning. Colder ambient temperatures will create greater amounts of ice inside of the plume thus leading to more friction and electrical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=A. J.|last2=Odams|first2=P.|last3=Edwards|first3=D.|last4=Arason|first4=Þ.|date=2010|title=Monitoring of lightning from the April–May 2010 Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption using a very low frequency lightning location network|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/4/044013/pdf|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seasonal Effects'''

In a study presented in the Bulletin of Volcanology in 2010, it was stated that “Seasonal effects show that more eruptions with lightning were reported in winter (bounded by the respective autumnal and vernal equinoxes) than in summer”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This finding indicates that the lightning activity is driven by magma-derived water rather than atmospheric.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Volcanic Spherules ==
It has been suggested that a by-product of volcanic lighting are lightning induced [[volcanic spherules]], (LIVS).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Genareau|first=Kimberly|last2=Wardman|first2=John B.|last3=Wilson|first3=Thomas M.|last4=McNutt|first4=Stephen R.|last5=Izbekov|first5=Pavel|date=2015|title=Lightning-induced volcanic spherules|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/43/4/319/131847/Lightning-induced-volcanic-spherules|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=319–322|doi=10.1130/G36255.1|issn=1943-2682|via=|bibcode=2015Geo....43..319G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These small glass spherules are thought to be formed during high-temperatures processes such as cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The temperature of a bolt of volcanic lightning can reach 30,000&amp;nbsp;°C. When this bolt contacts ash particles within the plume it will cause them to melt and then quickly solidify as they cool, forming orb shapes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The presence of volcanic spherules aids in providing evidence for the occurrence of volcanic lightning when the lightning itself was not observed directly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Business ==
According to [[Transparency International]], companies operating in Sudan (based on reporting in 2009) included four national companies: China National Petroleum Corporation ([[CNPC]]), Kuwait Petroleum Corporation ([[Kuwait Petroleum Corporation|KPC]]), the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ([[ONGC]], the Indian [[National oil company|NOC]]) and [[Petronas]] (''Petroliam Nasional Berhad''). Transparency International audited these companies' corporate reporting on anti-corruption programmes, organisational disclosure and country-level global disclosure (including in Sudan) until February 2011 to enhance the transparency and accountability of oil and gas revenues. The report "Why transparency in the oil and gas sector matters" states: "Oil and gas producers transfer considerable funds to host governments – in the form of license fees, royalties, dividends, taxes and support for local communities. These financial inflows should contribute substantially to social and economic development, yet many resource-rich countries have been unable to transform resource wealth into wellbeing". All African companies scored zero in reporting on anti-corruption programmes. In general, country-level disclosure in Sudan demonstrated opportunities for improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/59374/951162/TI_PRT_2011_report_FINAL_EN.pdf  ''2011 Report on oil and gas companies, Promoting revenue transparency''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602213650/http://www.transparency.org/content/download/59374/951162/TI_PRT_2011_report_FINAL_EN.pdf |date=2011-06-02 }} [[Transparency International]] 2011 Africa p 5 Companies p. 21, 25, 31, 71, in Sudan p 90, 96, 98,100&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flood''' is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry.&lt;ref&gt;MSN Encarta Dictionary, [http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861612277 Flood], Retrieved on 2006-12-28, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023547055729 Archived] on 2009-10-31&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] (EU) [[Floods Directive]] defines a flood as a  covering by [[water]] of land not normally covered by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:288:0027:0034:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2007/60/EC Chapter 1 Article2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the [[tide]]. Floods are an area of study of the discipline [[hydrology]] and are of significant concern in [[agriculture]], [[civil engineering]] and [[public health]]. 

Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a [[river]], [[lake]], or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks [[levee]]s, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries,&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (June 2000) [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=flood1 Flood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824054504/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=flood1 |date=2007-08-24 }}, Retrieved on 2009-01-09&lt;/ref&gt; or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in [[precipitation]] and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood [[property]] or [[drown]] [[domestic animals]].

Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the [[river channel]], particularly at bends or [[meander]]s in the [[waterway]]. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and [[Fertility (soil)|fertile]] and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry.

Some floods develop slowly, while others such as [[flash flood]]s, can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain. Additionally, floods can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins.

== Etymology ==
The word "flood" comes from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''flod'', a word common to [[Germanic language]]s (compare [[German language|German]] ''Flut'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''vloed'' from the same root as is seen in ''flow, float''; also compare with [[Latin]] ''fluctus'', ''flumen''). [[Deluge myth]]s are [[Mythology|mythical]] stories of a great flood sent by a [[deity]] or deities to destroy civilization as an act of [[divine retribution]], and they are featured in the mythology of many cultures.

== Principal types ==

=== Areal ===
Floods can happen on flat or low-lying areas when water is supplied by rainfall or snowmelt more rapidly than it can either [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]] or [[Surface runoff|run off]]. The excess accumulates in place, sometimes to hazardous depths. Surface [[soil]] can become saturated, which effectively stops infiltration, where the [[water table]] is shallow, such as a [[floodplain]], or from intense rain from one or a [[storm train|series of storms]]. Infiltration also is slow to negligible through frozen ground, rock, [[concrete]], paving, or roofs. Areal flooding begins in flat areas like floodplains and in local depressions not connected to a stream channel, because the velocity of [[Surface runoff|overland flow]] depends on the surface slope. [[Endorheic basin]]s may experience areal flooding during periods when precipitation exceeds evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Myrtle|title=Ground-water flooding in glacial terrain of southern Puget Sound, Washington|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs11100 |date=2000|accessdate=2015-07-23|ref=MJones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Riverine (Channel) ===
Floods occur in all types of [[river]] and [[stream]] channels, from the smallest [[Stream#Intermittent and ephemeral streams|ephemeral streams]] in humid zones to [[Arroyo (creek)|normally-dry channels]] in arid climates to the [[Amazon River|world's largest]] rivers. When overland flow occurs on tilled fields, it can result in a [[muddy flood]] where [[sediment]]s are [[Erosion|picked up by run off]] and carried as suspended matter or [[bed load]]. Localized flooding may be caused or exacerbated by drainage obstructions such as [[landslide]]s, [[Ice jam|ice]], [[debris]], or [[beaver]] dams.

Slow-rising floods most commonly occur in large rivers with large [[Drainage basin|catchment areas]]. The increase in flow may be the result of sustained rainfall, rapid snow melt, [[monsoon]]s, or [[tropical cyclones]]. However, large rivers may have rapid flooding events in areas with dry climate, since they may have large basins but small river channels and rainfall can be very intense in smaller areas of those basins.

Rapid flooding events, including [[flash floods]], more often occur on smaller rivers, rivers with steep valleys, rivers that flow for much of their length over impermeable terrain, or normally-dry channels. The cause may be localized [[convective precipitation]] (intense [[thunderstorm]]s) or sudden release from an upstream impoundment created behind a [[dam]], landslide, or [[glacier]]. In one instance, a flash flood killed eight people enjoying the water on a Sunday afternoon at a popular waterfall in a narrow canyon. Without any observed rainfall, the flow rate increased from about {{convert|50|to|1500|ft3/s|sigfig=2}} in just one minute.&lt;ref name="Hjalmarson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hjalmarson|first1=Hjalmar W.|date=December 1984|title=Flash Flood in Tanque Verde Creek, Tucson, Arizona|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|volume=110|issue=12|pages=1841–1852|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1984)110:12(1841)}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-07-24--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Two larger floods occurred at the same site within a week, but no one was at the waterfall on those days. The deadly flood resulted from a thunderstorm over part of the drainage basin, where steep, bare rock slopes are common and the thin soil was already saturated.

Flash floods are the most common flood type in normally-dry channels in arid zones, known as [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] in the southwest United States and many other names elsewhere. In that setting, the first flood water to arrive is depleted as it wets the sandy stream bed. The leading edge of the flood thus advances more slowly than later and higher flows. As a result, the rising limb of the [[hydrograph]] becomes ever quicker as the flood moves downstream, until the flow rate is so great that the depletion by wetting soil becomes insignificant.

=== Estuarine and coastal ===
Flooding in [[estuary|estuaries]] is commonly caused by a combination of sea tidal surges caused by [[wind]]s and low [[barometric pressure]], and they may be exacerbated by high upstream river flow.

Coastal areas may be flooded by storm events at sea, resulting in waves over-topping defenses or in severe cases by [[tsunami]] or tropical cyclones. A [[storm surge]], from either a [[tropical cyclone]] or an [[extratropical cyclone]], falls within this category. Research from the NHC (National Hurricane Center) explains: "Storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides. [[Storm surge]] should not be confused with storm tide, which is defined as the water level rise due to the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide. This rise in water level can cause extreme flooding in coastal areas particularly when storm surge coincides with normal high tide, resulting in storm tides reaching up to 20 feet or more in some cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/ |title=Storm Surge Overview|website=noaa.gov|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban flooding ===
Urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a [[built environment]], particularly in more densely populated areas, caused by rainfall overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems, such as [[storm sewers]]. Although sometimes triggered by events such as flash flooding or [[snowmelt]], urban flooding is a condition, characterized by its repetitive and systemic impacts on communities, that can happen regardless of whether or not affected communities are located within designated floodplains or near any body of water.&lt;ref name="cnt"&gt;Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL, [http://www.cnt.org/resources/the-prevalence-and-cost-of-urban-flooding/ "The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding"], May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from potential overflow of rivers and lakes, snowmelt, [[stormwater]] or water released from damaged [[Water supply network#Water distribution network|water mains]] may accumulate on property and in public rights-of-way, seep through building walls and floors, or backup into buildings through sewer pipes, toilets and sinks.

In urban areas, flood effects can be exacerbated by existing paved streets and roads, which increase the speed of flowing water.

The flood flow in urbanized areas constitutes a hazard to both the population and infrastructure. Some recent catastrophes include the inundations of [[Nîmes]] (France) in 1998 and [[Vaison-la-Romaine]] (France) in 1992, the flooding of [[New Orleans]] (USA) in 2005, and the flooding in [[Rockhampton]], [[Bundaberg]], [[Brisbane]] during the 2010–2011 summer in [[Queensland]] (Australia). Flood flows in urban environments have been studied relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events.&lt;ref name=Chanson_2011c&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:243550 |title=Turbulent Velocity and Suspended Sediment Concentration Measurements in an Urban Environment of the Brisbane River Flood Plain at Gardens Point on 12–13 January 2011|journal=Hydraulic Model Report No. CH83/11|year=2011|issue=CH83/11|page=120|first1=Richard|last1=Brown|authorlink2=Hubert Chanson|first2=Hubert|last2=Chanson|first3=Dave|last3=McIntosh|first4=Jay|last4=Madhani|isbn=978-1-74272-027-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent research has considered the criteria for safe evacuation of individuals in flooded areas.&lt;ref name="Chanson_2014"&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]], Brown, R., McIntosh, D.|title=Hydraulic structures and society - Engineering challenges and extremes|publisher=Proceedings of the 5th IAHR International Symposium on Hydraulic Structures (ISHS2014)|date=26 June 2014|location=Brisbane, Australia|editor=L.

=== Catastrophic ===
Catastrophic riverine flooding is usually associated with major infrastructure failures such as the collapse of a dam, but they may also be caused by drainage channel modification from a [[landslide]], [[earthquake]] or [[volcanic eruption]]. Examples include [[outburst flood]]s and [[lahar]]s. [[Tsunami]]s can cause catastrophic coastal flooding, most commonly resulting from undersea earthquakes.

== Causes ==
[[File:Cyclone Hudhud destruction in Visakhapatnam 2.jpg|thumb|Flood due to [[Cyclone Hudhud]] in [[Visakhapatnam]]]]

=== Upslope factors ===
The amount, location, and timing of water reaching a drainage channel from natural precipitation and controlled or uncontrolled reservoir releases determines the flow at downstream locations.  Some precipitation evaporates, some slowly percolates through soil, some may be temporarily sequestered as snow or ice, and some may produce rapid runoff from surfaces including rock, pavement, roofs, and saturated or frozen ground.  The fraction of incident precipitation promptly reaching a drainage channel has been observed from nil for light rain on dry, level ground to as high as 170 percent for warm rain on accumulated snow.&lt;ref&gt;Babbitt, Harold E. &amp; Doland, James J., ''Water Supply Engineering'',  McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

Most precipitation records are based on a measured depth of water received within a fixed time interval.  ''Frequency'' of a precipitation threshold of interest may be determined from the number of measurements exceeding that threshold value within the total time period for which observations are available.  Individual data points are converted to ''intensity'' by dividing each measured depth by the period of time between observations.  This intensity will be less than the actual peak intensity if the ''duration'' of the rainfall event was less than the fixed time interval for which measurements are reported.  Convective precipitation events (thunderstorms) tend to produce shorter duration storm events than orographic precipitation.  Duration, intensity, and frequency of rainfall events are important to flood prediction.  Short duration precipitation is more significant to flooding within small drainage basins.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Andrew L., ''Basic Hydraulics'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981, {{ISBN|0-471-07965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important upslope factor in determining flood magnitude is the land area of the watershed upstream of the area of interest.  Rainfall intensity is the second most important factor for watersheds of less than approximately {{convert|30|sqmi|sigfig=1|disp=or}}.  The main channel slope is the second most important factor for larger watersheds.  Channel slope and rainfall intensity become the third most important factors for small and large watersheds, respectively.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;Simon, Andrew L., ''Practical Hydraulics'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981, {{ISBN|0-471-05381-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time of Concentration]] is the time required for runoff from the most distant point of the upstream drainage area to reach the point of the drainage channel controlling flooding of the area of interest. The time of concentration defines the critical duration of peak rainfall for the area of interest.&lt;ref name="Urquhart"&gt;Urquhart, Leonard Church, ''Civil Engineering Handbook'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The critical duration of intense rainfall might be only a few minutes for roof and parking lot drainage structures, while cumulative rainfall over several days would be critical for river basins.

=== Downslope factors ===
Water flowing downhill ultimately encounters downstream conditions slowing movement. The final limitation in coastal flooding lands is often the [[ocean]] or some coastal flooding bars which form natural [[lake]]s. In flooding low lands, elevation changes such as tidal fluctuations are significant determinants of coastal and estuarine flooding.  Less predictable events like tsunamis and storm surges may also cause elevation changes in large bodies of water. Elevation of flowing water is controlled by the geometry of the flow channel and, especially, by depth of channel, speed of flow and amount of sediments in it &lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt;  Flow channel restrictions like bridges and canyons tend to control water elevation above the restriction.  The actual control point for any given reach of the drainage may change with changing water elevation, so a closer point may control for lower water levels until a more distant point controls at higher water levels.

Effective flood channel geometry may be changed by growth of vegetation, accumulation of ice or debris, or construction of bridges, buildings, or levees within the flood channel.

=== Coincidence ===
Extreme flood events often result from coincidence such as unusually intense, warm rainfall melting heavy snow pack, producing channel obstructions from floating ice, and releasing small impoundments like [[beaver]] dams.&lt;ref name="Abbett"&gt;Abbett, Robert W., ''American Civil Engineering Practice'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Coincident events may cause extensive flooding to be more frequent than anticipated from [[100-year flood|simplistic statistical prediction models]] considering only precipitation runoff flowing within unobstructed drainage channels.&lt;ref name="BR"&gt;[[United States Department of the Interior]], Bureau of Reclamation, ''Design of Small Dams'', United States Government Printing Office, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Debris modification of channel geometry is common when heavy flows move uprooted woody vegetation and flood-damaged structures and vehicles, including boats and [[railway]] equipment. Recent field measurements during the [[2010–11 Queensland floods]] showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by velocity and water depth fluctuations.&lt;ref name="Chanson_2011c" /&gt; These considerations ignore further the risks associated with large debris entrained by the flow motion.&lt;ref name="Chanson_2014" /&gt;

Some researchers have mentioned the storage effect in urban areas with transportation corridors created by [[cut and fill]]. Culverted fills may be converted to impoundments if the [[culvert]]s become blocked by debris, and flow may be diverted along streets.  Several studies have looked into the flow patterns and redistribution in streets during storm events and the implication on flood modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Identifiability of Distributed Floodplain Roughness Values in Flood Extent Estimation|journal=Journal of Hydrology|year=2006|volume=314|issue=1–4|pages=139–157|first1=MGF|last1=Werner|first2=NM|last2=Hunter|first3=PD|last3=Bates|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.03.012|bibcode= 2005JHyd..314..139W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Primary effects ===
The primary effects of flooding include [[death|loss of life]] and damage to buildings and other structures, including bridges, [[sewerage]] systems, roadways, and canals.

Floods also frequently damage [[power transmission]] and sometimes [[power generation]], which then has [[knock-on effect]]s caused by the loss of power. This includes loss of drinking [[water treatment]] and water supply, which may result in loss of drinking water or severe water contamination. It may also cause the loss of sewage disposal facilities. Lack of clean water combined with [[human sewage]] in the flood waters raises the risk of [[waterborne diseases]], which can include [[typhoid]], [[giardia]], [[cryptosporidium]], [[cholera]] and many other diseases depending upon the location of the flood.

Damage to roads and transport infrastructure may make it difficult to mobilize aid to those affected or to provide emergency health treatment.

Flood waters typically inundate farm land, making the land unworkable and preventing crops from being planted or harvested, which can lead to shortages of food both for humans and farm animals. Entire harvests for a country can be lost in extreme flood circumstances. Some tree species may not survive prolonged flooding of their root systems.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bratkovich, Lisa Burban, et al., [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/n_resource/flood/cover.htm "Flooding and its Effects on Trees"], [[USDA Forest Service]], Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, St. Paul, MN, September 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary and long-term effects ===
Economic hardship due to a temporary decline in tourism, rebuilding costs, or food shortages leading to price increases is a common after-effect of severe flooding. The impact on those affected may cause psychological damage to those affected, in particular where deaths, serious injuries and loss of property occur.

Urban flooding can cause chronically wet houses, leading to the growth of [[indoor mold]] and resulting in adverse health effects, particularly respiratory symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Scientific Findings Resource Bank (IAQ-SFRB), [http://www.iaqscience.lbl.gov/dampness-risks-house.html "Health Risks or Dampness or Mold in Houses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213929/http://www.iaqscience.lbl.gov/dampness-risks-house.html |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban flooding also has significant economic implications for affected neighborhoods. In the [[United States]], industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10–25 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL [http://www.cnt.org/resources/the-prevalence-and-cost-of-urban-flooding/ "The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding"], May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), almost 40 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130917193030/http://www.fema.gov/protecting-yourbusinesses "Protecting Your Businesses"], last updated March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[National Flood Insurance Program|insurance]] is available against flood damage to both homes and businesses.&lt;ref name=NFIP&gt;{{cite web|title=National Flood Insurance Program|url=https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/ |website=FloodSmart.gov|accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
Floods (in particular more frequent or smaller floods) can also bring many benefits, such as recharging [[ground water]], making soil more [[Fertility (soil)|fertile]] and increasing [[nutrient]]s in some soils. Flood waters provide much needed water resources in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] regions where precipitation can be very unevenly distributed throughout the year and kills pests in the farming land. Freshwater floods particularly play an important role in maintaining [[ecosystem]]s in river corridors and are a key factor in maintaining floodplain [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;WMO/GWP Associated Programme on Flood Management, [http://www.apfm.info/publications/policy/ifm_env_aspects/Environmental_Aspects_of_IFM_En.pdf "Environmental Aspects of Integrated Flood Management"], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding can spread nutrients to lakes and rivers, which can lead to increased [[biomass]] and improved [[fisheries]] for a few years.

For some fish species, an inundated floodplain may form a highly suitable location for [[spawning]] with few predators and enhanced levels of nutrients or food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kops.ub.uni-konstanz.de/volltexte/2009/7515/pdf/2008_Wantzen_etal_An_extension_of_the_floodpulse.pdf Extension of the Flood Pulse Concept], Retrieved on 2012-06-12&lt;/ref&gt; Fish, such as the [[weather fish]], make use of floods in order to reach new habitats. Bird populations may also profit from the boost in food production caused by flooding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.ipsterraviva.net/2010/10/15/birdlife-soars-above-botswanas-floodplains Birdlife soars above Botswana's floodplains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209093150/http://africa.ipsterraviva.net/2010/10/15/birdlife-soars-above-botswanas-floodplains/ |date=2011-02-09 }} (2010-10-15), Retrieved on 2012-06-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic flooding was essential to the well-being of ancient communities along the [[Tigris-Euphrates]] Rivers, the [[Nile River]], the [[Indus River]], the [[Ganges]] and the [[Yellow River]] among others. The viability of [[hydropower]], a renewable source of energy, is also higher in flood prone regions.

== Flood safety planning ==
[[File:Greeley, CO, September 19, 2013 (12441526333).jpg|thumb|Aftermath of flooding in Colorado, 2013]]
At the most basic level, the best defense against floods is to seek higher ground for high-value uses while balancing the foreseeable risks with the benefits of occupying flood hazard zones.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"&gt;Eychaner, J.H. (2015) ''Lessons from a 500-year record of flood elevations'', [http://www.floods.org/ace-files/documentlibrary/publications/asfpmpubs-techrep7_2015.pdf Association of State Floodplain Managers, Technical Report 7], Accessed 2015-06-27&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–23}} Critical community-safety facilities, such as hospitals, emergency-operations centers, and police, fire, and [[rescue]] services, should be built in areas least at risk of flooding. Structures, such as bridges, that must unavoidably be in flood hazard areas should be designed to withstand flooding. Areas most at risk for flooding could be put to valuable uses that could be abandoned temporarily as people retreat to safer areas when a flood is imminent.

Planning for flood safety involves many aspects of analysis and engineering, including:
* observation of previous and present flood heights and inundated areas,
* statistical, [[hydrologic]], and hydraulic model analyses,
* mapping inundated areas and flood heights for future flood scenarios,
* long-term [[land use planning]] and regulation,
* [[engineering design]] and construction of structures to control or withstand flooding,
* intermediate-term monitoring, [[Flood forecasting|forecasting]], and emergency-response planning, and
* short-term monitoring, [[Flood warning|warning]], and response operations.

Each topic presents distinct yet related questions with varying scope and scale in time, space, and the people involved. Attempts to understand and manage the mechanisms at work in floodplains have been made for at least six millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Dyhouse, G., "Flood modelling Using HEC-RAS (First Edition)", Haestad Press, Waterbury (USA) 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2015}}

In the United States, the Association of State Floodplain Managers works to promote education, policies, and activities that mitigate current and future losses, costs, and human suffering caused by flooding and to protect the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains – all without causing adverse impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of State Floodplain Managers|url=http://floods.org/ |accessdate=2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portfolio of [[best practice]] examples for [[disaster mitigation]] in the United States is available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Practices Portfolio|url=http://www.fema.gov/mitigation-best-practices-portfolio |publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control ===
{{Main|Flood control}}

In many countries around the world, waterways prone to floods are often carefully managed. Defenses such as [[detention basin]]s, [[levee]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Levees and Other Raised Ground|author=Henry Petroski|publisher=American Scientist|year=2006|volume=94|issue=1|pages=7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bunding|bunds]], [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and [[weir]]s are used to prevent waterways from overflowing their banks. When these defenses fail, emergency measures such as [[sandbag]]s or portable inflatable tubes are often used to try to stem flooding. Coastal flooding has been addressed in portions of Europe and the Americas with [[Coastal management|coastal defenses]], such as [[sea wall]]s, [[beach nourishment]], and [[barrier island]]s.

In the [[riparian zone]] near rivers and streams, [[erosion control]] measures can be taken to try to slow down or reverse the natural forces that cause many waterways to meander over long periods of time. Flood controls, such as dams, can be built and maintained over time to try to reduce the occurrence and severity of floods as well. In the United States, the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] maintains a network of such flood control dams.

In areas prone to urban flooding, one solution is the repair and expansion of man-made sewer systems and stormwater infrastructure. Another strategy is to reduce impervious surfaces in streets, parking lots and buildings through natural drainage channels, [[porous paving]], and [[wetlands]] (collectively known as [[green infrastructure]] or [[sustainable urban drainage systems]] (SUDS)). Areas identified as flood-prone can be converted into parks and playgrounds that can tolerate occasional flooding. Ordinances can be adopted to require developers to retain stormwater on site and require buildings to be elevated, protected by [[floodwall]]s and [[levees]], or designed to withstand temporary inundation. Property owners can also invest in solutions themselves, such as re-landscaping their property to take the flow of water away from their building and installing [[rain barrels]], [[sump pump]]s, and [[check valve]]s.

== Analysis of flood information ==

A series of annual maximum flow rates in a stream reach can be analyzed [[extreme value analysis|statistically]] to estimate the [[100-year flood]] and floods of other [[return period|recurrence intervals]] there. Similar estimates from many sites in a hydrologically similar region can be related to measurable characteristics of each drainage basin to allow [[regression analysis|indirect estimation]] of flood recurrence intervals for stream reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis.

Physical process models of channel reaches are generally well understood and will calculate the depth and area of inundation for given channel conditions and a specified flow rate, such as for use in floodplain mapping and [[flood insurance]]. Conversely, given the observed inundation area of a recent flood and the channel conditions, a model can calculate the flow rate. Applied to various potential channel configurations and flow rates, a reach model can contribute to selecting an optimum design for a modified channel. Various reach models are available as of 2015, either [[One-dimensional space|1D]] models (flood levels measured in the [[stream channel|channel]]) or [[Two-dimensional space|2D]] models (variable flood depths measured across the extent of a floodplain). [[HEC-RAS]],&lt;ref&gt;United States Army Corps of Engineers, Davis, CA, [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/ Hydrologic Engineering Center]&lt;/ref&gt; the Hydraulic Engineering Center model, is among the most popular [[software]], if only because it is available free of charge. Other models such as TUFLOW&lt;ref&gt;BMT WBM Pty Ltd., Brisbane, Queensland, [http://www.tuflow.com/ "TUFLOW Flood and Tide Simulation Software"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627014611/http://www.tuflow.com/ |date=2008-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; combine 1D and 2D components to derive flood depths across both river channels and the entire floodplain.

[[computer simulation|Physical process models]] of complete drainage basins are even more complex. Although many processes are well understood at a point or for a small area, others are poorly understood at all scales, and process interactions under normal or extreme climatic conditions may be unknown. Basin models typically combine land-surface process components (to estimate how much rainfall or snowmelt reaches a channel) with a series of reach models. For example, a basin model can calculate the runoff [[hydrograph]] that might result from a 100-year storm, although the recurrence interval of a storm is rarely equal to that of the associated flood. Basin models are commonly used in flood forecasting and warning, as well as in analysis of the effects of land use change and [[climate change]].

=== Flood forecasting ===
{{Main|Flood forecasting|flood warning|}}

Anticipating floods before they occur allows for precautions to be taken and people to be warned &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/58417.aspx |title=Flood Warnings|publisher=Environment Agency|date=2013-04-30|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they can be prepared in advance for flooding conditions. For example, farmers can remove animals from low-lying areas and utility services can put in place emergency provisions to re-route services if needed. Emergency services can also make provisions to have enough resources available ahead of time to respond to emergencies as they occur. People can evacuate areas to be flooded.

In order to make the most accurate flood forecasts for [[waterway]]s, it is best to have a long time-series of historical data that relates [[stream flow]]s to measured past rainfall events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/flood |title=Australia rainfall and river conditions|publisher=Bom.gov.au|date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coupling this historical information with [[Real-time data|real-time knowledge]] about volumetric capacity in catchment areas, such as spare capacity in reservoirs, ground-water levels, and the degree of [[Phreatic zone|saturation]] of area [[aquifer]]s is also needed in order to make the most acrate flood forecasts.

[[Weather radar|Radar]] estimates of rainfall and general [[weather forecasting]] techniques are also important components of good flood forecasting. In areas where good quality data is available, the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time. The output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway,&lt;ref name="Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://water.weather.gov/ahps |title=Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=104|issue=D16|pages=19,655|accessdate=4 February 2013|bibcode=1999JGR...10419655C|last1=Connelly|first1=Brian A|last2=Braatz|first2=Dean T|last3=Halquist|first3=John B|last4=Deweese|first4=Michael M|last5=Larson|first5=Lee|last6=Ingram|first6=John J|year=1999|doi=10.1029/1999JD900051}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also may allow for the computation of the likely statistical return period of a flood. In many developed countries, urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood – that is a flood that has a probability of around 63% of occurring in any 100-year period of time.

According to the U.S. [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) Northeast River Forecast Center (RFC) in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], a rule of thumb for flood forecasting in urban areas is that it takes at least {{convert|1|in|mm}} of rainfall in around an hour's time in order to start significant [[ponding]] of water on [[Impervious surface|impermeable surfaces]]. Many NWS RFCs routinely issue Flash Flood Guidance and Headwater Guidance, which indicate the general amount of rainfall that would need to fall in a short period of time in order to cause flash flooding or flooding on larger [[water basin]]s.&lt;ref name="Flash Flood Guidance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/rfcshare/ffg.php |title=FFG|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, an integrated approach to real-time hydrologic computer modelling utilizes observed data from the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS),&lt;ref name="USGS WaterWatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/index.php?id=ww_current |title=WaterWatch|date=4 February 2013|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; various [[Weather spotting|cooperative observing networks]],&lt;ref name="Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cocorahs.org |title=Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; various [[Automated airport weather station|automated weather sensors]], the [[NOAA]] National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC),&lt;ref name="National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov |title=NOHRSC|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; various [[hydroelectric]] companies, etc. combined with [[quantitative precipitation forecast]]s (QPF) of expected rainfall and/or snow melt to generate daily or as-needed hydrologic forecasts.&lt;ref name="Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System" /&gt; The NWS also cooperates with [[Environment Canada]] on hydrologic forecasts that affect both the USA and Canada, like in the area of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].

The Global Flood Monitoring System, "GFMS," a computer tool which maps flood conditions worldwide, is available [http://flood.umd.edu/ online]. Users anywhere in the world can use GFMS to determine when floods may occur in their area. GFMS uses precipitation data from [[NASA]]'s Earth observing satellites and the [[Global Precipitation Measurement satellite]], "GPM." Rainfall data from GPM is combined with a land surface model that incorporates vegetation cover, soil type, and terrain to determine how much water is soaking into the ground, and how much water is flowing into [[streamflow]].

Users can view statistics for rainfall, streamflow, water depth, and flooding every 3 hours, at each 12 [[kilometer]] gridpoint on a global map. Forecasts for these parameters are 5 days into the future. Users can zoom in to see inundation maps (areas estimated to be covered with water) in 1 kilometer resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Predicting Floods|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2015/22jul_floods/ |website=science.nasa.gov|accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfcr-4XmxNY&amp;authuser=0 |title=ScienceCasts: Predicting Floods|date=21 July 2015|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=13 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In myth and religion ==
[[Flood myth]]s (great, civilization-destroying floods) are widespread in many cultures.

Flood events in the form of [[divine retribution]] have also been described in religious text. As a prime example, the [[Genesis flood narrative]] plays a prominent role in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

'''Forensic geophysics''' is a branch of [[forensic science]] and is the study, the search, the localization and the mapping of buried objects or elements beneath the soil or the water, using [[geophysics]] tools for legal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2012 |last1=Pringle |first1=JK |last2=Ruffell |first2=A |last3=Jervis |first3=JR |last4=Donnelly |first4=L |last5=McKinley |first5=J |last6=Hansen |first6=J |last7=Morgan |first7=R |last8=Pirrie |first8=D |last9=Harrison |first9=M |title=The use of geoscience methods for terrestrial forensic searches |volume=114 |pages=108–123|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|bibcode = 2012ESRv..114..108P |doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various geophysical techniques for forensic investigations in which the targets are buried and have different dimensions (from weapons or metallic barrels to human burials and bunkers). Geophysical methods have the potential to aid the search and the recovery of these targets because they can non-destructively and rapidly investigate large areas where a suspect, illegal burial or, in general, a forensic target is hidden in the [[subsoil]]. When in the subsurface there is a contrast of physical properties between a target and the material in which it is buried, it is possible to individuate and define precisely the concealing place of the searched target. It is also possible to recognize evidences of human soil occupation or excavation, both recent and older. Forensic geophysics is an evolving technique that is gaining popularity and prestige in [[law enforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1177/1043986211405885 |year=2011 |last1=Larson |first1=DO |last2=Vass |first2=AA |last3=Wise |first3=M |title=Advanced Scientific Methods and Procedures in the Forensic Investigation of Clandestine Graves |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=149–182 |journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searched for objects obviously include clandestine graves of murder victims, but also include unmarked burials in graveyards and cemeteries, weapons used in criminal activities and environmental crime illegally dumping material.

There are various near-surface geophysical techniques that can be utilised to detect a near-surface buried object, which should be site and case-specific. A thorough desk study (including historical maps), utility survey, site reconnaissance and control studies should be undertaken before trial geophysical surveys and then full geophysical surveys are undertaken in phased investigations. Note also other search techniques should be used to first to prioritise suspect areas, for example [[Search and rescue dog#Human remains detection|cadaver dogs]] or forensic geomorphologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2014 |last1=Ruffell |first1=A |last2=McKinley |first2=J |title=Forensic geomorphology |volume=206 |pages=14–22| journal=Geomorphology |bibcode = 2014Geomo.206...14R |doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.12.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

For large-scale buried objects, [[seismic]] surveys may be appropriate but these have, at best, 2m vertical resolution so may not be ideal for certain targets, more typically they are used to detect bedrock below the surface (see.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite book |last=Reynolds|first= JR |title=An Introduction to Applied and Environmental Geophysics, 2nd Edition|publisher=Wiley|date=2011|isbn=978-0-471-48535-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For relatively quick site surveys, bulk ground [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] surveys can be collected which identifies areas of disturbance of different ground but these can suffer from a lack of resolution. This recent Black Death investigation in central London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2015.04.010 |year=2015 |last1=Dick |first1=HC |last2=Pringle |first2=JK |last3=Sloane |first3=B |last4=Carver |first4=J |last5=Wisneiwski |first5=KD |last6=Haffenden |first6=A |last7=Porter |first7=S |last8=Roberts |first8=D |last9=Cassidy |first9=NJ |title=Detection and characterisation of Black Death burials by multi-proxy geophysical methods |volume=59 |pages=132–141| journal=Journal of Archaeological Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=10855986 |year=2000 |last1=Nobes |first1=D |title=The Search for "Yvonne": A Case Example of the Delineation of a Grave Using Near-Surface Geophysical Methods |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=715–721| journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a successful woodland search for a cold case in woodland in New Zealand.

[[Ground-penetrating radar]] (or GPR) has a typical maximum depth below ground level (bgl) of 10 m, depending upon the antennae frequencies used, typically 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1.2 Gz. The higher the frequency the smaller the object that can be resolved but also penetration depths decrease, so operators need to think carefully when choosing antennae frequencies and, ideally, undertake trial surveys using different antennae over a target at a known depth onsite. GPR is the most popularly used technique in forensic search, but is not suitable in certain soil types and environments, e.g. coastal (i.e. salt-rich) and clay-rich soils (lack of penetration). 2D profiles can be relatively quickly collected and, if time permits, successive profiles can be used to generate 3D datasets which may resolve more subtle targets (see &lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;). Recent studies have used GPR to locate mass graves from the Spanish Civil War in mountainous &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.05.040 | year=2016 |last1=Fernandez-Alvarez |first1=J-P |title=Discovery of a mass grave from the Spanish Civil War using Ground Penetrating Radar and forensic archaeology |volume=267 |issue=10 |pages=e10-e17| journal=Forensic Science International }}&lt;/ref&gt; and urban &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.03.034 | year=2018 |last1=Fernandez-Alvarez |first1=J-P |title=GPR and ERT detection and characterization of a mass burial, Spanish Civil War, Northern Spain |volume=287 |pages=e1-e9| journal=Forensic Science International }}&lt;/ref&gt; environments.

Electrical resistivity methods can also detect objects, especially in clay-rich soil which would preclude the use of GPR. There are different equipment configurations, the dipole-dipole (fixed-offset) method is the most common which can traverse across an area, measuring resistivity variations at a set depth (typically 1-2x probe separations) which have been used in forensic searches. More slower methods are putting out many probes and collecting both spatially horizontally and vertically, called [[Electrical resistivity imaging]] (ERI). Multiple 2D profiles is termed [[electrical resistivity tomography]] (ERT).&lt;ref name=pye&gt;{{cite book |last=Pye|first= Kenneth|author2=D.J. Croft|title=Forensic geoscience: principles, techniques and applications|publisher=Geological Society of London|date=2004|isbn=1-86239-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magnetometry]] can detect buried metal (or indeed fired objects such as bricks or even where surface fires were) using simple total field magnetometers, through to fluxgate gradiometers and high-end alkali vapour gradiometers, depending upon accuracy (and cost) required (see &lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;). Surface magnetic susceptibility has also shown recent promise for forensic search.

Water-based searches are also becoming more common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.04.012 | year=2017 |last1=Ruffell |first1=A |last2=Pringle |first2=JK |last3=Cassella |first3=JP |last4=Morgan |first4=RM |last5=Ferguson |first5=M |last6=Heaton |first6=V |last7=Hope |first7=C | last8=McKinley |first8=J | title=The use of geoscience methods for aquatic forensic searches | journal=Earth-Science Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; with specialist marine magnetometers, side-scan sonar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.05.032 |year=2013 |last1=Schultz |first1=JJ |last2=Healy |first2=CA |last3=Parker |first3=K |last4=Lowers |first4=B|title=Detecting submerged objects: The application of side scan sonar to forensic contexts |volume=231 |pages=306–316| journal=Forensic Science International |pmid=23890654}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other acoustic methods and even water-penetrating radar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S1355-0306(06)71602-1 |year=2009 |last1=Ruffell |first1=A |title=Under-water Scene Investigation Using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) in the Search for a Sunken Jet ski, Northern Ireland |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=221–230| journal=Science &amp; Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; methods used to rapidly scan bottoms of ponds, lakes, rivers and near-shore depositional environments.

==Controlled research==
There has been recent efforts to undertake research over known buried and below-water surface simulated forensic targets in order to gain an insight into optimum search technique(s) and/or equipment configuration(s). Most commonly, this involved the burial porcine cadavers and long-term monitoring for soilwater,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Jamie K.|last2=Cassella|first2=John P.|last3=Jervis|first3=John R.|last4=Williams|first4=Anna|last5=Cross|first5=Peter|last6=Cassidy|first6=Nigel J.|date=2015-07-01|title=Soilwater Conductivity Analysis to Date and Locate Clandestine Graves of Homicide Victims|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12802/abstract|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|language=en|volume=60|issue=4|pages=1052–1060|doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12802|issn=1556-4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; seasonal effects on electrical resistivity surveys, burial in walls and beneath concrete,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruffell|first=A|last2=Pringle|first2=JK|last3=Forbes|first3=S|date=2014-01-05|title=Search protocols for hidden forensic objects beneath floors and within walls|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.12.036/abstract|journal=Forensic Science International|language=en|volume=237|pages=237–245|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.12.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Long-Term monitoring in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Jamie K.|last2=Jervis|first2=John R.|last3=Roberts|first3=Daniel|last4=Dick|first4=Henry C.|last5=Wisniewski|first5=Kristopher D.|last6=Cassidy|first6=Nigel J.|last7=Cassella|first7=John P.|date=2016-03-01|title=Long-term Geophysical Monitoring of Simulated Clandestine Graves using Electrical and Ground Penetrating Radar Methods: 4–6 Years After Burial|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.13009/abstract|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|language=en|volume=61|issue=2|pages=309–321|doi=10.1111/1556-4029.13009|issn=1556-4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=John J.|last2=Walter|first2=Brittany S.|last3=Healy|first3=Carrie|date=2016-09-01|title=Long-term sequential monitoring of controlled graves representing common burial scenarios with ground penetrating radar: Years 2 and 3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116301707|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=132|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.06.015|bibcode=2016JAG...132...60S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molina|first=Carlos Martin|last2=Pringle|first2=Jamie K.|last3=Saumett|first3=Miguel|last4=Evans|first4=Gethin T.|date=2016-12-01|title=Geophysical and botanical monitoring of simulated graves in a tropical rainforest, Colombia, South America|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116303706|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=135|pages=232–242|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.10.002|bibcode=2016JAG...135..232M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally there has been surveys in graveyards over graves of known ages to determine the geophysical responses of multi-geophysical techniques with increasing burial ages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dick|first=H |last2=Pringle|first2=JK |last3=Wisniewski|first3=KD|last4=Goodwin|first4=J|last5=van der Putten|first5=R|last6=Evans|first6=GT|last7=Francis|first7=JD|last8=Cassella|first8=JP|last9=Hansen|first9=JD|date=2017|title=Determining geophysical responses from burials in graveyards and cemeteries|url=http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/geo2016-0440.1|journal=Geophysics|volume=x|pages=x–x|doi=10.1190/geo2016-0440.1||bibcode=2017Geop...82B.245D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grid energy storage''' (also called '''large-scale energy storage''') is a collection of methods used to [[energy storage|store electrical energy]] on a large scale within an [[grid (electricity)|electrical power grid]]. Electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent power plants such as [[renewable electricity]] sources such as [[wind power]], [[tidal power]], [[solar power]]) exceeds consumption, and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption.

{{As of|2017}}, the largest form of grid energy storage is dammed hydroelectricity, with both conventional hydroelectric generation as well as pumped storage. Alternatives include [[rail energy storage]], where rail cars carrying 300 ton weights are moved up or down a 8-mile section of inclined rail track, storing or releasing energy as a result; or disused oil-well potential energy storage,  where 100 ton weights are raised or lowered in a 12,000&amp;nbsp;ft deep decommissioned oil well.

Developments in battery storage have enabled commercially viable projects to store energy during peak production and release during peak demand.

An alternative to grid storage is the use of [[peaking power plant]]s to fill in demand gaps.

== Benefits of storage and managing peak load ==
The stores are used – feeding power to the grids – at times when consumption that cannot be deferred or delayed exceeds production.  In this way, electricity production need not be drastically scaled up and down to meet momentary consumption&amp;nbsp;– instead, transmission from the combination of generators plus storage facilities is maintained at a more constant level.

An alternate and complementary approach to achieve the similar effect as grid energy storage is to use a [[smart grid]] communication infrastructure to enable [[Demand response]]. These technologies shift electricity consumption and electricity production from one time (when it's not useful) to another (when it's in demand).

Any [[grid (electricity)|electrical power grid]] must match electricity production to consumption, both of which vary drastically over time.  Any combination of energy storage and demand response has these advantages:
*fuel-based power plants (i.e. coal, oil, gas, nuclear) can be more efficiently and easily operated at constant production levels
*electricity generated by intermittent sources can be stored and used later, whereas it would otherwise have to be transmitted for sale elsewhere, or shut down
*peak generating or transmission capacity can be reduced by the total potential of all storage plus deferrable loads (see [[demand side management]]), saving the expense of this capacity
*more stable pricing – the cost of the storage or demand management is included in pricing so there is less variation in power rates charged to customers, or alternatively (if rates are kept stable by law) less loss to the utility from expensive on-peak wholesale power rates when peak demand must be met by imported wholesale power
*emergency preparedness – vital needs can be met reliably even with no transmission or generation going on while non-essential needs are deferred

Energy derived from solar, tidal and wind sources inherently varies &amp;nbsp;– the amount of electricity produced varies with time of day, moon phase, season, and random factors such as the weather.  Thus, renewables in the absence of storage present special challenges to electric utilities.  While hooking up many separate wind sources can reduce the overall variability, solar is reliably not available at night, and tidal power shifts with the moon, so slack tides occur four times a day.

How much this affects any given utility varies significantly. In a [[summer peak]] utility, more solar can generally be absorbed and matched to demand.  In [[winter peak]] utilities, to a lesser degree, wind correlates to heating demand and can be used to meet that demand.  Depending on these factors, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected [[intermittent energy source|intermittent source]]s such as [[solar power]] and [[Wind power|wind turbines]] tend to require investment in grid interconnections, grid energy storage or demand side management.

In an [[grid (electricity)|electrical grid]] without energy storage, generation that relies on energy stored within fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be scaled up and down to match the rise and fall of electrical production from intermittent sources (see [[load following power plant]]).  While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can be quickly scaled up or down to follow the wind, coal and nuclear plants take considerable time to respond to load.  Utilities with less natural gas or hydroelectric generation are thus more reliant on demand management, grid interconnections or costly pumped storage.

The French consulting firm Yole Développement estimates the “stationary storage” market could be a $13.5 billion opportunity by 2023, compared with less than $1 billion in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smit|first1=Debra|title=Jay Whitacre and the edible battery|date=24 August 2015|url=http://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/jay-whitacre-and-the-edible-battery/60826|website=Ozy|access-date=2016-06-15|ref=Ozy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608062631/http://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/jay-whitacre-and-the-edible-battery/60826|archivedate=8 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand side management and grid storage ===
[[File:Energy-Units-01.png|thumb|A sense of units and scale for electrical energy production and consumption]]

The demand side can also store electricity from the grid, for example charging a [[battery electric vehicle]] stores energy for a vehicle and [[storage heater]]s, [[District heating#Heat accumulators and storage|district heating storage]] or [[ice storage air conditioning|ice storage]] provide thermal storage for buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/09/f18/Grid%20Energy%20Storage%20December%202013.pdf |title=Grid Energy Storage |date=December 2013 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]] |page=28 |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228214713/https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/09/f18/Grid%20Energy%20Storage%20December%202013.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At present this storage serves only to shift consumption to the off-peak time of day, no electricity is returned to the grid.

The need for grid storage to provide peak power is reduced by demand side [[Dynamic pricing#Time-based utility pricing|time of use]] pricing, one of the benefits of smart meters. At the household level, consumers may choose less expensive off-peak times for clothes washer/dryers, dishwashers, showers and cooking. As well commercial and industrial users will take advantage of cost savings by deferring some processes to off-peak times.

Regional impacts from the unpredictable operation of wind power has created a new need for interactive [[demand response]], where the utility communicates with the demand. Historically this was only done in cooperation with large industrial consumers, but now may be expanded to entire grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raponline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/synapse-hurley-demandresponseasapowersystemresource-2013-may-31.pdf |title=Demand Response as a Power System Resource |author1=Doug Hurley |author2=Paul Peterson |author3=Melissa Whited |publisher=RAP Energy Solutions, Synapse Energy Economics |date=May 2013 |page=13 |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430205055/http://www.raponline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/synapse-hurley-demandresponseasapowersystemresource-2013-may-31.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance a few large scale projects in Europe link variations in wind power to change industrial food freezer loads, causing small variations in temperature. If communicated on a grid-wide scale, small changes to heating/cooling temperatures would instantly change consumption across the grid.

A report released in December 2013 by the [[United States Department of Energy]] further describes the potential benefits of energy storage and demand side technologies to the electric grid: “Modernizing the electric system will help the nation meet the challenge of handling projected energy needs—including addressing climate change by integrating more energy from renewable sources and enhancing efficiency from non-renewable energy processes. Advances to the electric grid must maintain a robust and resilient electricity delivery system, and energy storage can play a significant role in meeting these challenges by improving the operating capabilities of the grid, lowering cost and ensuring high reliability, as well as deferring and reducing infrastructure investments. Finally, energy storage can be instrumental for emergency preparedness because of its ability to provide backup power as well as grid stabilization services.” &lt;ref name=energy-department-releases-grid-energy-storage-report&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-releases-grid-energy-storage-report|date=12 December 2013|title=Energy Department Releases Grid Energy Storage Report|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513022854/https://energy.gov/articles/energy-department-releases-grid-energy-storage-report|archivedate=13 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report was written by a core group of developers representing [[Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability]], [[ARPA-E]], [[Office of Science]], [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]], and [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]]; all of whom are engaged in the development of grid energy storage.&lt;ref name= energy-department-releases-grid-energy-storage-report /&gt;

=== Energy storages for grid applications ===

Energy storages are a valuable asset for the [[electrical grid]]. They can provide benefits and services such as [[load management]], [[power quality]] and [[uninterruptable power supply]] to increase the efficiency and supply security. This becomes more and more important in regard to the [[energy transition]] and the need for a more efficient and sustainable energy system.

Numerous energy storages ([[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], [[Electric battery]], [[Flywheel energy storage]], [[Supercapacitor]] etc.) are available each different in technology and design. The potential they bring depend on how they are used and where they are deployed to. Not all energy storages operate equally well in all situations. For example, a pumped-hydro station is well suited for bulk load management applications due to their large capacities and power capabilities. However, suitable sitings are limited and their usefulness fades when dealing with localized [[power quality]] issues. On the other hand flywheels and capacitors are most effective in maintaining [[power quality]] but lack storage capacities to be used in larger applications. These constraints are a natural limitation to the storage’s applicability.

Several studies have developed interest and investigated the suitability or selection of the optimal energy storage for certain applications. Literature surveys comprise the available information of the state-of-the-art and compare the storage’s uses based on current existing projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Palizban|first=Omid |last2=Kauhaniemi|first2=Kimmo |date=May 2016 |title=Energy storage systems in modern grids—Matrix of technologies and applications |journal=Journal of Energy Storage|volume=6|pages=248-259|doi=10.1016/j.est.2016.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Luo|first=Xing |last2=Wang|first2=Jihong |last3=Dooner|first3=Mark |last4=Clarke|first4=Jonathan |date=January 1, 2015|title=Overview of current development in electrical energy storage technologies and the application potential in power system operation |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914010290 |journal=Applied Energy |volume=137 |pages=511-536 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.09.081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies take a step further in evaluating energy storages with each other and rank their fitness based on [[Multiple-criteria decision analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Daim|first=Tugrul U. |last2=Li|first2=Xin |last3=Kim|first3=Jisun |last4=Simms |first4=Scott |date=June 2012 |title=Evaluation of energy storage technologies for integration with renewable electricity: Quantifying expert opinions |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210422412000172 |journal=Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions |volume=3|pages=29-49 |doi=10.1016/j.eist.2012.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pham|first=Cong-Toan |last2=Månsson|first2=Daniel |date=November 2015 |title=Suitability analysis of Fuzzy Logic as an evaluation method for the selection of energy storage technologies in Smart Grid applications |journal=IEEE |volume=2015 International Symposium on Smart Electric Distribution Systems and Technologies (EDST) |doi=10.1109/SEDST.2015.7315251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another paper proposed an evaluation scheme through the investigation and modelling of storages as equivalent circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pham |first=Cong-Toan |last2=Månsson|first2=Daniel |date=October 2017 |title=On the physical system modelling of energy storages as equivalent circuits with parameter description for variable load demand (Part I) |journal=Journal of Energy Storage |volume=13 |pages=73-84 |doi=10.1016/j.est.2017.05.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pham|first=Cong-Toan |last2=Månsson|first2=Daniel |date=August 2018 |title=Optimal energy storage sizing using equivalent circuit modelling for prosumer applications (Part II) |journal=Journal of Energy Storage |volume=18 |pages=1-15 |doi=10.1016/j.est.2018.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An indexing approach has also been suggested in a few studies, but is still in the novel stages &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Raza|first=Syed Shabbar |last2=Janajreh|first2=Isam |last3=Ghenai|first3=Chaouki |date=December 2014 |title=Sustainability index approach as a selection criteria for energy storage system of an intermittent renewable energy source |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914004437 |journal=Applied Energy |volume=136 |pages=909-920 |doi=10.1016/j.est.2018.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Air===

====Compressed air====
{{Main|Compressed air energy storage}}
Another grid energy storage method is to use off-peak or renewably generated  electricity to [[compressed air|compress air]], which is usually stored in an old [[mining|mine]] or some other kind of geological feature. When electricity demand is high, the compressed air is heated with a small amount of [[natural gas]] and then goes through [[turboexpander]]s to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62476-2|title=Storing energy from the wind in compressed-air reservoirs|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262407907624762|journal=New Scientist|volume=195|issue=2623|pages=44–47|year=2007|last1=Pendick|first1=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compressed air storage is typically around 60–90% efficient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/02/21/lightsail-gets-5-5-million-for-compressed-air-energy-storage/#gsc.tab=0|title=LightSail Gets $5.5M From Total, Thiel, Khosla, Gates for Compressed Air Energy Storage|work=CleanTechnica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liquid air====

===Batteries ===
{{Main|Battery (electricity)|Rechargeable battery|Battery storage power station}}
[[File:Light-plant-Fig1198-Page989-Ch45-Hawkins-Electrical-Guide.png|thumb|A 900 watt direct current light plant using 16 separate lead acid battery cells (32 volts).&lt;ref name="Hawkins1917"&gt;{{cite book|first=Nehemiah |last=Hawkins|title=Hawkins Electrical Guide ...: Questions, Answers &amp; Illustrations; a Progressive Course of Study for Engineers, Electricians, Students and Those Desiring to Acquire a Working Knowledge of Electricity and Its Applications; a Practical Treatise|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=yyEVAAAAYAAJ|page=989}}|year=1917|publisher=T. Audel &amp; Company|pages=989–}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Battery storage was used in the early days of [[direct current]] electric power. Where AC grid power was not readily available, isolated lighting plants run by wind turbines or internal combustion engines provided lighting and power to small motors. The battery system could be used to run the load without starting the engine or when the wind was calm. A bank of lead-acid batteries in glass jars both supplied power to illuminate lamps, as well as to start an engine to recharge the batteries. Battery storage technology is typically around 80% to more than 90% efficient for newer lithium ion devices such as the [[Tesla Powerwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Aquion-Energys-Disruptive-Battery-Tech-Picks-Up-35M-in-VC |author=Eric Wesoff |date=2 April 2013 |title=Aquion Energy’s Disruptive Battery Tech Picks Up $35M in VC |work=greentechmedia.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806181853/http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Aquion-Energys-Disruptive-Battery-Tech-Picks-Up-35M-in-VC |archivedate=6 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2015/05/09/tesla-powerwall-powerblocks-per-kwh-lifetime-prices-vs-aquion-energy-eos-energy-imergy/ |title=Tesla Powerwall &amp; Powerpacks Per-kWh Lifetime Prices vs Aquion Energy, Eos Energy, &amp; Imergy |date=9 May 2015 |author=Zachary Shahan |website=CleanTechnica |access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battery systems connected to large solid-state converters have been used to stabilize power distribution networks. Some grid batteries are co-located with renewable energy plants, either to smooth the power supplied by the intermittent wind or solar output, or to shift the power output into other hours of the day when the renewable plant cannot produce power directly (see [[Battery storage power station#Installation examples|Installation examples]]). These hybrid systems (generation + storage) can either alleviate the pressure on the grid when connecting renewable sources or be used to reach self-sufficiency and work "off-the-grid" (see [[Stand-alone power system]]).

Contrary to electric vehicle applications, batteries for stationary storage do not suffer from mass or volume constraints. However, due to the large amounts of energy and power implied, the cost per power or energy unit is crucial. The relevant metrics to assess the interest of a technology for grid-scale storage is the $/Wh (or $/W) rather than the Wh/kg (or W/kg). The electrochemical grid storage was made possible thanks to the development of the electric vehicle, that induced a fast decrease in the production costs of batteries below $300/kWh. By optimizing the production chain, major industrials aim to reach $150/kWh by the end of 2020. These batteries rely on a Li-Ion technology, which is suited for mobile applications (high cost, high density). Technologies optimized for the grid should focus on low cost and low density.

==== Grid-oriented battery technologies ====
[[Sodium-ion battery|Sodium-Ion]] batteries are a cheap and sustainable alternative to Li-ion, because sodium is far more abundant and cheaper than lithium, but it has a lower power density. However, they are still on the early stages of their development.

Automotive-oriented technologies rely on solid electrodes, which feature a high energy density but require an expensive manufacturing process. Liquid electrodes represent a cheaper and less dense alternative as they do not need any processing.

===== Molten-state batteries =====
These batteries are composed of two molten metal alloys separated by an electrolyte. They are simple to manufacture but require a temperature of several hundred degree Celsius to keep the alloy in a liquid state. This technology includes [[Molten-salt battery#Sodium Nickel Chloride .28Zebra.29 Battery|ZEBRA]],  [[NaS battery|Sodium-sulfur batteries]] and [[Liquid metal battery|liquid metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/liquid-battery.html|title=Liquid battery big enough for the electric grid?|date=19 November 2009|author=David L.

One approach is to reuse unreliable vehicle batteries in dedicated grid storage [https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2014/03/18/the-afterlife-for-electric-vehicle-batteries-a-future-source-of-energy-storage/] as they are expected to be good in this role for ten years [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/11/121116-second-life-for-used-electric-car-batteries/].  If such storage is done on a large scale it becomes much easier to guarantee replacement of a vehicle battery degraded in mobile use, as the old battery has value and immediate use.

=== Flywheel ===
{{Main|Flywheel storage power system|Flywheel energy storage}}
[[File:G2 front2.jpg|thumb|NASA G2 flywheel]]

Mechanical inertia is the basis of this storage method. When the electric power flows into the device, an [[electric motor]] accelerates a heavy rotating disc. The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed, slowing down the disc and producing electricity. Electricity is stored as the [[kinetic energy]] of the disc. [[Friction]] must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time. This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using [[magnetic bearing]]s, tending to make the method expensive. Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as [[steel]] or [[composite material]]s to resist the [[centrifugal force]]s. The ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic, however, tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application; they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving [[power quality]] in [[renewable energy]] systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.djei.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2015/March/First-Hybrid-Flywheel-Energy-Storage-Plant-in-Europe-announced-in-Midlands-.html First Hybrid-Flywheel |title=Energy Storage Plant in Europe announced in Midlands |date=26 March 2015 |publisher=Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128202155/https://www.djei.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2015/March/First-Hybrid-Flywheel-Energy-Storage-Plant-in-Europe-announced-in-Midlands-.html |archive-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/08/new-energy-storage-plant-could-revolutionise-renewable-sector |title=New energy storage plant could 'revolutionise' renewable sector |work=[[The Guardian]] |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204075936/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/08/new-energy-storage-plant-could-revolutionise-renewable-sector |archive-date=4 December 2016 }}&lt;!--inaccurate--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications that use flywheel storage are those that require very high bursts of power for very short durations such as [[tokamak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint European Torus facility – Flywheel details|url=http://www.efda.org/2011/10/775-tons-of-steel/|accessdate=18 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201124209/http://www.efda.org/2011/10/775-tons-of-steel/|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[laser]] experiments where a motor generator is spun up to operating speed and is partially slowed down during discharge.

Flywheel storage is also currently used in the form of the [[Diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply]] to provide [[Uninterruptible power supply#Rotary|uninterruptible power supply]] systems (such as those in large [[Data Center|datacenters]]) for ride-through power necessary during transfer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/010810_Terremark_Installs_Space_Saving_Flywheel_UPS_in_New_Data_Center |title=Terremark Installs Space-Saving Flywheel UPS in New Data Center |author=David Hamilton |date=8 January 2010 |website=Web Host Industry Review |accessdate=2010-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428165248/http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/010810_Terremark_Installs_Space_Saving_Flywheel_UPS_in_New_Data_Center |archivedate=28 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– that is, the relatively brief amount of time between a loss of power to the mains and the warm-up of an alternate source, such as a [[diesel generator]].

This potential solution has been implemented by EDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.pt|title=EDA – Electricidade dos Açores|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128050358/http://www.eda.pt/|archivedate=28 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2015}} in the [[Azores]] on the islands of [[Graciosa]] and [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]. This system uses an 18 megawatt-second flywheel to improve [[power quality]] and thus allow increased renewable energy usage. As the description suggests, these systems are again designed to smooth out transient fluctuations in supply, and could never be used to cope with an outage exceeding a couple of days.

Powercorp in Australia have been developing applications using wind turbines, flywheels and low load diesel (LLD) technology to maximize the wind input to small grids. A system installed in Coral Bay, Western Australia, uses wind turbines coupled with a flywheel based control system and LLDs. The flywheel technology enables the wind turbines to supply up to 95 percent of Coral Bay’s energy supply at times, with a total annual wind penetration of 45 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects/756 |title=Coral Bay PowerStore Flywheel Project |work=DOE Global Energy Storage Database |accessdate=2017-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826071853/https://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects/756 |archivedate=26 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }},&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen===
{{Main|Hydrogen economy|Hydrogen storage}}

[[Hydrogen]] is being developed as an electrical energy storage medium.&lt;ref name="RSC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=RSC2&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484_Fuel_cell_electric_vehicles_and_hydrogen_infrastructure_status_2012?ev=prf_pub|last1=Eberle|first1=Ulrich|first2=Bernd|last2=Mueller|first3=Rittmar|last3=von Helmolt|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]|date=15 July 2012|accessdate=2013-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209172012/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484_Fuel_cell_electric_vehicles_and_hydrogen_infrastructure_status_2012?ev=prf_pub|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is produced, then compressed or liquefied, cryogenicly stored at −252.882&amp;nbsp;°C, and then converted back to electrical energy or heat. Hydrogen can be used as a fuel for portable (vehicles) or stationary energy generation. Compared to pumped water storage and batteries, hydrogen has the advantage that it is a high energy density fuel.&lt;ref name="RSC2" /&gt;

Hydrogen can be produced either by [[steam reforming|reforming natural gas with steam]] or by the [[electrolysis of water]] into hydrogen and [[oxygen]] (see [[hydrogen production]]). Reforming natural gas produces [[carbon dioxide]] as a by-product. [[High temperature electrolysis]] and [[high pressure electrolysis]] are two techniques by which the efficiency of hydrogen production may be able to be increased. Hydrogen is then converted back to electricity in an [[internal combustion engine]], or a [[fuel cell]].

The AC-to-AC efficiency of hydrogen storage has been shown to be on the order of 20 to 45%, which imposes economic constraints.&lt;ref name="RSC2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=anscombe /&gt; The price ratio between purchase and sale of electricity must be at least proportional to the efficiency in order for the system to be economic. Hydrogen fuel cells can respond quickly enough to correct rapid fluctuations in electricity demand or supply and regulate frequency. Whether hydrogen can use natural gas infrastructure depends on the network construction materials, standards in joints, and storage pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/energy/research/themes/energy-systems/hydrogen/dodds-demoullin-2013-gas-network-conversion Conversion of the UK gas system to transport hydrogen]  {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516103851/http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/energy/research/themes/energy-systems/hydrogen/dodds-demoullin-2013-gas-network-conversion |date=16 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equipment necessary for hydrogen energy storage includes an electrolysis plant, [[hydrogen compressor]]s or [[Liquid hydrogen|liquifiers]], and storage tanks.

[[Biohydrogen]] is a process being investigated for producing hydrogen using biomass.

[[Micro combined heat and power]] (microCHP) can use hydrogen as a fuel.

Some nuclear power plants may be able to benefit from a symbiosis with hydrogen production. High temperature (950 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C) gas cooled nuclear [[generation IV reactor]]s have the potential to electrolyze hydrogen from water by thermochemical means using nuclear heat as in the [[sulfur-iodine cycle]]. The first commercial reactors are expected in 2030.

A community based pilot program using [[wind turbines]] and hydrogen generators was started in 2007 in the remote community of [[Ramea, Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Morel|last=Oprisan|publisher=IEA Wind – KWEA Joint Workshop|date=April 2007|url=http://www.ieawind.org/wnd_info/KWEA_pdf/Oprisan_KWEA_.pdf|title=Introduction of Hydrogen Technologies to Ramea Island|accessdate=2 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730110344/http://www.ieawind.org/wnd_info/KWEA_pdf/Oprisan_KWEA_.pdf|archivedate=30 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar project has been going on since 2004 in [[Utsira]], a small Norwegian island municipality.

[[Underground hydrogen storage]] is the practice of [[hydrogen storage]] in underground [[cave]]rns, [[salt dome]]s and depleted oil and gas fields.&lt;ref name="RSC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Olaf Kruck |author2=Fritz Crotogino |date=14 August 2013 |url=http://www.hyunder.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/D3.3_Benchmarking-of-selected-storage-options.pdf |title=Benchmarking of selected storage options |work=HyUnder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) for many years without any difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hyweb.de/Knowledge/Ecn-h2a.html |author1=Reinhold Wurster |author2=Werner Zittel |title=Hydrogen Energy |work=HyWeb – The LBST Information Portal on Hydrogen and Fuel Cells |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040102122446/http://www.hyweb.de/Knowledge/Ecn-h2a.html |archivedate=2 January 2004 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European project [[Hyunder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hyunder.eu/ |title=Why storing large scale intermittent renewable energies with hydrogen? |work=HyUnder |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111061655/http://www.hyunder.eu/ |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy  an additional 85 caverns are required as it cannot be covered by [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|PHES]] and [[CAES]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyunder.eu/images/Presentations%20EUSEW/2%20HyUnder%20EUSEW%20workshop%20Luis%20Correas.pdf Storing renewable energy: Is hydrogen a viable solution?] {{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Power to gas====
[[Power to gas]] is a technology which converts [[electricity|electrical]] power to a gas [[fuel]]. There are 2 methods, the first is to use the electricity for [[water splitting]] and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid. The second less efficient method is used to convert [[carbon dioxide]] and water to [[methane]], (see [[natural gas]]) using [[electrolysis]] and the [[Sabatier reaction]]. The excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen, fuel cell maker [[Hydrogenics]] and natural gas distributor [[Enbridge]] have teamed up to develop such a [[power to gas]] system in Canada.&lt;ref name="anscombe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anscombe|first=Nadya|title=Energy storage: Could hydrogen be the answer?|url=http://www.solarnovus.com/energy-storage-could-hydrogen-be-the-answer_N5028.html|accessdate=3 November 2012|newspaper=Solar Novus Today|date=4 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819022518/http://www.solarnovus.com/energy-storage-could-hydrogen-be-the-answer_N5028.html|archivedate=19 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipeline storage of hydrogen where a natural gas network is used for the storage of hydrogen. Before switching to [[natural gas]], the German gas networks were operated using [[towngas]], which for the most part consisted of hydrogen. The storage capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200,000 GW·h which is enough for several months of energy requirement. By comparison, the capacity of all German pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 GW·h. The transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss (&lt;0.1%) than in a power network (8%){{Clarify|for what length of the pipeline or power network are the losses given (presumably 1000km)|date=January 2015}}. The use of the existing [[List of natural gas pipelines|natural gas pipelines]] for hydrogen was studied by NaturalHy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf |title=Preparing for the Hydrogen Economy by Using the Existing Natural Gas System as a Catalyst |publisher=Naturalhy |date=October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118102741/http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The power-to-ammonia concept====
The power-to-[[ammonia]] concept offers a carbon-free energy storage route with a diversified application palette. At times when there is surplus [[low-carbon power]], it can be used to create ammonia fuel. Ammonia may be produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity, then high temperature and pressure are used to combine nitrogen from the air with the hydrogen, creating ammonia. As a liquid it is similar to propane, unlike hydrogen alone, which is difficult to store as a gas under pressure or to cryogenically liquefy and store at −253&amp;nbsp;°C.

Just like natural gas, the stored ammonia can be used as a thermal fuel for transportation and electricity generation or used in a fuel cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fenrg.2014.00035/full|title=Ammonia as a Suitable Fuel for Fuel Cells|first1=Rong|last1=Lan|first2=Shanwen|last2=Tao|date=5 May 2018|publisher=|journal=Frontiers in Energy Research|volume=2|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Frontiers|doi=10.3389/fenrg.2014.00035|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901163349/http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fenrg.2014.00035/full|archivedate=1 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard 60,000 m3 tank of liquid ammonia contains about 211 GWh of energy, equivalent to the annual production of roughly 30 wind turbines. Ammonia can be burned cleanly: water and nitrogen are released, but no CO2 and little or no nitrogen oxides. Ammonia has [[Ammonia#Uses|multiple uses]] besides being an energy carrier, it is the basis for the production of many chemicals, the most common use is for fertilizer. Given this flexibility of usage, and given that the infrastructure for the safe transport, distribution and usage of ammonia is already in place, it makes ammonia a good candidate to be a large-scale, non-carbon, energy carrier of the future.

===Hydroelectricity===
====Pumped water====

In many places, pumped storage hydroelectricity is used to even out the daily generating load, by pumping water to a high storage reservoir during off-peak hours and weekends, using the excess base-load capacity from coal or nuclear sources.  During peak hours, this water can be used for [[hydroelectric]] generation, often as a high value rapid-response reserve to cover transient peaks in demand. Pumped storage recovers about 70% to 85% of the energy consumed, and is currently the most cost effective form of mass power storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricitystorage.org/technology/storage_technologies/pumped_hydro/ |title=Pumped Hydro (PH) |website=Electricity Storage Association |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315123945/http://www.electricitystorage.org/technology/storage_technologies/pumped_hydro |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief problem with pumped storage is that it usually requires two nearby reservoirs at considerably different heights, and often requires considerable capital expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pumped Hydroelectric Energy Storage |url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node6.html |publisher=Imperial College London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029024441/http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node6.html |archivedate=29 October 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pumped water systems have high [[Intermittent power source#Terminology|dispatchability]], meaning they can come on-line very quickly, typically within 15 seconds,&lt;ref name=Dinorwig&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhc.co.uk/dinorwig.htm |title=First Hydro Dinorwig Power Station |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512031732/http://www.fhc.co.uk/dinorwig.htm |archivedate=12 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes these systems very efficient at soaking up variability in electrical ''demand'' from consumers. There is over 90 GW of pumped storage in operation around the world, which is about 3% of ''instantaneous'' global generation capacity. Pumped water storage systems, such as the [[Dinorwig power station|Dinorwig]] storage system in Britain, hold five or six hours of generating capacity,&lt;ref name=Dinorwig/&gt; and are used to smooth out demand variations.

Another example is the 1836 MW [[Tianhuangping Pumped Storage Power Station|Tianhuangping Pumped-Storage Hydro Plant]] in China, which has a reservoir capacity of eight million cubic meters (2.1 billion U.S. gallons or the volume of water over [[Niagara Falls]] in 25 minutes) with a vertical distance of 600 m (1970&amp;nbsp;feet). The reservoir can provide about 13 GW·h of stored gravitational potential energy (convertible to electricity at about 80% efficiency), or about 2% of China's daily electricity consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/ch.html CIA – The World Factbook – China]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813072716/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/ch.html |date=13 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new concept in pumped-storage is utilizing [[wind energy]] or [[solar power]] to pump water. [[Wind turbine]]s or solar cells that direct drive [[water pump]]s for an energy storing wind or solar [[dam]] can make this a more efficient process but are limited. Such systems can only increase kinetic water volume during windy and daylight periods.

====Hydroelectric dams====
[[File:FeiCueiReservoir.jpg|thumb|[[Feitsui Dam|Fetsui hydroelectric dam]] in [[New Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].]]

Hydroelectric dams with large reservoirs can also be operated to provide peak generation at times of peak demand. Water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released through the plant when demand is higher.  The net effect is the same as pumped storage, but without the pumping loss. Depending on the reservoir capacity the plant can provide daily, weekly, or seasonal load following.

Many existing hydroelectric dams are fairly old (for example, the [[Hoover Dam]] was built in the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide [[baseload power]] will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit.&lt;ref name="burec_hydro"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/power/edu/pamphlet.pdf|title=Hydroelectric Power|format=PDF|publisher=[[United States Bureau of Reclamation]]|date=|accessdate=2008-10-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021182534/http://www.usbr.gov/power/edu/pamphlet.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sccpa_hoover"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scppa.org/hoover.htm |title=SCPPA Hoover Project Page |publisher=[[Southern California Public Power Authority]] |date= |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927000656/http://www.scppa.org/hoover.htm |archivedate=27 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam,&lt;ref name="burec_hydro"/&gt; compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam is one of the most efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.

A dam which impounds a large reservoir can store and release a correspondingly large amount of energy, by controlling river outflow and raising or lowering its reservoir level a few meters. Limitations do apply to dam operation, their releases are commonly subject to government [[water right|regulated water rights]] to limit downstream effect on rivers. For example, there are grid situations where baseload thermal plants, nuclear or wind turbines are already producing excess power at night, dams are still required to release enough water to maintain adequate river levels, whether electricity is generated or not. Conversely there's a limit to peak capacity, which if excessive could cause a river to flood for a few hours each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rethinkingwater.ca/water_use_plans.html|title=Rethinking our Water Ways - 5.3 Water Use Plans|author=|date=|website=www.rethinkingwater.ca|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005190830/http://www.rethinkingwater.ca/water_use_plans.html|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superconducting magnetic energy ===
{{Main|Superconducting magnetic energy storage}}

Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems store energy in the [[magnetic field]] created by the flow of [[direct current]] in a  [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] coil which has been [[cryogenics|cryogenically]] cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. A typical SMES system includes three parts: superconducting coil, power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator. Once the superconducting coil is charged, the current will not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely. The stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil. The power conditioning system uses an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]]/[[rectifier]] to transform [[alternating current]] (AC) power to direct current or convert DC back to AC power. The inverter/rectifier accounts for about 2–3% energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of [[electricity]] in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip efficiency is greater than 95%. The high cost of superconductors is the primary limitation for commercial use of this energy storage method.

Due to the energy requirements of [[refrigeration]], and the limits in the total energy able to be stored, SMES is currently used for short duration energy storage. Therefore, SMES is most commonly devoted to improving [[power quality]].  If SMES were to be used for [[public utility|utilities]] it would be a [[day|diurnal]] storage device, charged from [[base load power plant|base load]] power at night and meeting [[peaking power plant|peak loads]] during the day.

[[Superconducting magnetic energy storage#Technical challenges|Superconducting magnetic energy storage technical challenges]] are yet to be solved for it to become practical.

===Thermal===
{{Main|Thermal energy storage}}

In Denmark the direct storage of electricity is perceived as too expensive for very large scale usage, albeit significant usage is made of existing Norwegian Hydro.  Instead, the use of existing hot water storage tanks connected to district heating schemes, heated by either electrode boilers or heat pumps, is seen as a preferable approach.  The stored heat is then transmitted to dwellings using [[district heating]] pipes.

[[Molten salt]] is used to store heat collected by a [[solar power tower]] so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm Advantages of Using Molten Salt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605094349/http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |date=5 June 2011 }} Tom Mancini, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM Accessed December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Off-peak electricity can be used to make [[ice]] from water, and the ice can be stored.  The stored ice can be used to cool the air in a large building which would have normally used electric AC, thereby shifting the electric load to off-peak hours.  On other systems stored ice is used to cool the intake air of a [[gas turbine]] [[electrical generator|generator]], thus increasing the on-peak generation capacity and the on-peak efficiency.

A [[Pumped Heat Electricity Storage]] system uses a highly reversible heat engine/heat pump to pump heat between two storage vessels, heating one and cooling the other. The UK-based engineering company Isentropic that is developing the system claims a potential electricity-in to electricity-out round-trip efficiency of 72–80%.&lt;ref name=Isentropic&gt;{{cite web|title=Isentropic's PHES Technology|url=http://www.isentropic.co.uk/our-phes-technology|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010160418/http://www.isentropic.co.uk/our-phes-technology|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, energy storage is economical when the [[marginal cost]] of electricity varies more than the costs of storing and retrieving the energy plus the price of energy lost in the process. For instance, assume a [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage reservoir]] can pump to its upper reservoir a volume of water capable of producing 1,200 [[MW·h]] after all losses are factored in (evaporation and seeping in the reservoir, efficiency losses, etc.). If the marginal cost of electricity during off-peak times is $15 per MW·h, and the reservoir operates at 75% efficiency (i.e., 1,600 MW·h are consumed and 1,200 MW·h of energy are retrieved), then the total cost of filling the reservoir is $24,000. If all of the stored energy is sold the following day during peak hours for an average $40 per MW·h, then the reservoir will see revenues of $48,000 for the day, for a [[gross profit]] of $24,000.

However, the marginal cost of electricity varies because of the varying operational and fuel costs of different classes of generators. At one extreme, [[base load power plant]]s such as [[coal power|coal]]-fired power plants and [[nuclear power]] plants are low marginal cost generators, as they have high capital and maintenance costs but low fuel costs. At the other extreme, [[peaking power plant]]s such as [[gas turbine]] [[Natural gas#Power generation|natural gas]] plants burn expensive fuel but are cheaper to build, operate and maintain. To minimize the total operational cost of generating power, base load generators are dispatched most of the time, while peak power generators are dispatched only when necessary, generally when energy demand peaks.  This is called "economic dispatch".

Demand for [[electricity]] from the world's various grids varies over the course of the day and from season to season. For the most part, variation in electric demand is met by varying the amount of electrical energy supplied from primary sources. Increasingly, however, operators are storing lower-cost energy produced at night, then releasing it to the grid during the peak periods of the day when it is more valuable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/pages/sec8_8.pdf Energy Information Administration / Annual Energy Review 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625051521/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/pages/sec8_8.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }}, Table 8.2a&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where hydroelectric dams exist, release can be delayed until demand is greater; this form of storage is common and can make use of existing reservoirs. This is not storing "surplus" energy produced elsewhere, but the net effect is the same – although without the efficiency losses.  Renewable supplies with variable production, like [[wind power|wind]] and [[solar power]], tend to increase the net variation in electric load, increasing the opportunity for grid energy storage.

It may be more economical to find an alternative market for unused electricity, rather than try and store it. [[HVDC|High Voltage Direct Current]] allows for transmission of electricity, losing only 3% per 1000&amp;nbsp;km.

The United States Department of Energy's International Energy Storage Database provides a free list of grid energy storage projects, many of which show funding sources and amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects |title=Projects |work=DOE Global Energy Storage Database |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115123502/http://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects |archivedate=15 November 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Load leveling ===
The demand for electricity from consumers and industry is constantly changing, broadly within the following categories:
*Seasonal (during dark winters more electric lighting and heating is required, while in other climates hot weather boosts the requirement for air conditioning)
*Weekly (most industry closes at the weekend, lowering demand)
*Daily (such as the morning peak as offices open and [[air conditioners]] get switched on)
*Hourly (one method for estimating television viewing figures in the United Kingdom is to measure the power spikes during advertisement breaks or after programmes when viewers go to switch a kettle on &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/for_christmas/_new_year/christmas_television/37945.stm|title=BBC News – Christmas Television – The great TV ratings war|work=bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112005412/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/for_christmas/_new_year/christmas_television/37945.stm|archivedate=12 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Transient (fluctuations due to individual's actions, differences in power transmission efficiency and other small factors that need to be accounted for)

There are currently three main methods for dealing with changing demand:
*Electrical devices generally having a working [[voltage]] range that they require, commonly 110–120&amp;nbsp;V or 220–240&amp;nbsp;V.  Minor variations in load are automatically smoothed by slight variations in the voltage available across the system.
*Power plants can be run below their normal output, with the facility to increase the amount they generate almost instantaneously.  This is termed 'spinning reserve'.
*Additional generation can be brought online.  Typically, these would be hydroelectric or gas turbines, which can be started in a matter of minutes.

The problem with standby gas turbines is higher costs, expensive generating equipment is unused much of the time. Spinning reserve also comes at a cost, plants run below maximum output are usually less efficient.  Grid energy storage is used to shift generation from times of peak load to off-peak hours. Power plants are able to run at their peak efficiency during nights and weekends.

Supply-demand leveling strategies may be intended to reduce the cost of supplying peak power or to compensate for the intermittent generation of wind and solar power.

===Energy demand management===
{{Main|Energy demand management}}
In order to keep the supply of electricity consistent and to deal with varying electrical loads it is necessary to decrease the difference between generation and demand. If this is done by changing loads it is referred to as demand side management (DSM).  For decades, utilities have sold off-peak power to large consumers at lower rates, to encourage these users to shift their loads to off-peak hours, in the same way that telephone companies do with individual customers.  Usually, these time-dependent prices are negotiated ahead of time.  In an attempt to save more money, some utilities are experimenting with selling electricity at minute-by-minute [[spot price]]s, which allow those users with monitoring equipment to detect demand peaks as they happen, and shift demand to save both the user and the utility money. Demand side management can be manual or automatic and is not limited to large industrial customers. In residential and small business applications, for example, appliance control modules can reduce energy usage of [[water heating|water heaters]], [[air conditioning]] units, refrigerators, and other devices during these periods by turning them off for some portion of the peak demand time or by reducing the power that they draw. Energy demand management includes more than reducing overall energy use or shifting loads to off-peak hours. A particularly effective method of energy demand management involves encouraging electric consumers to install more [[energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]] equipment. For example, many utilities give rebates for the purchase of [[thermal insulation|insulation]], [[weatherstripping]], and appliances and [[light bulb]]s that are energy efficient. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of [[geothermal heat pump]]s by their customers, to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient, as well as to reduce the winter electricity demand compared to conventional air-sourced heat pumps or resistive heating.&lt;ref name="geothermal_incentive"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitalelec.com/Energy_Efficiency/ground_source/index.html |title=Geothermal Heat Pumps |publisher=[[Capital Electric Cooperative]] |accessdate=2008-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206122801/http://www.capitalelec.com/Energy_Efficiency/ground_source/index.html |archivedate=6 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies with factories and large buildings can also install such products, but they can also buy energy efficient industrial equipment, like [[boiler]]s, or use more efficient processes to produce products. Companies may get incentives like rebates or low interest loans from utilities or the government for the installation of energy efficient industrial equipment. Facilities may shift their demand by enlisting a third party to provide [[Energy Storage as a Service (ESaaS)]].

=== Portability ===
This is the area of greatest success for current energy storage technologies.  Single-use and rechargeable batteries are ubiquitous, and provide power for devices with demands as varied as digital watches and cars.  Advances in battery technology have generally been slow, however, with much of the advance in battery life that consumers see being attributable to efficient power management rather than increased storage capacity. Portable [[consumer electronics]] have benefited greatly from size and power reductions associated with [[Moore's law]]. Unfortunately, Moore's law does not apply to hauling people and freight; the underlying energy requirements for transportation remain much higher than for information and entertainment applications. Battery capacity has become an issue as pressure grows for alternatives to [[internal combustion engine]]s in cars, trucks, buses, trains, ships, and aeroplanes.  These uses require far more [[energy density]] (the amount of energy stored in a given volume or weight) than current battery technology can deliver. Liquid [[hydrocarbon]] fuel (such as [[gasoline]]/[[petrol]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]), as well as alcohols ([[methanol]], [[ethanol]], and [[butanol]]) and [[lipids]] ([[straight vegetable oil]], [[biodiesel]]) have much higher energy densities.

There are synthetic pathways for using electricity to reduce carbon dioxide and water to liquid hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels.&lt;ref name="great_lakes_wind_potential"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greengold.org/wind/documents/107.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325012758/http://greengold.org/wind/documents/107.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009 |title=A Great Potential: The Great Lakes as a Regional Renewable Energy Source|first=David|last=Bradley|date=6 February 2004|accessdate=2008-10-04|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pathways begin with electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen, and then reducing carbon dioxide with excess hydrogen in variations of the reverse [[water gas shift reaction]]. Non-fossil sources of carbon dioxide include [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] plants and [[sewage treatment]] plants. Converting electrical energy to carbon-based liquid fuel has potential to provide portable energy storage usable by the large existing stock of motor vehicles and other engine-driven equipment, without the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen or another exotic [[energy carrier]]. These synthetic pathways may attract attention in connection with attempts to improve [[energy security]] in nations that rely on imported petroleum, but have or can develop large sources of renewable or nuclear electricity, as well as to deal with possible future [[Export land model|declines in the amount of petroleum]] available to import.

Because the transport sector uses the energy from petroleum very inefficiently, replacing petroleum with electricity for mobile energy will not require very large investments over many years.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Reliability ===
Virtually all devices that operate on electricity are adversely affected by the sudden removal of their power supply.  Solutions such as UPS ([[Uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]]) or backup generators are available, but these are expensive.  Efficient methods of power storage would allow for devices to have a built-in backup for power cuts, and also reduce the impact of a failure in a generating station.  Examples of this are currently available using [[fuel cell]]s and flywheels.

'''Immersion baptism''' (also known as '''baptism by immersion''' or '''baptism by submersion''') is a method of [[baptism]] that is distinguished from baptism by [[affusion]] (pouring) and by [[aspersion]] (sprinkling), sometimes without specifying whether the immersion is total or partial,&lt;ref&gt;"Baptism (Gr. ''baptizein'', 'to dip in water') Initiation into the Christian faith through a worship ceremony in which water is applied by sprinkling (aspersion), pouring (affusion), or immersion while the Trinitarian formula is spoken … Main modes of baptism are immersion (dipping or plunging), pouring (affusion), and sprinkling (aspersion)." – [https://books.google.com/books?id=UJ9PYdzKf90C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=McKim,+Westminster+dictionary+of+theological+terms&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K27OTL-QKoX1sgbPy4mXCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=immersion&amp;f=false Donald K.

C., ''The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary (Eerdmans 1987), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Some form of immersion is envisaged, although affusion is allowed if running or standing water is lacking: 'If you do not have either, pour water three times on the head'." – Martin, R. P., &amp; Davids, P. H. (2000). Dictionary of the later New Testament and its developments (electronic ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; but very commonly with the indication that the person baptized is immersed completely.&lt;ref&gt;"Immersion, Baptism by (BAP-tih-zuhm bai ih-MER-shuhn): A method of baptizing whereby the whole person is submerged in water three times while the Trinitarian formula is pronounced. In the Rite of Baptism, immersion is indicated as the first way to baptize. For immersion, the candidate steps down or into a pool of water at waist height." – Stravinskas, ''Catholic Dictionary'' (Our Sunday Visitor 1993, 2002), p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;""While much debate has focused on the varying interpretations of the forms of baptism, each form (immersion, sprinkling, or pouring) is clearly associated with the concept of cleansing and identification, which are the two integral parts of Spirit baptism. Immersion, however, depicts more clearly the symbolic aspect of baptism since its three steps—immersion (going into the water), submersion (going under the water), and emersion (coming out of the water)—more closely parallel the concept of entering into the death of Christ, experiencing the forgiveness of sins, and rising to walk in the newness of Christ’s resurrected life (Rom 6:4)." – Douglas, &amp; Tenney (eds.), ''New International Bible Dictionary'' (Zondervan 1987), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"According to the rules of by far the largest portion of the Christian Church the water may be used in any one of three ways: ''immersion'', where the recipient enters bodily into the water, and where, during the action, the head is plunged either once or three times beneath the surface; ''affusion'', where water is poured upon the head of the recipient who stands either in water or on dry ground; and ''aspersion'', where water is sprinkled on the head or on the face.&lt;br&gt;''1. Immersion'' It has frequently been argued that the word ''baptízein'' invariably means 'to dip' or 'immerse' and that therefore Christian baptism must have been performed originally by immersion only, and that the other two forms, infusion and aspersion, are invalid – that there can be no real baptism unless the method of immersion be used. But the word that invariably means 'to dip' is not ''baptízein'' but ''báptein''; ''baptízein'' has a wider signification; and its use to denote the Jewish ceremonial of pouring water on the hands (Lk. 11:38; Mk. 7:4), as has already been said, shows that it is impossible to conclude from the word itself that immersion is the only valid method of performing the rite. ... When immersion was used the head of the recipient was plunged thrice beneath the surface at the mention of each name of the trinity; when the mode was by affusion the same reference to the trinity was kept by pouring water thrice upon the head. The two usages that were recognized and prescribed by the beginning of the 2nd cent. may have been in use throughout the apostolic period, although definitive information is lacking." T.M. Lindsay, ''Baptism. Reformed View'', in Bromiley (ed.) 'The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised', volume 1, page 419 (1988; 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Testament 1995"&gt;'One of their strongest arguments revolves around the Greek word for baptism in the New Testament. Its predominant meaning is "to immerse" or "to dip," implying that the candidate was plunged beneath the water.', Youngblood, R. F., Bruce, F. F., Harrison, R. K., &amp; Thomas Nelson Publishers. (1995). Nelson's new illustrated Bible dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also, though less commonly, applied exclusively to modes of baptism that involve only partial immersion (see Terminology, below)

==Terminology==

Baptism by immersion is understood by some to imply submersion of the whole body beneath the surface of the water.&lt;ref name="New Testament 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The baptism of John did have certain similarities to the ritual washings at Qumran: both involved withdrawal to the desert to await the lord; both were linked to an ascetic lifestyle; both included total immersion in water; and both had an eschatological context.' (Maxwell E. Johnson, 'Living Water, Sealing Spirit: Readings on Christian Initiation', 1995), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Immersion, however, depicts more clearly the symbolic aspect of baptism since its three steps—immersion (going into the water), submersion (going under the water), and emersion (coming out of the water)—more closely parallel the concept of entering into the death of Christ, experiencing the forgiveness of sins, and rising to walk in the newness of Christ’s resurrected life (Rom 6:4).' (Douglas, &amp; Tenney (eds.)., 'New International Bible Dictionary ', 1987), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Immersion, Baptism by (BAP-tih-zuhm bai ih-MER-shuhn): A method of baptizing whereby the whole person is submerged in water three times while the Trinitarian formula is pronounced. In the Rite of Baptism, immersion is indicated as the first way to baptize. For immersion, the candidate steps down or into a pool of water at waist height." (Stravinskas, ‘Catholic Dictionary’, 2002), p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Presumably D5 and D6 apply to men and women alike; after completing the immersion (D5) – that is, after submerging totally in the water and emerging – the convert, whether male or female, is deemed to be like an Israelite in all respects (D6).' (Shaye J. D. Cohen, 'The Beginnings of Jewishness', 2001: quoting: The Journal of Jewish studies: Volume 41, p. 185)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The fact that he chose a permanent and deep river suggests that more than a token quantity of water was needed, and both the preposition "in" (the Jordan) and the basic meaning of the verb "baptize" probably indicate immersion. In v. 16 Matthew will speak of Jesus "coming up out of the water." The traditional depiction in Christian art of John the Baptist pouring water over Jesus' head may therefore be based on later Christian practice.' ([http://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/book.pl/code=2979 R. T. France, 'The Gospel of Matthew', 2007, p. 109]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Others speak of baptismal immersion as either complete or partial,&lt;ref name="ldysinger.stjohnsem.edu"&gt;"As to the method of baptism, it is probable that the original form was by immersion, complete or partial" (Williston Walker, "A History of the Christian Church'', quoted in [http://www.ldysinger.stjohnsem.edu/CH_501_Intro/06_Lead_Liturg/01_txtbk_06_pagan_op.htm#&amp;#91;6&amp;#93;.3._BAPTISM_ Saint John's Seminary, Course Lectures, Early Church History to 1500, Baptism).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;"Total or partial immersion of the candidate seems to be the form best grounded in the Tradition, and to be acceptable to most churches" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=anImr8a1MVQC&amp;pg=PA567&amp;dq=%22total+or+partial+immersion%22+baptism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RNI_TdvOJ4yEhQf9zaTpCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22total%20or%20partial%20immersion%22%20baptism&amp;f=false [[Jeffrey Gros]], Thomas F.

[[William Sanford La Sor]], Lothar Heiser, Jean-Charles Picard, Malka Ben Pechat, and Everett Ferguson agree that early Christian baptism was normally by total immersion. Sanford La Sor (1987) considers it likely that the archaeological evidence favours total immersion.&lt;ref&gt;"The philological evidence is technical and inconclusive. But the archaeological and Mishnaic evidence seems to support the argument for immersion. That is clearly what occurred in the contemporaneous Jewish miqva’ot, so that is probably what happened in early Jewish Christian baptism", Sanford La Sor, 'Discovering What Jewish Miqva’ot Can Tell Us About Christian Baptism', Biblical Archaeology Review, (1987), 13.01&lt;/ref&gt; Lothar Heiser (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Die Taufe in der orthdoxen Kirche: Geschicte, Spendung, und Symbolik nach der Lehre der Vater (Trier, Paulinus, 1987), pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; likewise understands the literary and pictorial evidence to indicate total immersion.&lt;ref&gt;"The conclusions of Lothar Heiser on the administration of baptism after examining the literary and pictorial evidence accord with mine: the water customarily reached the hips of the baptizand; after calling on the triune God, the priest bent the baptizand under so as to dip him in water over the head; in the cases of pouring in the Didache and in sickbed baptism the baptized did not stand in the font.", Ferguson, ''Baptism in the early church: history, theology, and liturgy in the first five centuries'' (Eerdmans 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2748-7}}), p. 860&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Charles Picard (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Actes du Xie Congres International d'Archeologie Chretienne, Lyone, Vienne, Grenoble, Geneve et Aoste, 21-28 septembre 1986 (Vatican, 1989), Vol. 2, pp. 1451–68 (1455, 1457, 1459, 1462–63)&lt;/ref&gt; reaches the same conclusion,&lt;ref&gt;"Jean-Charles Picard, working with the literary texts but correlating them with archaeological sources for southern France and northern Italy, concludes that the authors who furnish details of the baptismal rite speak only of immersion.

Commenting on early church practice, other reference works speak of immersion without specifying whether it was total or partial. A recent Bible encyclopedia speaks of the "consensus of scholarly opinion" that the baptismal practice of John the Baptist and the apostles was by immersion.&lt;ref&gt;"Lexicographers universally agree that the primary meaning of baptizo G966 is 'to dip' or 'to immerse", and there is a similar consensus of scholarly opinion that both the baptism of John and of the apostles was by immersion", Jewett, "Baptism", in Murray (ed.), "Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, volume 1, p.466 (rev. ed. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; A standard Bible dictionary says that baptism was normally by immersion.&lt;ref&gt;"Baptism was normally by immersion either in the river or in the bath-house of a large house", Dowley (ed.), "Eerdman's Handbook to the History of Christianity", p. 10 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Among other sources, Old says that immersion (though not the only form), was normally used,&lt;ref name=Old/&gt; Grimes says "There is little doubt that early Christian baptism was adult baptism by immersion.",&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, "Deeply Into the Bone: Re-Inventing Rites of Passage", p. 50 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Marshall says that immersion was the general rule, but affusion and even sprinkling were also practiced,&lt;ref&gt;"Our study has not attempted to demonstrate that affusion rather than immersion was the practice in New Testament times, since it is clear that immersion was the general rule; rather it has shown that there are a variety of points which indicate that affusion (and even sprinkling, ''Did''. 7.3) was also practised" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=lUgZeuOhIg4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=archeology+baptism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qeLOTLj-OJH6sgaCjpmnAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Howard Marshall, "The Meaning of the Verb "Baptize", in Porter, Cross (editors), ''Dimensions of Baptism: Biblical and Theological Studies'' (Sheffield Academic Press 2002] {{ISBN|0-8264-6203-0}}), p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt; since "archaeological evidence supports the view that in some areas Christian baptism was administered by affusion".&lt;ref&gt;''Dimensions of Baptism'' (2002), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; His presentation of this view has been described by Porter and Cross as "a compelling argument".&lt;ref&gt;''Dimensions of Baptism'' (2002), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Laurie Guy says immersion was probably the norm, but that at various times and places full immersion, partial immersion and affusion were probably in use.&lt;ref&gt;"We can be fairly sure that early baptism was not normally by sprinkling.

Therefore, under normal circumstances it ought to be the preferred, even the sole, practice of the church."&lt;ref&gt;Grenz,'Theology for the Community of God', p. 530 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars agree that immersion was the practice of the New Testament church.&lt;ref name="Schreiner p. 81"&gt;"Most scholars agree that immersion was practiced in the NT, and it is likely that both of these texts allude to the practice, even though baptism is not the main point of either text.", Schreiner, "Believer's Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ", p. 81 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Most scholars in the world will admit, regardless of his denomination, that New Testament baptism was by immersion.", Bisagno, "The Power of Positive Preaching to the Saved", p. 106 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Most commentaries just assume immersion to be the original mode, as all Christianity did until after the Reformation.", Moody, "The Broadman Bible Commentary: Acts.

The Cambridge History of Christianity (2006) also concludes from the archaeological evidence that pouring water three times over the head was a frequent arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;"The ''Didache'', representing practice perhaps as early as the beginning of the second century, probably in Syria, also assumes immersion to be normal, but it allows that if sufficient water for immersion is not at hand, water may be poured three times over the head. The latter must have been a frequent arrangement, for it corresponds with most early artistic depictions of baptism, in Roman catacombs and on sarcophagi of the third century and later. The earliest identifiable Christian meeting house known to us, at Dura Europos on the Euphrates, contained a baptismal basin too shallow for immersion. Obviously local practice varied, and practicality will often have trumped whatever desire leaders may have felt to make action mime metaphor" ([http://www.google.com/search?q=Young+%22most+early+artistic%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Margaret Mary Mitchell, Frances Margaret Young, K.

Robin Jensen writes: "Historians have sometimes assumed that baptism was usually accomplished by full immersion - or submersion - of the body (dunking). However, the archaeological and iconographic evidence is ambiguous on this point. Many - if not most - surviving baptismal fonts are too shallow to have allowed submersion.

===Earliest description of Christian baptism outside the New Testament===

Its instructions on baptism are as follows:
{{cquote|Now about baptism: this is how to baptize. Give public instruction on all these points, and then baptize in running water, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.. If you do not have running water, baptize in some other. If you cannot in cold, then in warm. If you have neither, then pour water on the head three times in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

And if thou hast not living water, baptize into other water; and if thou canst not in cold, then in warm (water). But if thou hast neither, pour [water] thrice upon the head in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

==New Testament studies==

{{Wiktionary|βαπτίζω}}
Christian theologians such as [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] use several parts of the [[New Testament]] to support full immersion (submersion) as the intended symbol:
{{quote|1) The meaning of the word ''baptizo'' in Greek is essentially "dip" or "immerse," not sprinkle, 2) The descriptions of baptisms in the New Testament suggest that people went down into the water to be immersed rather than having water brought to them in a container to be poured or sprinkled ({{bibleverse||Matthew|3:6}}, "in the Jordan;" 3:16, "he went up out of the water;" {{bibleverse||John|3:23}}, "much water there;" {{bibleverse||Acts|8:38}}, "went down into the water"). 3) Immersion fits the symbolism of being buried with Christ ({{bibleverse||Romans|6:1–4}}; {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:12}}).&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;}}

Piper asserts that baptism refers to the physical lowering into the water and rising in faith in part because of the reflection of this symbol in {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:12}} which says "having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life."&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;[http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Sermons/ByTopic/23/998_What_Baptism_Portrays/ John Piper, Sermon on May 25, 1997, "What Baptism Portrays"]&lt;/ref&gt; Others hold that there is no evidence in the New Testament that any one mode of baptism was used.&lt;ref&gt;"The New Testament tells us very little about how baptism was administered. ...We are not told what method of baptism was used, whether it was by total immersion or by some form of pouring or sprinkling.

===Criticism of the total immersion (submersion) view===

====Grammatical criticism====
As criticism of the claim that, in {{bibleverse||Acts|8:38–39}}, which is the only reference in the New Testament to Christian baptism being administered in the open, the actions of "going down into the water" and "coming up out of the water" indicate that this baptism was by immersion, it is pointed out that "going down into" and "coming up out of" a river or a store of still water, actions there ascribed to both the baptizer and the baptized, do not necessarily involve immersion in the water.&lt;ref&gt;That it was affusion baptism is admitted as possible by [http://www.biblegateway.com/resources/commentaries/IVP-NT/Acts/Philip-Ethiopian-Eunuch Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch] and taken as certain in John R. W. Stott, ''The Spirit, the Church, and the World'' 1990, referred to in the preceding. See also [http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/wil_shishko/TH.Shishko.baptism.immersion.pdf William Shishko, "Is Immersion Necessary for Baptism"] in ''IIIM Magazine Online. Volume 4, Number 28, July 17 to July 24, 2002, p. 5, reproduced from ''New Horizons'', July–August 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, anti-immersionist Rev. W. A. McKay wrote a polemic work against immersion baptism, arguing that it was a theological invention of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cihm_26338 W.A. McKay, Immersion proved not to be a Scriptural Mode of Baptism but a Romish Invention (Toronto: The Canada Publishing Company, 1881)].&lt;/ref&gt; Differentiating between immersion and affusion,&lt;ref&gt;"When a servant washes the floor she does not immerse it in water, but pours water on it" [https://archive.org/details/cihm_26338 W.A. McKay, Immersion proved not to be a Scriptural Mode of Baptism but a Romish Invention (Toronto: The Canada Publishing Company, 1881)], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; McKay held that βαπτίζω referred to affusion (which McKay understood as standing in water and having water poured over the head), as opposed to immersion.&lt;ref&gt;'Rev. W. H. Withrow, in his recent and excellent work on the Catacombs, gives a number of these figures, and on page 535 he says : "The testimony of the Catacombs respecting the mode of baptism, as far as it extends, is strongly in favour of aspersion or affusion. All their pictured representations of the rite indicate this mode, for which alone the early fonts seem adapted ; nor is there early early art evidence of baptismal immersion. " No picture in the world older than the sixteenth century represents our Lord as being baptized by "dipping." (See pp. 44–47.)', [https://archive.org/details/cihm_26338 W.A. McKay, Immersion proved not to be a Scriptural Mode of Baptism but a Romish Invention (Toronto: The Canada Publishing Company, 1881)], page preceding preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Dr. Ditzler, in his recent work on Baptism, after a most thorough examination of no less than thirty-one of the best Greek lexicons and authors, says (p. 161), "every one of the thirty-one authorities sustains affusion as baptism."', ibid., p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'It was through the influence of these pure Apostolic churches that Rome, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, was compelled to abandon her heathenish dipping, and come back to the scriptural mode of baptism, by affusion or sprinkling.', ibid., p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Challenging immersion baptism, he wrote:
{{quote|Where is the evidence that the [[Ethiopian eunuch|eunuch]] was dipped? "Why," cries the Baptist, "he went with Philip ''into'' the water and came ''out'' again." But is not such reasoning trifling with common sense? Do not thousands go into the water and come out again without going under the water? Is it not said that Philip went into the water and came out of it as well as the eunuch? They "''both''" went. If then they prove that the eunuch was immersed they prove also that Philip was immersed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cihm_26338 W.A. McKay, Immersion proved not to be a Scriptural Mode of Baptism but a Romish Invention (Toronto: The Canada Publishing Company, 1881)], p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the same passage the act of baptizing is distinguished from the going down into the water: "They both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. And when they came up out of the water ..."

{{Wiktionary|εἰς|ἐκ}}
As McKay and others also pointed out, the Greek preposition εἰς, here translated as "into", is the same as is used when Peter is told to go ''to'' the sea and take the first fish that came up ({{bibleverse||Matthew|17:27}}) and in other passages where it obviously did not imply entry of the kind that submersion involves. In fact, in the same chapter 8 of the ''Acts of the Apostles'', the preposition εἰς appears 11 times, but only once is it commonly translated as "into"; in the other verses in which it appears it is best translated as "to".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/wil_shishko/TH.Shishko.baptism.immersion.pdf William Shishko, "Is Immersion Necessary for Baptism"] in ''IIIM Magazine Online. Volume 4, Number 28, July 17 to July 24, 2002,] p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The same ambiguity pertains to the preposition ἐκ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/acts/8-39.htm Online Parallel Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lexical criticism====

[[John Calvin]] (1509–1564) wrote that "it is evident that the term baptise means to immerse, and that this was the form used by the primitive Church", but in the same context (''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' IV, xv, 19),&lt;ref&gt;See page 343 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=mNsOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=calvin+institutes+of+the+christian+religion+book+iv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fpzLTNmXKM-Lswby2ainAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false this English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; using the same verb "immerse", but indicating that it does not necessarily mean immersing "wholly", he also wrote: "Whether the person who is baptised be wholly immersed, and whether thrice or once, or whether water be only poured or sprinkled upon him, is of no importance; Churches ought to be left at liberty in this respect, to act according to the difference of countries." Modern, professional lexicography defines βαπτίζω as dip, plunge or immerse, while giving examples of its use for merely partial immersion.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott gives examples of the use of βαπτίζω with reference to a merely partial plunging or dipping: ξίφος εἰς σφαγήν J.BJ2.18.4; σπάθιον εἰς τὸ ἔμβρυον Sor.2.63', Liddell, H. G., Scott, R., Jones, H. S., &amp; McKenzie, R. (1996). A Greek–English lexicon (Rev. and augm. throughout) (305)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntactical criticism====

{{bibleverse||Mark|7:3–4}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|11:38}} are two instances of New Testament uses of the verb ''baptizo'' outside the context of Christian baptism. One speaks of how the Pharisees do not eat unless they "wash their hands" thoroughly (''nipto'', the ordinary word for washing something), and, after coming from the market place, do not eat unless they "wash themselves" (literally, "baptize themselves", passive or middle voice of ''baptizo''). The other tells how a Pharisee, at whose house Jesus ate, "was astonished to see that he did not first "wash himself" (literally, "baptize himself", aorist passive of ''baptizo'') before dinner". Some commentaries claim that these two passages show that the word baptizo in the New Testament cannot be assumed to have the meaning "immerse".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xewBAAAACAAJ A. A. Hodge,Outlines of Theology 1992] {{ISBN|0-85151-160-0}} {{ISBN|978-0-85151-160-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first of the two passages, it is actually the hands that are specifically identified as "washed" ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:3|YLT}}), not the entire persons, who are described as having (literally) "baptized themselves" – {{bibleverse||Mark|7:4–5|YLT}}). Zodhiates identifies the meaning of baptizo here as 'immerse', even if not totally ("wash part of the body such as the hands").&lt;ref&gt;'Washing or ablution was frequently by immersion, indicated by either baptםzפ or nםptפ (3538), to wash. In Mark 7:3, the phrase 'wash their hands' is the translation of nםptפ (3538), to wash part of the body such as the hands. In Mark 7:4 the verb wash in 'except they wash' is baptizomai, to immerse. This indicates that the washing of the hands was done by immersing them in collected water. See Luke 11:38 which refers to washing one’s hands before the meal, with the use of baptizomai, to have the hands baptized.", Zodhiates, S. (2000, c1992, c1993). The Complete Word Study Dictionary : New Testament (electronic ed.) (G907). Chattanooga, TN: AMG Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; but the word is rendered "wash themselves" or "purify themselves", not "baptize themselves" or "immerse themselves", by modern English Bible translations,&lt;ref&gt;"And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash." (Biblical Studies Press. (2006; 2006). The NET Bible First Edition; Mark 7:4)&lt;/ref&gt; professional commentaries,&lt;ref&gt;'Mark’s statement that the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands has often been taken as an exaggeration, even as seriously in error. Archaeological evidence, however, indicates that many Jews of the first century CE attempted to live in a state of ritual purity.' (Collins &amp; Attridge, "Mark : A Commentary on the Gospel of Mark", Hermeneia--a critical and historical commentary on the Bible", 2007), p. 345)&lt;/ref&gt; and translation guides.&lt;ref&gt;'Purify themselves seems somewhat preferable as a base for translating ‘wash themselves,’ since whatever water was used—whether in sprinkling or bathing—had as a primary function the ceremonial purification of the person. Purification is described in various ways, e.g. ‘to become really clean’ (Mazatec), ‘to become not mixed,’ in the sense of contaminated (Mezquital Otomi), ‘to take away pollution’ (Loma)", (Bratcher &amp; Nida (eds.), "A handbook on the Gospel of Mark. UBS handbook series; Helps for translators", 1993), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, the Liddell-Scott-Jones [[Greek–English Lexicon]] (1996) cites the other passage ({{bibleverse||Luke|11:38|YLT}}) as an instance of the use of the word baptizo to mean "perform ablutions", not "baptize", "dip", "plunge", "immerse",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=baptizw&amp;la=greek#lexicon LSJ:βαπτίζω]&lt;/ref&gt; and the standard lexicon of Bauer and Danker treats it as an instance of a derived meaning, "wash ceremonially for the purpose of purification", distinct from the basic meaning ("immerse") of the verb ''baptizo'',&lt;ref&gt;"The basic meaning of ''baptizō'' is 'immerse'. A derived meaning 'wash ceremonially for the purpose of purification' is given in the standard lexicon (Bauer and Danker, BDAG, 164) but documented only by Mark 7:4 and Luke 11:38" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=W8XYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Bauer+and+Danker%22+baptism&amp;dq=%22Bauer+and+Danker%22+baptism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cm0sTYCTG4a4hAfQgaXuCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA M.

N. Ritchie, ''The Regulative Principle of Worship'', p. 301).]&lt;/ref&gt; References to the cleaning of vessels which use baptizo also refer to immersion,.&lt;ref&gt;'Despite assertions to the contrary, it seems that baptizō, both in Jewish and Christian contexts, normally meant "immerse", and that even when it became a technical term for baptism, the thought of immersion remains. The use of the term for cleansing vessels (as in Lev. 6:28 Aquila [cf. 6:21]; cf. baptismos in Mk. 7:4) does not prove the contrary, since vessels were normally cleansed by immersing them in water. The metaphorical uses of the term in the NT appear to take this for granted, e.g. the prophecy that the Messiah will baptise in Spirit and fire as a liquid (Matt. 3:11), the "baptism" of the Israelites in the cloud and the sea (1 Cor. 10:2), and in the idea of Jesus’ death as a baptism (Mk. 10:38f. baptisma; Lk. 12:50; cf. Ysebaert, op. cit., 41 ff.).', Brown, C. (1986). Vol. 1: New international dictionary of New Testament theology (144)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hermeneutical criticism====

The burial symbolism of {{bibleverse||Romans|6:4}} and {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:12}} is seen by some Christians as a reference not to the manner of baptism in water but to "a spiritual death, burial, resurrection, and new life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleviews.com/baptism-lh.html Leland M. Haines, Baptism]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Armenian Baptists
Baptism by partial immersion, a mode of baptism that, according to the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church is still found in the Eastern Church,&lt;ref name="ODCC"&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church by F. L. Cross (Editor), E. A. Livingstone (Editor) Oxford University Press, USA; 3 edition p.65 (March 13, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; is also the form presented in the ''Key of Truth'', the text described as the manual of the old Armenian Baptists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Baptism |display=Baptism § 3. Immersion or Aspersion |volume=3 |page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lays down that the person to be baptized "shall come on his knees into the midst of the water" and there make a profession of faith to "the elect one", who "instantly takes the water into his hands, and ... shall directly or indirectly empty out the water over the head".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ie/books?id=8x8JtuiEmF0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22key+of+truth%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G5ZF2d_Ae2&amp;sig=_CmXUyLL3UIdUSMWP1ICWBEvarI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2TFtS9PNOtHX-Qbd6-TrAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=baptism%20knees&amp;f=false The Key of Truth, a Manual of the [[Paulician]] Church of Armenia (reproduction 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-110-36174-8}}),] p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

;Saint Thomas Christians
The [[Syro Malabar Catholic]] sect of the [[Saint Thomas Christians]], who trace their origin to [[Thomas the Apostle]], have always practised [[affusion|pouring]] rather than any form of immersion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Miller+%22Thomists+of+India%22&amp;btnG= Randolph A.

However the [[Malankara Church]] follows child immersion baptism in [[Baptismal font]].

===Roman Catholicism===
According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]],
:"Baptism is performed in the most expressive way by triple immersion in the baptismal water. However, from ancient times it has also been able to be conferred by pouring the water three times over the candidate's head"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3J.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1239).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021205831/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3J.HTM |date=October 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===

====Normative full-immersion baptism ====

Complete submersion of the person being baptized is the custom only among some [[religious denomination|denominations]] that have arisen in the second millennium, but, since the form of immersion that is in use in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] is referred to as "full immersion", that church is included in this section.

=====United Pentecostal=====

Baptism is a second essential component of [http://www.upci.org UPCI] doctrine. Members of the UPCI affirm an indispensable need for baptism, citing John 3:5, Acts 2:38 and Matthew 28:19. They point to Matthew 3:13–16 as evidence that even Jesus himself was baptized. The UPCI mode of baptism is complete immersion in water, completed in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.

=====Anabaptists=====

[[Anabaptist]]s ("re-baptizers") and [[Baptists]] promote adult baptism, or "[[believer's baptism]]". Baptism is seen as an act identifying one as having accepted Jesus Christ as Savior.

Anabaptists were given that name because of performing baptism on people whom others, but not the Anabaptists, considered to be already baptized. They did not accept [[infant baptism]] as true baptism.

Anabaptists perform baptisms indoors in a baptismal font or baptistry, a swimming pool, or a bathtub, or outdoors in a creek or river. Baptism memorializes the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus.{{bibleref2c|Rom|6}} Baptism, they believe, does not accomplish anything in itself, but is an outward personal sign or testimony that the person's sins have already been washed away by the blood of Christ shed on the cross.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;''London Baptist Confession of 1644'', XVII.

=====Baptists=====
{{Main article|Baptist_beliefs#Believer's baptism}}

Immersion baptism, understood as demanding total submersion of the body, is required by [[Baptists]], as enunciated in the 1689 [[Baptist Catechism]]: "Baptism is rightly administered by immersion, or dipping the whole body of the person in water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Optional immersion baptism====
Major Protestant groups in which baptism by total or partial immersion is optional, although not typical, include [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christchurchanglican.org/ang_topix/baptism.html Anglican Faith: Baptism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlsessays.net/files/NitzBaptism.pdf Baptism: Baptist and Lutheran Teachings Compared], by Marcus C. Nitz, pp1-2 &amp; p5, [[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What is the meaning of the word 'baptize'? 'Baptize' means to apply water by washing, pouring, sprinkling, or immersing" – ''Luther's Small Catechism'', par. 244&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]],&lt;ref&gt;"Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary; the Baptism is rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person" – "Westminster Confession of Faith," par. 6.141&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methodism|Methodists]],&lt;ref&gt;"The real difference between Baptists and other catholic Christians (including Methodists) comes in our understanding of who is the primary actor in Baptism. Is Baptism something God does, or is it just an act of the believer? If it is God’s act of imparting Grace, then the mode of Baptism--sprinkling, pouring, or immersion--is irrelevant. If, on the other hand, it is an act of the believer--as the Baptists believe in believer’s baptism--the mode of the application of the water is of extreme importance. And this is the fundamental difference between how we understand Baptism and how our baptist brothers and sisters understand it. For them it is their act; for us it is God’s act" ([Gregory S. Neal, The Sacrament of Holy Baptism).]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Nazarene]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baptism may be administered by sprinkling, pouring, or immersion, according to the choice of the applicant" – ''Church of the Nazarene Manual'', 1972 ed., p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other denominations===

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
Latter-day Saints’ written explanations concerning baptism stated: “&amp;hellip;we are baptized by being lowered under water and raised back up by a person who has authority from God to do so. This action symbolizes Jesus Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection, and it also represents the end of our old lives and beginning a new life as His disciples.”&lt;ref&gt;Official Web site of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints [https://www.mormon.org/beliefs/commandments, from subheading "Baptism and Confirmation"]. Retrieved Sept. 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacenerd.blogspot.com/2007/10/on-baptism.html On Baptism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.net/forums/learn-about-mormon-church/9201-baptism.html Baptism???]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'' 20:72-74&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng See ref. for full context]&lt;/ref&gt;) gives the authoritative declaration on mode:

&lt;small&gt;72 Baptism is to be administered in the following manner unto all those who repent–&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;73 The person who is called of God and has authority from Jesus Christ to baptize, shall go down into the water with the person who has presented himself or herself for baptism, and shall say, calling him or her by name: Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;74 Then shall he immerse him or her in the water, and come forth again out of the water.&lt;/small&gt;

Baptism by immersion is the only way to be completely accepted as a member, either converted to or raised in the church; no other form is accepted in the LDS Church. [[Baptism for the dead]] is also performed in LDS temples, to provide this ordinance to those who did not have the opportunity in life, or were physically unable, ''post mortem'', for them to accept as they will. It is performed the same way there.

====The Community of Christ====
The [[Community of Christ]], formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, practices baptism by submersion.

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
Complete immersion of the person in water is considered necessary by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=174|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immersion in other religious groups==

*In Judaism, [[mikvah|self-administered immersion]] is used for ritual cleansing,&lt;ref&gt;"In addition to full immersion, which requires a mikveh, handwashing is mandatory or customary in various circumstances, such as on getting up in the morning, before eating bread, after sexual intercourse and after a burial.", Lange, "An introduction to Judaism", p. 94 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and as a rite of passage for proselytes.&lt;ref&gt;"Another common practice is for converts to Judaism to immerse in a ritual bath.", Cohn-Sherbok, "Messianic Judaism", p. 160. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Proselyte baptism was like other washings in Judaism in being a full immersion and in being self-administered.", Ferguson, "Baptism in the early church: history, theology, and liturgy in the first five centuries", p. 103 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21926">In the height region between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km altitude on Earth, the ionospheric plasma is electrically conducting. Atmospheric tidal winds due to differential  solar heating or due to gravitational lunar forcing move the ionospheric plasma against the [[geomagnetic field]] lines thus generating electric fields and currents just like a [[dynamo]] coil moving against magnetic field lines. That region is therefore called '''ionospheric dynamo region'''.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels&gt;Chapman , S.J. and J. Bartels, „Geomagnetism“ , Clarendon Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; 
The magnetic manifestation of these electric currents on the ground  can be observed during magnetospheric quiet conditions. They are called Sq-variations (S=solar; q=quiet) and L-variations  (L=lunar) of the geomagnetic field.
Additional electric currents are generated by the varying  [[magnetospheric electric convection field]]. These are the DP1-currents (the auroral electrojets) and the  polar DP2-currents.
&lt;ref name=Akasofu&gt;Akasofu, S.I., "Physics of Magnetospheric Substorms", Reidel, Dordrecht, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a polar-ring current has been derived from the observations which depends on the polarity of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;Heppner, J.P., in Dyer, E.R. (ed), "Critical Problems of Magnetospheric Physics", Nat. Acad. Sci.,Washington, D.C., p. 107. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; These geomagnetic variations belong to the so-called external part of the [[geomagnetic field]]. Their amplitudes reach at most about 1% of the main internal [[geomagnetic field]] '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Atmospheric Electric Conductivity==
Radioactive material from the ground and galactic cosmic rays ionize a small fraction  of the atmospheric gas within the lower and middle atmosphere  and make the gas electrically conducting. Electrons quickly  attach to neutral particles forming negative ions. The positive ions are mostly singly charged. The electric conductivity depends on the mobility of the ions . That mobility  is proportional to the reciprocal air density. Thus, the electric conductivity increases almost  exponentially with altitude.  The ions move with the neutral gas making the conductivity [[isotropic]].&lt;ref&gt;Viggiano, A.A., and F. Arnold, in Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. 1, p. 1, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

At heights between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km however -the dynamo region-, solar X- and extreme [[ultraviolet radiation]] (XUV) is almost completely absorbed  generating the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers.  Here, the electrons are already bound to the [[geomagnetic field]] gyrating several times about these lines before they collide with the neutrals, while the positive ions still essentially move with the neutral gas. Thus, the electric conductivity becomes [[anisotropic]]. The conductivity parallel to an electric field  '''E'''  is called  [[Pedersen]] conductivity.  The conductivity orthogonal to '''E''' and the geomagnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  is the [[Hall]] conductivity. Ohmic losses and thus [[Joule]] heating occur when Pedersen currents flow. The component parallel to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  still increases with altitude. Near the geomagnetic dip equator, a west-east directed electric field generates vertical Hall currents which cannot close. Therefore,  a vertical polarization field builds up generating a horizontal Hall current which adds to the Pedersen current. Such enhancement is described by the [[Cowling]] conductivity. Pedersen and Hall conductivities reach maximum values near 120 to 140&amp;nbsp;km  altitudes with numbers of about 1 mS/m during sunlit conditions. During the night, these numbers may decrease by a factor of ten or more. The values of  these conductivities depend on local time, latitude, season and solar 11- year cycle. The height integrated conductivities become of the order of 50 S, or  a total resistance of the dynamo region of about 1/50 = 0.02 Ohm during daytime conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Fejer, A.A., Rev. Geophys., 2, 275, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

In the auroral regions which lie between about 15° and 20° geomagnetic co-latitude and the corresponding latitudes in the southern hemisphere, precipitating high energy particles from the [[magnetosphere]] ionize the neutral gas, in particular at heights around 110 to 120&amp;nbsp;km, and increase the electric conductivity substantially. During magnetospheric disturbed conditions, this conductivity enhancement becomes much larger, and the auroral regions move equatorward.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt;

At heights above about 200&amp;nbsp;km, collisions between neutrals and plasma become rare so that both ions and electrons can only gyrate about the geomagnetic lines of force, or drift orthogonal to '''E''' and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. The parallel conductivity is so large that the geomagnetic lines of force become electric potential lines, and only electric fields orthogonal to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; can exist (see [[magnetosphere]]).

==Atmospheric Tides==
'''Atmospheric tides''' are global-scale waves excited by regular solar differential heating (thermal tides)or by the gravitational [[tidal force]] of the moon (gravitational tides). The atmosphere behaves like a huge waveguide closed at the bottom (the Earth's surface) and open to space at the top. In such a waveguide an infinite number of atmospheric wave modes can be excited. Because the waveguide is imperfect, however, only  modes of lowest degree with large horizontal and vertical scales can develop sufficiently well so that they can be filtered out from the meteorological noise. They are solutions of the [[Laplace]] equation &lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, M.S., "The eigenfunctions of Laplace's tidal equations over a sphere", Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.", London, A262, p. 511, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and are called Hough functions. These can be approximated by a sum of [[spherical harmonics]].

Two kinds of wave modes exit: class 1 waves (sometimes called gravity waves), and class 2 waves (rotational waves). Class 2 waves owe their existence to the [[Coriolis effect]] and can only exist for periods larger than 12 hours. Tidal waves can be either internal (travelling waves ) with positive eigenvalues (or equivalent depth)  which have finite vertical wavelengths and can transport wave energy upward, or external (evanescent waves) with negative eigenvalues and infinitely large vertical wavelengths meaning that their phases remain constant with altitude. These external wave modes cannot transport wave energy, and their  amplitudes decrease exponentially with height outside their source regions. Each mode is characterized by four numbers: the zonal wave number n, positive for class 1 waves and negative for class 2 waves (their meridional structures becoming increasingly complex with increasing number n), a meridional wave number m, the eigenvalue, and the period, in our case one solar or [[lunar day]], respectively. The modes are labeled as (m, n). Even numbers of n correspond to waves symmetric with respect to the equator, and odd numbers corresponding to antisymmetric waves.

At thermospheric heighs, [[dissipation]] of atmospheric waves becomes significant so that at above about 150&amp;nbsp;km altitude, all wave modes gradually become external waves, and the [[Hough function]]s degenerate to [[spherical harmonics]]s; e.g., mode (1, -2) develops to the spherical harmonic P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), mode (2, 2) becomes P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), with θ the co-latitude, etc.&lt;ref name=VollandAT&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migrating Solar  Tides===
The fundamental solar diurnal tidal mode which optimally matches the solar heat input configuration and thus is most strongly excited is the (1,&amp;nbsp;-2) - mode. It depends on local time and travels westward with the Sun. It is an external mode of class 2. Its maximum pressure amplitude on the ground is about 60 hPa.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen &gt;Chapman, S., and R.S. Lindzen, "Atmospheric Tides", Kluwer Dordrecht, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[thermosphere]], however, it becomes the predominant mode reaching temperature amplitudes at the [[exosphere]] of at least 140 K  and horizontal winds of the order of  100&amp;nbsp;m/s and more increasing with geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, H. and J.W. King, J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 29,1045, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The largest solar semidiurnal wave is mode (2,&amp;nbsp;2) with maximum pressure amplitudes near the ground of 120&amp;nbsp; hPa. It is an internal class 1 wave. Its amplitude increases with altitude. Although its solar excitation is half of that of mode (1,&amp;nbsp;-2), its amplitude on the ground is larger by a factor of two. This indicates the effect of  suppression of external waves, in this case by a factor of four
.&lt;ref name=VollandAT/&gt;

===Semidiurnal Lunar Tides===
The dominant migrating lunar tide is the (2, 2) mode depending on lunar [[Time zone|local time]]. Its maximum pressure amplitude near the ground is 6 Pa, which is far below the meteorological noise. Therefore, it is not simple to detect such small signal.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen /&gt; Because it is an internal waves, its amplitude increases with altitude reaching values at 100&amp;nbsp;km height two orders of magnitude larger than on the ground.

==Electric Currents==

===Sq-Current===

====Morphology====
More than 100 geomagnetic observatories around the world measure regularly the variations of the [[earth's magnetic field]]. The daily variations during selected days of quiet geomagnetic activity are used to determine a monthly mean. From the horizontal component ΔH of such data, one can derive a corresponding overhead equivalent electric sheet current system at dynamo layer heights of strength

J = 2 ΔH/μ = 1.6 ΔH

with J (in milliAmpere/meter) the electric overhead sheet current, ΔH (in nanoTesla) the observed horizontal component of the geomagnetic variation, and μ the electric permeability of free space.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels /&gt; One can determine the direction of the magnetic field with regard to the current by the simple rule of thumb: if the thumb of the right hand points into the direction of the current, the curved fingers give the direction of the associated magnetic field.

One has to take into account that this relationship is not unique. In general, electric currents within [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] are three-dimensional, and an infinite number of current configurations fits to the geomagnetic variations observed on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima, N., Radio Sci., 6, 269, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic measurement in space are necessary to obtain a realistic picture.

[[File:Sqcurrent.jpg|thumb|400px|Figure 1. Streamlines of equivalent ionospheric Sq current during equinox (1957 - 1969) at 12 UT separated into primary (a) and secondary (b) part. Between two streamlines flow 20 kA &lt;ref&gt;Malin, S.R.C., Phil Trans. R. Soc., London, Ser. A 274, 551,1973&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;]].
Figure 1a shows current streamlines of an equivalent Sq current as seen from the sun at noon. This current configuration is fixed to the sun, while the earth rotates beneath it. A total current of about 140 kA flows within one daytime vortex. The rotating Sq current and the electrically conducting earth interior behave like  a huge  transformer with the dynamo region as the primary winding and the earth as the secondary winding. Since the Sq current varies with the basic period of one day, electric currents are induced within the earth's interior. The magnetic field of this secondary current is superimposed on the magnetic field of the primary Sq current. Methods to separate  both components go back to [[Gauss]]. The amplitude of the secondary current is about 1/3 of that of the  primary current and slightly shifted in  phase. Figure 1b shows that secondary component. The ratio between sheet current and magnetic component given above has now simply the value one.

The Sq current depends on season. The summer [[vortex]] is intensified compared with the winter vortex and reaches into the winter hemisphere. A longitudinal dependence of the Sq current exists which is related to  the inclined dipole component of the internal magnetic field, but probably also to nonmigrating tidal waves from below.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., at all., J. Geophys. Res., Space Physics, 113, 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 11-year [[solar cycle]], the amplitude of Sq increases by a factor of more than two from sunspot minimum to sunspot maximum. Two thirds of this increase may result from the enhancement of the electric conductivity with solar activity. The rest is probably due to the increase of the wind speed caused by the temperature increase with increasing solar activity. During the night, the electron density of the ionospheric [[E-layer]] diminishes much more strongly than that of the [[F-layer]]. Therefore, the height center of the dynamo region shifts upward.&lt;ref&gt;Matsushita, S., and W.H. Campell, W.H. (eds.), "Physics of Geomagnetic Phenomena", Vol. I and II, Academic Press, New York,1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The main driver of the Sq current is the external (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height,&lt;ref&gt;Kato, S., J. Geophys. Res., 71, 3211, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., J. Geophys.Res. 87, 5222, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by  180°. This appears to be the result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity  
.&lt;ref name=VollandAE&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; 
The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity.  
 
Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150&amp;nbsp;km from the equator
.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; Such enhancement of the Sq current  by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. 
During a [[solar flare]], bursts of [[solar radiation]] from the environment of an active  sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase  occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.DF., and S.V. Venkatesmaran, J. Geophys. Res., 81, 139,1971&lt;/ref&gt; During  a [[solar eclipse]], the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, C.U., J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 25,529,1963&lt;/ref&gt; It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity.
 
In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi 
anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanc, M., and A.D. Richmond, J. Geophys. Res., 85, 1669, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaka, K,.Z., et all., Ann. Geophys., 27, 3523, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This current system is called Ddyn.

====Theory====
[[File:Sqblockdiagram.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 2. Blockdiagram illustrating coupling between the horizontal wind '''U''' and pressure p via the Ampere force '''j'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Here '''j''' is the electric current density, '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; the geomagnetic field, h the equivalent depth, σ the electric conductivity, and '''E''' the electric polarization field. In a self-consistent treatment of the coupled system, gate B must be closed. In conventional dynamo theories, gate B is open.]]
In order to determine quantitatively the dynamo action of the neutral wind '''U''', one starts with the horizontal momentum equation of the wind together with  an equation for the divergence of the wind. The momentum equation balances the inertial force, the Coriolis force, and the horizontal gradient of pressure p.&amp;nbsp;In addition, the Ampere force '''J'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; couples the electric  current density '''j''' to the wind and pressure system. The equivalent depth h (the eigenvalue of the tidal mode) determines the divergence of the wind. The electric current must obey [[Ohm]]'s law. An electric polarization field  '''E''' is generated by charge separation to enforce the condition of no sources and sinks of the current. Feedback between wind and electric current occurs via the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''. Usually, the  electric conductivity tensor '''σ''' is considered as a given data set, and a height integrated conductivity tensor '''Σ'''  and a height integrated sheet current  '''J''' are applied.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.D., Geomagn. and Geoelectr. 31, 287,1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In conventional models, the Ampere force is neglected. This means that gate B in Figure 2 is open. This is called a kinematic dynamo. Models with closed gate B are called  hydromagnetic dynamos. The influence of the mutual coupling between wind and current can immediately be seen if one considers an infinitely large electric conductivity σ. In the kinematic model, the electric current would become infinitely large, while the wind amplitude remains constant. In the hydromagnetic model, the current reaches an upper limit, similar to a technical dynamo during short circuit, while the wind amplitude breaks down to a fraction of its original value. Charge separation acts like a self-impedance preventing the current to become infinitely large.&lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;

===L-Current===
Lunar (L) currents are weaker by a factor of about 20 than the Sq currents. The dominant wind component to drive these currents is the (2, 2) tidal mode. The L current is similar in shape as the Sq current, with the difference that four vortices instead of two exit. In each vortex a total current of about 4 kA flows. The seasonal variation of L is similar to that of Sq. During sunlit hours, L is strongly enhanced, while it approaches zero during the night. Thus, the L current exhibits, in addition, a  modulation depending on the lunar phase.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; The geomagnetic effect of the L-current can best been seen near the dip equator where the [[Cowling]] conductivity strongly enhances that current.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt;

===DP1-Current===
Interaction between [[solar wind]] plasma and the polar [[geomagnetic field]] produces a global-scale [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] directed from dawn to dusk  with a potential difference of  about 15 kV during quiet magnetospheric conditions, increasing substantially during disturbed conditions. Charge separation takes place at the [[magnetopause]]. This area is connected with the ionospheric dynamo region via the first open geomagnetic field lines with one footpoint within the auroral regions. Thus, electric discharging currents can flow via field-aligned currents as two small bands within the auroral zone dynamo layer, on the daytime as well as on the nighttime hemisphere. These currents are called DP1 current or auroral electrojets. Their magnitudes  are of the order of Mega Amperes.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt; Ohmic losses and thus Joule heating of these currents is comparable with that due to the solar XUV heat input within middle and lower latitudes during quiet conditions and much larger during disturbed conditions. Therefore, it dominates ionospheric and thermospheric dynamics and causes [[ionospheric]] and thermospheric storms &lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G.W., in  Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. II, p.195, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G. W., Surv. Geophys. 32, 101, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===DP2-Current===
The [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] drives a two cell current within the polar cup  with their vortices situated on the morning and on the evening side. It is called DP2 current. That current exists already during quiet conditions  (S&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;) and becomes enhances during disturbed conditions. It is mainly composed of electric  Hall currents.&lt;ref name= ChapmanBartels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishida, A., and S. Kokubun, Rev. Geophys. Space Sci., 9, 417,1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar-Ring Current===
If the azimuthal  component of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]]  (IMF) is directed toward dusk, the magnetospheric plasma is slowed down in the northern polar cap and accelerated in the southern polar cap. If the azimuthal component of the IMF is directed toward dawn, the situation is reversed. This devitation from co-rotation disappears at lower latitudes. The magnetic effect on the ground within the polar regions corresponds to an ionospheric Hall current at about 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; polar distance encircling the magnetic poles in a clockwise direction as seen by an observer standing on the ground during interplanetatry sectors with fields pointing away from the sun, and in a counterclockwise direction during toward-sector polarity &lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Svalgaard, L., J. Geophys. Res., 78, 2064, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jenny Greenteeth''' is a figure in [[English folklore]].  A river [[hag]], similar to [[Peg Powler]] or a [[grindylow]], she would pull children or the elderly into the water and drown them.  The name is also used to describe pondweed or [[Lemnoideae|duckweed]], which can form a continuous mat over the surface of a small body of water, making it misleading and potentially treacherous, especially to unwary children. With this meaning the name is common around [[Liverpool]] and southwest [[Lancashire]].{{sfnp|Vickery|1983|p=247}}

==Description and name==
She was often described as green-skinned, with long hair, and sharp teeth. She is called Jinny Greenteeth in [[Lancashire]], but in [[Cheshire]] and [[Shropshire]] she is called Ginny Greenteeth, Jeannie Greenteeth or Wicked Jenny.

She is also described as lurking in the upper branches of trees at night, although this may be a folklorist's confusion with the northern English ''Jinny-hewlet'', a folk name for an owl.{{sfnp|Higson|1870|p=157}}

==Similar folk figures around the world==
She is likely to have been an invention to frighten children from dangerous waters, similar in nature to the Slavic [[Rusalka]], the [[Kappa (folklore)|Kappa]] in Japanese mythology, or Australia's [[Bunyip]]. But one folklorists have seen in her a memory of sacrificial practices.{{sfnp|Silver|2000|pp=155–156}} A similar figure in [[Jamaican culture|Jamaican folklore]] is called the River Mumma (River Mother). She is said to live at the fountainhead of large rivers in Jamaica sitting on top of a rock, combing her long black hair with a gold comb. She usually appears at midday and she disappears if she observes anyone approaching. However, if an intruder sees her first and their eyes meet, terrible things will happen to the intruder. Relatively is in [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] around [[Lake Erie]], specifically in the urban legends of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] in which sailors use a paranormal being to reason for the dangers and shipwrecks in the [[Erie Triangle|Erie Quadrangle (lake area around Erie County)]].Referred to as the Storm Hag (uncommonly also known as Jenny Greenteeth), is said to be a green skinned woman with teeth like a shark’s but green, as well as piercing yellow eyes who rests on the bottom of the Lake, off the coast of [[Presque Isle]] and sings a song whenever s ship approaches.

When the sailors of the ship hear the song, the Storm Hag attacks the ship and crew with violent storms and waves, sinking and devouring them.

==In popular culture==
Jenny Greenteeth inspired the lake monster (Meg Mucklebones) in the 1985 [[Ridley Scott]] fantasy film ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]''.{{r|Fig}}

Jenny Green Teeth (note the words are separated) is the title character in a book of short stories, ''Jenny Green Teeth and Other Short Stories'' by New Zealand-born English writer and Scholar [[Joel Hayward]].{{r|Story}}

Jenny Green Teeth is also the main subject of a poem, "Welsh Maiden", by [[Joel Hayward]] in his collection, ''Lifeblood: A Book of Poems'' (2003);{{r|Poem}} and is recalled by *[[John Heath-Stubbs]] in his poem ‘The Green Man’s Last Will and Testament’, lamenting the eclipse of "the cruel nymphs/ Of the northern streams, [[Peg Powler]] of the Tees/ And Jenny Greenteeth of the Ribble".&lt;ref&gt;C A Duffy ed., ''The Map and the Clock'' (London 2016) p. 506-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Novella|novelette]] "Water Babies" by [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Jenny Greenteeth is mentioned as being one of many names for a child-snatching water-demon.  In the novella, an Australian police officer investigates a series of drownings that turn out to be predatory attacks by a seal-like creature.{{sfnp|Brown|2006|p=213}}

She appears in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[The Wee Free Men]]'', attacking the main character Tiffany Aching and her brother Wentworth near a shallow stream.

This is the '''list of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' monsters''' from products published in 1974–1976, an important element of that [[role-playing game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Detlef |editor1-last= Wienecke-Janz | year = 2002 | title = Lexikon der Zauberwelten – Gandalf &amp; Co. | publisher = Wissen Media Verlag | isbn = 3-577-13505-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list only includes monsters from official ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' supplements published by [[TSR, Inc.]], not those licensed or unlicensed third party products such as video games or unlicensed ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' manuals. This list only includes the content from the original 1974 ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' boxed set, the ''Greyhawk'' supplement (1974), the ''Blackmoor'' supplement (1975), and ''Eldritch Wizardry'' (1976).

== TSR 2002 – ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''  Box Set (1974) ==
[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|The 1974 ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' boxed set]] by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]] contained three booklets, including a list of monsters in the booklet "Monsters &amp; Treasure".  This booklet contained an index on pages 3–4 featuring statistics about how many creatures of each type of creature appeared per encounter, armor class, how many inches the creature could move on its turn, hit dice, % in lair, and treasure. Pages 5–20 followed with descriptions of each of the monsters, typically consisting of one or more paragraphs. Most of the monsters on this book did not feature an illustration. Also featured are descriptions of humans (bandits, brigands, berserkers, dervishes, nomads, buccaneers, cavemen, and mermen), horses, insects, and other small and large animals.

In addition, the signal of several binary black holes merging into a single black hole and in so doing producing [[gravitational wave]]s have been observed by the [[LIGO]] instrument.  These are listed above in the section [[List of black holes#Stellar_black_holes_and_candidates#|Black holes detected by gravitational wave signals]].

== Highest mountains in Austria ==
This table lists about 150 Austrian summits above 3150 m with a [[topographic prominence]] of at least 150 m and nine peaks of note with a slightly lower re-ascent. Only those mountains with a prominence of 150 m or more are ranked.

!Mountain 
!Height (m)&lt;ref&gt;Heights are from the ''{{lang|de|[[Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen]]}}'' Austrian maps online or the relevant [[Alpine Club Guide]] or [[Alpine Club map]].  Assume an error rate of up to 10 m, as height estimates can vary dramatically between sources. For example, the [[Großvenediger]] summit is 3657 m on the ''Austrian maps online'', 3666 or 3667 m in much literature (e.g. in End &amp; Peterka, 2006), but 3674 m in most literature and on most websites. Some of the discrepancies stem from snowmelt. For instance, until the 20th century the snowy north peak of the [[Wildspitze]] was the higher summit (then measured at 3772 m), but it now is at least 5 meters lower than the rocky south summit, which is 3768 or 3770 m. Indeed, the 3674 m estimate for the snow cap of Großvenediger dates from the mid 19th-century or earlier [https://books.google.com/books?id=nawAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=Großvenediger].&lt;/ref&gt;

![[Topographic prominence|Prominence]] (m)&lt;ref&gt;Prominence estimates have an even higher error range than summit heights, as the pass height estimates vary too while not all low points between peaks have been measured.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3789">Four major river systems follow meandering courses from north to south, draining into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. From west to east these are the [[Cavalla River|Cavally]], [[Sassandra River|Sassandra]], [[Bandama River|Bandama]], and [[Komoé River|Comoé]] — all relatively untamed rivers navigable only short distances inland from the coast. In the north, many smaller tributaries change to dry streambeds between rains.

== Major Rivers ==
The Cavally River has its headwaters in the [[Mount Richard-Molard|Nimba Mountains]] in Guinea and forms the border between Ivory Coast and Liberia for over half its length. It crosses rolling land and rapids and is navigable for about fifty kilometers inland from its exit to the sea near Cape Palmas.

The Sassandra River Basin has its source in the high ground of the north, where the Tiemba River joins the Férédougouba River, which flows from the Guinea highlands. It is joined by the Bagbé, Bafing, Nzo, Lobo, and Davo rivers and winds through shifting sandbars to form a narrow estuary, which is navigable for about eighty kilometers inland from the port of Sassandra.

The Bandama River, often referred to as the Bandama Blanc, is the longest in the country, joining the Bandama Rouge (also known as the Marahoué), Solomougou, Kan, and Nzi rivers over its 800-kilometer course. This large river system drains most of central Ivory Coast before it flows into the Tagba Lagoon opposite Grand-Lahou. During rainy seasons, small craft navigate the Bandama for fifty or sixty kilometers inland.

Easternmost of the main rivers, the Comoé, formed by the Leraba and Gomonaba, has its sources in the Sikasso Plateau of Burkina Faso. It flows within a narrow 700-kilometer basin and receives the Kongo, and Iringou tributaries before winding among the coastal sandbars and emptying into the Ebrié Lagoon near Grand-Bassam. The Comoé is navigable for vessels of light draft for about fifty kilometers to Alépé.

Large dams were built in the 1960s and 1970s to control the flow of major rivers to the south. These projects created reservoirs, now referred to as lakes bearing the names of the dams- -Buyo on the Sassandra, Kossou and Taabo on the Bandama, and Ayamé on the small Bia River in the southeast corner of the country. [[Lake Kossou]] is the largest of these, occupying more than 1,600 square kilometers in the center of the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3237">'''Lithoprotection''' is a term introduced in 2001 by Armenian biologist Tigran Tadevosyan as the name to the phenomenon where rock cover of a habitat diversifies local wildlife.

==Etymology==
The word "lithoprotection" originates from the Greek root "lithos", meaning "stone", and the Latin root "protectus", meaning "to cover".

==Definition==
Originally an existence of a lithoprotection had been proposed based on observations of increased plant and animal diversity in habitats with rock cover compared to habitats without rock cover in the same conditions of an arid climate and steep slopes &lt;ref name="Safarian"&gt;Safarian Kh. 1960. An effect of rock-cover on the soil erosion, soil humidity and growth and development of plants.  Agricultural Science Newsletter, (Teghek. Gjugh. git.), 8, pp. 25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tadevosyan, 2001"&gt;Tadevosyan T.L. 2001. Lythoprotection of the Biodiversity in Arid Regions of Armenia.V-th conference of young scientist in Pushino. Biology - science of the 21st century. Puschino, p. 298. (In Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; (Safarian, 1960; Tadevosyan, 2001). To explain this phenomenon, the author compared the life forms of plants, and the body sizes and escape strategies of animals inhabiting habitats with and without rock cover &lt;ref name="Tadevosyan, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tadevosyan, 2002"&gt;Tadevosyan, T.L. (2001): Ex Situ conservation psammophilic species of the flora and plant communities of Ararat Valley. PhD thesis. Institute of Botany, Yerevan, Nation. Acad. Sci. Rep. Arm. (In Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;(Tadevosyan, 2001 - 2002). His conclusion was that many groups of vascular plants, including trees, shrubs, [[succulent]]s, [[fern]]s, and [[moss]] species, linked to rocky substrates because they require higher than an area's average soil humidity, sometimes being shaded by a solid piece of rock, as well as strong attachment to the substrate. On the other hand, many relatively large animals (including larger lizards, snakes, some mammals and many bird species) need habitats with a dense network of shelters created by crevices and spaces between rocks in order survive overheating and predation. Thus, due to its ability to prevent the evaporation of humidity from the soil, to catch the seeds of plants, to hold trees and shrubs securely to the ground and to serve as a network of efficient shelters for many animals and shade-loving plants, rock cover lithoprotection is being considered as a protective element of a habitat biodiversity.

==Conservation==
Managing lithoprotection may be used as a measure of managing wildlife. Removal of a lithoprotection by cleaning an area of stone and rocks is a common practice in an urban landscape development. Because a lack of lithoprotection is equal to decreased biodiversity, this practice can be considered one of the core mechanisms of [[biodiversity loss]] in urban landscapes. Adding lithoprotection in contrary typically attracts wildlife and helps diversify and maintain biodiversity of a landscape &lt;ref name="Tadevosyan, 2001" /&gt;(Tadevosyan, 2001). Bright examples of artificial use of lithoprotection are attractive rockaries, [[Japanese rock garden]] and other elements of a [[garden design]].

The '''Mata Amarilla formation''' is a stratigraphic division of [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]], consisting of rocks deposited between the [[Albian]] and [[Santonian]] ages. The middle section was previously considered to be the [[Pari Aike Formation]].

==Age==
The middle section of the Mata Amarilla Formation has widely been regarded as [[Maastrichtian]] in age, but recent dating of a lava tuff layer shows that it dates back to 96.2 ± 0.7 Ma, during the [[Cenomanian]].&lt;ref name="varelaetal2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Varela | first1 = A.

A '''material passport''' is a document consisting of all the materials that are included in a product or construction. It consist of a set of data describing defined characteristics of materials in products, which give them value for recovery, recycling and re-use.

The core idea behind the concept is that a material passport will contribute to a more "[[circular economy]]", in which materials are being recovered, recycled and/or re-used in an open traded material market. The concept of the 'material passport’ is currently being developed by multiple parties in mainly European countries. A possible second-hand material market or material-bank could become a reality in the future.

Similar concepts are being developed by several parties. Other names for the material passport are:
* Circularity passport &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circularity Passports|url=http://www.epea.nl/circularity-passports/|website=www.epea.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cradle-to-cradle passport &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cradle to cradle ship recycling|url=http://www.maersk.com/en/hardware/triple-e/the-hard-facts/cradle-to-cradle|website=www.maersk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Product passport &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Product passport for eco-innovation|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/sustainable-dev/news/eu-group-says-a-product-passport-would-open-doors-to-eco-innovation/|website=EurActiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Why is a material passport needed? ==
"According to United Nations estimates, construction accounts for some 50 percent of raw material consumption in Europe and 60 percent of waste" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU research project "Buildings as material banks" gets under way: The Cradle to Cradle Material Passport becomes BIM-compatible - Drees &amp; Sommer|url=http://www.dreso.com/en/press/press-releases/detail/aktuell/eu-forschungsprojekt-buildings-as-material-banks-startet-der-cradle-to-cradle-materialpass-wi/|website=www.dreso.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that the earth is a closed system, this situation is objectively untenable. There is an urgent need to go about raw materials in a more intelligent way. A shift in the building sector would greatly benefit a situation towards needing less material, and using material more effectively, e.g. by ensuring a much longer and more useful life cycle.
Proponents of the material passport argue that it is a step towards this direction.

The material passport gives material an identity. By acknowledging that it exists, in a given form in a specific building, it ensures that material receives and keeps a value, e.g. through a possible re-use after the deconstruction of for example a building.

Like a personal passport, the material passport allows the material to ‘travel’, or identifies the most useful future destination after it has served in a building. This could be in another building or in another product altogether. 

By recognizing the individual materials in buildings, new ownership structures could be facilitated, that would enable more functions to be offered as a service. As we now can have lighting as a service, we could have other functions, such as "shelter from elements" as a service, instead of owning a roof.

In general, material passports create incentives for suppliers to produce and developers / managers / renovators to choose healthy, sustainable and circular materials/building products. They fit into a broader and growing movement that aims at developing circular building business models.

== Applicability ==
The material passport can be applied to every product or construction. There are different levels in which a product/construct can be discomposed:
* Product level
* Component level 
* Material level

For a building, a material passport could be a complete description of all products (staircase, window, furnace, …), components (iron beam, glass panel, …), and raw materials (wood, steel, …),that are present in the building. Ideally, this database is created during construction and subsequently continuously kept up to date. In case an existing building does not yet have a material passport, it can be created through various methods (e.g. plan analysis, digital 3D scanning).

A material passport allows the owner of a product/construct to know exactly what it is made of. This is of importance at the end of its useful life, to enable the most effective re-use of the materials. It allows the owner to view a product/construct as a depot, inventory of valuable materials.

Furthermore, the process of creating a material passport also shapes the design of the building. The easier the materials can be extracted and re-used, the better. This will lead to an increase of ‘recoverable’ or ‘reversible’ buildings, buildings that can be dis-assembled as easily as they were assembled.

Another possibility is that a material passport enables the owner to get a better overview of value of the product/construct. Besides the value of the location and of the space, it can now also improve the valuation of the materials used. A higher, or more accurate, valuation of product/construct can be made possible.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
===Advantages===
* By having a material passport, one can anticipate on the deconstruction of the properties and ensure the highest possible usefulness of the materials used after having vacated premises. This is another way of being conscious about the footprint, and limiting our negative impact on the environment.
* A more granular understanding of the construction of a building, might enable novel forms of financing that will support suppliers to provide a service rather than sell a product.
* By reviewing how buildings are valued now, new financing products or financing policies (e.g. higher collateral value)can be developed that better reflect the (financial) value of buildings.
* The recovery of a collateral in case of default might improve through the sale of the parts instead of the building as a whole.

===Disadvantages===
* A passport needs to be kept up to date and maintained throughout a building's life. It is not known yet how work intensive this is, but for it to remain relevant, all changes to the building that happened after the passport was created, need to be logged. Potentially the value of this work will only be apparent at the end of the useful life of a building, which might be several decades away.
* The market for second hand materials is still in its infancy, and currently not able to support the optimal re-use of the materials in a building. Also, much more standardization, at least at the level of components, will be needed to increase the re-use the materials in a building.
* There is no standardization for material passports yet. Passports might therefore prove to have limited usefulness when ultimately needed, due to evolving requirements, or require additional investments during the life of the building to keep them up to market standard.
* Legislation needs to be put in place, to support more sustainable building, enable the development of services instead of ownership, … and support a broad deployment of material passports.
* The infrastructure, mainly IT, to support material passports still needs to be created.
The first scientific publication about a material passport (2012) was written by Maayke Damen and is called "[https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/257741 A resources passport for a circular economy]".  It provides a comprehensive overview of the advantages and disadvantages of a material passport for every actor in the supply chain. It includes an outline for the content of a material passport.

[[File:Villa Cassel.jpg|thumb|The nature centre of [[Pro Natura (Switzerland)|Pro Natura]] near the [[Aletsch Glacier]] ([[Swiss Alps]]).]]

A '''nature center''' (or '''nature centre''') is an organization with a [[visitor center]] or [[interpretive center]] designed to educate people about nature and the environment. Usually located within a protected [[Open space reserve|open space]], nature centers often have trails through their property.  Some are located within a state or city [[park]], and some have special [[garden]]s or an [[arboretum]].  Their properties can be characterized as nature preserves and wildlife sanctuaries.  Nature centers generally display small live animals, such as [[reptile]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, or [[fish]].  There are often museum exhibits and displays about [[natural history]], or preserved mounted animals or nature [[dioramas]].   Nature centers are staffed by paid or volunteer [[naturalists]] and most offer educational programs to the general public, as well as summer camp, after-school and school group programs.

Some nature centers allow free admission but collect voluntary donations in order to help offset expenses.  They usually rely on support from dedicated [[volunteering|volunteers]].

[[Environmental education]] centers differ from nature centers in that their museum exhibits and education programs are available mostly by appointment, although casual visitors may be allowed to walk on their grounds.

Some city, state and national parks have facilities similar to nature centers, such as museum exhibits, [[dioramas]] and trails, and some offer park nature education programs, usually presented by a [[park ranger]].

[[File:River-SideShrineAndSacredGroveOfOsun.jpg|thumb]]
'''Osun-Osogbo''' or '''Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove''' is a sacred forest along the banks of the [[Osun river]] just outside the city of [[Osogbo]], [[Osun State]], [[Nigeria]].

The Osun-Osogbo Grove is among the last of the sacred forests which usually adjoined the edges of most [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] cities before extensive urbanization. In recognition of its global significance and its cultural value, the Sacred Grove was inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Probst. ''Osogbo and the Art of Heritage. Monuments. Deities, and Money''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s saw the desecration of the Osun-Osogbo Grove: shrines were neglected, priests abandoned the grove as customary responsibilities and sanctions weakened. Prohibited actions like fishing, hunting and felling of trees in the grove took place until an Austrian, [[Susanne Wenger]], came and stopped the abuse going on in the grove.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Probst. "Modernism against Modernity. A Tribute to Susanne Wenger." ''Critical Interventions'', ''Journal of African Art History and Visual Culture'', 2009, No.3/4, 245-255. Peter Probst. "From Iconoclasm to Heritage. The Osogbo Art Movement and the Dynamics of Modernism in Nigeria." ''A Companion to Modern African Art''. Edited by Gitti Salami and Monica Blackmun Visona (eds.) Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2013, pp. 294-310.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the encouragement of the [[Oba (ruler)|Ataoja]] and the support of the local people, "Wenger formed the New Sacred Art movement to challenge land speculators, repel poachers, protect shrines and begin the long process of bringing the sacred place back to life by establishing it, again, as the sacred heart of Osogbo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/feature/people-places/osun-osogbo-preserving-culture-arts/|title=Osun Osogbo: Carnival of culture in a sacred forest|work=The Punch - Nigeria's Most Widely Read Newspaper|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Osun-Osogbo Festival==
Every year, the Osun-Osgogbo festival is celebrated in the month of August at the grove. Yearly, the festival attracts thousands of Osun worshippers, spectators and tourists from all walks of life.

For the people of Osogbo Land, August is a month of celebration, traditional cleansing of the city and cultural reunion of the people with their ancestors and founders of the Osogbo Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osunosogbofestival.com/about/|title=About  -   Osun Osogbo Festival|work=osunosogbofestival.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Osun-Osogbo Festival is a two-week-long programme. It starts with the traditional cleansing of the town called 'Iwopopo', which is followed in three days by the lighting of the 500-year-old sixteen-point lamp called 'Ina Olojumerindinlogun'. [[File:Ina oloju merindinlogun.jpg|thumb|Ina Olojumerindinlogun, the sacred lamp lit at the beginning of the annual Osun-Osogbo festival]] Then comes the 'Ibroriade', an assemblage of the crowns of the past ruler, Ataojas of Osogbo, for blessings. This event is led by the sitting Ataoja of Osogbo and the Arugba, Yeye Osun and a committee of priestesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tours.logbaby.com/osunosogbo/|title=Osun Osogbo Festival|work=logbaby.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept of aesthetics in the Osun Osogbo festival==

Aesthetics, according to general usage, is the perception of beauty. It is the appreciation of the beauty in all parts of life, but as a field of study it is mostly concerned with the arts. The aesthetics of the Osun Osogbo festival includes drumming, dancing, musical performing, wearing of elaborate costumes, speaking of the Yoruba language, recitation of [[praise poetry]] and so on.

These elements make the festival what it is, and adding pomp and colour to the proceedings. The festival is of immense benefit to the tourism sector of Nigeria. It enables the community to sell its culture to tourist coming from both within the country and all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myproject.com.ng/index.php/product/osun-osogbo-festival-functions-aesthetics/|title=THE OSUN OSOGBO FESTIVAL (ITS FUNCTIONS AND AESTHETICS)|work=myproject.com.ng|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Osun Osogbo festival also serves as a strong unifying factor in Osogboland, as irrespective of the different social, economic, religious and political convictions of the people, they all come together annually to celebrate the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myproject.com.ng/index.php/product/osun-osogbo-festival-functions-aesthetics/|title=THE OSUN OSOGBO FESTIVAL (ITS FUNCTIONS AND AESTHETICS)|work=myproject.com.ng|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1364">'''Overnight capital cost''' is a term used in the power generation industry to describe the cost of building a power plant overnight. The term is useful to compare the economic feasibility of building various plants. The overnight capital cost does not take into account financing costs or [[Cost escalation|escalation]], and hence is not an actual estimate of construction cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rocky Mountain Institute|title=Overnight capital cost for U.S. pressurized-water reactors|url=http://www.rmi.org/RFGraph-Capital_cost_US_pressurized_water_reactors|work=Reinventing Fire|publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]]|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors in the energy industry typically look to the [[Levelized cost of energy#Calculations|levelized cost of energy]] (LCOE) for comparing generation technologies (e.g. [[solar power]], [[natural gas]]) in the long term, as it includes ongoing fuel, maintenance, and operation costs. The U.S. Department of Energy tracks and makes publicly available [http://en.openei.org/apps/TCDB/ levelized cost of energy figures for competing technologies]. These figures will vary substantially in other countries due to different energy policies and domestic energy sources.

The '''PAN Parks Foundation''' was a non-governmental organisation that aimed to protect [[Europe]]'s [[wilderness]]es. The foundation filled for bankruptcy in May 2014 in The Netherlands, but was denied the status by the court and is currently in liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://wilderness-society.org/panparks-foundation-in-liquidation/ PAN PARKS Foundation In Liquidation]'', European Wilderness Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The PAN Parks Foundation was founded in 1998 by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the Dutch travel company Molecaten, with the aim of creating national parks in Europe, along the model of the [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] and [[Yosemite National Park]]s in North America.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://vidasilvestre.org.uy/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/PAN-PARKS_Lessons-Learned-Series_7_Conducting-Independent-Audits.pdf Conducting Independent Audits]'', PAN Parks Foundations, 1998, p.2, accessed 2 September 2012; ''[https://archive.is/20130415153435/http://www.panparks.org/what-we-do/partners Partners]'', PAN Parks Foundation, accessed 2 September.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation aims to create a network of European wilderness areas where wilderness and high quality tourism facilities are balanced with environmental protection and [[sustainable]] local development.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20130415135145/http://www.panparks.org/what-we-do/making-a-difference Making a Difference]'', PAN Parks Foundation, accessed 2 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to achieve this through a process of auditing and verification, enabling it to certify parks owned by partners as meeting particular standards, combined with political advocacy on the local and European level.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://vidasilvestre.org.uy/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/PAN-PARKS_Lessons-Learned-Series_7_Conducting-Independent-Audits.pdf Conducting Independent Audits]'', PAN Parks Foundations, 1998, pp.2-4, accessed 2 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fsp firestop.jpg|thumb|[[Intumescent]] [[firestop]] '''putty''' being used over top of ceramic fibre packing to restore the two-hour [[fire-resistance rating]] of a concrete floor slab, with electrical cable [[penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrants]] in a building ]]
[[File:Putty reentry.jpg|thumb|right|Intumescent firestop putty used in a successful [[fire test]], which led to a [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] [[certification listing]]]]

'''Putty''' is a material with high [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], similar in texture to [[clay]] or [[dough]], typically used in domestic construction and repair as a sealant or filler. '''Painter's Putty''' is typically a [[linseed oil]]-based product used for filling holes, minor cracks and defacements in wood only. Putties can also be made [[intumescent]], in which case they are used for [[firestop]]ping as well as for padding of [[Junction box|electrical outlet boxes]] in [[Fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated]] [[drywall]] assemblies. In the latter case, [[hydrates]] in the putty produce an [[endothermic]] reaction to mitigate [[heat]] transfer to the unexposed side.

==Use in construction==
Putty has been used extensively in [[Glazing (window)|glazing]] for fixing and sealing panes of glass into wooden frames (or [[Sash window|sashes]]), although its use is decreasing with the prevalence of [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and metal window frames which use synthetic sealants such as [[silicone]]. Glazing putty is traditionally made by mixing a base of whiting (finely ground [[chalk]]) with [[linseed oil]] in various proportions. There are a number of synthetic alternatives such as [[polybutene]] based putties, where the polybutene is a low [[molecular weight]] [[oligomer]] replacing the [[linseed oil]]. [[Butyl rubber]] is also added to the mixture to provide some strength and flexibility.

In [[woodworking]], water-based putties are more commonly used, as these emit very little odour, are more easily cleaned up and are compatible with water-based and latex sealers.

[[Plumber's putty]] is waterproof, used to make watertight seals in plumbing.

[[Pratley's Putty]] is an adhesive used primarily for steel bonding.{{expand section|date=September 2016}}

== Other uses ==
Certain types of putty also have use in the field of [[terminal ballistics]], where the putty can accurately represent the average density of the human body. As such it can be used, for instance, to test the penetrative power of [[projectile]]s, or the stopping power of [[Bulletproof vest|body armour]].

Play putty, such as ''[[silly putty]],'' is for children to play with, and often comes in plastic eggs.

The '''Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC''' is a [[European Union directive]] which mandates levels of [[renewable energy]] use within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="directive-2009-28-ec"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The directive was published on 23 April 2009 and amends and repeals the 2001 [[EU Directive on Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources 2001/77/EC|Directive on Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources 2001/77/EC]].  The directive requires that 20% of the energy consumed within the European Union is [[renewable energy|renewable]].  This target is pooled among the [[Member States of the European Union|member states]].&lt;ref name="euractiv-2008"&gt;

EU leaders had already reached agreement in March 2007 that, in principle, 20% of the bloc's final energy consumption should be produced from renewable energy sources by 2020 as part of its drive to cut [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.&lt;ref name="euractiv-2007"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The key objectives of the strategy are to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20%, to increase the share of renewable energy to 20%, and to achieve energy savings of 20% or more.  The targets are mutually dependent.&lt;ref name="eu-2020-energy-strategy"&gt;

The draft report on the directive was published by the [[European Commission]] in January 2008.  [[Claude Turmes]] served as [[rapporteur]] on the draft.

Members states were obliged to notify the [[European Commission]] by 30 June 2010 of a [[National Renewable Energy Action Plan]] which sets out the road map of the trajectory.  Member states also have to submit progress reports explaining their implementation of the directive and their progress towards their targets, as is required by article{{nbsp}}22 of the directive.

A June 2015 report from the [[European Commission]] shows that EU countries are on track to meet the aggregate 20% goal.&lt;ref name="european-commission-2015"&gt;

== Future developments ==

The current renewable energy directive ends in 2020.  {{as of|2016}} a new directive is being negotiated.

Documents leaked in late-2016 reveal that a confidential [[European Union]] impact assessment analyses four scenarios for paring back the 'priority dispatch' system afforded to renewable generation in many countries.  The assessment concludes that removing priority dispatch could increase carbon emissions by 45{{nbsp}}million to 60{{nbsp}}million tonnes per annum or up to 10%, with the aim of making European energy generators more flexible and cost-competitive.  Priority dispatch is mandated under the current EU renewable energy directive, although the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Sweden do not comply.  Industry sources told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that it is "highly likely" that priority dispatch will be removed from the next EU directive, which takes effect from 2020.  Sources also said that renewable generators would seek financial compensation if priority dispatch is eliminated.  The [[WindEurope]] trade association reacted strongly to the news.&lt;ref name="neslen-2016"&gt;

{{Self-contradictory|about=the meaning of "beach glass"|date=February 2018}}

[[Image:Amant.JPG|thumb|right|Green and white sea glass.]]

'''Sea glass''' and '''beach glass''' are similar but come from two different types of water. "Sea glass" is [[physical weathering|physically]] and [[Chemical weathering|chemically]] weathered [[glass]] found on [[beach]]es along bodies of [[seawater|salt]] water. These weathering processes produce natural [[frosted glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bytheseajewelry.com/what-is-sea-glass-or-beach-glass/|title=What Is Sea Glass - How and Where do you find it?|website=bytheseajewelry.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Genuine sea glass" can be collected as a [[hobby]] and is used for decoration, most commonly in  [[jewelry]]. "Beach glass" comes from [[fresh water]] and in most cases has a different pH balance and a less frosted appearance than sea glass. Sea glass takes 20 to 40 years, and sometimes as much as 100 years, to acquire its characteristic texture and shape.&lt;ref&gt;Sea Glass Journal (date unknown). The Godfather of Sea Glass: Richard LaMotte Boosts the National Profile of Sea Glass Retrieved from http://www.seaglassjournal.com/articles/pureseaglass/lamotte.htm on 2/19/2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes also colloquially referred to as "Drift glass" from the longshore drift process that forms the smooth edges.  In practice, the two terms are used interchangeably.

==Formation==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}

Sea glass begins as normal shards of broken glass that are then persistently tumbled and ground until the sharp edges are smoothed and rounded. In this process, the glass loses its slick surface but gains a frosted appearance over many years.
&lt;ref name="findseaglass.net"&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is Sea Glass? |url=https://www.findseaglass.net/what-is-sea-glass/ |website=Find Sea Glass |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally produced sea glass ("genuine sea glass") originates as pieces of glass from broken bottles, broken tableware, or even shipwrecks, which are rolled and tumbled in the ocean for years until all of their edges are rounded off, and the slickness of the glass has been worn to a frosted appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=Elizabeth|title=Where Does Beach Glass Come From?|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/beach-glass-come-from-14693.html|website=USA Today|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificially produced sea glass (sometimes called "beach glass"),{{Inconsistent|date=February 2018|reason="Everywhere else in the article, 'beach glass' refers to glass naturally weathered by fresh water."}} although superficially similar to sea glass, nevertheless has clear differences in appearance. Having not actually originated from the sea, most connoisseurs will not consider artificial "sea" glass to actually be genuine sea glass, but rather simply tumbled glass, where pieces of modern-day glass are tossed into a rock tumbler or dipped in acid to produce the desired finish. Artificially-produced, the glass is much less expensive and is used for making jewelry, but is often passed off as real sea glass.&lt;ref name="seaglassassociation.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Sea Glass Association|url=https://seaglassassociation.org/genuine-vs-artificial/|accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
[[File:Beach-glass.jpg|thumb|right|Colorful green and blue beach glass found in a river in eastern [[Pennsylvania|PA]]. Note the less tumbled edges than some pieces found in the sea.]] Sea glass can be found all over the world, but the beaches of the northeast [[United States]], [[Bermuda]], [[Fort Bragg, California]], [[Benicia, California]], [[North Carolina]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]], northeast and northwest [[England]]{{Citation needed|reason=The northwest claim needs a reliable source; World-famous beach at Seaham, England, is in the Northeast.|date=June 2013}}, [[Mexico]], [[Hawaii]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Australia]], [[Italy]] and southern [[Spain]] are famous&lt;ref name="weibel"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weibel |first1=Barbara |title=Best Beaches for Collecting Sea Glass |url=http://beaches.uptake.com/blog/best-beaches-hunt-sea-glass.html |website=UpTake |archiveurl=https://archive.is/kknZH |archivedate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their bounty of sea glass, [[bottle]]s, bottle lips and stoppers, art glass, [[marbles]], and [[pottery]] shards. The best times to look are during spring tides (especially the [[Perigean spring tide|perigean]] and proxigean tides) and during the first low tide after a storm.&lt;ref name="findseaglass.net"/&gt;
[[File:Black Bay Beach Bermuda.jpg|thumb|left|Black Bay Beach in [[Sandys Parish]], [[Bermuda]] is covered in green, white, clear, and some brown sea glass.]]
Glass from inland waterways such as the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Great Lakes]] is known as beach glass.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It is similar to sea glass, but in the absence of wave rigor and oceanic saline, content is typically less weathered. Beach glass from inland regions often has prominently embossed designs or letters on it, which can make tracing its origin less challenging.&lt;ref name="Ritterbush"&gt;Ritterbush&lt;/ref&gt; The outer surface of beach glass shards may also be texturally varied, with one side frosty and the other shiny. This is most likely because they are pieces broken off from larger glass objects which are themselves still embedded in mud, silt or clay, slowly being exposed by wave action and erosion.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

{{tone|section|date=September 2015}}

==Colors==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
The color of sea glass is determined by its original source. Most sea glass comes from bottles, but it can also come from jars, plates, windows, windshields, ceramics or [[sea pottery]].&lt;ref name="findseaglass.net"/&gt;

The most common colors of sea glass are [[Variations of green#Kelly green|kelly green]], brown, white, and clear. These colors predominantly come from glass bottles  mostly used by companies that sell beer, juices, soft drinks, and other beverages. The clear or white glass comes from clear plates and glasses, windshields, windows, and assorted other sources.&lt;ref name="LaMotte"&gt;{{cite book | last = La Motte | first = R | title = Pure Sea Glass | publisher = Sea Glass Publishing | isbn = 0975324608 | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less common colours include [[Variations of green#Jade|jade]], [[Amber (colour)|amber]] (from bottles for whiskey, medicine, spirits, and early bleach bottles), golden amber or [[amberina]] (mostly used for spirit bottles), lime green (from soda bottles during the 1960s), forest green, and ice- or soft blue (from soda bottles, medicine bottles, ink bottles, and fruit jars from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, windows, and windshields). These colors are found about once for every 25 to 100 pieces of sea glass found.&lt;ref name="LaMotte"/&gt;

Uncommon colors of sea glass include a type of green, which comes primarily from early to mid-1900s [[Coca-Cola]], [[Dr Pepper]], and [[RC Cola]] bottles as well as beer bottles. Soft green colors could come from bottles that were used for ink, fruit, and baking soda. These colors are found once in every 50 to 100 pieces.&lt;ref name="LaMotte"/&gt;

Purple sea glass is very uncommon, as is [[citron]], opaque white (from milk bottles), [[cobalt]] and [[cornflower blue]] (from early [[Milk of Magnesia]] bottles, poison bottles, artwork, Bromo-Seltzer and [[Vicks]] VapoRub containers), and aqua (from Ball [[Mason jars]] and certain 19th century glass bottles). These colors are found once for every 200 to 1,000 pieces found.&lt;ref name="LaMotte"/&gt;

Extremely rare colors include gray, pink (often from [[Great Depression]]-era plates), [[teal]] (often from [[Mateus wine]] bottles), black (older, very dark [[olive green]] glass), yellow (often from 1930s [[Vaseline]] containers), turquoise (from tableware and art glass), red (often from old [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]] bottles,&lt;ref name=dean&gt;Dean, C. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/science/19glass.html?_r=1 From junk to collectible, shaped by time and tide.] ''New York Times'' October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; car tail lights, dinnerware, or nautical lights, it is found once in about every 5,000 pieces), and orange (the least common type of sea glass, found once in about 10,000 pieces). These colors are found once for every 1,000 to 10,000 pieces collected. Some shards of black glass are quite old, originating from thick eighteenth-century [[gin]], beer, and wine bottles.&lt;ref name="LaMotte"/&gt;

===Antique black sea glass===

[[File:IMG 5097Blackglassseaglass.JPG|thumb|This "black" sea glass was collected in [[Jamaica]] 24 Dec. 2009. Under good light the green shade of the original glass before weathering is revealed.]]

Old black glass that had iron [[slag]] added during production to increase strength&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odysseyseaglass.com/black-sea-glass.html#What_Is_Black_Sea_Glass |title=Black Sea Glass, Black Beach Glass |work=odysseyseaglass.com |date= |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opaqueness were at times broken in shipment.&lt;ref name="antiquebottles.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquebottles.com/blackglass |title=Antique Black Glass Bottles |work=Antique Bottle Collector's Haven |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These broken bottles were jettisoned at the beachside wharf upon landfall. They originally contained such things as wine, gin, whiskey, medicines, and liquids subject to light damage. The bottles that survived the long and often rough voyage were refilled once emptied of the original contents and recycled, sometimes for many decades. They were refilled with local spirits, herbal tinctures, extracts, and medicinals.

As the glass craft gained knowledge the bottles became thinner. Quality improved in glass formulations and purity, as well as strides in technical improvements in glass-making techniques all aid in placing a piece of sea glass in a loosely defined era. Along with knowledge of historical trading partners that visited the search locations, production sources can be deduced, but a single feature is not a reliable indicator of origin. Many similar features over a broad sample narrow the choices. Particular substances became associated with certain color, and shapes of bottles.&lt;ref name="antiquebottles.com"/&gt; These all help define country of origin. Medicines and liquor were often sold in green bottles; olive green was the most common color for gin, but brown was also used as well as cobalt blue. Whiskey was contained in green and brown bottles as well. The liquor bottles for sea shipment were oftentimes square so as to use space more efficiently in shipping crates. Poisons were almost always in blue bottles. Round, mallet, and squat cylinder black glass bottles were all made,&lt;ref name="antiquebottles.com"/&gt; and shape correlates to age of the bottles with some overlap. Correlations exist today: brown beer bottles, and of course the globally recognized shape of the Coca-Cola green glass bottle.

In the [[Caribbean]], many nations traded, and pirates plundered them all. So glass from many producer countries can be found with examples going back to the 15th century. Old slave trading ports are good search locations. As are former colonial ports in the slave-molasses-rum triangle. All former colonial locations with sea trade routes, and the motherland shipping ports are prime search areas.

For instance, in Jamaica there are influxes of Spanish, African, English, American, East Indian, Chinese, and Jews (who incidentally arrived about the same time Christopher Columbus' son arrived to settle the island in 1510 and many later shipped with the Caribbean pirate crews) and other Europeans scattered throughout the historical record. The majority of black glass found on the island of Jamaica is English glass produced from the later 1600s until the 1800s in England. Sea glass arrived in Jamaica with the old world supply chain first established in the 15th century. The Spanish considered Santiago (Jamaica) a backwater to Cuba, and this allowed the English to relieve them of it in 1655 without much resistance. The first man-made glass most likely arrived with Christopher Columbus on his 2nd voyage when he claimed the island for Spain in 1494. He is reported to have landed at [[Discovery Bay, Jamaica|Dry Harbor, Discovery Bay]] on the north coast. Whether any of the glass on board became sea glass is part of the romance and wonder of beachcombing.

Black glass is often green or brown when held up to light, although it appears black to the unaided eye. Weathering and oxidation, together with UV light interacting with metallic oxides and chemicals in the glass and seawater are all factors affecting the color of sea glass over long exposure and time frames. In texture and color black sea glass resembles black beach rock, very much resembling the extrusive igneous rock basalt, or weathered black obsidian, a natural black volcanic glass. Gas bubbles are often trapped in old glass, impurities and irregularities in the original bottles were common and one indicator of age. Early examples were hand blown, later ones utilized a mold. Due to the inherent strength, you'll find larger size pieces of old black glass, including pieces that survived for centuries. Potential age of black beach glass found depends on your search location. Small pieces require a trained eye to spot. Texture is a good tool to employ along with color. Black glass is the rarest of all the sea/beach glasses due to age and difficulty in finding it. Although when you find an old, long used location it can produce a considerable amount of material.

Collectors should be aware of the historical nature of the location, and the fact that gathering old items is considered cultural theft in some areas of the world. In other areas sea glass is just another piece of trash on the beach. Most sea glass' historical context is lost to the sea, but its mere presence in some areas is the heritage and legacy of the location. National treasures made of former trash exist, such as is Glass Beach at Fort Bragg CA. The glass at Ft. Bragg is mostly from the mid-20th century.

==Hobby==
Like collecting shells, fossils, or stones, combing shorelines for sea glass is a hobby many beach-goers and [[beachcombing|beachcombers]] enjoy. Hobbyists often fill decorative jars with their collections and take great pleasure in tracing a shard's provenance while artisans craft pieces of jewelry, stained glass and other decorative pieces from sea glass. Some collectors use their collections in creating works of art by putting them in cement or other adhesive to create a mosaic.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In North America, the hobby has the North American Sea Glass Association, which organizes a yearly conference and issues a [[newsletter]].&lt;ref name=nasga&gt;[https://www.seaglassassociation.org/ North American Sea Glass Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
Authentic sea and beach glass is becoming rarer and harder to find. More people are actively searching for it, and the shift to other materials such as plastic for containers has greatly reduced the number of glass containers dumped in the sea.

This scarcity has led to some artisans and crafters tumbling poorer pieces of sea glass shards to create what is called "twice-tossed" glass, while others create artificial sea glass, or "craft glass", from ordinary glass pieces using a rock tumbler. While such glass is chunkier than most true sea glass, lacks its romantic [[provenance]], and differs in many technical ways (e.g., long-term exposure to water conditions creates an etched surface on the glass that cannot be duplicated artificially), it does meet the demand of crafters at a cheaper price and in a wider range of colors.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

A number of characteristics highlight the differences between artificial sea glass and natural sea glass, starting with the coloration and surface texture of each piece.
&lt;ref name="northbeachtreasures.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Messerschmidt |first=Peter |title=The Issue of Natural vs Fake ("Man Made") Sea Glass |url=http://www.northbeachtreasures.com/natural-sea-glass.html |website=North Beach Treasures |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623093451/http://www.northbeachtreasures.com/natural-sea-glass.html |archivedate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of natural sea glass will usually have a frosty, almost powdery texture at different points.&lt;ref name="northbeachtreasures.com"/&gt; One of the most reliable indicators for natural sea glass is a "C" shaped design all over the outside of the sample.&lt;ref name="seaglassassociation.org"/&gt; If the design is located on the piece, it is authentic sea glass, since artificial beach glass will typically not have that particular design.&lt;ref name="seaglassassociation.org"/&gt; Sea glass usually comes from broken glass bottles or other household items, so the pieces you find on the beach will not be perfectly shaped, unlike artificial sea glass, often sold as beach glass.&lt;ref name="seaglassassociation.org"/&gt;

'''Shape waves''' are excitations propagating along [[Josephson vortices]] or [[fluxons]]. In the case of two-dimensional [[Josephson junctions]] (thick [[long Josephson junction]]s with an extra dimension) described by the 2D [[sine-Gordon equation]], shape waves are distortions of a [[Josephson vortex]] line of an arbitrary profile. Shape waves have remarkable properties exhibiting [[Lorentz contraction]] and [[time dilation]] similar to that in [[special relativity]]. Position of the shape wave excitation on a [[Josephson vortex]] acts like a “minute-hand” showing the time in the rest-frame associated with the vortex. At some conditions, a moving vortex with the shape excitation can have less energy than the same vortex without it.

[[Image:SnagTree.jpg|thumb|A fir tree snag among living fir trees]]
In [[forest]] [[ecology]], a '''snag''' refers to a standing, dead or dying [[tree]], often missing a top or most of the smaller branches. In [[Limnology|freshwater ecology]] it refers to trees, branches, and other pieces of naturally occurring wood found sunken in rivers and streams; it is also known as [[coarse woody debris]]. When used in manufacturing, especially in Scandinavia, they are often called "dead wood" and in Finland "kelo wood".

== Forest snags ==
Snags are an important structural component in forest communities, making up 10–20% of all trees present in old-growth tropical, temperate, and boreal forests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nilsson|first=Sven G|last2=Niklasson|first2=Mats|last3=Hedin|first3=Jonas|last4=Aronsson|first4=Gillis|last5=Gutowski|first5=Jerzy M|last6=Linder|first6=Per|last7=Ljungberg|first7=Håkan|last8=Mikusiński|first8=Grzegorz|last9=Ranius|first9=Thomas|date=2002|title=Densities of large living and dead trees in old-growth temperate and boreal forests|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112701004807|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=161|issue=1–3|pages=189–204|doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00480-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delaney|first=Matt|last2=Brown|first2=Sandra|last3=Lugo|first3=Ariel E.|last4=Torres-Lezama|first4=Armando|last5=Quintero|first5=Narsizo Bello|date=1998-03-01|title=The Quantity and Turnover of Dead Wood in Permanent Forest Plots in Six Life Zones of Venezuela1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.1998.tb00364.x/abstract|journal=Biotropica|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=2–11|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.1998.tb00364.x|issn=1744-7429}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vázquez|first=Leopoldo|last2=Renton|first2=Katherine|date=2015-01-23|title=High Density of Tree-Cavities and Snags in Tropical Dry Forest of Western Mexico Raises Questions for a Latitudinal Gradient|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0116745|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=1|pages=e0116745|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0116745|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4304802|pmid=25615612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snags and downed [[coarse woody debris]] represent a large portion of the woody biomass in a healthy forest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In temperate forests, snags provide critical habitat for more than 100 species of bird and mammal, and snags are often called 'wildlife trees' by foresters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raphael|first=Martin G.|last2=White|first2=Marshall|date=1984-01-01|title=Use of Snags by Cavity-Nesting Birds in the Sierra Nevada|jstor=3830575|journal=Wildlife Monographs|issue=86|pages=3–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r6/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=fsbdev2_026701|title=Region 6 – Resource Management|website=www.fs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dead, [[wood-decay fungus|decaying wood]] supports a rich community of decomposers like [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]], [[insect]]s, and other [[invertebrate]]s. These organisms and their [[Consumer (food chain)|consumers]], along with the structural complexity of cavities, hollows, and broken tops make snags important habitat for birds, bats, and small mammals, which in turn feed larger mammalian predators.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Thomas, Jack W., Ralph G. Anderson, Chris Maser, and Evelyn L. Bull. 1979. Snags. p.60-77. In Wildlife habitats in managed forests the Blue Mountains of Oregon and Washington, USDA Forest Service. Ag. Hand. No. 553, 512p.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Pseudotsuga menziesii 01221.JPG|upright|thumb|A [[coast Douglas-fir]] snag provides nest cavities for birds]]
Snags are optimal habitat for primary cavity nesters such as woodpeckers which create the majority of cavities used by secondary cavity users in forest ecosystems. Woodpeckers excavate cavities for more than 80 other species and the health of their populations relies on snags. Most snag-dependent birds and mammals are insectivorous and represent a major portion of the insectivorous forest fauna, and are important factors in controlling forest insect populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are many instances in which birds  reduced outbreak populations of forest insects, such as woodpeckers affecting outbreaks of southern hardwood borers and Engelmann spruce beetles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Snag Stages.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Successional stages of a snag from death of a tree to final decomposition.]]

Snag creation occurs naturally as trees die due to old age, disease, drought, or wildfire. A snag undergoes a series of changes from the time the tree dies until final collapse, and each stage in the decay process has particular value to certain wildlife species.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, F. P. 1955. The rate of natural falling of beetle-killed ponderosa pine snags. Journal of Forestry 53(10):720–723.&lt;/ref&gt; Snag persistence depends on two factors, the size of the stem, and the durability of the wood of the species concerned. The snags of some large conifers, such as [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|Giant Sequoia]] and [[Sequoia sempervirens|Coast Redwood]] on the Pacific Coast of North America, and the [[Fitzroya|Alerce]] of Patagonia, can remain intact for 100 years or more, becoming progressively shorter with age, while other snags with rapidly decaying wood, such as [[aspen]] and [[birch]], break up and collapse in 2–10 years.

[[Snag forest|Snag Forests]], or [[Complex early seral forest|Complex Early Seral Forests]], are ecosystems that occupy potentially forested sites after a stand-replacement disturbance and before re-establishment of a closed-forest canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanson|first=Mark E|last2=Franklin|first2=Jerry F|last3=Beschta|first3=Robert L|last4=Crisafulli|first4=Charles M|last5=DellaSala|first5=Dominick A|last6=Hutto|first6=Richard L|last7=Lindenmayer|first7=David B|last8=Swanson|first8=Frederick J|date=2011-03-01|title=The forgotten stage of forest succession: early-successional ecosystems on forest sites|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/090157/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=117–125|doi=10.1890/090157|issn=1540-9309}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generated by natural disturbances such as [[wildfire]] or [[Bark beetle|insect outbreaks]] that reset [[ecological succession]] processes and follow a pathway that is influenced by biological legacies (e.g., large live trees and snags downed logs, seed banks, resprout tissue, fungi, and other live and dead biomass) that were not removed during the initial disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Jerry F.|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David|last3=MacMahon|first3=James A.|last4=McKee|first4=Arthur|last5=Magnuson|first5=John|last6=Perry|first6=David A.|last7=Waide|first7=Robert|last8=Foster|first8=David|date=2000-01-01|title=Threads of Continuity|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-4629.2000.tb00155.x/abstract|journal=Conservation in Practice|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=8–17|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4629.2000.tb00155.x|issn=1552-5228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donato|first=Daniel C.|last2=Fontaine|first2=Joseph B.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Water hunting birds like the [[osprey]] or [[kingfisher]]s can be found near water, perched in a snag tree, or feeding upon their fish catch.

== Freshwater snags ==
In [[Limnology|freshwater ecology]] in [[Australia]] and the United States, the term snag is used to refer to the trees, branches and other pieces of naturally occurring wood found in a sunken form in [[river]]s and streams. Such snags have been identified as being critical for shelter and as [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] sites for [[fish]], and are one of the few hard substrates available for [[biofilm]] growth supporting aquatic invertebrates in lowland rivers flowing through alluvial flood plains. Snags are important as sites for biofilm growth and for shelter and feeding of aquatic invertebrates in both lowland and upland rivers and streams.[[Image:Nisqually River 05894.JPG|left|thumb|A [[Canada goose]] feeds near a snag in the [[Nisqually River]]]]In [[Australia]], the role of freshwater snags has been largely ignored until recently, and more than one million snags have been removed from the [[Murray-Darling basin]]. Large tracts of the lowland reaches of the Murray-Darling system are now devoid of the snags that native fish like [[Murray cod]] require for shelter and breeding. The damage such wholesale snag removal has caused is clearly enormous, but is difficult to quantify (but see [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.01043.x;jsessionid=bzJx9fH83X44rRfwaT?journalCode=rec]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). Most snags in these systems are [[river red gum]] snags. As the dense wood of river red gum is almost impervious to rot it is thought that some of the river red gum snags removed in past decades may have been several thousand years old.

== Maritime hazard ==
Also known as ''deadheads'', partially submerged snags posed hazards to early riverboat navigation and commerce. If hit, snags punctured the wooden hulls used in the 19th century and early 20th century. Snags were, in fact, the most commonly encountered hazard, especially in the early years of steamboat travel.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Lewis C.| title=Steamboats on the Western Rivers|date=1977| publisher= [[Dover Publications]] |location=New York|pages=193–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] operated "[[snagboat]]s" such as the ''[[W. T. Preston]]'' in the [[Puget Sound]] of Washington State and the ''[[Montgomery (snagboat)|Montgomery]]'' in the rivers of Alabama to pull out and clear snags.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2015}}  Starting in 1824, there were successful efforts to remove snags from the Mississippi and its tributaries.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;  By 1835, a lieutenant reported to the Chief of Engineers that steamboat travel had become much safer, but by the mid-1840s the appropriations for snag removal dried up and snags re-accumulated until after the Civil War.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;

== "Dead wood" products ==
[[File:Pinus sylvestris counter.jpg|right|thumb|"Kelo wood" ("dead wood") used in Finland in the manufacture of rustic furniture products.]]
In Scandinavia and Finland snags, invariably pine trees, known in Finnish as ''kelo'' and in Swedish as ''torraka'', are collected for the production of different objects, from furniture to entire log houses. Commercial enterprises market them abroad as "dead wood" or in Finland as "kelo wood". They have been especially prized for their silver-grey weathered surface in the manufacture of vernacular or national romantic products. The suppliers of "dead wood" emphasise its age: the wood has developed with dehydration in the dry coldness of the subarctic zones, the tree having stopped growing after some 300–400 years, and the tree has remained upright for another few hundred years. "Dead wood" logs are easier to transport and handle than normal logs due to their lightness.

[[Image:EarthAtmosphereBig.jpg|thumb|80px|right|Earth atmosphere diagram showing all the layers of the atmosphere to scale]]

The '''thermosphere''' is the layer of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] directly above the [[mesosphere]] and below the [[exosphere]]. Within this layer of the atmosphere, [[ultraviolet radiation]] causes [[photoionization]]/photodissociation of molecules, creating ions in the [[ionosphere]]. Taking its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] θερμός (pronounced ''thermos'') meaning heat, the thermosphere begins at about 80&amp;nbsp;km (50&amp;nbsp;mi) above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Duxbury &amp; Duxbury. Introduction to the World's Oceans. 5ed. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; At these high altitudes, the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to [[molecular mass]] (see [[turbosphere]]). Thermospheric [[temperature]]s increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic [[solar radiation]]. Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity, and can rise to 1,700&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C (3,100&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;F) or more. Radiation causes the atmosphere particles in this layer to become electrically charged (see [[ionosphere]]), enabling [[radio wave]]s to be refracted and thus be received beyond the horizon. In the exosphere, beginning at about 600&amp;nbsp;km (375&amp;nbsp;mi) above sea level, the atmosphere turns into [[outer space|space]], although by the criteria set for the definition of the [[Kármán line]], the thermosphere itself is part of space.

The highly diluted gas in this layer can reach {{convert|2500|C|F}} during the day. Despite the high temperature, an observer or object will experience cold temperatures in the thermosphere, because the extremely low density of gas (practically a hard vacuum) is insufficient for the molecules to conduct heat. A normal [[thermometer]] will read significantly below {{convert|0|C|F}}, at least at night, because the energy lost by thermal radiation would exceed the energy acquired from the atmospheric gas by direct contact. In the [[anacoustic zone]] above {{convert|160|km|mi}}, the density is so low that molecular interactions are too infrequent to permit the transmission of sound. 
 
The dynamics of the thermosphere are dominated by [[atmospheric tide]]s, which are driven by the very significant [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal heating]]. Atmospheric waves dissipate above this level because of collisions between the neutral gas and the ionospheric plasma.

The [[International Space Station]] orbits the Earth within the middle of the thermosphere, between {{convert|330|and|435|km|mi}}.

==Neutral gas constituents==
It is convenient  to separate the atmospheric regions  according to the two temperature minima at about 12&amp;nbsp;km altitude (the [[tropopause]]) and at about 85&amp;nbsp;km (the [[mesopause]]) (Figure 1). The thermosphere (or the upper atmosphere) is the height region above 85&amp;nbsp;km, while the region between the tropopause and the mesopause is the middle atmosphere ([[stratosphere]] and [[mesosphere]]) where absorption of solar UV radiation generates the temperature maximum near 45&amp;nbsp;km altitude and causes the [[ozone]] layer.
[[File:Nomenclature of Thermosphere.jpg|thumb|500px|Figure 1. Nomenclature of atmospheric regions based on the profiles of electric conductivity (left), temperature (middle), and electron number density in m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;(right)]]
 
The density of the Earth's atmosphere decreases nearly exponentially with altitude. The total mass of the atmosphere  is M = ρ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; H&amp;nbsp; ≃ 1&amp;nbsp;kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within a column of one square centimeter above the ground (with ρ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.29&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; the atmospheric density on the ground at z = 0 m altitude, and H ≃ 8&amp;nbsp;km the average atmospheric [[scale height]]). 80% of that mass is concentrated within the [[troposphere]]. The mass of the thermosphere above about 85&amp;nbsp;km is only 0.002% of the total mass. Therefore, no significant energetic feedback from the thermosphere to the lower atmospheric regions can be expected.

Turbulence causes the air within the lower atmospheric regions below the [[turbopause]] at about 110&amp;nbsp;km to be a mixture of gases that does not change its composition. Its mean molecular weight is 29&amp;nbsp;g/mol with molecular oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as the two dominant constituents. Above the [[turbopause]], however, diffusive separation of the various constituents is significant, so that each constituent follows its own barometric height structure with a scale height inversely proportional to its molecular weight. The lighter constituents atomic oxygen (O), helium (He), and hydrogen (H) successively dominate above about 200&amp;nbsp;km altitude and vary with geographic location, time, and solar activity.  The ratio
N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O which is a measure of the electron density at the ionospheric F region is highly affected by these variations.&lt;ref&gt;Prölss, G.W. and M. K.  Bird, "Physics of the Earth's Space Environment", Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These changes follow from the diffusion of  the minor constituents through the major gas component during dynamic processes.

The thermosphere contains an appreciable concentration of elemental [[sodium]] located in a 10-km thick band that occurs at the edge of the mesosphere, 80 to 100&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface. The sodium has an average concentration of 400,000 atoms per cubic centimeter. This band is regularly replenished by sodium sublimating from incoming meteors. Astronomers have begun utilizing this sodium band to create "[[Laser_guide_star|guide stars]]" as part of the optical correction process in producing ultra-sharp ground-based observations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/print/volume-52/issue-07/features/adaptive-optics-eso-s-very-large-telescope-sees-four-times-first-laser-light.html Martin Enderlein et al., ''ESO's Very Large Telescope sees four times first light'', Laser Focus World, July 2016, pp. 22-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy input==

===Energy budget===
The thermospheric temperature can be determined from density observations as well as from direct satellite measurements. The temperature vs. altitude z in Fig. 1 can be simulated by the so-called [[David Bates (physicist)|Bates]] profile:&lt;ref&gt;Rawer, K., Modelling of neutral and ionized atmospheres, in Flügge, S. (ed): Encycl. Phys., '''49/7''', Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, 223&lt;/ref&gt;

(1) {{pad|4em}} &lt;math&gt;T = T_\infty - (T_\infty- T_0) \exp \{ -s(z - z_0) \}&lt;/math&gt;

with  T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; the exospheric temperature above about 400&amp;nbsp;km altitude, 
T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 355&amp;nbsp;K, and z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 120&amp;nbsp;km reference temperature and height, and s an empirical parameter depending on T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; and decreasing with T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. That formula is derived from a simple equation of heat conduction. One estimates a total heat input of q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;≃ 0.8 to 1.6&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; above z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 120&amp;nbsp;km altitude. In order to obtain equilibrium conditions, that heat input q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; above z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is lost to the lower atmospheric regions by heat conduction.

The exospheric temperature T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; is a fair measurement of the solar XUV radiation. Since solar radio emission F at 10.7&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength is a good indicator of solar activity, one can apply the empirical formula for quiet magnetospheric conditions.&lt;ref name="Hedin"&gt;Hedin,A.E., A revised thermospheric model based on mass spectrometer and incoherent scatter data: MSIS-83 J. Geophys. Res., '''88''', 10170, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) {{pad|4em}} &lt;math&gt;T_\infty \simeq 500 + 3.4 F_0&lt;/math&gt;

with T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; in K, F&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; in 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (the Covington index) a value of F averaged over several solar cycles.  The Covington index varies typically between 70 and 250 during a solar cycle, and never drops below about 50. Thus, T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; varies between about 740 and 1350&amp;nbsp;K. During very quiet magnetospheric conditions, the still continuously flowing magnetospheric energy input contributes by about 250&amp;nbsp;K to the residual temperature of 500&amp;nbsp;K in eq.(2). The rest of 250&amp;nbsp;K in eq.(2) can be attributed to atmospheric waves generated within the troposphere and dissipated within the lower thermosphere.

===Solar XUV radiation===
The solar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV) at wavelengths &lt; 170&amp;nbsp;nm is almost completely absorbed within the thermosphere. This radiation causes the various [[ionospheric layer]]s as well as a temperature increase at these heights (Figure 1).
While the solar visible light (380 to 780&amp;nbsp;nm) is nearly constant with a variability of not more than about 0.1% of the [[solar constant]],&lt;ref&gt;Willson, R.C., Measurements of the solar total irradiance and its variability, Space Sci. Rev., '''38''', 203, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; the solar XUV radiation is highly variable in time and space. For instance, X-ray bursts associated with [[solar flares]] can dramatically increase their intensity over preflare levels by many orders of magnitude over a time span of tens of minutes. In the extreme ultraviolet, the Lyman α line at 121.6&amp;nbsp;nm represents an important source of [[ionization]] and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] at ionospheric D layer heights.&lt;ref&gt;Brasseur, G., and S. Salomon, "Aeronomy of the Middle Atmosphere", Reidel Pub., Dordrecht, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; During quiet periods of [[solar activity]], it alone contains more energy than the rest of the XUV spectrum. Quasi-periodic changes of the order of 100% or greater, with periods of 27 days and 11 years, belong to the prominent variations of solar XUV radiation. However, irregular fluctuations over all time scales are present all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidtke, G., Modelling of the solar radiation for aeronomical applications, in Flügge, S. (ed), Encycl. Phys. ''49/7'', Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, 1&lt;/ref&gt; During low solar activity, about half of the total energy input into the thermosphere is thought to be solar XUV radiation. Evidently, that solar XUV energy input occurs only during daytime conditions, maximizing at the equator during [[equinox]].

===Solar wind===
A second source of energy input into the thermosphere is [[solar wind]] energy which is transferred to the [[magnetosphere]] by mechanisms that are not well understood. One possible way to transfer energy is via a hydrodynamic dynamo process. Solar wind particles penetrate into the polar regions of the magnetosphere where the [[geomagnetic field]] lines are essentially vertically directed. An electric field is generated, directed from dawn to dusk. Along the last closed geomagnetic field lines with their footpoints within the [[auroral]] zones, field aligned electric currents can flow into the [[ionospheric dynamo region]] where they are closed by electric [[Pedersen current|Pedersen]] and [[Hall current]]s. [[Ohm]]ic losses of the Pedersen currents heat the lower thermosphere (see e.g., [[Magnetospheric electric convection field]]). In addition, penetration of high energetic particles from the magnetosphere into the auroral regions enhance drastically the electric conductivity, further increasing the electric currents and thus [[Joule heating]]. During quiet magnetospheric activity, the magnetosphere contributes perhaps by a quarter to the thermosphere's energy budget.&lt;ref&gt;Knipp, D.J., W.K. Tobiska, and B.A. Emery, Direct and indirect thermospheric heating source for solar cycles, Solar Phys., ''224'', 2506, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This is about 250&amp;nbsp;K of the exospheric temperature in eq.(2). During very large activity, however, this heat input can increase substantially, by a factor of four or more. That solar wind input occurs mainly in the auroral regions during both day and night.

===Atmospheric waves===
Two  kinds of large-scale atmospheric waves within the lower atmosphere exist: internal waves with finite vertical wavelengths which can transport wave energy upward; and external waves with infinitely large wavelengths which cannot transport wave energy.&lt;ref name=VollandTP&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves", Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atmospheric gravity wave]]s and most of the [[atmospheric tides]] generated within the troposphere belong to the internal waves. Their density amplitudes increase exponentially with height, so that at the mesopause these waves become turbulent and their energy is dissipated (similar to breaking of ocean waves at the coast), thus contributing to the heating of the thermosphere by about 250&amp;nbsp;K in eq.(2). On the other hand, the fundamental diurnal tide labelled (1, −2) which is most efficiently excited by solar irradiance is an external wave and plays only a marginal role within lower and middle atmosphere. However, at thermospheric altitudes, it becomes the predominant wave. It drives the electric Sq-current within the [[ionospheric dynamo region]] between about 100 and 200&amp;nbsp;km height.

Heating, predominately by tidal waves, occurs mainly at lower and middle latitudes. The variability of this heating depends on the meteorological conditions within troposphere and middle atmosphere, and may not exceed about 50%.

==Dynamics==
[[File:Thermospherewaves.jpg|thumb|500px|Figure 2. Schematic meridian-height cross-section of circulation of (a) symmetric wind component (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), (b) of antisymmetric wind component (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), and (d) of symmetric diurnal wind component (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 3 h and 15 h local time. Upper right pannel (c) shows the horizontal wind vectors of the diurnal component in the northern hemisphere depending on local time.]]
Within the thermosphere above about 150&amp;nbsp;km height, all atmospheric waves successively become external waves, and no significant vertical wave structure is visible. The atmospheric wave modes degenerate to the [[spherical harmonics|spherical functions]] P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; with m a meridional [[wave number]] and n the zonal [[wave number]] (m = 0: zonal mean flow; m = 1: diurnal tides; m = 2: semidiurnal tides; etc.). The thermosphere becomes a damped oscillator system with low-pass filter characteristics. This means that smaller-scale waves (greater numbers of (n,m)) and higher frequencies are suppressed in favor of large-scale waves and lower frequencies. If one considers very quiet magnetospheric disturbances and a constant mean exospheric temperature (averaged over the sphere), the  observed temporal and spatial distribution of the exospheric temperature distribution can be described by a sum of spheric functions:&lt;ref&gt;Köhnlein, W., A model of thermospheric temperature and composition, Planet. Space Sci. '''28''', 225, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

(3) {{pad|4em}} &lt;math&gt;T(\varphi, \lambda, t) = T_\infty \{ 1 + \Delta T_2^0 P_2^0(\varphi) + \Delta T_1^0 P_1^0(\varphi) \cos [ \omega_a (t - t_a) ] + \Delta T_1^1 P_1^1(\varphi) \cos (\tau - \tau_d) + \cdots \}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, it is φ latitude, λ longitude, and t time, ω&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; the [[angular frequency]] of one year,  ω&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; the angular frequency of one solar day, and τ =  ω&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;t + λ  the local time. t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = June 21 is the date of northern summer solstice, and τ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 15:00 is the local time of maximum diurnal temperature.

The first term in (3) on the right is the global mean of the exospheric temperature (of the order of 1000&amp;nbsp;K). The second term [with P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5(3 sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(φ)−1)] represents the heat surplus at lower latitudes and a corresponding heat deficit at higher latitudes (Fig. 2a). A thermal wind system develops  with wind toward the poles in the upper level and wind away from the poles in the lower level. The coefficient ΔT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.004 is small because Joule heating in the aurora regions compensates that heat surplus even during quiet magnetospheric conditions. During disturbed conditions, however, that term becomes dominant, changing sign so that now heat surplus is transported from the poles to the equator. The third term (with P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = sin φ) represents heat surplus on the summer hemisphere and is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the summer into the winter hemisphere (Fig. 2b). Its relative  amplitude is of the order ΔT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ≃ 0.13. The fourth term (with P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(φ) = cos φ) is the dominant diurnal wave (the tidal mode (1,−2)). It is responsible for the  transport of  excess heat from the daytime hemisphere into the nighttime hemisphere (Fig. 2d). Its relative amplitude is ΔT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;≃ 0.15, thus on the order of 150&amp;nbsp;K. Additional terms (e.g.,  semiannual, semidiurnal terms and higher order terms) must be added to eq.(3). However, they are of minor importance. Corresponding sums can be developed for density, pressure, and the various gas constituents.&lt;ref name="Hedin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Zahn, U., et al., ESRO-4 model of global thermospheric composition and temperatures during low solar activity, Geophy. Res. Lett., ''4'', 33, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermospheric storms==
In contrast to solar XUV radiation, magnetospheric disturbances, indicated on the ground by geomagnetic variations, show an unpredictable impulsive character, from short periodic disturbances of the order of hours to long-standing giant storms of several days' duration. The reaction of the thermosphere to a large magnetospheric storm is called thermospheric storm. Since the heat input into the thermosphere occurs at high latitudes (mainly into the auroral regions), the heat transport represented by the term P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; in eq.(3) is reversed. In addition, due to the impulsive form of the disturbance, higher-order terms are generated which, however, possess short decay times and thus quickly disappear. The sum of these modes determines the "travel time" of the disturbance to the lower latitudes, and thus the response time of the thermosphere with respect to the magnetospheric disturbance. Important for the development of an [[ionospheric storm]] is the increase of the ratio N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O  during a thermospheric storm at middle and higher latitude.&lt;ref name="Prölss"&gt;Prölss, G.W., Density perturbations in the upper atmosphere caused by dissipation of solar wind energy, Surv. Geophys., ''32'', 101, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; An increase of  N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases the loss process of the ionospheric plasma and causes therefore a decrease of the electron density within the ionospheric F-layer (negative ionospheric  storm).

A thrust fault is a type of [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|reverse fault]] that has a [[strike and dip|dip]] of 45 degrees or less.&lt;ref name="USGSGloss"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=dip%20slip | title=dip slip | publisher=[[USGS]] | work=Earthquake Glossary | accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCSB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2845 | title=How are reverse faults different than thrust faults?

If the angle of the fault plane is lower (often less than 15 degrees from the horizontal&lt;ref name="Crosby1967"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/cspg/data/015/015003/0219.htm | title=High Angle Dips at Erosional Edge of Overthrust Faults | author=Crosby, G.W. | journal=Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology | year=1967 | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=219–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the displacement of the overlying block is large (often in the kilometer range) the fault is called an ''overthrust'' or ''overthrust fault''.&lt;ref name="Glossary2005"&gt;{{cite book | title=Glossary of Geology (5th edition) | publisher=American Geological Institute | last=Neuendorf | first=K.K.E. | last2=Mehl, Jr. | first2=J.P. | last3=Jackson | first3=J.A. (editors) | year=2005 | location=Alexandria, Virginia | page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erosion can remove part of the overlying block, creating a ''fenster'' (or ''[[Window (geology)|window]]'') – when the underlying block is exposed only in a relatively small area.  When erosion removes most of the overlying block, leaving island-like remnants resting on the lower block, the remnants are called ''klippen'' (singular ''[[klippe]]'').

===Blind thrust faults===
{{Main|Blind thrust earthquake}}
If the fault plane terminates before it reaches the Earth's surface, it is referred to as a ''blind thrust'' fault. Because of the lack of surface evidence, blind thrust faults are difficult to detect until they rupture. The destructive 1994 [[1994 Northridge earthquake|quake in Northridge, California]], was caused by a previously undiscovered blind thrust fault.

Because of their low [[strike and dip|dip]], thrusts are also difficult to appreciate in mapping, where lithological offsets are generally subtle and stratigraphic repetition is difficult to detect, especially in [[peneplain]] areas.

===Fault-bend folds===
Thrust faults, particularly those involved in [[Thrust tectonics#Thin-skinned deformation|thin-skinned]] style of deformation, have a so-called ''ramp-flat'' geometry. Thrusts mostly propagate along zones of weakness within a sedimentary sequence, such as [[mudstone]]s or [[Rock salt|salt]] layers, these parts of the thrust are called ''decollements''. If the effectiveness of the [[decollement]] becomes reduced, the thrust will tend to cut up the section to a higher stratigraphic level until it reaches another effective decollement where it can continue as bedding parallel flat. The part of the thrust linking the two flats is known as a ''ramp'' and typically forms at an angle of about 15°-30° to the bedding. Continued displacement on a thrust over a ramp produces a characteristic fold geometry known as a ''ramp anticline'' or, more generally, as a ''fault-bend fold''.

===Fault-propagation folds===
Fault-propagation folds form at the tip of a thrust fault where propagation along the decollement has ceased but displacement on the thrust behind the fault tip is continuing. The continuing displacement is accommodated by formation of an asymmetric anticline-syncline fold pair. As displacement continues the thrust tip starts to propagate along the axis of the syncline. Such structures are also known as ''tip-line folds''. Eventually the propagating thrust tip may reach another effective decollement layer and a composite fold structure will develop with characteristics of both fault-bend and fault-propagation folds.

===Thrust duplex===
Duplexes occur where there are two decollement levels close to each other within a sedimentary sequence, such as the top and base of a relatively strong [[sandstone]] layer bounded by two relatively weak mudstone layers. When a thrust that has propagated along the lower detachment, known as the ''floor thrust'', cuts up to the upper detachment, known as the ''roof thrust'', it forms a ramp within the stronger layer. With continued displacement on the thrust, higher stresses are developed in the footwall of the ramp due to the bend on the fault. This may cause renewed propagation along the floor thrust until it again cuts up to join the roof thrust. Further displacement then takes place via the newly created ramp. This process may repeat many times, forming a series of fault bounded thrust slices known as ''imbricates'' or [[Horse (geology)|horses]], each with the geometry of a fault-bend fold of small displacement. The final result is typically a lozenge shaped duplex.

Most duplexes have only small displacements on the bounding faults between the horses and these dip away from the foreland. Occasionally the displacement on the individual horses is greater, such that each horse lies more or less vertically above the other, this is known as an ''antiformal stack'' or ''imbricate stack''. If the individual displacements are greater still, then the horses have a foreland dip.

Duplexing is a very efficient mechanism of accommodating shortening of the crust by thickening the section rather than by folding and deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/0253/pdf/of03-253.pdf|title=diagrams of the Brooks Range Thrust|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tectonic environment==
{{main|Thrust tectonics}}
[[Image:SunRiver.JPG|thumb|300px|An example of [[thin-skinned deformation]] (thrusting) in [[Montana]].  Note that the white [[Madison Limestone]] is repeated, with one example in the foreground and another at a higher level to the upper right corner and top of the picture.]]
Large overthrust faults occur in areas that have undergone great compressional forces.

These conditions exist in the [[orogeny|orogenic belts]] that result from either two [[continental crust|continental]] [[tectonic plates|tectonic]] collisions or from [[subduction zone]] accretion.

The resultant compressional forces produce [[mountain]] ranges. The [[Himalayas]], the [[Alps]], and the [[Appalachians]] are prominent examples of compressional orogenies with numerous overthrust faults.

Thrust faults occur in the foreland basin which occur marginal to orogenic belts. Here, compression does not result in appreciable mountain building, which is mostly accommodated by folding and stacking of thrusts. Instead thrust faults generally cause a thickening of the stratigraphic section.

Foreland basin thrusts also usually observe the ramp-flat geometry, with thrusts propagating within units at a very low angle "flats" (at 1–5 degrees) and then moving up-section in steeper ramps (at 5–20 degrees) where they offset stratigraphic units. Identifying ramps where they occur within units is usually problematic.

Thrusts and duplexes are also found in [[accretionary wedge]]s in the [[ocean trench]] margin of subduction zones, where oceanic sediments are scraped off the subducted plate and accumulate. Here, the accretionary wedge must thicken by up to 200% and this is achieved by stacking thrust fault upon thrust fault in a [[mélange|melange]] of disrupted rock, often with chaotic folding. Here, ramp flat geometries are not usually observed because the compressional force is at a steep angle to the sedimentary layering.

==History==
Thrust faults were unrecognised until the work of [[Arnold Escher von der Linth]], [[Albert Heim]] and [[Marcel Alexandre Bertrand]] in the Alps working on the [[Glarus Thrust]]; [[Charles Lapworth]], [[Ben Peach]] and [[John Horne]] working on parts of the [[Moine Thrust Belt|Moine Thrust]] [[Scotland]]; [[Alfred Elis Törnebohm]] in the Scandinavian Caledonides and [[R. G. McConnell]] in the Canadian Rockies.&lt;ref&gt;Peach, B.N., Horne, J., Gunn, W., Clough, C.T. &amp; Hinxman, L.W. 1907.

Rept., '''2''', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The realisation that older strata could, via faulting, be found above younger strata, was arrived at more or less independently by geologists in all these areas during the 1880s. [[Archibald Geikie|Geikie]] in 1884 coined the term ''thrust-plane'' to describe this special set of faults. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By a system of reversed faults, a group of strata is made to cover a great breadth of ground and actually to overlie higher members of the same series. The most extraordinary dislocations, however, are those to which for distinction we have given the name of Thrust-planes. They are strictly reversed faults, but with so low a hade that the rocks on their upthrown side have been, as it were, pushed horizontally forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/structure/tectonics/thrust_tectonics/|title=Thrust Tectonics|website=www.see.leeds.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Crystalline Rocks of the Scottish Highlands|journal=Nature|date=November 13, 1884|volume=31|pages=29–31|doi=10.1038/031029d0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v31/n785/pdf/031029d0.pdf|accessdate=September 15, 2011|author=Archibald Geikie|bibcode = 1884Natur..31...29G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''traveling-wave tube''' ('''TWT''', pronounced "twit") or '''traveling-wave tube amplifier''' ('''TWTA''', pronounced "tweeta") is a specialized [[vacuum tube]] that is used in [[electronics]] to amplify [[radio frequency]] (RF) signals in the [[microwave]] range.&lt;ref name="Gilmour"&gt;{{cite book

A major advantage of the TWT over some other microwave tubes is its ability to amplify a wide range of [[frequency|frequencies]], a wide [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].  The bandwidth of the helix TWT can be as high as two [[octave]]s, while the cavity versions have bandwidths of 10–20%.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt;  Operating frequencies range from 300&amp;nbsp;MHz to 50&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt; The power gain of the tube is on the order of 40 to 70 [[decibel]]s,&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt; and output power ranges from a few watts to [[megawatt]]s.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt;

TWTs account for over 50% of the sales volume of all microwave vacuum tubes.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;   They are widely used as the power amplifiers and [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] in [[radar]] systems, [[communication satellite]] and spacecraft [[transmitter]]s, and [[electronic warfare]] systems.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

==Description==

===A Basic TWT===
The TWT is an elongated vacuum tube with an [[electron gun]] (a heated [[cathode]] that emits [[electron]]s) at one end. A [[voltage]] applied across the cathode and [[anode]] accelerates the electrons towards the far end of the tube, and an external magnetic field around the tube focuses the electrons into a beam. At the other end of the tube the electrons strike the "collector", which returns them to the circuit.

Wrapped around the inside of the tube, just outside the beam path, is a helix of wire, typically [[oxygen-free copper]]. The RF signal to be amplified is fed into the helix at a point near the emitter end of the tube. The signal is normally fed into the helix via a [[waveguide]] or electromagnetic coil placed at one end, forming a one-way signal path, a [[directional coupler]].

By controlling the accelerating voltage, the speed of the electrons flowing down the tube is set to be similar to the speed of the RF signal running down the helix. The signal in the wire causes a magnetic field to be induced in the center of the helix, where the electrons are flowing. Depending on the phase of the signal, the electrons will either be sped up or slowed down as they pass the windings. This causes the electron beam to "bunch up", known technically as "velocity modulation". The resulting pattern of electron density in the beam is an analog of the original RF signal.

Because the beam is passing the helix as it travels, and that signal varies, it causes induction in the helix, amplifying the original signal. By the time it reaches the other end of the tube, this process has had time to deposit considerable energy back into the helix. A second directional coupler, positioned near the collector, receives an amplified version of the input signal from the far end of the RF circuit. Attenuators placed along the RF circuit prevent the reflected wave from traveling back to the cathode.

Higher powered helix TWTs usually contain [[beryllium oxide]] ceramic as both a helix support rod and in some cases, as an electron collector for the TWT because of its special electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties.&lt;ref&gt;1997 Industrial Assessment of the Microwave Power Tube Industry - US Department of Defense [http://www.triodeel.com/images/tubeassessment.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanberyllia.com/tech_info1.html Beryllium Oxide Properties]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison===
[[File:Uv 1008 1976.jpg|thumb|Soviet UV-1008 (УВ-1008) TWT from 1976, with waveguide input and output]]

There are a number of RF amplifier tubes that operate in a similar fashion to the TWT, known collectively as velocity-modulated tubes. The best known example is the [[klystron]]. All of these tubes use the same basic "bunching" of electrons to provide the amplification process, and differ largely in what process causes the velocity modulation to occur.

In the klystron, the electron beam passes through a hole in a [[resonant cavity]] which is connected to the source RF signal. The signal at the instant the electrons pass through the hole causes them to be accelerated (or decelerated). The electrons enter a "drift tube" in which faster electrons overtake the slower ones, creating the bunches, after which the electrons pass through another resonant cavity from which the output power is taken.  Since the velocity sorting process takes time, the drift tube must often be several feet long.

In comparison, in the TWT the acceleration is caused by the interactions with the helix along the entire length of the tube. This allows the TWT to have a very low noise output, a major advantage of the design. More usefully, this process is much less sensitive to the physical arrangement of the tube, which allows the TWT to operate over a wider variety of frequencies. TWT's are generally at an advantage when low noise and frequency variability are useful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radartutorial.eu/08.transmitters/Traveling%20Wave%20Tube.en.html "Traveling Wave Tube"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radartutorial.eu/18.explanations/ex19.en.html "Velocity-modulated Tubes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coupled-cavity TWT===
Helix TWTs are limited in peak RF power by the current handling (and therefore thickness) of the helix wire. As power level increases, the wire can overheat and cause the helix geometry to warp. Wire thickness can be increased to improve matters, but if the wire is too thick it becomes impossible to obtain the required [[helix|helix pitch]] for proper operation. Typically helix TWTs achieve less than 2.5&amp;nbsp;kW output power.

The '''coupled-cavity TWT''' overcomes this limit by replacing the helix with a series of coupled cavities arranged axially along the beam. This structure provides a helical [[waveguide]], and hence amplification can occur via velocity modulation. Helical waveguides have very nonlinear dispersion and thus are only narrowband (but wider than [[klystron]]). A coupled-cavity TWT can achieve 60&amp;nbsp;kW output power.

Operation is similar to that of a [[klystron]], except that coupled-cavity TWTs are designed with attenuation between the slow-wave structure instead of a drift tube. The slow-wave structure gives the TWT its wide bandwidth. A [[free electron laser]] allows higher frequencies.

==Traveling-wave-tube amplifier==
A TWT integrated with a regulated [[power supply]] and protection circuits is referred to as a traveling-wave-tube amplifier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vsats: Very Small Aperture Terminals|author=John Everett|publisher=IET|year=1992|isbn=0-86341-200-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWuXmf4V4NwC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=twta+power-supply+protection+control&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=KmiMR5uEKozitQPomLHQBQ&amp;sig=D15Vi396wr6gRWzB1o3JtBiUF1I#PPA64,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated '''TWTA''' and often pronounced "TWEET-uh"). It is used to produce high-power [[radio frequency]] signals. The bandwidth of a broadband TWTA can be as high as one [[Octave (electronics)|octave]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} although tuned (narrowband) versions exist; operating frequencies range from 300&amp;nbsp;MHz to 50&amp;nbsp;GHz.

A TWTA consists of a traveling-wave tube coupled with its protection circuits (as in [[klystron]]) and regulated [[power supply]] [[Active power conditioner|electronic power conditioner]] (EPC),&lt;!--Unsure if active is correct--&gt; which may be supplied and integrated by a different manufacturer. The main difference between most power supplies and those for vacuum tubes is that efficient vacuum tubes have depressed collectors to recycle kinetic energy of the electrons, so the secondary winding of the power supply needs up to 6 taps of which the helix voltage needs precise regulation. The subsequent addition of a [[linear]]izer (as for [[inductive output tube]]) can, by complementary compensation, improve the [[gain compression]] and other characteristics of the TWTA; this combination is called a linearized TWTA (LTWTA, "EL-tweet-uh").

Broadband TWTAs generally use a helix TWT and achieve less than 2.5&amp;nbsp;kW output power. TWTAs using a coupled cavity TWT can achieve 15&amp;nbsp;kW output power, but at the expense of bandwidth.

==Invention, development and early use==
The original design and prototype of the TWT was done by Andrei "Andy" Haeff c. 1931 while he was working as a doctoral student at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory at Caltech.  His original patent, "Device for and Method of Controlling High Frequency Currents", was filed in 1933 and granted in 1936.&lt;ref name=Haeff_patent&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2064469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ieee_spectrum&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Jack|last1=Copeland|first2=Andre A.|last2=Haeff|title=The True History of the Traveling Wave Tube|journal=IEEE Spectrum| date=September 2015 |pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the TWT is often attributed to [[Rudolf Kompfner]] in 1942–1943.  In addition, Nils Lindenblad, working at RCA (Radio Corporation of America) in the USA also filed a patent for a device in May 1940&lt;ref name=Lindenblad_patent&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2300052}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was remarkably similar to Kompfner's TWT.&lt;ref name=Gilmour_book&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Artech House|isbn=978-0-890-06720-8|last=Gilmour|first=A. S.|title=Principles of traveling wave tubes|location=Boston|series=Artech House Radar Library|year=1994|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Both of these devices were improvements over Haeff's original design as they both used the then newly invented precision electron gun as the source of the electron beam and they both directed the beam down the center of the helix instead of outside of it.  These configuration changes resulted in much greater wave amplification than Haeff's design as they relied on the physical principles of velocity modulation and electron bunching.&lt;ref name=ieee_spectrum/&gt; Kompfner developed his TWT in a British [[Admiralty]] radar laboratory during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electron beams and microwave vacuum electronics|author=Shulim E.

The TWT was later refined by Kompfner,&lt;ref name=Kompfner_book/&gt; [[John R. Pierce]],&lt;ref name=Pierce_book&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=John R.|authorlink=John R.

Note that Kompfner's US patent, granted in 1953, does cite Haeff's previous work.&lt;ref name=ieee_spectrum/&gt;

By the 1950s, after further development at the [[Electron Technologies, Inc.#History|Electron Tube Laboratory]] at Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City, California, TWTs went into production there, and by the 1960s TWTs were also produced by such companies as the [[e2v|English Electric Valve Company]], followed by [[Ferranti]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firedirect.net/Profiles/0802_e2v/0802_001.htm Fire Direct Web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923162457/http://www.firedirect.net/Profiles/0802_e2v/0802_001.htm |date=2009-09-23 }}.

==Uses==
TWTAs are commonly used as amplifiers in [[satellite]] [[transponders]], where the input signal is very weak and the output needs to be high power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Satellite Communications|author=Dennis Roddy|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2006|isbn=0-07-146298-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KEt_hFyjwgC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;dq=twta&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=sGSMR4aGJovUsgOd-J3QBQ&amp;sig=ke5M82C-Y32_MVDtufLwcjOijas#PPA375,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TWTA whose output drives an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is a type of [[transmitter]].

A '''tropical cyclone''' is a rapidly rotating [[storm|storm system]] characterized by a [[Low-pressure area|low-pressure]] center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, [[Beaufort scale|strong winds]], and a spiral arrangement of [[thunderstorm]]s that produce heavy rain. Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, including [[#Hurricane or typhoon|hurricane]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʌr|ᵻ|k|ən|,_|-|k|eɪ|n}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/hurricane#hurricane|title=hurricane|publisher=Oxford dictionary |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hurricane|title=Hurricane - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hurricane|title=Definition of "hurricane" - Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tropical cyclone#Hurricane or typhoon|typhoon]] ({{IPAc-en|t|aɪ|'|f|uː|n}}), [[#Tropical storm|tropical storm]], cyclonic storm, [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical depression|tropical depression]], and simply cyclone.&lt;ref name="HCT"&gt;{{cite web | title = What is the difference between a hurricane, a cyclone, and a typhoon? | work = OCEAN FACTS | publisher = [[National Ocean Service]] | url = http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/cyclone.html | accessdate = December 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and northeastern [[Pacific Ocean]], and a [[typhoon]] occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean; while in the south Pacific or [[Indian Ocean]], comparable storms are referred to simply as "tropical cyclones" or "severe cyclonic storms".&lt;ref name="HCT" /&gt;

"Tropical" refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over [[tropics|tropical]] seas. "Cyclone" refers to their winds moving in a circle,&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com.research.aadl.org/view/Entry/46537?redirectedFrom=Cyclone+#eid|website=OED Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=September 10, 2017|date=June 2017|quote=a general term for all storms or atmospheric disturbances in which the wind has a circular or whirling course.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whirling round their central clear [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]], with their winds blowing [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|counterclockwise]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and clockwise in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The opposite direction of circulation is due to the [[Coriolis effect]]. Tropical cyclones [[tropical cyclogenesis|typically form]] over large bodies of relatively warm water. They derive their energy through the evaporation of [[water]] from the [[ocean]] surface, which ultimately [[Condensation|recondenses]] into [[cloud]]s and rain when moist air rises and cools to [[Saturated fluid|saturation]]. This [[energy source]] differs from that of [[extratropical cyclone|mid-latitude cyclonic storms]], such as [[nor'easter]]s and [[European windstorm]]s, which are fueled primarily by [[Baroclinic instability|horizontal temperature contrasts]]. Tropical cyclones are typically between {{convert|100|and|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter.

The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the [[conservation of angular momentum]] imparted by the [[Earth]]'s [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result, they rarely form within 5° of the equator.&lt;ref name="BAMS Zhang 1988"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/1520-0477(1998)079&lt;0019:TCAGCC&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = Tropical Cyclones and Global Climate Change: A Post-IPCC Assessment| journal = Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society| volume = 79| pages = 19–38| year = 1998| last1 = Henderson-Sellers | first1 = A.| last2 = Zhang | first2 = H.| last3 = Berz | first3 = G.| last4 = Emanuel | first4 = K.| last5 = Gray | first5 = W.| last6 = Landsea | first6 = C.| last7 = Holland | first7 = G.| last8 = Lighthill | first8 = J.| last9 = Shieh | first9 = S.

Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impact of a tropical cyclone, compared to inland regions. The primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean waters, therefore these forms are typically strongest when over or near water, and weaken quite rapidly over land. Coastal damage may be caused by strong winds and rain, high waves (due to winds), [[storm surge]]s (due to wind and severe pressure changes), and [[tornadogenesis|the potential]] of spawning [[tornado]]es. Tropical cyclones also draw in air from a large area—which can be a vast area for the most severe cyclones—and concentrate the [[precipitation]] of the water content in that air (made up from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from water) into a much smaller area. This continual replacement of moisture-bearing air by new moisture-bearing air after its moisture has fallen as rain, which may cause extremely heavy rain and river flooding up to {{convert|40|km|mi}} from the coastline, far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere holds at any one time.

Though their effects on human populations are often devastating, tropical cyclones can relieve [[drought]] conditions. They also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward [[temperate]] [[latitude]]s, which may play an important role in modulating regional and global [[climate]].

Tropical cyclones are areas of relatively [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] in the [[troposphere]], with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at [[sea level]].&lt;ref name="ABC pressures"&gt;{{cite news|author=Symonds, Steve|title=Highs and Lows|work=Wild Weather|url=http://www.abc.net.au/northcoast/stories/s989385.htm|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 17, 2003|accessdate=March 23, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011194541/http://www.abc.net.au/northcoast/stories/s989385.htm |archivedate = October 11, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environment near the center of tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as "warm core" systems.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ A7"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions: What is an extra-tropical cyclone? |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=March 23, 2007 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A7.html |author1=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory |author2=Hurricane Research Division |authorlink1=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209121005/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A7.html |archivedate=February 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind field===
The near-surface wind field of a tropical cyclone is characterized by air rotating rapidly around a [[Eye (cyclone)|center of circulation]] while also flowing radially inwards. At the outer edge of the storm, air may be nearly calm; however, due to the Earth’s rotation, the air has non-zero [[absolute angular momentum]]. As air flows radially inward, it begins to [[cyclonic rotation|rotate cyclonically]] (counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) in order to [[conservation of angular momentum|conserve angular momentum]]. At an inner radius, air begins to ascend to the [[tropopause|top of the troposphere]]. This radius is typically coincident with the inner radius of the [[eyewall]], and has the strongest near-surface winds of the storm; consequently, it is known as the ''[[radius of maximum wind]]s''.&lt;ref name="NHC glossary"/&gt; Once aloft, air flows away from the storm's center, producing a shield of [[cirrus cloud]]s.&lt;ref name="cirrus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cirrus Cloud Detection|location=Monterey, CA|url=http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/sat_training/nexsat/cirrus/NexSat_Cirrus.pdf|author=Marine Meteorology Division|work=Satellite Product Tutorials|publisher=[[United States Naval Research Laboratory]]|accessdate=June 4, 2013|format=PDF|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previously mentioned processes result in a wind field that is nearly [[axisymmetric]]: Wind speeds are low at the center, increase rapidly moving outwards to the radius of maximum winds, and then decay more gradually with radius to large radii. However, the wind field often exhibits additional spatial and temporal variability due to the effects of localized processes, such as [[atmospheric convection|thunderstorm activity]] and horizontal [[Instability#Fluid instabilities|flow instabilities]]. In the vertical direction, winds are strongest near the surface and decay with height within the troposphere.&lt;ref name="MWR Frank 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frank, W.

===Eye and center===
[[File:Bansi 2015-01-12 210417Z - edit1.jpg|thumb|right|Thunderstorm activity in the eyewall of [[2014–15 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season#Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Bansi|Cyclone Bansi]] as seen from the [[International Space Station]], on January 12, 2015]]
At the center of a mature tropical cyclone, air sinks rather than rises. For a sufficiently strong storm, air may sink over a layer deep enough to suppress cloud formation, thereby creating a clear "[[Eye (cyclone)|eye]]". Weather in the eye is normally calm and free of clouds, although the sea may be extremely violent.&lt;ref name="JetStream structure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/tropics/tc_structure.htm|author=[[National Weather Service]]|work=JetStream&amp;nbsp;— An Online School for Weather|publisher=[[National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration]]|title=Tropical Cyclone Structure|accessdate=May 7, 2009|date=October 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eye is normally circular in shape, and is typically {{convert|30|–|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, though eyes as small as {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} and as large as {{convert|370|km|mi|abbr=on}} have been observed.&lt;ref name="WilmaTCR"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pasch |first=Richard J. |author2=Eric S.

The cloudy outer edge of the eye is called the "eyewall". The eyewall typically expands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the "[[Eye (cyclone)#Stadium effect|stadium effect]]".&lt;ref name="MWR 1996 AHS summary"/&gt; The [[eyewall]] is where the greatest wind speeds are found, air rises most rapidly, clouds reach to their highest altitude, and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.&lt;ref name="JetStream structure"/&gt;

In a weaker storm, the eye may be obscured by the [[central dense overcast]], which is the upper-level cirrus shield that is associated with a concentrated area of strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone.&lt;ref name="CDO AMS"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[American Meteorological Society]]|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=c&amp;p=19|title=AMS Glossary: C|work=Glossary of Meteorology|accessdate=December 14, 2006|publisher=[[Allen Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eyewall may vary over time in the form of [[Eye (cyclone)#Eyewall replacement cycles|eyewall replacement cycles]], particularly in intense tropical cyclones. [[Rainbands|Outer rainbands]] can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward, which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and [[angular momentum]]. When the primary eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one at the end of the cycle, at which time the storm may return to its original intensity.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ D8"&gt;{{cite web|author=Atlantic Oceanographic and Hurricane Research Division |title=Frequently Asked Questions: What are "concentric eyewall cycles" (or "eyewall replacement cycles") and why do they cause a hurricane's maximum winds to weaken? |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=December 14, 2006 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D8.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206051303/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D8.html |archivedate=December 6, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapid deepening===
{{main|Rapid deepening}}
On occasion, tropical cyclones may undergo a process known as rapid deepening, a period in which the minimum sea-level pressure of a tropical cyclone decreases by 42mb in a 24-hour period.&lt;ref name="NWS Glossary"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Weather Service Glossary|url=http://w1.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=r|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|accessdate=December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for rapid deepening to occur, several conditions must be in place. [[Sea surface temperature|Water temperatures]] must be extremely high (near or above 30&amp;nbsp;°C, 86&amp;nbsp;°F), and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not upwell cooler waters to the surface. [[Wind shear]] must be low; when wind shear is high, the [[Convection#Atmospheric convection|convection]] and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted. Usually, an [[anticyclone]] in the upper layers of the [[troposphere]] above the storm must be present as well—for extremely low surface pressures to develop, air must be rising very rapidly in the [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]] of the storm, and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently.&lt;ref name="Energetics"&gt;{{cite web|author=Diana Engle|title=Hurricane Structure and Energetics|publisher=Data Discovery Hurricane Science Center|accessdate=October 26, 2008|url=http://www.newmediastudio.org/DataDiscovery/Hurr_ED_Center/Hurr_Structure_Energetics/Hurr_Struct.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527094650/http://www.newmediastudio.org/DataDiscovery/Hurr_ED_Center/Hurr_Structure_Energetics/Hurr_Struct.html|archivedate=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. [[Gale|gale force]]), the radius of outermost closed [[isobar (meteorology)|isobar]] ([[Radius of outermost closed isobar|ROCI]]), and the radius of vanishing wind.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cawcr.gov.au/publications/BMRC_archive/tcguide/ch2/ch2_4.htm |title=Global Guide to Tropical Cyclone Forecasting: chapter 2: Tropical Cyclone Structure |date=May 7, 2009 |publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601213941/http://www.cawcr.gov.au/publications/BMRC_archive/tcguide/ch2/ch2_4.htm |archivedate=June 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chavas Emanuel GRL"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2010GL044558| title = A QuikSCAT climatology of tropical cyclone size| journal = Geophysical Research Letters| volume = 37| issue = 18| pages = n/a| year = 2010| last1 = Chavas | first1 = D. R.| last2 = Emanuel | first2 = K. A. | bibcode=2010GeoRL..3718816C}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative [[vorticity]] field decreases to 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="MWR 1996 AHS summary"/&gt;

On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from {{convert|100–2000|km|mi}} as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin.&lt;ref name="Merrill"/&gt; If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two [[latitude|degrees of latitude]] ({{convert|222|km|mi|abbr=on}}), then the cyclone is "very small" or a "midget". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees ({{convert|333|–|670|km|mi|abbr=on}}) is considered "average sized". "Very large" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8&amp;nbsp;degrees ({{convert|888|km|mi|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name="JTWCsize"/&gt; Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.&lt;ref name="Chavas Emanuel GRL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merrill"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A comparison of Large and Small Tropical cyclones |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=112 |issue=7 |pages=1408–1418 |last=Merrill |first=Robert T |year=1984 |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1984)112&lt;1408:ACOLAS&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode=1984MWRv..112.1408M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher [[storm surge]] due to the combination of longer wind [[fetch (geography)|fetch]], longer duration, and enhanced [[wave setup]].&lt;ref name="Irish et al JPO"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/2008JPO3727.1| title = The Influence of Storm Size on Hurricane Surge| journal = Journal of Physical Oceanography| volume = 38| issue = 9| pages = 2003–2013| year = 2008| last1 = Irish | first1 = J.

==Physics and energetics==
[[File:Hurricane profile.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Tropical cyclones exhibit an overturning circulation where air inflows at low levels near the surface, rises in thunderstorm clouds, and outflows at high levels near the tropopause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/anthro2.htm|title=Anthropogenic Effects on Tropical Cyclone Activity.|author=Emanuel, Kerry |date=February 8, 2006|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[three-dimensional]] wind field in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components: a "primary circulation" and a "[[secondary circulation]]". The primary circulation is the rotational part of the flow; it is purely circular. The secondary circulation is the overturning (in-up-out-down) part of the flow; it is in the [[Geometric terms of location|radial]] and vertical directions. The primary circulation is larger in magnitude, dominating the surface wind field, and is responsible for the majority of the damage a storm causes, while the secondary circulation is slower but governs the [[energetics]] of the storm.

===Secondary circulation: a Carnot heat engine===
A tropical cyclone's primary energy source is heat from the evaporation of [[water]] from the surface of a warm [[ocean]], previously heated by sunshine.

Second, the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to [[sensible heat]] during [[condensation]]). Third, air outflows and loses heat via [[Thermal radiation|infrared radiation]] to space at the temperature of the cold [[tropopause]]. Finally, air [[Subsidence (atmosphere)|subsides]] and warms at the outer edge of the storm while conserving total heat content. The first and third legs are nearly [[isothermal]], while the second and fourth legs are nearly [[isentropic]]. This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the [[Secondary flow|secondary circulation]]. The Carnot perspective provides an [[Tropical cyclone#Maximum potential intensity|upper bound]] on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain.

This rate of energy release is equivalent to 70 times the [[world energy resources and consumption|world energy consumption]] of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity, or to exploding a 10-[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] [[nuclear bomb]] every 20&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="NOAA Question of the Month"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucar.edu/news/features/hurricanes/index.jsp |title=Hurricanes: Keeping an eye on weather's biggest bullies. |date=March 31, 2006 |publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] |accessdate=May 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425013318/http://www.ucar.edu/news/features/hurricanes/index.jsp |archivedate=April 25, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary circulation: rotating winds===
The primary rotating flow in a tropical cyclone results from the [[conservation of angular momentum]] by the secondary circulation. [[Absolute angular momentum]] on a rotating planet &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{1}{2}fr^2 + vr&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Coriolis parameter]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the azimuthal (i.e. rotating) wind speed, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius to the axis of rotation. The first term on the right hand side is the component of planetary angular momentum that projects onto the local vertical (i.e. the axis of rotation). The second term on the right hand side is the relative angular momentum of the circulation itself with respect to the axis of rotation. Because the planetary angular momentum term vanishes at the equator (where &lt;math&gt;f=0&lt;/math&gt; ), tropical cyclones rarely [[Tropical cyclone#Formation|form]] within 5° of the equator.&lt;ref name="BAMS Zhang 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/ASK/hurricanes.html|title=Hurricanes and the equator|author=Barnes, Gary|publisher=[[University of Hawaii]]|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As air flows radially inward at low levels, it begins to rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum. Similarly, as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause, its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius, resulting in an upper-level [[anti-cyclone]]. The result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong [[cyclone]] at low levels and a strong [[anti-cyclone]] near the [[tropopause]]; from [[Thermal wind|thermal wind balance]], this corresponds to a system that is warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes (i.e. "warm-core"). From [[hydrostatic balance]], the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes, with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface.&lt;ref name="MWR Frank 1977" /&gt;

===Maximum potential intensity===
Due to surface friction, the inflow only partially conserves angular momentum. Thus, the sea surface lower boundary acts as both a source (evaporation) and sink (friction) of energy for the system. This fact leads to the existence of a theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone can attain. Because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed (just as climbing out of a pool feels much colder on a windy day), there is a positive feedback on energy input into the system known as the Wind-Induced Surface Heat Exchange (WISHE) feedback.&lt;ref name="JAS Emanuel 1986" /&gt; This feedback is offset when frictional dissipation, which increases with the cube of the wind speed, becomes sufficiently large. This upper bound is called the "maximum potential intensity", &lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt;, and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;v_p^2 = \frac{C_k}{C_d}\frac{T_s - T_o}{T_o}\Delta k&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the sea surface, &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the outflow ([K]), &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy difference between the surface and the overlying air ([J/kg]), and &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; are the surface [[Heat transfer coefficient|exchange coefficients]] ([[dimensionless]]) of enthalpy and momentum, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bister_Emanuel_1998_MAP"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01030791| title = Dissipative heating and hurricane intensity| journal = Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics| volume = 65| issue = 3–4| pages = 233–240| year = 1998| last1 = Bister | first1 = M.| last2 = Emanuel | first2 = K. A.|bibcode = 1998MAP....65..233B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface-air enthalpy difference is taken as &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = k^*_s-k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k^*_s&lt;/math&gt; is the saturation [[enthalpy]] of air at sea surface temperature and sea-level pressure and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy of boundary layer air overlying the surface.

The maximum potential intensity is predominantly a function of the background environment alone (i.e. without a tropical cyclone), and thus this quantity can be used to determine which regions on Earth can support tropical cyclones of a given intensity, and how these regions may evolve in time.&lt;ref name="Emanuel_2000_MWR"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/1520-0493(2000)128&lt;1139:ASAOTC&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = A Statistical Analysis of Tropical Cyclone Intensity| journal = Monthly Weather Review| volume = 128| issue = 4| pages = 1139–1152| year = 2000| last1 = Emanuel | first1 = K. |bibcode = 2000MWRv..128.1139E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knutson_etal_2010_NG"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ngeo779| title = Tropical cyclones and climate change| journal = Nature Geoscience| volume = 3| issue = 3| pages = 157–163| year = 2010| last1 = Knutson | first1 = T.

====Derivation====
A tropical cyclone may be viewed as a [[heat engine]] that converts input [[heat]] energy from the surface into [[mechanical energy]] that can be used to do [[mechanical work]] against surface friction. At equilibrium, the rate of net energy production in the system must equal the rate of energy loss due to frictional dissipation at the surface, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;W_{in} = W_{out}&lt;/math&gt;

The rate of energy loss per unit surface area from surface friction, &lt;math&gt;W_{out}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;W_{out} = C_d \rho |\mathbf{u}|^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of near-surface air ([kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]) and &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{u}|&lt;/math&gt; is the near surface wind speed ([m/s]).

The rate of energy production per unit surface area, &lt;math&gt;W_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;W_{in} = \epsilon Q_{in}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the heat engine efficiency and &lt;math&gt;Q_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is the total rate of heat input into the system per unit surface area. Given that a tropical cyclone may be idealized as a [[Tropical cyclone#Secondary circulation: a Carnot heat engine|Carnot heat engine]], the Carnot heat engine efficiency is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{T_s-T_o}{T_s}&lt;/math&gt;

Heat (enthalpy) per unit mass is given by

:&lt;math&gt;k = C_pT + L_vq&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the heat capacity of air, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is air temperature, &lt;math&gt;L_v&lt;/math&gt; is the latent heat of vaporization, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of water vapor. The first component corresponds to [[sensible heat]] and the second to [[latent heat]].

There are two sources of heat input. The dominant source is the input of heat at the surface, primarily due to evaporation. The bulk aerodynamic formula for the rate of heat input per unit area at the surface, &lt;math&gt;Q_{in:k}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{in:k} = C_k \rho |\mathbf{u}|\Delta k&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = k^*_s-k&lt;/math&gt; represents the enthalpy difference between the ocean surface and the overlying air. The second source is the internal sensible heat generated from frictional dissipation (equal to &lt;math&gt;W_{out}&lt;/math&gt;), which occurs near the surface within the tropical cyclone and is recycled to the system.

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{in:friction} = C_d \rho |\mathbf{u}|^3&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the total rate of net energy production per unit surface area is given by

:&lt;math&gt;W_{in} = \frac{T_s-T_o}{T_s}\left(C_k \rho |\mathbf{u}|\Delta k + C_d \rho |\mathbf{u}|^3\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Setting &lt;math&gt;W_{in} = W_{out}&lt;/math&gt; and taking &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{u}| \approx v&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the rotational wind speed is dominant) leads to the solution for &lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt; given above. This derivation assumes that total energy input and loss within the system can be approximated by their values at the radius of maximum wind. The inclusion of &lt;math&gt;Q_{in:friction}&lt;/math&gt; acts to multiply the total heat input rate by the factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{T_s}{T_o}&lt;/math&gt;. Mathematically, this has the effect of replacing &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator of the Carnot efficiency.

An alternative definition for the maximum potential intensity, which is mathematically equivalent to the above formulation, is

:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt{\frac{T_s}{T_o}\frac{C_k}{C_d}(CAPE^*_s-CAPE_b)|_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where CAPE stands for the [[Convective Available Potential Energy]], &lt;math&gt;CAPE^*_s&lt;/math&gt; is the CAPE of an air parcel lifted from saturation at sea level in reference to the environmental [[Atmospheric sounding|sounding]], &lt;math&gt;CAPE_b&lt;/math&gt; is the CAPE of the boundary layer air, and both quantities are calculated at the radius of maximum wind.&lt;ref name="Bister_Emanuel_2002_JGRA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2001JD000776| title = Low frequency variability of tropical cyclone potential intensity 1.

====Characteristic values and variability on Earth====
On Earth, a characteristic temperature for &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; is 300 K and for &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt; is 200 K, corresponding to a Carnot efficiency of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 1/3&lt;/math&gt;. The ratio of the surface exchange coefficients, &lt;math&gt;C_k/C_d&lt;/math&gt;, is typically taken to be 1. However, observations suggest that the drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; varies with wind speed and may decrease at high wind speeds within the boundary layer of a mature hurricane.&lt;ref name="Powell_etal_2003_Nat"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature01481| pmid = 12646913| title = Reduced drag coefficient for high wind speeds in tropical cyclones| journal = Nature| volume = 422| issue = 6929| pages = 279–83| year = 2003| last1 = Powell | first1 = M.

A characteristic value of the maximum potential intensity, &lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt;, is {{convert|80|m/s|mph km/h}}. However, this quantity varies significantly across space and time, particularly within the [[season|seasonal cycle]], spanning a range of {{convert|0|to|100|m/s|mph km/h}}.&lt;ref name="Bister_Emanuel_2002_JGRA" /&gt; This variability is primarily due to variability in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium ( &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; ) as well as in the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere, which are controlled by the large-scale dynamics of the tropical climate. These processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature (and underlying ocean dynamics), background near-surface wind speed, and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating.&lt;ref name="Emanuel_Sobel_2013_JAMES"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jame.20032| title = Response of tropical sea surface temperature, precipitation, and tropical cyclone-related variables to changes in global and local forcing| journal = Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 447–458| year = 2013| last1 = Emanuel | first1 = K. | last2 = Sobel | first2 = A. | bibcode = 2013JAMES...5..447E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of this modulation is complex, particularly on climate time-scales (decades or longer). On shorter time-scales, variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical mean, as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water.&lt;ref name="Sobel_Bretherton_2000_JC"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/1520-0442(2000)013&lt;2086:TRBCAS&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = The Relationship between Convection and Sea Surface Temperature on Intraseasonal Timescales| journal = Journal of Climate| volume = 13| issue = 12| pages = 2086–2104| year = 2000| last1 = Woolnough | first1 = S.

===Interaction with the upper ocean===
[[File:GulfMexTemps 2005Hurricanes.gif|thumb|Chart displaying the drop in surface temperature in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as Hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] passed over]]

The passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially, which can influence subsequent cyclone development. This cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters. This effect results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening. Additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from falling raindrops (this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes). Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean, by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days.&lt;ref name="NASA Cooling"&gt;{{cite web|author1=D'Asaro, Eric A. |author2=Black, Peter G. |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://iop.apl.washington.edu/opd/user/dasaro/DENNIS/HurrConf.pdf |format=PDF |title=J8.4 Turbulence in the Ocean Boundary Layer Below Hurricane Dennis |year=2006 |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330131407/http://iop.apl.washington.edu/opd/user/dasaro/DENNIS/HurrConf.pdf |archivedate=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coversely, the mixing of the sea can result in heat being inserted in deeper waters, with [[Cyclonic Niño|potential effects]] on global [[climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fedorov |first1=Alexey V. |last2=Brierley |first2=Christopher M. |last3=Emanuel |first3=Kerry |title=Tropical cyclones and permanent El Niño in the early Pliocene epoch |journal=Nature |date=February 2010 |volume=463 |issue=7284 |pages=1066–1070 |doi=10.1038/nature08831 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08831 |language=En |issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]]s (RSMCs) worldwide. These organizations are designated by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and are responsible for tracking and issuing bulletins, warnings, and advisories about tropical cyclones in their designated areas of responsibility. In addition, there are six [[Tropical Cyclone Warning Center]]s (TCWCs) that provide information to smaller regions.&lt;ref name="WMO RSMC list"&gt;{{cite web|work=Tropical Cyclone Program (TCP)|publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|title=Regional Specialized Meteorological Center|date=April 25, 2006|accessdate=November 5, 2006|url=http://severe.worldweather.wmo.int/rsmcs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the [[tropical cyclone basins]] are active.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ G1"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division |title=Frequently Asked Questions: When is hurricane season? |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=July 25, 2006 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gYGdo8A6?url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html |archivedate=May 5, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor is rapid cooling with height, which allows the release of the [[heat of condensation]] that powers a tropical cyclone.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ A15"/&gt; High humidity is needed, especially in the lower-to-mid [[troposphere]]; when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere, conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ A15"/&gt; Low amounts of [[wind shear]] are needed, as high shear is disruptive to the storm's circulation.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ A15"/&gt; Tropical cyclones generally need to form more than {{convert|555|km|abbr=on}} or five degrees of latitude away from the [[equator]], allowing the [[Coriolis effect]] to deflect winds blowing towards the low pressure center and creating a circulation.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ A15"/&gt; Lastly, a formative tropical cyclone needs a preexisting system of disturbed weather. Tropical cyclones will not form spontaneously.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ A15"/&gt; Low-latitude and low-level westerly wind bursts associated with the [[Madden–Julian oscillation]] can create favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis by initiating tropical disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/bwang/bw/paper/186_Kikuchi_et_al_Nargis.pdf|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=36|year=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037296|author=Kikuchi, Kazuyoshi|author2= Wang, Bin |author3=Fudeyasu, Hironori |title=Genesis of tropical cyclone Nargis revealed by multiple satellite observations|pages=L06811|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.6811K|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==

The movement of a tropical cyclone (i.e. its "track") is typically approximated as the sum of two terms: "steering" by the background environmental wind and "beta drift".&lt;ref name="Holland JAS 1983"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/1520-0469(1983)040&lt;0328:TCMEIP&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = Tropical Cyclone Motion: Environmental Interaction Plus a Beta Effect| journal = Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences| volume = 40| issue = 2| pages = 328–342| year = 1983| last1 = Holland | first1 = G. J. |bibcode = 1983JAtS...40..328H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental steering===
Environmental steering is the dominant term. Conceptually, it represents the movement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions, similar to "leaves carried along by a stream".&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ G6"&gt;{{cite web|author=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Research Division|title=Frequently Asked Questions: What determines the movement of tropical cyclones?|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=July 25, 2006|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, the winds, or [[flow field]], in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts: the flow associated with the storm itself, and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place. In this way, tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as [[advection]] of the storm by the local environmental flow. This environmental flow is termed the "steering flow".

Climatologically, tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west [[trade winds]] on the equatorial side of the [[subtropical ridge]]—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ G6"/&gt; In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer [[tropical wave|tropical easterly waves]] westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ A4"/&gt; These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region.&lt;ref name="MWR Avila 1995"/&gt; In contrast, in the [[Indian Ocean]] and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|author=DeCaria, Alex|work=ESCI 344&amp;nbsp;– Tropical Meteorology|publisher=[[Millersville University of Pennsylvania|Millersville University]]|url=http://snowball.millersville.edu/~adecaria/ESCI344/esci344_lesson05_TC_climatology.html|title = Lesson 5&amp;nbsp;– Tropical Cyclones: Climatology.|year=2005|accessdate=February 22, 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080507051727/http://snowball.millersville.edu/~adecaria/ESCI344/esci344_lesson05_TC_climatology.html| archivedate = May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.

===Beta drift===
In addition to environmental steering, a tropical cyclone will tend to drift slowly poleward and westward, a motion known as "beta drift". This motion is due to the superposition of a vortex, such as a tropical cyclone, onto an environment in which the [[Coriolis force]] varies with latitude, such as on a sphere or [[beta plane]]. It is induced indirectly by the storm itself, the result of a feedback between the cyclonic flow of the storm and its environment.

Physically, the cyclonic circulation of the storm advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center. Because air must conserve its [[absolute angular momentum|angular momentum]], this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center. The combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs even if there is zero environmental flow.

===Multiple storm interaction===
{{Main|Fujiwhara effect}}
A third component of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves the interaction of multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after [[Sakuhei Fujiwhara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/wfujiwha.htm|title=Fujiwhara effect describes a stormy waltz|accessdate=February 21, 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|date=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies===

Though a tropical cyclone typically moves from east to west in the tropics, its track may shift poleward and eastward either as it moves west of the subtropical ridge axis or else if it interacts with the mid-latitude flow, such as the [[jet stream]] or an [[extratropical cyclone]]. This motion, termed "recurvature", commonly occurs near the western edge of the major ocean basins, where the jet stream typically has a poleward component and extratropical cyclones are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/~chu/chap4/se200.htm|date=April 10, 2007|title=Section 2: Tropical Cyclone Motion Terminology|publisher=United States Naval Research Laboratory|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of tropical cyclone recurvature was [[Hurricane Ioke|Typhoon Ioke]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="CPHC Ioke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2006.php#ioke | title = Hurricane Ioke: 20–27 August 2006|date=May 2007|accessdate=June 9, 2007|author=Powell, Jeff|work=2006 Tropical Cyclones Central North Pacific|publisher=[[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landfall===
{{See also|Tropical cyclogenesis#Unusual areas of formation}}
The landfall of a tropical cyclone occurs when a storm's surface center moves over a coastline.&lt;ref name="NHC glossary"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml|year=2016|title=Glossary of NHC/TPC Terms|accessdate=April 30, 2016|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and inland hours before landfall; in fact, a tropical cyclone can launch its strongest winds over land, yet not make landfall. NOAA uses the term "direct hit" to describe when a location (on the left side of the eye) falls within the radius of maximum winds (or twice that radius if on the right side), whether or not the hurricane's eye made landfall.&lt;ref name="NHC glossary"/&gt;

===Changes caused by El Niño–Southern Oscillation===
{{See also|El Niño–Southern Oscillation}}
Most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the [[equator]], then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the [[Westerlies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/forecaster_handbooks/Philippines2/Forecasters%20Handbook%20for%20the%20Philippine%20Islands%20and%20Surrounding%20Waters%20Typhoon%20Forecasting.3.pdf|title=3.3 JTWC Forecasting Philosophies|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2006|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|accessdate=February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[subtropical ridge]] position shifts due to El Niño, so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] tend to experience much fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during [[El Niño]] and neutral years. During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near [[130th meridian east|130°E]] which would favor the Japanese archipelago.&lt;ref name="China"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=M.

A tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several different ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C2.html |title=Subject : C2) Doesn't the friction over land kill tropical cyclones? |date=February 25, 2008 |work=[[National Hurricane Center]] |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=May 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506160420/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C2.html |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two, or evolve into extratropical cyclones.

A tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below {{convert|26.5|C|F}}. This will cause the storm to lose its tropical characteristics, such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center, and become a remnant [[low-pressure area]]. These '''remnant systems''' may persist for up to several days before losing their identity. This dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern North Pacific.&lt;ref name="Edwards genesis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Edwards, Jonathan|url=http://www.hurricanezone.net/articles/tropical-cyclone-formation.html|title=Tropical Cyclone Formation|accessdate=November 30, 2006|publisher=HurricaneZone.net| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221063429/http://www.hurricanezone.net/articles/tropical-cyclone-formation.html| archivedate = February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical wind shear, causing the convection and heat engine to move away from the center; this normally ceases development of a tropical cyclone.&lt;ref name="EAM"&gt;{{cite book|title=East Asian Monsoon|author=Chang, Chih-Pei |year=2004|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=981-238-769-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N8QYOdqGdgkC&amp;pg=PA484&amp;lpg=PA484|oclc=61353183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, its interaction with the main belt of the Westerlies, by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone, can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into [[extratropical cyclones]].

===Artificial dissipation===
In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[United States government]] attempted to weaken hurricanes through [[Project Stormfury]] by [[cloud seeding|seeding]] selected storms with [[silver iodide]]. It was thought that the seeding would cause [[supercooled water]] in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hrd_sub/sfury.html |title=Project Stormfury |date=February 7, 2009 |work=Hurricane Research Division |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=May 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615055430/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hrd_sub/sfury.html |archivedate=June 15, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The winds of [[Hurricane Debbie (1969)|Hurricane Debbie]]—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/1520-0477(1985)066&lt;0505:PSASC&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = Project STORMFURY: A Scientific Chronicle 1962–1983| journal = Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society| volume = 66| issue = 5| pages = 505–514| year = 1985| last1 = Willoughby | first1 = H.

The project was dropped after it was discovered that [[eyewall replacement cycle]]s occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ C5a"&gt;{{cite web|author=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Research Division|title=Frequently Asked Questions: Why don't we try to destroy tropical cyclones by seeding them with silver torches iodide?|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=July 25, 2006|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C5a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches have been suggested over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing [[iceberg]]s into the tropical oceans.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ C5e"/&gt; Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation,&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ C5b"&gt;{{cite web|author=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Research Division|title=Frequently Asked Questions: Why don't we try to destroy tropical cyclones by placing a substance on the ocean surface?|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=July 25, 2006|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C5b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that the [[heat of condensation|latent heat]] is absorbed by the ice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop),&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ C5e"&gt;{{cite web|author=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Research Division|title=Frequently Asked Questions: Why don't we try to destroy tropical cyclones by cooling the surface waters with icebergs or deep ocean water?|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=July 25, 2006|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C5e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ C5c"&gt;{{cite web|author=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Research Division|title=Frequently Asked Questions: Why don't we try to destroy tropical cyclones by nuking them?|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=July 25, 2006|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C5c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone.&lt;ref name="Sudden Sea"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scotti, R.

When hurricanes surge upon shore from the ocean, salt is introduced to many freshwater areas and raises the [[salinity]] levels too high for some habitats to withstand. Some are able to cope with the salt and recycle it back into the ocean, but others can not release the extra surface water quickly enough or do not have a large enough freshwater source to replace it.

The flood water can pick up the toxins from different spills and contaminate the land that it passes over. The toxins are very harmful to the people and animals in the area, as well as the environment around them. The flooding water can also spark many dangerous oil spills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cappielo|first=Dina|title=Spills from hurricanes stain coast With gallery - Houston Chronicle|url=http://www.chron.com/news/hurricanes/article/Spills-from-hurricanes-stain-coast-With-gallery-1915858.php|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=February 12, 2014|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparedness and response ===
{{Main|Hurricane preparedness|Hurricane response}}
Hurricane preparedness encompasses the actions and planning taken before a tropical cyclone strikes to mitigate damage and injury from the storm.   Knowledge of tropical cyclone impacts on an area help plan for future possibilities.  Preparedness may involve preparations made by individuals as well as centralized efforts by governments or other organizations.  Tracking storms during the tropical cyclone season helps individuals know current threats.  Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers provide current information and forecasts to help individuals make the best decision possible.

Hurricane response is the [[disaster response]] after a hurricane.  Activities performed by hurricane responders include assessment, restoration, and demolition of buildings; removal of [[debris]] and waste; repairs to land-based and maritime [[infrastructure]]; and public health services including [[search and rescue]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hurricane/sheets.html|title=OSHA's Hazard Exposure and Risk Assessment Matrix for Hurricane Response and Recovery Work: List of Activity Sheets|last=|first=|date=2005|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|language=EN-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurricane response requires coordination between federal, tribal, state, local, and private entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiha.org/publications-and-resources/HealthandSafetyIssuesinNaturalDisasters/Pages/Before-You-Begin.aspx|title=Before You Begin - The Incident Command System (ICS)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Industrial Hygiene Association|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster]], potential response volunteers should affiliate with established organizations and should not self-deploy, so that proper training and support can be provided to mitigate the danger and stress of response work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nvoad.org/howtohelp/volunteer-3/|title=Volunteer|last=|first=|date=|website=[[National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observation and forecasting==

===Observation===
{{Main|Tropical cyclone observation}}

Intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge, as they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and [[weather station]]s, being relatively sparse, are rarely available on the site of the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.&lt;ref name="FCMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ce.ufl.edu/~fcmp/overview/overview.htm|author=Florida Coastal Monitoring Program|title=Project Overview|accessdate=March 30, 2006|publisher=[[University of Florida]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060503084406/http://users.ce.ufl.edu/~fcmp/overview/overview.htm |archivedate = May 3, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by [[weather satellite]]s capturing [[visible light|visible]] and [[infrared]] images from space, usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals. As a storm approaches land, it can be observed by land-based [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]]. Radar plays a crucial role around landfall by showing a storm's location and intensity every several minutes.&lt;ref name="CPHC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/HAW/observations.php|title=Observations|date=December 9, 2006|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[In situ]] measurements, in real-time, can be taken by sending specially equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government [[hurricane hunters]].&lt;ref name="Hurricane Hunters"&gt;{{cite web|author=403rd Wing|url=http://www.hurricanehunters.com|title=The Hurricane Hunters|publisher=[[Hurricane Hunters|53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron]]|accessdate=March 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft used are [[WC-130]] Hercules and [[WP-3D]] Orions, both four-engine [[turboprop]] cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch [[GPS dropsonde]]s inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted [[Insitu Aerosonde|Aerosonde]], a small drone aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated a new way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.&lt;ref name="SunHerald"&gt;{{cite news|author=Lee, Christopher|title=Drone, Sensors May Open Path Into Eye of Storm|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/07/AR2007100700971_pf.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forecasting===

Because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system. The deep layer mean flow, or average wind through the depth of the [[troposphere]], is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed. If storms are significantly sheared, use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude, such as at the 70&amp;nbsp;kPa pressure surface ({{convert|3000|m|ft|disp=or}} above sea level) will produce better predictions. Tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-term [[wikt:wiggle|wobbles]] of the storm as it allows them to determine a more accurate long-term trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|url=http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/~chu/chap4/se100.htm|title=Influences on Tropical Cyclone Motion|accessdate=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce [[tropical cyclone prediction model|computer models]] that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems. Combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones, as well as with a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting [[satellites]] and other sensors, scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades.&lt;ref name="NHC forecast verifications models"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Hurricane Center]]|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify6.shtml?#FIG1 | work = National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification|title=Annual average model track errors for Atlantic basin tropical cyclones for the period 1994–2005, for a homogeneous selection of "early" models|accessdate=November 30, 2006|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | date = May 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists are not as skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name="NHC forecast verifications Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Hurricane Center]]|work=National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify5.shtml?|title=Annual average official track errors for Atlantic basin tropical cyclones for the period 1989–2005, with least-squares trend lines superimposed|accessdate=November 30, 2006|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=May 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development.

==Classifications, terminology, and naming==

===Intensity classifications===
{{Main|Tropical cyclone scales}}
[[File:Maria, Bopha and Saomai 2006-08-07 0435Z.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Three tropical cyclones of the [[2006 Pacific typhoon season]] at different stages of development. The weakest (left) demonstrates only the most basic circular shape. A stronger storm (top right) demonstrates [[rainbands|spiral banding]] and increased centralization, while the strongest (lower right) has developed an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]].]]
'''Tropical cyclones''' are classified into three main groups, based on intensity: tropical depressions, tropical storms, and a third group of more intense storms, whose name depends on the region. For example, if a [[#Tropical storm|tropical storm]] in the Northwestern Pacific reaches hurricane-strength winds on the [[Beaufort scale]], it is referred to as a ''typhoon''; if a tropical storm passes the same benchmark in the [[Pacific hurricane|Northeast Pacific Basin]], or in [[North Atlantic hurricane|the North Atlantic]], it is called a ''hurricane''.&lt;ref name="NHC glossary"/&gt; Neither "hurricane" nor "typhoon" is used in either the Southern Hemisphere or the Indian Ocean. In these [[Tropical cyclone basins|basins]], storms of a tropical nature are referred to as either tropical cyclones, severe tropical cyclones or very intense tropical cyclones.

As indicated in the table below, each basin uses a separate [[Tropical cyclone scales|system of terminology]], which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the [[180th meridian]] into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as [[Hurricane Ioke|Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke]] in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur.&lt;ref name="CPHC John TCR"&gt;{{cite report|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|title=Hurricane John Preliminary Report|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1994.php#John|year=2004|accessdate=March 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over {{convert|150|mph|km/h}}, are called ''Super Typhoons'' by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.&lt;ref name="SUPERDUPER"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bouchard, R.

Although not strictly tropical (or even subtropical) cyclonic systems like depressions, storms and hurricanes/&amp;#x200b;typhoons, the National Hurricane Center, Central Pacific Hurricane Center, and Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitor and designate certain areas of interest (also called [[Invest (meteorology)|invests]]) for potential cyclonic activity, sometimes classifying them as potential tropical cyclones as an unofficial fourth category.

====Potential tropical cyclone====

If a tropical disturbance (not yet developed into a tropical depression) is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours, then it will be classified by the NHC, CPHC, or JTWC as a '''potential tropical cyclone''' (PTC).&lt;ref name="ATL-EPAC TCOP"&gt;{{cite report|author=RA IV Hurricane Committee|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/1163-TCP-30-RA-IV-HC-39-OPERATIONAL-PLAN-2017-17650_en.pdf|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|title=Regional Association IV Hurricane Operational Plan 2017|format=PDF|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tropical depression====
{{redirect|Tropical Depression|the Filipino reggae band|Tropical Depression (band)|the EP by Elephant Micah|Tropical Depression (EP)}}
{{anchor|Tropical Depression}}{{anchor|tropical depression}}
A '''tropical depression''' or '''tropical low''' is a tropical disturbance that has a clearly defined [[Eye (cyclone)|surface circulation]] with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of less than {{convert|34|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="SPAC TCOP"/&gt; Within the Southern Hemisphere, the depression can have gale force or stronger winds in one or more quadrants, but not near the centre.&lt;ref name="SPAC TCOP"/&gt;

====Tropical storm====
{{Redirect|Tropical Storm|the album|Tropical Storm (album){{!}}''Tropical Storm'' (album)}}
{{anchor|Tropical Storm}}{{anchor|tropical storm}} A '''tropical storm''' is an organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds between {{convert|34|kn|km/h}} and {{convert|64|kn|km/h}}. At this point, the distinctive cyclonic shape starts to develop, although an eye is not usually present. Government weather services first assign names to systems that reach this intensity (thus the term ''named storm'').&lt;ref name="NOAA preparedness"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]]|date=September 2006|title=Hurricanes&amp;nbsp;...

The shear force of winds can blow off shingles, and air borne objects can cause damage to power lines, roofing and siding. More dangerous is the heavy rainfall causing inland flooding.&lt;ref name="NWS Storm Damage Centre"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://stormdamagecenter.org/tropical-storms.php |title=Storm Damage Center |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105161814/https://stormdamagecenter.org/tropical-storms.php |archivedate=November 5, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hurricane or typhoon====
{{main|Atlantic hurricane|Pacific hurricane|typhoon}}
{{anchor|Hurricane}}{{anchor|Typhoon}}{{anchor|hurricane}}{{anchor|typhoon}}A '''hurricane''' or '''typhoon''' (sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone, as opposed to a depression or storm) is a system with sustained winds of at least {{convert|64|kn|mph km/h m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="NHC glossary"/&gt; A cyclone of this intensity tends to develop an eye, an area of relative calm (and lowest atmospheric pressure) at the center of circulation. The eye is often visible in satellite images as a small, circular, cloud-free spot. Surrounding the eye is the [[eyewall]], an area about {{convert|16|km|mi}} to {{convert|80|km|mi}} wide in which the strongest [[thunderstorm]]s and winds circulate around the storm's center. Maximum sustained winds in the strongest tropical cyclones have been estimated at about {{convert|95|m/s|kn mph km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ E1"/&gt;

===Origin of storm terms===
[[File:101.typhoon.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| [[Taipei 101]] endures a typhoon in 2005]]
The word ''typhoon'', which is used today in the Northwest Pacific, may be derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''ţūfān'' (طوفان) (similar in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]), or [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Typhon]]'' (Τυφών) (a monster from [[Greek mythology]] associated with storms) or Chinese "táifēng" (Simplified Chinese: 台风, Traditional Chinese: 颱風) (fēng = wind).&lt;ref name="Greek typhoon"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/typhoon|title=Typhoon|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''hurricane'', used in the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, is derived from ''huracán'', the Spanish word for the [[Island Caribs|Carib]]/[[Taino people|Taino]] storm god, [[Juracán]]. This god is believed by scholars to have been at least partially derived from the [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] creator god, [[Huracan]]. Huracan was believed by the Maya to have created dry land out of the turbulent waters. The god was also credited with later destroying the "wooden people", the precursors to the "[[Maya maize god|maize people]]", with an immense storm and flood.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ B4"&gt;{{cite web|author=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Research Division|title=Frequently Asked Questions: What is the origin of the word "hurricane"? |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=July 25, 2006 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mesoamermyth"&gt;{{cite book |author=Read, Kay Almere |author2= Jason González |year=2000 |title=Handbook of Mesoamerican Mythology |location=Oxford |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=1-85109-340-0 |page=200 |oclc=43879188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huracan is also the source of the word ''orcan'', another word for a particularly strong [[European windstorm]].&lt;ref name="mesoamermyth"/&gt;

===Numbering===
Almost all tropical and subtropical cyclones, even if not developed enough to be formally assigned names, are assigned numbers by the warning centers tasked with monitoring them.

For example, systems (tropical, subtropical, or even potential tropical) forming in the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins (in an official manner), as well as those originating in other areas (in an unofficial basis) serving [[United States]] government interests (both civilian and military), are assigned ''tropical cyclone numbers'' (or ''TC numbers'' for short) by the [[National Hurricane Center]], the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]], and the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]. A TC number is a two-digit number (starting each year/season with "01" and running upwards) followed by (except for the North Atlantic basin) a suffix letter corresponding to the basin of origin (like "E" for Eastern Pacific, "C" for Central Pacific, and "W" for Western Pacific);&lt;ref name="OFCM NHOP"&gt;{{cite report|author=Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research|url=http://www.ofcm.gov/publications/nhop/FCM-P12-2017.pdf|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|title=National Hurricane Operations Plan|date=May 2017|pages=26–28|format=PDF|accessdate=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number is often spelled-out in English (like "ONE", sometimes appended with a hyphen and the basin suffix as in "ONE-E") for the purpose of generating a placeholder name for a (sub)tropical depression or an otherwise yet-unnamed storm (especially in JTWC-tracked areas where differences in wind scales result in one agency upgrading the system to a storm without the other following suit).

Examples of TC numbers are ''PTC 08'' for a North Atlantic potential tropical cyclone ''EIGHT'', ''TD 21E'' for an East Pacific tropical depression ''TWENTYONE-E'', and ''SD 03C'' for a Central Pacific subtropical depression ''THREE-C''. TC numbers are hard-limited to a maximum of "49" by the [[Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System]]; however, the NHC and the CPHC usually limit this to "30";&lt;ref name="ATCF Readme"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael J. Brennan, [[National Hurricane Center]]|url=http://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/README|title=Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) Data Files / Text Files|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2017-07-03|accessdate=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also, TC numbers are not recycled until the next year/season. This numbering system is similar to that used for [[Invest (meteorology)|invests]], except invests are numbered from "90" to "99" (which are rotated and recycled within the same year/season) and explicitly specify suffix "L" for North Atlantic systems.

===Naming===
{{Main|Tropical cyclone naming|History of tropical cyclone naming}}
The practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years, with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start of naming.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Weather and Climate|url=http://www.metsoc.org.nz/system/files/journals/10/1/1990_101_24-26_rsmith.pdf|author=Smith, Ray|year=1990|volume=10|title=What's in a Name?|publisher=The Meteorological Society of New Zealand|issue=1|pages=24–26|archivedate=November 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129194207/http://www.metsoc.org.nz/system/files/journals/10/1/1990_101_24-26_rsmith.pdf|access-date=August 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahina"&gt;{{cite web|title=They Called the Wind Mahina: The History of Naming Cyclones|url=ftp://ftp.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/pub/dorst/Mahina.pptx|work=Hurricane Research Division, Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|author=Dorst, Neal M|page=Slides 8–72|date=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems in a brief form, that is readily understood and recognized by the public.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahina"/&gt; The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the [[Queensland Government]] Meteorologist [[Clement Wragge]] who named systems between 1887 and 1907.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahina"/&gt; This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived in the latter part of [[World War II]] for the Western Pacific.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahina"/&gt; Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the [[Tropical cyclone basins|North and South Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins]] as well as the [[Tropical cyclone basins|Australian region]] and [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name="Mahina"/&gt;

At present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts, watches, and warnings.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; Since the systems can last a week or longer and more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the same time, the names are thought to reduce the confusion about what storm is being described.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; Names are assigned in order from predetermined [[Lists of tropical cyclone names|lists]] with one, three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than {{convert|65|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} depending on which basin it originates.&lt;ref name="ATL/EPAC TCOP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIO TCOP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SWIO TCOP"/&gt; However, standards vary from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the Western Pacific, while tropical cyclones have to have a significant amount of [[gale]]-force winds occurring around the center before they are named within the [[Southern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="SWIO TCOP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPAC TCOP"/&gt; The names of significant tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with another name.&lt;ref name="ATL/EPAC TCOP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WPAC TCOP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPAC TCOP"/&gt;

While the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995, there is no obvious global trend; the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;10 (Between 77 and 97 tropical cyclones annually). However, the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere,&lt;ref name="Landsea Trends"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1128448| pmid = 16873634| title = CLIMATE CHANGE: Can We Detect Trends in Extreme Tropical Cyclones?| journal = Science| volume = 313| issue = 5786| pages = 452–4| year = 2006| last1 = Landsea | first1 = C.

J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of that, there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. [[Kerry Emanuel]] stated, "Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past 30&amp;nbsp;years or so, corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime."&lt;ref name="EmanuelHomepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/anthro2.htm|author=[[Kerry Emanuel|Emanuel, Kerry]]|title=Anthropogenic Effects on Tropical Cyclone Activity|accessdate=March 30, 2006|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially, as evidenced by the fact that five of the ten [[List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes#Listed by cost (United States only)|most expensive storms in United States history]] have occurred since 1990. According to the [[World Meteorological Organization]], "recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has been caused largely by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions."&lt;ref name="WMO-IWTC"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Summary Statement on Tropical Cyclones and Climate Change |publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]] |date=December 4, 2006 |url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/press_releases/2006/pdf/iwtc_summary.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=May 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325193707/http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/press_releases/2006/pdf/iwtc_summary.pdf |archivedate=March 25, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Roger A. Pielke Jr.|Pielke]] ''et al.'' (2008) normalized mainland US hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996–2005 was the second most damaging among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs.

Often in part because of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.&lt;ref name="BOM TC Guide 1.3"&gt;{{cite web|work=Global Guide to Tropical Cyclone Forecasting |publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]] |url=http://www.cawcr.gov.au/publications/BMRC_archive/tcguide/ch1/ch1_3.htm |title=1.3: A Global Climatology |author=Neumann, Charles J |accessdate=November 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601213525/http://www.cawcr.gov.au/publications/BMRC_archive/tcguide/ch1/ch1_3.htm |archivedate=June 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50–70&amp;nbsp;year cycle, also known as the [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]]. Nyberg ''et al.'' reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging 3–5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40–60&amp;nbsp;years, and six other averaging 1.5–2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10–20&amp;nbsp;years. These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Throughout, a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1–2 per year.&lt;ref name="Nyberg2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malmgren|first=J.|author2=Winter, A.|author3= Malmgren, B.

Although more common since 1995, few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 1970–94.&lt;ref name="RMS activity"&gt;{{cite web|author=Risk Management Solutions |url=http://www.rms.com/Publications/60HUActivityRates_whitepaper.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. and Caribbean Hurricane Activity Rates. |date=March 2006 |accessdate=November 30, 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614035204/http://www.rms.com/Publications/60HUActivityRates_whitepaper.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960, including many major [[New England]] hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933]], a record only recently exceeded in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870–99. During the [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887 season]], 19 tropical storms formed, of which a record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an [[1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane|1821 storm]] that made a direct hit on [[New York City]]. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4]] in strength.&lt;ref name="Columbia CCSR"&gt;{{cite web|author=Center for Climate Systems Research |title=Hurricanes, Sea Level Rise, and New York City |url=http://www.ccsr.columbia.edu/information/hurricanes/ |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |accessdate=November 29, 2006 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070102092224/http://www.ccsr.columbia.edu/information/hurricanes/ |archivedate=January 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic basin. Before the satellite era began in 1960, tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one, a ship reported a voyage through the storm, or a storm hit land in a populated area.&lt;ref name="BOM TC Guide 1.3"/&gt;

Proxy records based on [[paleotempestology|paleotempestological]] research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia.&lt;ref name="Liu1999"&gt;{{cite conference|first=Kam-biu|last=Liu|title=Millennial-scale variability in catastrophic hurricane landfalls along the Gulf of Mexico coast|conference=23rd Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology|publisher=American Meteorological Society|year=1999|location=Dallas, Texas, United States of America|pages=374–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiuFearn2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Kam-biu|author2=Fearn, Miriam L.|year=2000|title=Reconstruction of Prehistoric Landfall Frequencies of Catastrophic Hurricanes in Northwestern Florida from Lake Sediment Records|journal=Quaternary Research|volume=54|issue=2|pages=238–245|doi=10.1006/qres.2000.2166|bibcode = 2000QuRes..54..238L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. This millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the [[Azores High]],&lt;ref name="LiuFearn2000"/&gt; which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the [[North Atlantic oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elsner |first=James B.|author2=Liu, Kam-biu|author3= Kocher, Bethany|year=2000|title=Spatial Variations in Major U.S. Hurricane Activity: Statistics and a Physical Mechanism |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=13|issue=13|pages=2293–2305|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(2000)013&lt;2293:SVIMUS&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 2000JCli...13.2293E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in [[Haiti]] around 3200 [[Radiocarbon dating|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]] years BP,&lt;ref name="Higuera-Gundy1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higuera-Gundy |first=Antonia|year=1999 |title=A 10,300 &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C yr Record of Climate and Vegetation Change from Haiti |journal=Quaternary Research|volume=52|issue=2|pages=159–170 |doi=10.1006/qres.1999.2062|bibcode = 1999QuRes..52..159H|author2= Brenner, Mark|last3=Hodell|first3=David A.|last4=Curtis|first4=Jason H. |last5=Leyden |first5=Barbara W.|last6=Binford|first6=Michael W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a change towards more humid conditions in the [[Great Plains]] during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the [[Mississippi Valley]] through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in [[Cape Cod]] suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000&amp;nbsp;years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.

===Climate change===
{{Main|Tropical cyclones and climate change}}
The 2007 [[IPCC]] report noted many observed changes in the climate, including atmospheric composition, global average temperatures, ocean conditions, and others. The report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict. In addition, the report considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century, and declared it more likely than not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.&lt;ref name="ipcc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alley, Richard|year=2007|title=Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=February 23, 2007|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/contents.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P.J. Webster and others published in 2005 an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' examining the "changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity" over the past 35&amp;nbsp;years, the period when satellite data has been available. Their main finding was although the number of cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding the north [[Atlantic Ocean]], there was a great increase in the number and proportion of very strong cyclones.&lt;ref name="Webster et al. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Webster, P.

According to 2006 studies by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], "the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earth's climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere".&lt;ref name="GFDL warming"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] |url=http://www.oar.noaa.gov/spotlite/archive/spot_gfdl.html |title=Global Warming and Hurricanes |accessdate=November 29, 2006 |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315160002/http://www.oar.noaa.gov/spotlite/archive/spot_gfdl.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies published since 2008, by [[Kerry Emanuel]] from MIT, indicate that [[global warming]] is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=ftp://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/Haurwitz_2008.pdf |title=The Hurricane-Climate Connection | last=Emanuel |first=Kerry |year=2008 |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]] |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=ES10–ES20 |doi=10.1175/BAMS-89-5-Emanuel |accessdate=January 19, 2009 |quote=The weight of available evidence suggests that multidecadal variability of hurricane season tropical Atlantic SST and Northern Hemispheric surface temperature... is controlled mostly by time-varying radiative forcing owing to solar variability, major volcanic eruptions, and anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and greenhouse gases, though the response to this forcing may be modulated by natural modes of variability. |bibcode = 2008BAMS...89S..10E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Kerry Emanuel stated that potential hurricane destructiveness, a measure combining hurricane strength, duration, and frequency, "is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including [[climate oscillation|multidecadal oscillations]] in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming". Emanuel predicted "a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century".&lt;ref name="Nature Emanuel 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |url=ftp://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/NATURE03906.pdf |authorlink=Kerry Emanuel |journal=[[Nature (journal) |Nature]] |volume=436 |issue=7051 |pages=686–688 |access-date=March 20, 2006 |title=Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years |doi=10.1038/nature03906 |year=2005 |pmid=16056221 |bibcode=2005Natur.436..686E |author1=Emanuel |first1=K}}

In addition to tropical cyclones, there are two other classes of cyclones within the spectrum of cyclone types.

==Popular culture==

The aquatic to terrestrial transition of [[vertebrate]] organisms occurred in the late [[Devonian]] era and was an important step in the evolutionary history of modern land vertebrates. The transition allowed animals to escape [[Competition (biology)|competitive pressure]] from the water and explore [[ecological niche|niche]] opportunities on land. Fossils from this period have allowed scientists to identify some of the species that existed during this transition, such as [[Tiktaalik]]&lt;ref name=Tiktaalik&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/Q&amp;A.html#Q5 |title=Tiktaalik roseae: Q&amp;A Session with Neil Shubin |publisher=Tiktaalik.uchicago.edu |date=April 2006 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Acanthostega]].&lt;ref name=Clack&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clack|first1=Jennifer A.|title=Gaining ground : the origin and evolution of tetrapods|date=2012|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-35675-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these species were also the first to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial over aquatic life, such as neck mobility and hindlimb locomotion.

The late Devonian vertebrate transition was preceded by the plant and invertebrate terrestrial invasion. These invasions allowed for the appropriate niche development that would ultimately facilitate the vertebrate invasion. While the late Devonian event was the first land invasion by vertebrate organisms, aquatic species have continued to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial life (and vice versa) from the late Devonian to the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref name=Symposium&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashley-Ross|first1=M.

== Overview of transition ==
The vertebrate species that were important to the initial water to land transition can be qualified as being in one of five groups: [[sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygian fishes]], prototetrapods, aquatic tetrapods, true tetrapods, and terrestrial tetrapods. Many morphological changes occurred throughout this transition. Mechanical support structures changed from fins to limbs, the method of locomotion changed from swimming to walking, respiratory structures changed from gills to lungs, feeding mechanisms changed from suction feeding to biting, and mode of reproduction changed from larval development to metamorphosis.&lt;ref name=Greatest&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=JA|last2=Gordon|first2=MS|title=The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology|date=September–October 2004|volume=77|issue=5|pages=700–719|doi=10.1086/425183|pmid=15547790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary timeline ==

[[Lungfish]] appeared approximately 400 million years ago. It is a species that endured rapid evolution during the Devonian era, which became known as the dipnoan renaissance. The [[Acanthostega]] species, known as the fish with legs, is considered a [[tetrapod]] by structural findings but is postulated to have perhaps never left the aquatic environment. Its legs are not well-suited to support its weight. The bones of its forearm, the radius and ulna, are very thin at the wrist and also unable to support it on land. It also lacks a [[sacrum]] and strong ligaments at the hip, which would be integral to supporting the animal against gravity. In this sense, the species is considered a tetrapod but not one that has adapted well enough to walk on land. Furthermore, its gill bars have a supportive brace characterized for use as an underwater ear because it can pick up noise vibrations through the water. Tetrapods that adapted to terrestrial living adapted these gill bones to pick up sounds through air, and they later became the middle ear bones seen in mammalian tetrapods. [[Ichthyostega]], on the other hand, is considered to be a fully terrestrial tetrapod that perhaps depended on water for its aquatic young. Comparisons between the skeletal features of Acanthostega and Ichthyostega reveal that they had different habits. Acanthostega is likely exclusive to an aquatic environment, while Ichthyostega is progressed in the aquatic to terrestrial transition by living dominantly on the shores.&lt;ref name=Clack/&gt;

An evolutionary timeline of the late Devonian vertebrate terrestrial invasion demonstrates the changes that took place. A group of fish from the [[Givetian]] stage began developing limbs, and eventually evolved into aquatic tetrapods in the [[Famennian]] stage. Pederpes, Westlothiana, Protogyrinus, and Crassigyrinus descended from these species into the carboniferous period and were the first land vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Greatest/&gt;

A particularly important transitional species is one known as Tiktaalik. It has a fin, but the fin has bones within it that are similar to mammalian tetrapods. It has an upper arm bone, a lower arm bone, forearm bones, a wrist, and fingerlike projections. Essentially, it is a fin that can support the animal. Similarly, it also has a neck  that allows independent head movement from the body. Its ribs are also able to support the body in gravity. Its skeletal features exhibit its ability as a fish that can live in shallow water and also venture onto land.&lt;ref name=Tiktaalik/&gt;

== Driving factors ==
It took many millions of years for vertebrates to transition out of water onto land. During this time, both the competitive pressures that would push species out of the water and the  [[Ecological niche|niche]] occupation incentives that would pull species onto land were slowly building. The culmination of these driving factors are what ultimately facilitated the vertebrate transition.

=== Evolutionary pushes ===
Scientists believe that a long period of time where biotic and abiotic factors in the aquatic environment were unfavourable to certain aquatic organisms is what pushed their transition to shallower waters. Some of these push factors are environmental [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], unfavourable aquatic temperatures, and increased salinity. Other constantly present factors such as predation, competition, waterborne diseases and parasites also contributed to the transition.&lt;ref name=Greatest/&gt;

A theory put forth by [[Joseph Barrell]] possibly helps explain what may have initiated these push factors to become relevant in the late Devonian. The extensive oxidized sediments that were present in Europe and North America during the late Devonian are evidence of severe droughts during this time. These droughts would cause small ponds and lakes to dry out, forcing certain aquatic organisms to move on land to find other bodies of water. Natural selection on these organisms eventually led to the evolution of the first terrestrial vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Clack/&gt;

=== Evolutionary pulls ===
The pull factors were secondary to the push factors, and only became significant once the pressures to leave the aquatic environment became significant. These were largely the niches and opportunities that were available for exploitation in the terrestrial environment, and include higher environmental oxygen partial pressures, favourable temperatures, and the lack of competitors and predators on land. The plants and invertebrates that had preceded the vertebrate invasion also provided opportunities in the form of abundant prey and lack of predators.&lt;ref name=Greatest/&gt;

== Barriers to transition ==
There were many challenges that the first land vertebrates faced. These challenges allowed for rapid natural selection and niche domination, resulting in an adaptive radiation that produced many different vertebrate land species in a relatively short period of time.

=== Sensory systems ===
Depending on the water depth at which a species lives, the visual perception of many aquatic species is better suited to darker environments than those on land. Similarly, hearing in aquatic organisms is better optimized for sounds underwater, where the speed and amplitude of sound is greater than in air.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

=== Homeostasis ===
[[Homeostasis]] was almost definitely a challenge for land invading vertebrates. [[Gas exchange]] and [[water balance]] are highly different in water and in air. Homeostasis mechanisms suitable for a terrestrial environment may have been necessary to develop before these organisms invaded land.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

=== Anatomy ===

The primary anatomical barrier is the development of lungs for proper gas exchange, however other anatomical barriers also exist. The stressors of the musculoskeletal system are different in air than they are in water, and the muscles and bones must be strong enough to withstand the increased effects of gravity on land.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

=== Behaviour ===

Many behaviours, such as reproduction, are specifically optimized to a wet environment. Navigation and locomotion are also highly different in aquatic environments compared to terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

== Notable adaptations ==

=== Placement of eyes on head ===

The ancestral species of tetrapods that lived entirely in water had tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards to maximize visibility for predators and prey in the aquatic environment. As the ancestors of early tetrapods started inhabiting shallower waters, these species had flatter skulls with eyes at the tops of their heads, which made it possible to spot food above them. Once the tetrapods transitioned onto land, the lineages evolved to have tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards again. This allowed them to navigate through the terrestrial environment and look for predators and prey.&lt;ref name=Berkely&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_04 |title=The origin of tetrapods |publisher=Evolution.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Head and neck mobility ===

Fish do not have necks, so the head is directly connected to the shoulders. In contrast, land animals use necks to move their heads so they can look down to see the food on the ground. The greater the mobility of the neck, the more visibility the land animal has. As lineages moved from completely aquatic environments to shallower waters and land, they gradually evolved vertebral columns that increased neck mobility. The first neck vertebra that evolved permitted the animals to have flexion and extension of the head so that they can see up and down. The second neck vertebra evolved to allow rotation of the neck for moving the head left and right. As tetrapod species continued to evolve on land, adaptations included seven or more vertebrae, allowing increasing neck mobility.&lt;ref name=Berkely/&gt;

=== Fused sacrum ===

The sacrum connects the pelvis and hindlimbs and is useful for motion on land. The aquatic ancestors of tetrapods did not have a sacrum, so it was speculated to have evolved for locomotive function exclusive to terrestrial environments. However, the Acanthostega species is one of the earliest lineages to have a sacrum, even though it is a fully aquatic species. Once species moved onto land, the trait was adapted for terrestrial locomotion support, which is evidenced by additional vertebrae fusing similarly to permit additional support. This is an example of exaptation, where a trait performs a function that did not arise through natural selection for its current use.&lt;ref name=Berkely/&gt;

=== Lost adaptations ===

As the lineages evolved to adapt to terrestrial environments, many lost traits that were better suited for the aquatic environment. Many lost their gills, which were only useful for obtaining oxygen in water. Their tail fins became smaller. They lost the [[lateral line]] system, a network of canals along the skull and jaw that are sensitive to vibration, which does not work outside of an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=Berkely/&gt;

== Future invasions ==

For successful land invasion, the species had several pre-adaptations like air-breathing and limb-based locomotion. Aspects such as reproduction and swallowing, however, have bound these species to the aquatic environment. These pre-adaptations have allowed vertebrates to venture onto land hundreds of times, but were not able to accomplish the same degree of prolific radiation into diverse terrestrial species.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt; To understand the potential of future invasions, studies must evaluate the models of evolutionary steps taken in past invasions. The commonalities to current and future invasions may then be elucidated to predict the effects of environmental changes.

A '''volcanic plug''', also called a '''volcanic neck''' or '''lava neck''', is a [[volcano|volcanic]] object created when [[magma]] hardens within a [[Volcanic vent|vent]] on an active volcano. When present, a plug can cause an extreme build-up of [[pressure]] if rising [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile]]-charged [[magma]] is trapped beneath it, and this can sometimes lead to an explosive eruption. [[Glaciation|Glacial]] erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side, while a long slope of material remains on the opposite side. Such landforms are called [[crag and tail]]. If a plug is preserved, [[erosion]] may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion-resistant plug remains, producing a distinctive upstanding landform.

An example of two volcanic plugs can be found at the [[Pitons]], in [[Saint Lucia]], as they rise abruptly out of the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]].

==Examples of volcanic plugs==

===Africa===
Near the village of [[Rhumsiki]] in the [[Far North Region (Cameroon)|Far North Province]] of [[Cameroon]], Kapsiki Peak is an example of a volcanic plug and is one of the most photographed parts of the [[Mandara Mountains]]. Spectacular volcanic plugs are present in the center of [[La Gomera]] island in the [[Canary Islands]] archipelago, within the [[Garajonay National Park]].

===Europe===
[[Image:Rocher St Michel à Aiguilhe.JPG|thumb|140px|right|[[Saint Michel d'Aiguilhe]] chapel, on top of a volcanic plug in [[Le Puy-en-Velay]], France.]]

[[Borgarvirki]] is a volcanic plug located in north Iceland.

A volcanic plug is situated in the town of [[Motta Sant'Anastasia]] in Italy.

The volcanic plug rises about {{convert|85|m}} above the surroundings. Another building on a volcanic plug is the 14th century [[Trosky Castle]] in the [[Czech Republic]].

[[Strombolicchio]], the northernmost of the [[Aeolian Islands]], and [[Rockall]], a small, uninhabited, remote [[islet]] in the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], are also volcanic plugs.

In the [[United Kingdom]], two examples of a building on a volcanic plug are the [[Edinburgh Castle|Castle Rock]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and [[Deganwy Castle]], [[Wales]]. The [[Law, Dundee]], [[Ailsa Craig]], [[Bass Rock]], [[North Berwick Law]] and [[Dumgoyne]] hill are other examples of volcanic plugs located in [[Scotland]]. There are over 30 volcanic plugs in [[Northern Ireland]], including [[Slemish]] in [[Ballymena]], [[Tievebulliagh]], [[Scawt Hill]], [[Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge|Carrickarede]], [[Scrabo Tower|Scrabo]] and [[Slieve Gallion]].&lt;ref name="hmso"&gt;Wilson, H E et al (1986) Geological Survey of Northern Ireland, HMSO&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America and the Caribbean ===
[[File:Pitonpair.JPG|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The [[Pitons]] of [[Saint Lucia]] with Gros Piton in the foreground]]
There are several volcanic plugs in the [[United States]], including [[Morro Rock]] in [[California]] and [[Shiprock]] in [[New Mexico]]. [[Devils Tower]] in [[Wyoming]] and [[Little Devils Postpile]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], California, are also believed to be volcanic plugs by many [[geologist]]s.

In [[Canada]], the [[Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province]] gives rise to several confirmed and suspected plugs. Chief among these is [[Castle Rock (volcano)|Castle Rock]], located in [[British Columbia]], which last erupted during the [[Pleistocene]].

The southern coast of [[Saint Lucia]] is dominated by the iconic [[Pitons]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]. The twin peaks, Gros Piton and Petit Piton, steeply rise more than {{convert|770|m|ft}} above the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]].

===Oceania===
[[Image:Lion Rock, from North Piha.jpg|thumb|right|250px|New Zealand's Lion Rock was fortifiedby the  local [[Māori people|Maori]] as a refuge.]]
There are several volcanic plugs in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], including:

* the Pinnacles in the [[Coromandel Peninsula]]
* [[Bream Head]] in [[Northland Region | Northland]]
* Paritutu and the adjacent [[Sugar Loaf Islands]] in [[Taranaki]]
* St. Paul's Rock at [[Whangaroa Harbour]]
* [[Piha]]'s Lion Rock, which hosted a fortified [[Māori people|Maori]] [[Pā (Māori)|pa]].

In New Zealand's [[South Island]], [[Ōnawe Peninsula]] on [[Banks Peninsula]] is a prominent volcanic plug, and erosion of [[Saddle Hill (New Zealand)|Saddle Hill]] near [[Dunedin]] has also revealed a plug. Dunedin's [[Mount Cargill]] displays two plugs: its main summit and the subsidiary summit of Buttar's Peak.

In [[Australia]], the [[Stanley, Tasmania|Nut]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.discovertasmania.com/activities__and__attractions/popular_attractions/the_nut,_stanley |title= The Nut, Stanley |work= Discover Tasmania |publisher= [[Government of Tasmania]] |year= 2011 |accessdate= 30 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Table Cape]] in [[Tasmania]] are further examples along with [[Mount Warning]] in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:George Westinghouse.jpg|thumb|right|American entrepreneur and engineer [[George Westinghouse]] introduced a rival AC-based power distribution network in 1886.]]
The '''war of the currents''' (sometimes called '''battle of the currents''') was a series of events surrounding the introduction of competing electric power transmission systems in the late 1880s and early 1890s. It included commercial competition, a debate over electrical safety, and a media/[[propaganda]] campaign that grew out of it, with the main players being the [[direct current]] (DC)&amp;ndash;based [[Edison Electric Light Company]] and the [[alternating current]] (AC)&amp;ndash;based [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Company]]. It took place during the introduction and rapid expansion of the alternating current standard (already in use and advocated by several US and European companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/AC-PowerHistory.html |title=AC Power History and Timeline |website=[[Edison Tech Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and its eventual adoption over the direct current distribution system. Three aspects have been conflated into the "war": open competition involving large electric companies and a [[format war]] involving their developing systems, a general fear in the public's mind of death by accidental electrocution from high voltage AC leading to a debate over its safety and regulation, and the debate and behind-the-scene maneuvers associated with the introduction of the [[electric chair]].{{sfnp|Klein|2010}}

In 1886 [[George Westinghouse]] began building an alternating current system that used a [[transformer]] to step up voltage for long-distance transmission and then stepped it back down for indoor lighting, a more efficient and less expensive system that directly competed for the market the Edison system was designed to serve. As many other electric companies joined in and the use of AC spread rapidly, Edison's company made claims in early 1888 that alternating current was hazardous and inferior to the patented direct current system.

In the spring of 1888, a media furor arose over a series of deaths caused by pole-mounted high-voltage AC lines in New York City and around the country, attributed to the greed and callousness of the local AC-based lighting companies. In June of that year a New York electrical engineer named [[Harold P. Brown]] came to prominence as an opponent of the use of alternating current, claiming the AC-based lighting companies were putting the public at risk using high-voltages and installing it in a slipshod manner. Brown's campaign immediately gained the assistance of Edison and his company, aiding Brown in his public electrocution of animals with AC, trying to claim that AC was more dangerous than DC. Historians noted, and documents from the period seem to show, that there grew to be collusion between the Edison company and Brown in their parallel attempts to limit the use of AC: assisting Brown's attempt to push through legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system), providing technical assistance in Brown's tests to show AC would be the best current to power the new [[electric chair]], and colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.

This was a period of industrial consolidation and by 1890 over a dozen electric companies had merged down to three; Edison (now Edison General Electric), Thomson-Houston, and Westinghouse. By the early 1890s the latter two were generating profits far in advance of the DC-based Edison company. During this period Thomas Edison left the electric power business and the company he founded was beginning to add AC technology to its system. Edison Electric's institutional opposition to alternating current came to an end in 1892 when they merged with what had become their biggest competitor, the Thomson-Houston company, a merger that put the managers of Thomson-Houston in control of the new company, now called [[General Electric]]. The merger of the Edison company (along with its strong lighting patents) with Thomson-Houston (and its AC patents) created a company that now controlled three quarters of the US electrical business.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}}{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28–29}} Westinghouse won the bid to supply electrical power for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893 and won the first contract at Niagara Falls later that year. Their lead in the field quickly diminished with later contracts being split with General Electric.

There were several technical factors that drove the adoption of alternating-current over direct-current. The direct-current system generated and distributed electrical power at the same voltage as used by the customer's lamps and motors. This required the use of large, costly distribution wires and forced generating plants to be near the loads. With the development of a practical [[transformer]], alternating-current power could be sent long distances over relatively small wires at a conveniently high voltage, then reduced in voltage to that used by a customer. Alternating-current generating stations could be larger, more efficient, and the distribution wires were relatively less costly.

The lower cost of AC power distribution prevailed, though DC systems persisted in some urban areas throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Con Edison Press Release"&gt;{{cite web |title=A/C But No D/C: Last Con Edison Direct Current Customer is History |url=http://www.coned.com/newsroom/news/pr20071115.asp |website=[[Con Edison]] |date=November 14, 2007 |accessdate=September 29, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205153252/http://www.coned.com/newsroom/news/pr20071115.asp |archivedate=February 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While DC power is not used generally for the transmission of energy from power plants into homes as Edison and others intended, it is still common when distances are small or when isolation between different AC systems is needed, known as [[High-voltage direct current|High-Voltage DC (HVDC)]]. Low voltage DC is used widely in modern electronic devices, including computers, telephones, and automotive systems; in contrast, most electric motors are powered by line voltage AC.

[[File:Brush Company arc light madison square new york 1882.png|thumbnail|right|Very bright arc lighting (such as this one in 1882 New York) could only be used outdoors or in large indoor spaces where they could be mounted high out of people's sight line.]]

The war of the currents grew out of the development of two lighting systems; [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] running on alternating current and [[incandescent lamp|incandescent lighting]] running on direct current.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2012|p=86}} Both were supplanting [[gas lighting]] systems, with arc lighting taking over large area/street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential lighting.

===Arc lighting===
The first type of widely used electric light was the [[arc lamp]]. These lamps had been around for most of the 19th century but by the late 1870s were beginning to be installed in cities in large scale systems powered by central generating plants. Arc lighting systems were extremely brilliant and capable of lighting whole streets, factory yards, or the interior of large buildings. They needed high voltages (above 3,000 volts) and some ran better on alternating current.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=47}} Alternating current had been under development for a while in Europe with contributions being made to the field by [[Guillaume Duchenne]] (1850s), the dynamo work of [[Zénobe Gramme]], [[Ganz Works]] (1870s), [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]] (1880s), [[Lucien Gaulard]], and [[Galileo Ferraris]]. The high voltages allowed a central generating station to supply a large area, up to {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} long circuits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers |publisher=[[Society of Telegraph Engineers]] |volume=IX |date=March 24, 1880 |title=Notes on the Jablochkoff System of Electric Lighting |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lww4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 |issue=32 |page=143 |accessdate=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the capacity of a wire is proportional to the square of the current traveling on it, each doubling of the voltage allowed the same size cable to transmit the same amount of power four times the distance. 1880 saw the installation of large-scale arc lighting systems in several US cities including a central station set up by the [[Brush Electric Company]] in December 1880 to supply a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} length of Broadway in New York City with a 3,500&amp;ndash;volt demonstration arc lighting system.&lt;ref name=huji&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/brush.html |title=Charles Francis Brush |website=[[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224192642/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/brush.html |archivedate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electricmuseum.com/?p=434 |title=Brush Arc Lamps |website=Electric Museum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantages of arc lighting were: it was maintenance intensive, buzzed, flickered, constituted a fire hazard, was really only suitable for outdoor lighting, and, at the high voltages used, was dangerous to work with.&lt;ref name="Center"/&gt;

===Edison's DC company===
[[File:Laying the electrical Tubes electric lines under street Edison Pearl Street Utility June 21 1882 Harpers Weekly - detail.png|thumb|left|Workmen burying Edison DC power lines under the streets in New York City in 1882. This costly practice played to Edison's favor in public perceptions after several deaths were caused by overhead high voltage AC lines.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011}}]]
In 1878 inventor Thomas Edison saw a market for a system that could bring electric lighting directly into a customer's business or home, a niche not served by arc lighting systems.{{sfnp|Rockman|2004|p=131}} By 1882 the investor-owned utility [[Edison Illuminating Company]] was established in New York City. Edison designed his "utility" to compete with the then established gas lighting utilities, basing it on a relatively low 110 volt direct current supply to power a high resistance incandescent lamp he had invented for the system. Edison direct current systems would be sold to cities throughout the United States, making it a standard with Edison controlling all technical development and holding all the key patents.{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=80}} Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day. Direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct-current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. Direct current also worked well with electric motors, an advantage DC held throughout the 1880s. The primary drawback with the Edison direct current system was that it ran at 110 volts from generation to its final destination giving it a relatively short useful transmission range: to keep the size of the expensive copper conductors down generating plants had to be situated in the middle of population centers and could only supply customers less than a mile from the plant.

Starting in the 1880s alternating current gained its key advantage over direct current with the development of functional [[transformer]]s that allowed the voltage to be "stepped up" to much higher transmission voltages and then dropped down to a lower end user voltage for business and residential use.{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=81}} Using [[induction coil]]s to transfer power between electrical circuits had been around for 40 years with [[Pavel Yablochkov]] using them in his lighting system in 1876 and [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] using the principle to create a "step down" transformer in 1882, but the design was not very efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/Transformers.html |title=History of Transformers |year=2014 |website=Edison Tech Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype of the high efficiency, closed core shunt connection [[transformer]] was made by the Hungarian "Z.B.D." team (composed of [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]]) at [[Ganz Works]] in 1884.&lt;ref name="Halacsy (1961)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halacsy |first1=A.

===Westinghouse enters the AC business===
[[File:Westinghouse Electric Company (1888 catalogue).jpg|thumb|right|Westinghouse Electric Company 1888 catalog advertising their "Alternating System".]]
In North America the inventor and [[entrepreneur]] [[George Westinghouse]] entered the electric lighting business in 1884 when he started to develop a DC system and hired [[William Stanley, Jr.]] to work on it. Westinghouse became aware of the new European transformer based AC systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal ''Engineering''.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=42}} He grasped that AC combined with transformers meant greater [[economies of scale]] could be achieved with large centralized power plants transmitting stepped up voltage very long distances to be used in arc lighting as well lower voltage home and commercial incandescent lighting supplied via a "step down" transformer at the other end. Westinghouse saw a way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W. Bernard |last=Carlson |title=Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2013 |page=89 |isbn=978-0-69116-561-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edison DC system of centralized DC plants with their short transmission range also meant there was a patchwork of un-supplied customers between Edison's plants that Westinghouse could easily supply with AC power. 
[[File:William-Stanley jr.jpg|thumbnail|left|William Stanley developed the first practical AC transformer for Westinghouse and helped build the first AC systems.]]
Westinghouse purchased the US patents rights to the Gaulard-Gibbs transformer and imported several of those as well as [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] AC [[generator (device)|generator]]s to begin experimenting with an AC-based lighting system in [[Pittsburgh]]. William Stanley used the Gaulard-Gibbs design and designs from the ZBD Transformer to develop the first practical transformer. The [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] was formed at the beginning of 1886. In March 1886 Stanley, with Westinghouse's backing, installed the first multiple-voltage AC power system, a demonstration incandescent lighting system, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Barrington Historical Society'', Great Barrington, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Expanded to the point where it could light 23 businesses along main street with very little power loss over 4000 feet, the system used transformers to step 500 AC volts at the street down to 100 volts to power incandescent lamps at each location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/GreatBarrington.html |title=The Great Barrington Electrification, 1886 |year=2014 |website=Edison Tech Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; By fall of 1886 Westinghouse, Stanley, and [[Oliver B. Shallenberger]] had built the first commercial AC power system in the US in [[Buffalo, New York]].

===The spread of AC===
By the end of 1887 Westinghouse had 68 alternating current power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] of Lynn, Massachusetts (another competitor offering AC- and DC-based systems) had built 22 power stations.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011}} Thomson-Houston was expanding their business while trying to avoid patent conflicts with Westinghouse, arranging deals such as coming to agreements over lighting company territory, paying a royalty to use the Stanley AC transformer patent, and allowing Westinghouse to use their [[William E. Sawyer|Sawyer-Man]] incandescent bulb patent. Besides Thomson-Houston and Brush there were other competitors at the time included the [[United States Illuminating Company]] and the [[Waterhouse Electric Light Company]]. All of the companies had their own electric power systems, arc lighting systems, and even incandescent lamp designs for domestic lighting, leading to constant lawsuits and patent battles between themselves and with Edison.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2007|p=97}}

===Safety concerns===
[[File:Blizzard 1888 01.jpg|thumb|right|The myriad of telephone, telegraph, and power lines over the streets of New York City in a photo of the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]. An AC charged broken wire from the storm led to the electrocution of a boy that spring.]]
[[Elihu Thomson]] of Thomson-Houston was concerned about AC safety and put a great deal of effort into developing a lightning arrestor for high-tension power lines as well as a magnetic blowout switch that could shut the system down in a power surge, a safety feature the Westinghouse system did not have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. J. |last=Davis |title=Fleet Fire: Thomas Edison and the Pioneers of the Electric Revolution |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-61145-659-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson also worried about what would happen with the equipment after they sold it, assuming customers would follow a risky practice of installing as many lights and generators as they could get away with. He also thought the idea of using AC lighting in residential homes was too dangerous and had the company hold back on that type of installations until a safer transformer could be developed.{{sfnp|Higonnet|Landes|Rosovsky|1991|p=89}}

Due to the hazards presented by high voltage electrical lines most European cities and the city of Chicago in the US required them to be buried underground.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=137}} The City of New York did not require burying and had little in the way of regulation so by the end of 1887 the mishmash of overhead wires for telephone, telegraph, fire and burglar alarm systems in Manhattan were now mixed with haphazardly strung AC lighting system wires carrying up to 6000 volts.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}} [[Insulator (electricity)|Insulation]] on power lines was rudimentary, with one electrician referring to it as having as much value "as a molasses covered rag", and exposure to the elements was eroding it over time.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=137}} A third of the wires were simply abandoned by defunct companies and slowly deteriorating, causing damage to, and shorting out the other lines. Besides being an [[eyesore]], New Yorkers were annoyed when a large March 1888 snowstorm (the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]) tore down a large number of the lines, cutting off utilities in the city. This spurred on the idea of having these lines moved underground but it was stopped by a court injunction obtained by Western Union. Legislation to give all the utilities 90 days to move their lines into underground conduits supplied by the city was slowly making its way through the government but that was also being fought in court by the United States Illuminating Company, who claimed their AC lines were perfectly safe.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}}{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=139}}

===Edison's anti-AC stance===
As AC systems continued to spread into territories covered by DC systems, with the companies seeming to impinge on Edison patents including incandescent lighting, things got worse for the company. The price of copper was rising, adding to the expense of Edison's low voltage DC system, which required much heavier copper wires than higher voltage AC systems. Thomas Edison's own colleagues and engineers were trying to get him to consider AC. Edison's sales force was continually losing bids in municipalities that opted for cheaper AC systems{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=171}} and Edison Electric Illuminating Company president [[Edward Hibberd Johnson]] pointed out that if the company stuck with an all DC system it would not be able to do business in small towns and even mid-sized cities.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|pp=144–145}} Edison Electric had a patent option on the ZBD transformer, and a confidential in house report recommended that the company go AC, but Thomas Edison was against the idea.

After Westinghouse installed his first large scale system Edison wrote in a November 1886 private letter to Edward Johnson, "''Just as certain as death Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size, He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.''"{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=257}} Edison seemed to hold a view that the very high voltage used in AC systems was too dangerous and that it would take many years to develop a safe and workable system.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=146}} Safety and avoiding the bad press of killing a customer had been one of the goals in designing his DC system{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=174}} and he worried that a death caused by a mis-installed AC system could hold back the use of electricity in general,{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=146}} Edison's understanding of how AC systems worked seemed to be extensive. He noted what he saw as inefficiencies and that, combined with the capital costs in trying to finance very large generating plants, led him to believe there would be very little cost savings in an AC venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/0/0e/Carlson,_Competition_and_Consolidationin_the_Electrical_Manufacturing_Industry.pdf |first=W.

In February 1888 Edison Electric president Edward Johnson published an 84-page pamphlet titled "''A Warning from the Edison Electric Light Company''" and sent it to newspapers and to companies that had purchased or were planning to purchase electrical equipment from Edison competitors, including Westinghouse and Thomson Houston, stating that the competitors were infringing on Edison's incandescent light and other electrical patents.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=135}} It warned that purchasers could find themselves on the losing side of a court case if those patents were upheld. The pamphlet also emphasized the safety and efficiency of direct current, with the claim DC had not caused a single death, and included newspaper stories of accidental electrocutions caused by alternating current.

===Execution by electricity===
{{Further information|Electric chair}}
[[File:EXECUTION BY ELECTRICITY electric chair illustration Scientific American Volumes 58-59 June 30 1888.png|thumbnail|A June 30, 1888 [[Scientific American]] illustration of what the new [[electric chair]] might look like.]]

As arc lighting systems spread so did stories of how the high voltages involved were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|pp=171-173}} One such story in 1881 of drunken dock worker dying after he grabbed a large electric dynamo led Buffalo, New York dentist [[Alfred P. Southwick]] to seek some application for the curious phenomenon.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|pp=12–14}} He worked with local physician [[George Fell|George E. Fell]] and the Buffalo ASPCA, electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, to come up with a method to euthanize animals via electricity.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=21}} Southwick's 1882 and 1883 articles on how electrocution could be a replacement for [[hanging]], using a restraint similar to a dental chair (an [[electric chair]]){{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=24}} caught the attention of New York State politicians who, following a series of botched hangings, were desperately seeking an alternative. An 1886 commission appointed by New York governor [[David B. Hill]], which including Southwick, recommended in 1888 that executions be carried out by electricity using the electric chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01919.html |title=Southwick, Alfred Porter |website=American National Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were early indications that this new form of execution would become mixed up with the war of currents. As part of their [[fact-finding]], the commission sent out surveys to hundreds of experts on law and medicine, seeking their opinions, as well as contacting electrical experts, including Elihu Thomson and Thomas Edison.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|pp=54 &amp; 57–58}} In late 1887, when death penalty commission member Southwick contacted Edison, the inventor stated he was against capital punishment and wanted nothing to do with the matter. After further prompting, Edison hit out at his chief electric power competitor, George Westinghouse, in what may have been the opening salvo in the war of currents, stating in a December 1887 letter to Southwick that it would be best to use current generated by "'alternating machines,' manufactured principally in this country by Geo. Westinghouse".{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=420}} Soon after the execution by electricity bill passed in June 1888, Edison was asked by a New York government official what means would be the best way to implement the state's new form of execution. "Hire out your criminals as linemen to the New York electric lighting companies" was Edison's [[tongue in cheek]] answer.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsBernstein"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://simson.net/ref/1989/Edison_and_The_Chairt.pdf |last1=Reynolds |first1=Terry S. |last2=Bernstein |first2=Theodore |title=Edison and "The Chair" |magazine=Technology and Society |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |date=March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Thomas Alva Edison |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=87 |number=26 |date=December 27, 1902 |page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-AC backlash==
As the number of deaths attributed to high voltage lighting around the country continued to mount, a cluster of deaths in New York City in the spring of 1888 related to AC arc lighting set off a media frenzy against the "deadly arc-lighting current"{{sfnp|Stross|2007|pp=172}} and the seemingly callous lighting companies that used it.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=143}}{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=139–140}} These deaths included a 15-year-old boy killed on April 15 by a broken telegraph line that had energized with alternating current from a United States Illuminating Company line,&lt;ref group=fn&gt;broken during the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]] a month before,&lt;/ref&gt; a clerk killed two weeks later by an AC line, and a Brush Electric Company lineman killed in May by the AC line he was cutting. The press in New York seemed to switch overnight from stories about electric lights vs gas lighting to "death by wire" incidents, with each new report seeming to fan public resentment against high voltage AC and the dangerously tangled overhead electrical wires in the city.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}}{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=143}}

===Harold Brown's crusade===
[[File:Harold Pitney Brown engineer 1857 1932.png|thumbnail|Electrical engineer Harold Pitney Brown emerged in June 1888 as an anti-AC crusader.]]
At this point an electrical engineer named [[Harold P. Brown]], who at that time seemed to have no connection to the Edison company,{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=166}} sent a June 5, 1888 letter to the editor of the ''[[New York Post]]'' claiming the root of the problem was the alternating current (AC) system being used.  Brown argued that the AC system was inherently dangerous and "damnable" and asked why the "public must submit to constant danger from sudden death" just so utilities could use a cheaper AC system.

At the beginning of attacks on AC, Westinghouse, in a June 7, 1888 letter, tried to defuse the situation.  He invited Edison to visit him in Pittsburgh and said "I believe there has been a systemic attempt on the part of some people to do a great deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible between the Edison Company and The Westinghouse Electric Co., when there ought to be an entirely different condition of affairs". Edison thanked him but said "My laboratory work consumes the whole of my time".{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=167}}

On June 8 Brown was lobbying in person before the New York Board of Electrical Control, asking that his letter to the paper be read into the meeting's record and demanding severe regulations on AC including limiting power to 300 volts, a level that would make AC next to useless for transmission. There were many rebuttals to Browns claims in the newspapers and letters to the board, with people pointing out he was showing no scientific evidence that AC was more dangerous than DC. Westinghouse pointed out in letters to various newspapers the number of fires caused by DC equipment and suggested that Brown was obviously being controlled by Edison, something Brown continually denied.

A July edition of ''[[The Electrical Journal]]'' covered Brown's appearance before the New York Board of Electrical Control and the debate in technical societies over the merits of DC and AC and noted that:{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=135}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Electrical Journal'', Volume 21, July 21, 1888, p.415.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''&lt;big&gt;The battle of the currents is being fought this week in New York.&lt;/big&gt;''}}

At a July meeting Board of Electrical Control, Brown's criticisms of AC and even his knowledge of electricity was challenged by other electrical engineers, some of whom worked for Westinghouse. At this meeting, supporters of AC provided anecdotal stories from electricians on how they had survived shocks from AC at voltages up to 1000 volts and argued that DC was the more dangerous of the two.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=141}}

====Brown's demonstrations====
Brown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted Thomas Edison to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments.{{refn|group=fn|Brown claimed he made contact with Edison at this point{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=170}} or was brought to Edison by Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|loc=Chapter 13}} }} Edison immediately offered to assist Brown in his crusade against AC companies.  Before long, Brown was loaned space and equipment at Edison's West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as laboratory assistant [[Arthur Kennelly]].

Brown paid local children to collect stray dogs off the street for his experiments with direct and alternating current.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=173}} After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]].{{sfnp|Rockman|2004|p=469}} With many participants shouting for the demonstration to stop and others walking out, Brown subjected a caged dog to several shocks with increasing levels of direct current up to 1000 volts, which the dog survived. Brown then applied 330 volts of alternating current which killed the dog. Four days later he held a second demonstration to answer critics' claims that the DC probably weakened the dog before it died. In this second demonstration, three dogs were killed in quick succession with 300 volts of AC.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=174}} Brown wrote to a college that he was sure this demonstration would get the New York Board of Electrical Control to limit AC installations to 300 volts. Brown's campaign to restrict AC to 300 volts went nowhere but legislation did come close to passing in Ohio and Virginia.&lt;ref name="Carlson2003,285"&gt;{{cite book |first=W. Bernard |last=Carlson |title=Innovation as a Social Process: Elihu Thomson and the Rise of General Electric |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=285 |isbn=978-0-52153-312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collusion with Edison====
What brought Brown to the forefront of the debate over AC and his motives remain unclear,{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=166}} but historians note there grew to be some form of collusion between the Edison company and Brown.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=166}}{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|pp=70 &amp; 261}} Edison records seem to show it was Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings who came up with the idea of using Brown and several New York physicians to attack Westinghouse and the other AC companies in retaliation for what Hastings thought were unscrupulous bids by Westinghouse for lighting contracts in [[Denver]] and [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="Carlson2003,285"/&gt; Hasting brought Brown and Edison together{{sfnp|Klein|2010|loc=Chapter 13}} and was in continual contact with Brown.&lt;ref name="Carlson2003,285"/&gt; Edison Electric seemed to be footing the bill for some of Brown's publications on the dangers of AC{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=157}}.  In addition, Thomas Edison himself sent a letter to the city government of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] recommending Brown as an expert on the dangers of AC.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=174}} Some of this collusion was exposed in letters stolen from Brown's office and published in August 1889.

==Patents and mergers==
[[File:N.Tesla.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Nikola Tesla]]'s induction motor patent was acquired by Westinghouse in July 1888 with plans to incorporate it in a completely integrated AC system.]]
During this period Westinghouse continued to pour money and engineering resources into the goal of building a completely integrated AC system. To gain control of the Sawyer-Man lamp patents he bought [[Consolidated Electric Light]] in 1887. He bought the Waterhouse Electric Light Company in 1888 and the United States Illuminating Company in 1890, giving Westinghouse their own arc lighting systems as well as control over all the major incandescent lamp patents not controlled by Edison.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=281}} In April 1888 Westinghouse engineer [[Oliver B. Shallenberger]] developed an [[electricity meter|induction meter]] that used a [[rotating magnetic field]] for measuring [[alternating current]] giving the company a way to calculate how much electricity a customer used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DzMR8x_rbPgC |title=Wizard: The Life And Times of Nikola Tesla |first=Marc |last=Seifer |date=1 May 1998 |publisher=Citadel |isbn=978-0-8065-3556-2 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1888 Westinghouse paid a substantial amount to license [[Nikola Tesla]]'s US patents for a poly-phase AC [[induction motor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=tesla%20hired%20by%20westinghouse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KDI0aTz0EK&amp;sig=oct2jnPyWkQ3qvUR-JmstK9F0FI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jRwxUKK3LtS80QHjxoGYAg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20hired%20by%20westinghouse&amp;f=false |last=Klooster |first=John W. |title=Icons of Invention: The Makers of the Modern World from Gutenberg to Gates |date=1 January 2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-34743-6 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained a patent option on Galileo Ferraris' induction motor design.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003}} Although the acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, the general shortage of cash the company was going through by 1890 meant development had to be put on hold for a while.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2007|p=127}} The difficulties of obtaining funding for such a capital intensive business was becoming a serious problem for the company and 1890 saw the first of several attempts by investor [[J. P. Morgan]] to take over Westinghouse Electric.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2007|pp=128–130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Quentin R. |last=Skrabec |title=The World's Richest Neighborhood: How Pittsburgh's East Enders Forged American Industry |location=New York |publisher=Algora Publishing |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-87586-795-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson-Houston was continuing to expand, buying seven smaller electric companies including a purchase of the Brush Electric Company in 1889.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=292}} By 1890 Thomson-Houston controlled the majority of the arc lighting systems in the US and a collection of its own US AC patents. Several of the business deals between Thomson-Houston and Westinghouse fell apart and in April 1888 a judge rolled back part of Westinghouse's original Gaulard Gibbs patent, stating it only covered transformers linked in series.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=292}}

With the help of the financier [[Henry Villard]] the Edison group of companies also went through a series of mergers: ''Edison Lamp Company'', a lamp manufacturer in [[East Newark, New Jersey|East Newark]], New Jersey; ''[[Edison Machine Works]]'', a manufacturer of [[dynamo]]s and large [[electric motor]]s in [[Schenectady, New York]]; ''Bergmann &amp; Company'', a manufacturer of electric [[Light fixture|lighting fixtures]], [[Lightbulb sockets|sockets]], and other electric lighting devices; and ''Edison Electric Light Company'', the [[patent]]-holding company and the financial arm backed by [[J.P. Morgan]] and the [[Vanderbilt family]] for Edison's lighting experiments, merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electricity |url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |work=A Brief History of Con Edison |publisher=Con Edison |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new company, ''Edison General Electric Company'', was formed in January 1889 with the help of [[Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.]] and [[Grosvenor Lowrey]] with Villard as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wredge |first1=Charles D. |last2=Greenwood |first2=Ronald G. |title=William E.

==The peak of the war==

Through the fall of 1888 a battle of words with Brown specifically attacking Westinghouse continued to escalate. In November George Westinghouse challenged Brown's assertion in the pages of the ''Electrical Engineer'' that the Westinghouse AC systems had caused 30 deaths. The magazine investigated the claim and found at most only two of the deaths could be attributed to Westinghouse installations.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=118}}

===Associating AC and Westinghouse with the electric chair===
Although New York had a criminal procedure code that specified electrocution via an electric chair, it did not spell out the type of electricity, the amount of current, or its method of supply, since these were still relative unknowns.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=102–104}} The New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details and in late 1888 through early 1889 conducted a series of animal experiments on voltage amounts, electrode design and placement, and skin conductivity. During this time they sought the advice of Harold Brown as a consultant. This ended up expanding the war of currents into the development of the chair and the general debate over capital punishment in the US.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsBernstein"/&gt;

After the Medico-Legal Society formed their committee in September 1888 chairman [[Frederick Peterson]], who had been an assistant at Brown's July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College,{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=102}} had the results of those experiments submitted to the committee. The claims that AC was more deadly than DC and was the best current to use was questioned with some committee members, pointing out that Brown's experiments were not scientifically carried out and were on animals smaller than a human being. At their November meeting the committee recommended 3000 volts although the type of electricity, [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]], was not determined.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=102}} 
[[File:Harold Pitney Brown edison electrocute horse 1888 New York Medico-Legal Journal vol 6 issue 4.png|thumbnail|Harold Brown demonstrating the killing power of AC to the New York Medico-Legal Society by electrocuting a horse at Thomas Edison's West Orange laboratory.]]
In order to more conclusively prove to the committee that AC was more deadly than DC, Brown contacted Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings to arrange the use of the West Orange laboratory.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsBernstein"/&gt; There on December 5, 1888 Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=152–155}} Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society's December meeting recommended the use of 1000–1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities.

Westinghouse criticized these tests as a skewed self-serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=82}} On December 13 in a letter to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Westinghouse spelled out where Brown's experiments were wrong and claimed again that Brown was being employed by the Edison company. Brown's December 18 letter refuted the claims and Brown even challenged Westinghouse to an electrical duel, with Brown agreeing to be shocked by ever-increasing amounts of DC power if Westinghouse submitted himself to the same amount of increasing AC power, first to quit loses.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=82}} Westinghouse declined the offer.

In March 1889 when members of the Medico-Legal Society embarked on another series of tests to work out the details of electrode composition and placement they turned to Brown for technical assistance.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsBernstein"/&gt;{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=225}} Edison treasurer Hastings tried unsuccessfully to obtain a Westinghouse AC generator for the test.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsBernstein"/&gt; They ended up using Edison's West Orange laboratory for the animal tests.

Also in March, Superintendent of Prisons [[Austin Lathrop (New York)|Austin Lathrop]] asked Brown if he could supply the equipment needed for the executions as well as design the electric chair. Brown turned down the job of designing the chair but did agree to fulfill the contract to supply the necessary electrical equipment.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsBernstein"/&gt; The state refused to pay up front, and Brown apparently turned to Edison Electric as well as Thomson-Houston Electric Company to help obtaining the equipment. This became another behind-the-scenes maneuver to acquire Westinghouse AC generators to supply the current, apparently with the help of the Edison company and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsBernstein"/&gt;{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=190–195}} Thomson-Houston arranged to acquire three Westinghouse AC generators by replacing them with new Thomson-Houston AC generators and Edison Electric probably put up the money to acquire them for Brown. Thomson-Houston president [[Charles A. Coffin|Charles Coffin]] had at least two reasons for obtaining the Westinghouse generators; he did not want his company's equipment to be associated with the death penalty and he wanted to use one to prove a point, paying Brown to set up a public efficiency test to show that Westinghouse's sales claim of manufacturing 50% more efficient generators was false.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=193}}

That spring Brown published "The Comparative Danger to Life of the Alternating and Continuous Electrical Current" detailing the animal experiments done at Edison's lab and claiming they showed AC was far deadlier then DC.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=106}} This 61-page professionally printed booklet (probably paid for by the Edison company) was sent to government officials, newspapers, and businessmen in towns with populations greater than 5000 inhabitants.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=157}}

In May 1889 when New York had its first criminal sentenced to be executed in the electric chair, a street merchant named [[William Kemmler]], there was a great deal of discussion in the editorial column of the ''New York Times'' as to what to call the then-new form of execution. The term "''Westinghouse''d" was put forward as well as "''Gerry''cide" (after death penalty commission head Elbridge Gerry), and "''Brown''ed".{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=xxi-xxii}} ''The Times'' hated the word that was eventually adopted, [[electrocution]], describing it as being pushed forward by "pretentious ignoramuses".{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=xxii}} One of Edison's lawyers wrote to his colleague expressing an opinion that Edison's preference for ''dynamort'', ''ampermort'' and ''electromort'' were not good terms but thought ''Westinghouse''d was the best choice.''{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=xxi-xxii}}

====The Kemmler appeal====
[[File:William Kemmler.jpg|thumbnail|After William Kemmler was sentenced to death in the electric chair his appeal was financed by Westinghouse, an attempt to prevent Westinghouse AC generators from being used in an execution, by repealing the electrocution law.]]
William Kemmler was sentenced to die in the electric chair around June 24, 1889, but before the sentence could be carried out an appeal was filed on the grounds that it constituted [[cruel and unusual punishment]] under the US Constitution. It became obvious to the press and everyone involved that the politically connected (and expensive) lawyer who filed the appeal, [[William Bourke Cockran]], had no connection to the case but did have connection to the Westinghouse company, obviously paying for his services.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=101}}

During [[fact-finding]] hearings held around the state beginning on July 9 in New York City, Cockran used his considerable skills as a cross-examiner and [[orator]] to attack Brown, Edison, and their supporters. His strategy was to show that Brown had falsified his test on the killing power of AC and to prove that electricity would not cause certain death and simply lead to torturing the condemned. In cross examination he questioned Brown's lack of credentials in the electrical field and brought up possible collusion between Brown and Edison, which Brown again denied. Many witnesses were called by both sides to give firsthand anecdotal accounts about encounters with electricity and evidence was given by medical professionals on the human body's nervous system and the electrical conductivity of skin. Brown was accused of fudging his tests on animals, hiding the fact that he was using lower [[electric current|current]] DC and high-current AC.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=119}} When the hearing convened for a day at Edison's West Orange lab to witness demonstrations of skin resistance to electricity, Brown almost got in a fight with a Westinghouse representative, accusing him of being in the Edison laboratory to conduct [[industrial espionage]].{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=115}} Newspapers noted the often contradictory testimony was raising public doubts about the electrocution law but after Edison took the stand many accepted assurances from the "wizard of Menlo Park" that 1000 volts of AC would easily kill any man.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=125}}

After the gathered testimony was submitted and the two sides presented their case, Judge Edwin Day ruled against Kemmler's appeal on October 9 and US Supreme Court denied Kemmler's appeal on May 23, 1890.{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=120}}

When the chair was first used, on August 6, 1890, the technicians on hand misjudged the voltage needed to kill William Kemmler. After the first jolt of electricity Kemmler was found to be still breathing. The procedure had to be repeated and a reporter on hand described it as "an awful spectacle, far worse than hanging." George Westinghouse commented: "They would have done better using an axe."{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=125}}

===Brown's collusion exposed===
On August 25, 1889 the [[New York Sun]] ran a story headlined:
{{cquote|"''For Shame, Brown! - Disgraceful Facts About the Electric Killing Scheme; Queer Work for a State's Expert; Paid by One Electric Company to Injure Another''"}}

The story was based on 45 letters stolen from Brown's office that spelled out Brown's collusion with Thomson-Houston and Edison Electric. The majority of the letters were correspondence between Brown and Thomson-Houston on the topic of acquiring the three Westinghouse generators for the state of New York as well as using one of them in an efficiency test. They also showed that Brown had received $5,000 from Edison Electric to purchase the surplus Westinghouse generators from Thomson-Houston. Further Edison involvement was contained in letters from Edison treasurer Hastings asking Brown to send anti-AC pamphlets to all the legislators in the state of [[Missouri]] (at the company's expense), Brown requesting that a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison be sent to Scranton, PA, as well as Edison and Arthur Kennelly coaching Brown in his upcoming testimony in the Kemmler appeal trial.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=190–195}}&lt;ref name="inventionandtech.com"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.inventionandtech.com/content/inventing-electrocution-1?page=show |first=James F. |last=Penrose |title=Inventing Electrocution |year=1994 |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention &amp; Technology]] |volume=9 |number=4 |pages=34–44 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225124748/http://www.inventionandtech.com/content/inventing-electrocution-1 |archivedate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|pp=191–198}}

Brown was not slowed down by this revelation and characterized his efforts to expose Westinghouse as the same as going after a grocer who sells poison and calls it sugar.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=190–195}}&lt;ref name="inventionandtech.com"/&gt;{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|pp=191–198}}

===The "Electric Wire Panic"===
[[File:John Feeks Western Union lineman killed by AC October 11 1889.png|thumb|The death of Western Union Lineman John Feeks led to laws finally being passed to move AC lines underground in New York City.]]

1889 saw another round of deaths attributed to alternating current including a lineman in Buffalo, New York, four linemen in New York City, and a New York fruit merchant who was killed when the display he was using came in contact with an overhead line. NYC Mayor [[Hugh J. Grant]], in a meeting with the Board of Electrical Control and the AC electric companies, rejected the claims that the AC lines were perfectly safe saying "''we get news of all who touch them through the coroners office''".{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}} On October 11, 1889, John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low-voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below. The source of the power that killed Feeks was not determined although United States Illuminating Company lines ran nearby.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}

Feeks' public death sparked a new round of people fearing the electric lines over their heads in what has been called the "Electric Wire Panic".{{sfnp|Klein|2010}} The blame seemed to settle on Westinghouse since, having bought many of the lighting companies involved, people assumed Feeks' death was the fault of a Westinghouse subsidiary.{{sfnp|Klein|2010}} Newspapers joined into the public outcry following Feeks' death, pointing out men's lives "were cheaper to this monopoly than insulated wires" and calling for the executives of AC companies to be charged with [[manslaughter]]. The October 13, 1889, New Orleans ''[[Times-Picayune]]'' noted “''Death does not stop at the door, but comes right into the house, and perhaps as you are closing a door or turning on the gas you are killed''."{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=217}} Harold Brown's reputation was rehabilitated almost overnight with newspapers and magazines seeking his opinion and reporters following him around New York City where he measured how much current was leaking from AC power lines.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=218}}

[[File:Thomas Edison 1.png|thumbnail|left|The death of Feeks marked the first time Edison publicly denounced alternating current.]]
At the peak of the war of currents, Edison himself joined the public debate for the first time, denounced AC current in a November 1889 article in the ''[[North American Review]]'' titled "The Dangers of Electric Lighting". Edison put forward the view that burying the high-voltage lines was not a solution, and would simply move the deaths underground and be a "constant menace" that could short with other lines threatening people's homes and lives.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=200}} He stated the only way to make AC safe was to limit its voltage and vowed Edison Electric would never adopt AC as long as he was in charge.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}

George Westinghouse was suddenly put in the role of a "villain" trying to defend pole-mounted AC installations that he knew were unsafe and fumbled at reporters' questions trying to point out all the other things in a large city that were more dangerous.{{sfnp|Klein|2010}}{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}} The next month he did better in his response printed in the ''North American Review'', pointing out that his AC/transformer system actually used lower household voltages than the Edison DC system. He also pointed out 87 deaths in one year caused by street cars and gas lighting vs only 5 accidental electrocutions and no in-home deaths attributed to AC current.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}

The crowd that watched Feeks contained many New York [[aldermen]] due to the site of the accident being near the New York government offices and the horrifying affair galvanized them into the action of passing the law on moving utilities underground.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=178}} The electric companies involved obtained an injunction preventing their lines from being cut down immediately but shut down most of their lighting until the situation was settled, plunging many New York streets into darkness.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=292}} The legislation ordering the cutting down of all of the utility lines was finally upheld by the New York Supreme Court in December. The AC lines were cut down keeping many New York City streets in darkness for the rest of the winter since little had been done by the overpaid [[Tammany Hall]] city supervisors who were supposed to see to building the underground "subways" to house them.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=200}}

==The current war ends==
Even with the Westinghouse propaganda losses, the war of currents itself was winding down with direct current on the losing side. This was due in part to Thomas Edison himself leaving the electric power business.{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=125–126}} Edison was becoming marginalized in his own company having lost majority control in the 1889 merger that formed Edison General Electric.&lt;ref name="Sloat1979,316"&gt;{{cite book |first=Warren |last=Sloat |title=1929: America Before the Crash |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1979 |page=316 |isbn=978-0-02611-800-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he told president [[Henry Villard]] he thought it was time to retire from the lighting business and moved on to an iron ore refining project that preoccupied his time.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28–29}} Edison's dogmatic anti-AC values were no longer controlling the company. By 1889 Edison's Electric's own subsidiaries were lobbying to add AC power transmission to their systems and in October 1890 [[Edison Machine Works]] began developing AC-based equipment.

With Thomas Edison no longer involved with Edison General Electric, the war of currents came to a close with a financial merger.{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=120-121}} Edison president Henry Villard, who had engineered the merger that formed Edison General Electric, was continually working on the idea of merging that company with Thomson-Houston or Westinghouse. He saw a real opportunity in 1891. The market was in a general downturn causing cash shortages for all the companies concerned and Villard was in talks with Thomson-Houston, which was now Edison General Electric's biggest competitor. Thomson-Houston had a habit of saving money on development by buying, or sometimes stealing, patents. Patent conflicts were stymieing the growth of both companies and the idea of saving on some 60 ongoing lawsuits as well as saving on profit losses of trying to undercut each other by selling generating plants below cost pushed forward the idea of this merger in financial circles.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28–29}}&lt;ref name="Sloat1979,316"/&gt; Edison hated the idea and tried to hold it off but Villard thought his company, now winning its incandescent light patent lawsuits in the courts, was in a position to dictate the terms of any merger.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28–29}} As a committee of financiers, which included [[J.P. Morgan]], worked on the deal in early 1892 things went against Villard. In Morgan's view Thomson-Houston looked on the books to be the stronger of the two companies and engineered a behind the scenes deal announced on April 15, 1892, that put the management of Thomson-Houston in control of the new company, now called [[General Electric]] (dropping Edison's name). Thomas Edison was not aware of the deal until the day before it happened.

The fifteen electric companies that existed 5 years before had merged down to two; General Electric and Westinghouse. The war of currents came to an end and this merger of the Edison company, along with its lighting patents, and the Thomson-Houston, with its AC patents, created a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}}{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28–29}} From this point on General Electric and Westinghouse were both marketing alternating current systems.&lt;ref name="Garud2009,249"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Raghu |last1=Garud |first2=Arun |last2=Kumaraswamy |first3=Richard |last3=Langlois |title=Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks, and Organizations |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2009 |page=249 |isbn=978-1-40514-194-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison put on a brave face noting to the media how his stock had gained value in the deal but privately he was bitter that his company and all of his patents had been turned over to the competition.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}}

===Aftermath===
Even though the institutional war of currents had ended in a financial merger the technical difference between direct and alternating current systems followed a much longer technical merger.{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=120–121}} Due to innovation in the US and Europe, alternating current's economy of scale with very large generating plants linked to loads via long distance transmission was slowly being combined with the ability to link it up with all of the existing systems that needed to be supplied. These included single phase AC systems, poly-phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. In the engineered ''universal system'' these technological differences were temporarily being bridged via the development of [[rotary converter]]s and [[motor–generator]]s that allowed the large number of legacy systems to be connected to the AC grid.&lt;ref name="Garud2009,249"/&gt;{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=120–121}} These stopgaps were slowly replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded.

In May 1892 Westinghouse Electric managed to underbid General Electric on the contract to electrify the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago and, although they made no profit, their demonstration of a safe and effective highly flexible universal alternating current system powering all of the disparate electrical systems at the Exposition led to them winning the bid at the end of that year to build an AC power station at [[Niagara Falls]]. General Electric was awarded contracts to build AC transmission lines and transformers in that project and further bids at Niagara were split with GE who were quickly catching up in the AC field{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}} due partly to [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]], a Prussian mathematician who was the first person to fully understand AC power from a solid mathematical standpoint. General Electric hired many talented new engineers to improve its design of transformers, generators, motors and other apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;''The General Electric Story'', The Hall of History.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patent lawsuits were still hampering both companies and bleeding off cash, so in 1896, J. P. Morgan engineered a patent sharing agreement between the two companies that remained in force for 11 years.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2007|p=190}}

In 1897 Edison sold his remaining stock in Edison Electric Illuminating of New York to finance his iron ore refining prototype plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernest |last=Freeberg |title=The Age of Edison: Electric Light and the Invention of Modern America |location=New York |publisher=The Penguin Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-59420-426-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 Edison said to George Stanley, son of AC transformer inventor [[William Stanley, Jr.]], "''Tell your father I was wrong''", probably admitting he had underestimated the developmental potential of alternating current.{{sfnp|Higonnet|Landes|Rosovsky|1991|p=113}}

==Larger developments==

===International Electro-Technical Exhibition===
The [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891|International Electro-Technical Exhibition of 1891]], in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], featured the long distance transmission of high-power, three-phase electric current. It was held between 16 May and 19 October on the disused site of the three former “Westbahnhöfe” (Western Railway Stations) in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. The exhibition featured the first long distance transmission of high-power, three-phase electric current, which was generated 175&amp;nbsp;km away at [[Lauffen am Neckar]]. It successfully operated motors and lights at the fair. When the exhibition closed, the [[power station]] at Lauffen continued in operation, providing electricity for the administrative capital, Heilbronn, making it the first place to be equipped with three-phase AC power. Many corporate technical representatives (including E.W. Rice of Thomson-Houston Electric Company (what became General Electric)) attended.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Museum of Innovation and Science|The Schenectady Museum]]'', [[Schenectady, New York]].&lt;/ref&gt; The technical advisers and representatives were impressed. As a result of the successful field trial, three-phase current, as far as Germany was concerned, became the most economical means of transmitting electrical energy.

In Europe, Siemens and Halske became the dominant force. Three phase 60&amp;nbsp;Hz at 120 volts became the dominant system in North America while 220-240 volts at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz became the standard in Europe.

Alternating current power [[transmission network]]s today provide [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant path]]s and lines for power routing from any power plant to any load center, based on the economics of the transmission path, the cost of power, and the importance of keeping a particular load center powered at all times. High voltage power transmission allows generators (such as [[hydroelectric]] sites) to be located far from the loads.

===Willamette Falls to Niagara Falls===
In 1882, the German [[Miesbach–Munich Power Transmission]] used 2kV DC over a distance of {{convert|57|km}}. In 1889, the first long distance transmission of DC electricity in the United States was switched on at [[Willamette Falls]] Station, in [[Oregon City, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="Hydro-TL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://willamettefalls.org/Hist/Elec |title=History of Station A |website=Willamette Falls Heritage Foundation |year=2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716092119/https://www.willamettefalls.org/Hist/Elec |archivedate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, a flood destroyed the power station. This unfortunate event paved the way for the first long distance transmission of AC electricity in the world when Willamette Falls Electric company installed experimental AC generators from Westinghouse in 1890. That same year, the Niagara Falls Power Company (NFPC) and its subsidiary Cataract Company formed the International Niagara Commission composed of experts, to analyze proposals to harness [[Niagara Falls]] to generate electricity. The commission was led by [[Sir William Thomson]] (later Lord Kelvin) and included [[Eleuthère Mascart]] from France, [[William Unwin]] from England, [[Coleman Sellers]] from the US, and [[Théodore Turrettini]] from Switzerland. It was backed by [[entrepreneur]]s such as [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Lord Rothschild]], and [[John Jacob Astor IV]]. Among 19 proposals, they even briefly considered [[Pneumatics|compressed air]] as a [[power transmission]] medium, but preferred electricity. They could not decide which method would be best overall.

===AC deployment at Niagara===
By 1893 the NFPC had rejected the remaining proposals from a half dozen companies and awarded the generating contract to Westinghouse with further transmission lines and transformer contracts awarded to General Electric.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|p=40}}{{sfnp|Skrabec|2012|p=113}} Work began in 1893 on the Niagara Falls generation project: 5,000 horsepower (3,700 kW) was to be generated and transmitted as [[alternating current#AC power supply frequencies|alternating current]], at a frequency of 25&amp;nbsp;Hz to minimize impedance losses in transmission (changed to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz in the 1950s).

Some doubted that the system would generate enough electricity to power industry in Buffalo, New York. The inventor Nikola Tesla was sure it would work, saying that Niagara Falls could power the entire eastern United States. None of the previous polyphase alternating current transmission demonstration projects were on the scale of power available from Niagara:
* The German [[International Electrotechnical Exhibition|Lauffen-Neckar demonstration]] in 1891 had a capacity of 225&amp;nbsp;kW over 175&amp;nbsp;km
* Westinghouse successfully used AC in the commercial [[Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant]] in 1891 at 75&amp;nbsp;kW (Single phase)
* The [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair in 1893]] exhibited a complete 11,000&amp;nbsp;kW polyphase generation and distribution system with multiple generators, installed by Westinghouse.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011}}
* Almirian Decker designed a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] 250&amp;nbsp;kW AC system at [[Mill Creek No. 1 Hydroelectric Plant|Mill Creek, California]], in 1893&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Mill_Creek_No._1_Hydroelectric_Plant,_1893 |title=Mill Creek No. 1 Hydroelectric Plant |website=IEEE Global History Network |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westinghouse also had to develop a system that could be converted to all the needed power standards including single phase and polyphase AC and DC for street cars and factory motors. Westinghouse's initial customer for the [[hydroelectric]] [[generator (device)|generator]]s at the [[Edward Dean Adams Station]] at Niagara in 1895 were the plants of the [[Pittsburgh Reduction Company]] which needed large quantities of cheap electricity for [[smelting]] aluminum.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=274}} On November 16, 1896, electrical power transmitted to Buffalo began powering its street cars. The generators were built by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] with generators that bore Tesla's name. The scale of the project soon had General Electric contributing equally, building transmission equipment, plants, and generators.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=274}}

==Electric power transmission==

===The competing systems===
Edison's DC distribution system consisted of generating plants feeding heavy distribution conductors, with customer loads (lighting and motors) tapped off them. The system operated at the same voltage level throughout; for example, 100 volt lamps at the customer's location were connected to a generator supplying 110 volts, to allow for some voltage drop in the wires between the generator and load. The voltage level was chosen for convenience in lamp manufacture; high-resistance carbon filament lamps could be constructed to withstand 100 volts, and to provide lighting performance economically competitive with gas lighting. At the time it was felt that 100 volts was not likely to present a severe hazard of fatal [[electric shock]].

To save on the cost of copper conductors, a [[split phase|three-wire]] distribution system was used. The three wires were at +110 volts, 0 volts and &amp;minus;110 volts relative potential. 100-volt lamps could be operated between either the +110 or &amp;minus;110 volt legs of the system and the 0-volt [[ground and neutral|"neutral"]] conductor, which carried only the unbalanced current between the + and &amp;minus; sources. The resulting three-wire system used less copper wire for a given quantity of electric power transmitted, while still maintaining (relatively) low voltages. Even with this innovation, the [[voltage drop]] due to the resistance of the system conductors was so high that generating plants had to be located within a mile (1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;km) or so of the load. Higher voltages could not so easily be used with the DC system because there was no efficient low-cost technology to reduce a high transmission voltage to a low utilization voltage.

[[File:WestinghouseEarlyACSystem1887-USP373035.png|right|thumb|Westinghouse early AC system 1887 ({{US patent|373035}}).]]
In the alternating current system, [[transformer]]s were used between the (relatively) high voltage distribution system and the customer loads. Lamps and small motors could still be operated at some convenient low voltage, but the transformers allowed power to be transmitted at much higher voltages, say, ten times that of the loads. For a given quantity of [[electric power|power]] transmitted, the wire cross-sectional area was [[proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the voltage used. Alternatively, the allowable length of a circuit, given a wire size and allowable voltage drop, increased approximately as the square of the distribution voltage. This meant that fewer, larger generating plants could serve the load in a given area. Large loads, such as industrial motors or converters for electric railway power, could be served by the same distribution network that fed lighting, by using a transformer with a suitable secondary voltage.

Edison's response to the limitations of direct current was to generate power close to where it was consumed (today called [[distributed generation]]) and install large conductors to handle the growing demand for electricity, but this solution proved to be costly (especially for rural areas which could not afford to build a local station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H. W. |last=Brands |title=The Reckless Decade : America in the 1890s |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1995 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-31213-594-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to pay for large amounts of very thick copper wire), impractical (including inefficient voltage conversion) and unmanageable.

Direct current could not easily be converted to higher or lower voltages. This meant that separate electrical lines had to be installed to supply power to appliances that used different voltages, for example, lighting and electric motors. This required more wires to lay and maintain, wasting money and introducing unnecessary hazards.

Low-frequency (50–60&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]) alternating currents can be more dangerous than similar levels of DC since the alternating fluctuations can cause the heart to lose coordination, inducing [[ventricular fibrillation]], a deadly loss of heart rhythm that must be corrected immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Carl J. |last=Wiggers |authorlink=Carl J. Wiggers |title=The mechanism and nature of ventricular fibrillation |journal=[[American Heart Journal]] |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=October 1940 |pages=399–412 |doi=10.1016/S0002-8703(40)90874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any practical distribution system will use voltage levels sufficient for a dangerous amount of current to flow, whether it uses alternating or direct current. As precautions against electrocution are similar for both AC and DC, the technical and economic advantages of [[alternating current|AC power transmission]] outweighed this theoretical risk, and it was eventually adopted as the standard worldwide.
[[File:US390721.png|thumb|upright|Tesla's US390721 patent for a "Dynamo Electric Machine".]]

===Transmission loss===
The advantage of AC for distributing [[power (physics)|power]] over a distance is due to the ease of changing voltages using a [[transformer]]. Available power is the product of [[current (electricity)|current]] × [[voltage]] at the load. For a given amount of power, a low voltage requires a higher current and a higher voltage requires a lower current. Since metal conducting wires have an almost fixed [[electrical resistance]], some power will be wasted as heat in the wires. This power loss is given by [[Joule's laws]] and is proportional to the square of the current. Thus, if the overall transmitted power is the same, and given the constraints of practical conductor sizes, high-current, low-voltage transmissions will suffer a much greater power loss than low-current, high-voltage ones. This holds whether DC or AC is used.

Converting DC power from one voltage to another required a large spinning [[rotary converter]] or [[motor-generator set]], which was difficult, expensive, inefficient, and required maintenance, whereas with AC the voltage can be changed with simple and efficient transformers that have no moving parts and require very little maintenance. This was the key to the success of the AC system. Modern transmission grids regularly use AC voltages up to 765,000 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Donald G. |last1=Fink |authorlink1=Donald G. Fink |first2=H.

Alternating-current transmission lines have losses that do not occur with direct current. Due to the [[skin effect]], a conductor will have a higher resistance to alternating current than to direct current; the effect is measurable and of practical significance for large conductors carrying thousands of amperes. The increased resistance due to the skin effect can be offset by changing the shape of conductors from a solid core to a braid of many small (isolated) wires. Total losses in systems using high-voltage transmission and transformers to reduce (or increase) the voltage are very much lower than DC transmission at working voltage.

===Remnant and existent DC systems===
Some cities continued to use DC well into the 20th century. For example, central [[Helsinki]] had a DC network until the late 1940s, and Stockholm lost its dwindling DC network as late as the 1970s. A [[mercury-arc valve]] rectifier station could convert AC to DC where networks were still used. Parts of Boston, Massachusetts, along Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue still used 110 volts DC in the 1960s, causing the destruction of many small appliances (typically hair dryers and phonographs) used by [[Boston University]] students, who ignored warnings about the electricity supply. New York City's electric utility company, [[Consolidated Edison]], continued to supply direct current to customers who had adopted it early in the twentieth century, mainly for elevators. The [[New Yorker Hotel]], constructed in 1929, had a large direct-current power plant and did not convert fully to alternating-current service until well into the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Tom |last=Blalock |title=Powering the New Yorker: A Hotel's Unique Direct Current System |magazine=Power and Energy |publisher=IEEE |volume=4 |issue=1 |date=23 January 2006 |doi=10.1109/MPAE.2006.1578536}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the building in which AC pioneer [[Nikola Tesla]] spent his last years, and where he died in 1943. New York City's Broadway theaters continued to use DC services until 1975, requiring the use of outmoded manual resistance dimmer boards operated by several stagehands. This practice ended when the musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' introduced computerized lighting control and thyristor (SCR) dimmers to Broadway, and [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4311717 New York theaters were finally converted to AC].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Tom |last=Blalock |title=History and reflections on the way things were: Edison's Direct Current Influenced "Broadway" Show Lighting |magazine=Power and Engineering Review |publisher=IEEE |volume=22 |issue=10 |date=October 2002 |issn=0272-1724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1998, Consolidated Edison started to eliminate DC service. At that time there were 4,600 DC customers. By 2006, there were only 60 customers using DC service, and on November 14, 2007, the last direct-current distribution by Con Edison was shut down. Customers still using DC were provided with on-site AC to DC [[rectifier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Lee |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 16, 2007 |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/off-goes-the-power-current-started-by-thomas-edison/ |title=Off Goes the Power Current Started by Thomas Edison |accessdate=November 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] still provided DC power to some locations in [[San Francisco]] through at least 2012, primarily for elevators, supplied by close to 200 rectifiers each providing power for 7-10 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/san-franciscos-secret-dc-grid |title=San Francisco’s Secret DC Grid |date=15 November 2012 |first=Peter |last=Fairley |website=[[IEEE Spectrum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last DC commercial power distribution system in the United States was decommissioned in 2007.&lt;ref name="Con Edison Press Release"/&gt; The Central Electricity Generating Board in the UK continued to maintain a 200&amp;nbsp;volt DC generating station at [[Bankside Power Station]] on the [[River Thames]] in London as late as 1981. It exclusively powered DC printing machinery in [[Fleet Street]], then the heart of the UK's newspaper industry. It was decommissioned later in 1981 when the newspaper industry moved into the developing docklands area further down the river (using modern AC-powered equipment). The building was converted into an art gallery, the [[Tate Modern]].

Electric railways that use a [[third-rail]] system exclusively employ DC power between 110 and 1500 volts. Railways with [[overhead catenary]] lines use various power schemes including both high-voltage AC and low voltage DC. Low voltage in this context is 5&amp;nbsp;kV or below.

[[High-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) systems are used for bulk transmission of energy from distant generating stations or for interconnection of separate alternating-current systems. These HVDC systems use [[power electronics|electronic]] devices like [[mercury-arc valve]]s, [[thyristor]]s or [[IGBT]]s that were unavailable during the war of currents era. Power is still converted to and from alternating current at each side of the modern HVDC link. The advantages of HVDC over AC systems for bulk transmission include higher power ratings for a given line (important since installing new lines and even upgrading old ones is extremely expensive) and better control of power flows, especially in transient and emergency conditions that can often lead to blackouts. Many modern plants now use HVDC as an alternative to AC systems for long distance, high load transmission, especially in developing countries such as Russia, China, India and Brazil. One of the principal advantages is the ability to transfer power between two AC systems that are not in synchronized [[phase (waves)|phase]]. (See [[List of HVDC projects]] for more details.)

DC power distribution is still common when distances are small, and especially when energy storage or conversion uses batteries or fuel cells. These applications include:
* [[Electronics]], including [[integrated circuit]]s, high-power [[transmitter]]s and [[computer]]s
* [[Automotive battery|Vehicle starting, lighting, and ignition systems]]
* [[Hybrid electric vehicle|Hybrid]] and all-electric vehicle propulsion with internal power-supply
* [[Telephone|Telecommunication]] plant power (wired and cellular mobile) use a −48 volt DC battery supply
* [[Electrical substation|Electric Utility]] electrical substations continue to use a 125 volt DC "Station Battery" to operate control equipment
* [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) for computer systems
* [[Grid energy storage|Utility-scale battery systems]]
* "[[Off-the-grid|Off-grid]]" isolated power installations using wind or solar power

In these applications, direct current may be used directly or converted to alternating current using [[power inverter|power electronic devices]]. In the future, this may provide a way to supply energy to a grid from distributed sources. For example, hybrid vehicle owners may rent the capacity of their vehicle's batteries for load-levelling purposes by the local electrical utility company.

[[File:100 m final Berlin 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Usain Bolt]] setting a world record in the 100m dash at the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics]] in Berlin.]]

A '''world record''' is usually the best global performance ever recorded and officially verified in a specific [[skill]] or [[sport]]. The book ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' collates and publishes notable records of all types, from first and best to worst human achievements, to extremes in the natural world and beyond.

== Terminology ==
In the [[United States]] the form '''World's Record''' was formerly more common. The term '''World Best''' was also briefly in use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The latter term is still used in [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] events, including [[track and field]] and [[road running]] to describe good and bad performances not recognized as an official world record: either because it is not an event where the [[IAAF]] tracks the record (e.g. the 150 m run or individual events in a [[decathlon]]), or because it does not fulfil other rigorous criteria of an otherwise qualifying event (e.g. the [[Great North Run]] half-marathon, which has an excessive downhill gradient). The term is also used in video game [[speedrunning]] when someone achieves the fastest possible time for the game and category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speedrunslive - Glossary|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zeta potential titration''' is a [[titration]] of [[heterogeneous]] systems, for example  [[colloid]]s and [[emulsion]]s. Solids in such systems have very high [[surface area]]. This type of titration is used to study the [[zeta potential]] of these [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]s under different conditions.

[[File:Titration Zeta.gif|thumb|500px|Zeta potential titrations of concentrated [[alumina]] and [[rutile]] dispersions]]

==Iso-electric Point==

The [[iso-electric point]] is one such property. The iso-electric point is the pH value at which the [[zeta potential]] is approximately zero. At a pH near the iso-electric point (± 2 pH units), colloids are usually unstable; the particles tend to [[coagulation|coagulate]] or [[flocculation|flocculate]]. Such titrations use acids or bases as titration [[reagent]]s. Tables of iso-electric points for different materials are available.&lt;ref name=Kosmulski2001&gt;{{citation | last=Kosmulski | first=Marek | title = Chemical properties of Material Surfaces | series = Surfactant Science Series | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | date = 2001 | isbn=978-0-8247-0560-2 | volume = 102)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attached figure illustrates results of such titrations for concentrated dispersions of [[alumina]] (4% v/v) and [[rutile]] (7% v/v). It is seen that iso-electric point of alumina is around pH 9.3, whereas for rutile it is around pH 4. Alumina is unstable in the pH range from 7 to 11. Rutile is unstable in the pH range from 2 to 6.

==Surfactants and Stabilization==

Another purpose of this titration is determination of the optimum dose of [[surfactant]] for achieving [[chemical stability|stabilization]] or [[flocculation]] of a heterogeneous system. Examples can be found in the book by Dukhin and Goetz.&lt;ref name=Dukhin2002&gt;{{citation | last=Dukhin | first=Andrei S. | last2 = Goetz | first2 = Philip J. | title = Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date=2002 | isbn=978-0-444-51164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==

In a zeta-potential titration, the [[Zeta potential]] is the [[wikt:indicator|indicator]]. Measurement of the '''zeta potential''' can be performed using [[microelectrophoresis]], or [[electrophoretic light scattering]], or [[electroacoustic phenomena]]. The last method makes possible to perform titrations in concentrated systems, with no dilution. The book by Dukhin and Goetz provides a detailed description of such titrations.
