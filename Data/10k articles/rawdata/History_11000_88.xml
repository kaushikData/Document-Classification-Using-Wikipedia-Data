The '''2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff''' was a military standoff between India and Pakistan that resulted in the massing of troops on either side of the [[Indo-Pakistani border|border]] and along the [[Line of Control]] (LoC) in the region of [[Kashmir]]. This was the second major military standoff between India and Pakistan following the successful detonation of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear devices]] by both countries in 1998 and the most recent standoff between the nuclear rivals. The other had been the [[Kargil War]] in 1999.

The military buildup was initiated by India responding to a [[2001 Indian Parliament attack|terrorist attack]] on the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]] on 13 December 2001 (during which twelve people, including the five terrorists who attacked the building, were killed) and the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|legislative Assembly]] on [[2001 Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly attack|1 October 2001]].&lt;ref name="Rajesh M.

== Prelude ==
{{Main|2001 Indian Parliament attack}}

On the morning of 13 December 2001, a [[Clandestine cell system|cell]] of five armed men attacked the [[Indian Parliament]] by breaching the security cordon at Gate 12. The five men killed seven people before being shot dead by [[Indian Security Forces]].

[[List of current heads of state and government|World leaders]] and leaders in [[South Asia|nearby countries]] condemned the attack on the Parliament, including Pakistan. On 14 December, the ruling [[India]]n [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] blamed Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) for the attack. [[Home Minister of India|Home Minister]] [[Lal Krishna Advani|L.K. Advani]] claimed, "we have received some clues about yesterday's incident, which shows that a neighboring country, and some terrorist organisations active there are behind it,"&lt;ref name=advanipakclues&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/14parl21.htm "Parliament attack: Advani points towards neighbouring country"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906065831/http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/14parl21.htm |date=6 September 2005 }}, [[Rediff]], 14 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; in an indirect reference to Pakistan and Pakistan-based militant groups. The same day, in a ''[[demarche]]'' to Pakistan's [[High Commissioner]] to India, [[Ashraf Jehangir Qazi]], India demanded that Pakistan stop the activities of LeT and JeM, that Pakistan apprehend the organisation's leaders and that Pakistan curb the financial assets and the group's access to these assets.&lt;ref name=demarche&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/14parl12.htm "Govt blames LeT for Parliament attack, asks Pak to restrain terrorist outfits"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313105139/http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/14parl12.htm |date=13 March 2007 }}, [[Rediff]], 14 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the [[Indian government]]'s statements, Pakistan ordered its [[Pakistan Military|military]] on standing high alert the same day.

The Pakistan military's information sources, the [[Inter-Services Public Relations|ISPR]]'s [[spokesman]] [[Major-General]] [[Rashid Qureshi]], claimed that the Parliament attack was a "drama staged by Indian [[Indian Intelligence Agency|intelligence agencies]] to defame the freedom struggle in '[[Jammu and Kashmir|occupied Kashmir]]'" and further warned that India would pay "heavily if they engage in any misadventure".&lt;ref name=dawndec14&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2001/12/15/top1.htm "Pakistan forces put on high alert: Storming of parliament"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314041910/http://www.dawn.com/2001/12/15/top1.htm |date=14 March 2007 }}, [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 15 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December, amid calls from the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and the [[United Nations]] to exercise restraint, India mobilised and deployed its troops to Kashmir and the [[Punjab (India)|Indian part of the Punjab]] in what was India's largest military mobilization since the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani War|1971 conflict]].&lt;ref name=USAToday2002&gt;{{cite news|title=Musharraf vows to stop terror activity in Pakistan|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/06/22/india.htm|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=22 June 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007052612/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/06/22/india.htm|archive-date=7 October 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Indian codename for the mobilization was Operation Parakram ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Valor'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/02/06/stories/2004020604461200.htm |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Gen.

==January Offensive==
===Planning===
The troop deployment to India's western border was expected to take three to four weeks, accordingly the military action involving a limited offensive against the terrorists' training camps in Pak administered Kashmir was planned by the Indian [[Cabinet Committee on Security]] for the second week of January 2002. It would start with air strike by IAF's Tiger Squadron to attack zones with large concentration of camps. Special forces of the Indian army would then launch a limited ground offensive to further neutralise the terrorist camps and help to occupy the dominant positions on the LoC. 14 January 2002, was decided as the tentative D-day.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

According to the Indian strategy a limited strike in the Pakistan administered Kashmir was preferred as it would convey the Indian resolve to Pakistan and yet keep the international retribution levels that are manageable. Indian actions would then be comparable to the, ongoing US offensive in Afghanistan against [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[Al-Qaida]] terrorists.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

The CCS had weighed in the possibility of Pakistan launching an all-out offensive as a response to the Indian strikes. The intelligence assessment suggested that the Pakistani Army was not well prepared. This further minimized the chances of Pakistan launching a full-scale war. The Indian plans were strengthened by a strong economy with low inflation, high petroleum and forex reserves. Finance minister [[Yashwant Sinha]] announced that the Indian economy was prepared for a war, in spite of being the final option. The limited strike served as a tactical option. The troop build-up signalled "India's seriousness" to the international community and the USA. If Pakistan's strategy did not change then India would have no other option.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

=== Military Confrontations ===
In late December, both countries moved [[ballistic missile]]s closer to each other's border, and mortar and artillery fire was reported in Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/south/12/25/india.pakistan.kashmir.missiles Pakistan, India 'move missiles' to border] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106131408/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/south/12/25/india.pakistan.kashmir.missiles/ |date=6 January 2007 }} [[CNN]], 26 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2002, India had mobilized around 500,000 troops and three armored divisions on the Pakistan's border concentrated along the [[Line of Control]] in Kashmir. Pakistan responded similarly, deploying around 300,000 troops to that region.&lt;ref name="gs" /&gt; The tensions were partially diffused after Musharraf's speech on 12 January promising action on terror emanating from Pakistan.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

===Diplomacy===
India initiated its diplomatic offensive by recalling [[High Commission of India, Islamabad#Indian High Commissioner|Indian high commissioner]] and the civilian flights from Pakistan were banned.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

Pakistan picked up the war signals and began mobilisation of its military and initiated diplomatic talks with the US President George W. Bush. [[American Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] engaged with India and Pakistan to reduce tensions. In the first week of January, [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] visited India with a message that he was pressurising Pakistani President Musharraf. USA declared LeT and JeM as [[United_States_State_Department_list_of_Foreign_Terrorist_Organizations#Groups_designated_as_FTOs|foreign terrorist groups]].&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

===Musharraf's Speech===
On January 8 2002, [[Indian Home Minister]] [[L. K. Advani]] visited the US, where he was informed about the contents of the upcoming landmark speech by Musharraf.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt; On 12 January 2002, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]] gave a speech intended to reduce tensions with India. He for the first time condemned the attack on Parliament as a terrorist attack and compared it with the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="nys"/&gt; He declared in his speech that terrorism was unjustified in the name of Kashmir and Pakistan would combat extremism on its own soil. Pakistan would resolve Kashmir with dialogue and no organisation will be allowed to carry out terrorism ''under the pretext of Kashmir''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1756965.stm Musharraf declares war on extremism&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307170804/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1756965.stm|date=7 March 2008}}, [[BBC]], 12 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  As demanded by India, he also announced plans for the regulation of [[madarsa]]s and banning the known terrorist groups that were operating out of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt; He announced a formal ban on five jihadi organizations, that included Jaish-e-Muhammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba engaged in militancy in Kashmir.&lt;ref name="nys"/&gt;

===Indian decision===
The Indian Prime Minister though skeptic of the seriousness of Musharraf's pledges, decided not to carry out the military attack planned for January 14.&lt;ref name=nys&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/02/13/060213fa_fact_coll "The Stand-off"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718000407/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/02/13/060213fa_fact_coll |date=18 July 2008 }}, [[The New Yorker]], 13 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Musharraf's speech there was another factor that postponed the CCS plans of an immediate war. Pakistan had removed most of terrorist training camps from Pakistan administered Kashmir in January; this meant that to achieve militarily significant results the Indian forces would have to cross the international border. This would have been risky as it would show India as an aggressor and could have invited global intervention on Kashmir. It was decided by CCS to give Musharraf another chance but the armed forces were kept fully mobilised for war.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

== Kaluchak Massacre ==
Tensions escalated significantly in May. On 14 May, three suicidal terrorists attacked an Army camp at [[Kaluchak]] near [[Jammu]] and [[Kaluchak Massacre|killed 34 people]] and injured fifty more before getting killed, most of the victims were the wives and children of Indian soldiers serving in Kashmir. The terrorist incident again revived the chance of a full blown war.&lt;ref name="nys"/&gt; 

On 15 May, PM Vajpayee was quoted in the Indian Parliament saying "''Hamein pratikar karna hoga ( We will have to counter it).''"&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt; American [[Secretary of State|Foreign Minister]] [[Richard Armitage (naval officer)|Armitage]] quoted the incident as a trigger for further deterioration of the situation.&lt;ref name="nys"/&gt; 

Indian Cabinet had little belief that diplomatic pressure could stop Pakistan's support for the militants in Kashmir. India accused Pakistan that it was failing to keep its promise on ending the cross-border terrorism.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt; Musharraf's follow-up to his speech on January 12th was observed by India as weak and disingenuous. Pakistan did not extradite the terrorist leaders demanded by India, and Lashkar was allowed to continue its operations in Pakistan as a charity with a new name. During the spring, jihadi militants started crossing the Line of Control again.&lt;ref name="nys"/&gt; 

==June Offensive==
===Planning===
On May 18, Vajpayee reviewed the preparedness with the Defence Minister Fernandez, Director-General Military Operations and Military Intelligence Chief. The CCS met and favoured taking military action against terrorists in Pakistan. A limited military action similar to the one planned in January was not considered viable as Pakistan had strengthened its forces on the LoC. Any action limited to Pakistan administered Kashmir would only have limited military gains. Indian military favoured an offensive along the Indo-Pak border that will stretch the Pakistani troops and provide India an access to Pakistan administered Kashmir.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt; 

The Indian armed forces accordingly prepared the plan to target the war waging capabilities of Pakistan and destroy the terrorist camps. The battle canvas planned for June was larger than the one planned in January. The Indian Air Force along with 1 Strike Corps of Indian would initiate attack in Shakargarh bulge to engage Pakistan's Army Reserve North (ARN) that was spread from Muzaffarabad to Lahore. This would engage Pakistan's key strike corp while Indian strike formations from Eastern command would carry out the offensive at the Line of Control and capture the strategic positions used by the terrorists for infiltrations. The period considered was between 23 May and 10 June.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

=== Military Confrontations ===
During the end of May 2002, the Indian and Pakistani armed forces continued to be fully mobilized.

=== Threat of nuclear war ===
As both [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] are armed with nuclear weapons, the possibility a [[conventional war]] could escalate into a [[Nuclear war|nuclear one]] was raised several times during the standoff. Various statements on this subject were made by Indian and Pakistani officials during the conflict, mainly concerning a [[no first use]] policy. Indian [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|External Affairs Minister]] [[Jaswant Singh]] said on 5 June that India would not use nuclear weapons first,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_2002_June_3/ai_86623659 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205194211/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_2002_June_3/ai_86623659 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 December 2008 |title=India will not use nuclear weapons first: Singh |work=BNET |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Musharraf said on 5 June he would not [[Nuclear doctrine of Pakistan|renounce]]  Pakistan's right to use [[nuclear weapon]]s first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2002/06/05/story29703.asp Irish Examiner&amp;nbsp;– 2002/06/05: "Musharraf refuses to renounce first use of nuclear weapons"&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929150119/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2002/06/05/story29703.asp|date=29 September 2007}}, [[Irish Examiner]], 5 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; There was also concern that a 6 June 2002 [[asteroid]] explosion over Earth, known as the  [[Eastern Mediterranean Event]], could have caused a nuclear conflict had it exploded over India or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/deepimpact-02s.html |title=Near-Earth Objects Pose Threat, General Says |publisher=Spacedaily.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-01 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20021201192527/http://www.spacedaily.com/news/deepimpact-02s.html |archive-date=1 December 2002 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy===
Vajpayee contacted the leaders of the global community including Bush, Blair, [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] and informed them Musharraf could not deliver on his January 12 speech and the patience of the country was running out.  In the diplomacy that followed, Bush, Putin, Blair and [[Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] requested Vajpayee to avoid taking the extreme step. The global community informed India that it would negotiate with Musharraf to clarify his position on stopping of the cross-border infiltration.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;  

Attempts to defuse the situation continued. The [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] tried to mediate a solution, but in vain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2002-06-03-10-putin-66287377/541040.html "Putin Attempts to Mediate India-Pakistan Tensions"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110040146/http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2002-06-03-10-putin-66287377/541040.html |date=10 November 2013 }}, ''[[VOA]]'', 3 June 2002. Retrieved on 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Restraint was urged by the global community as there were fears that Pakistan would proceed to use its nuclear weapons in the face to counter its conventional asymmetry as compared to the Indian armed forces. In April, in an interview to German magazine [[Der Spiegel]] Musharraf had already hinted that he was willing to use nukes against India. Pakistan's nuclear threats led to US [[Secretary of State]] Powell contacting Musharraf at five occasions in the last week of May and reading the riot act.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

On 5 June American Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage visited Pakistan. He asked Musharraf if he would "permanently" end cross-border infiltration and help to dismantle the infrastructure used for terrorism. On June 6 Musharraf 's commitment was conveyed to Powell, and to India after his arrival. On June 10, Powell announced Musharraf's promise to the global community. After which India called off its strike plans.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

A full-frontal invasion would have translated into war. Political logic implied it was better to give another chance to Musharraf. The military build-up on the border by India in January and June had forced both the international community and Pakistan into action.&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"/&gt;

== July-August strikes ==
On July 29, 2002 for the first time after the end of Kargil war India used air power to attack positions held by the Pakistani forces at Loonda Post on the Indian side of the Line of Control in the Machil sector. Eight IAF [[Mirage 2000]] H aircraft dropped precision-guided bombs weighing 1,000-pounds to destroy four bunkers that were occupied by Pakistan. The forward trenches prepared by Indian troops in earlier years were also occupied by the Pakistani forces and 155-millimetre [[Bofors howitzer]]s were used to hit them. According to Indian military intelligence officials at least 28 Pakistani soldiers were killed in the fighting. The air assault was conducted in daylight and to demonstrate India's willingness to escalate the conflict in response to provocations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1918/19180220.htm When Pakistan took Loonda Post] ''Frontline'' Volume 19 - Issue 18, August 31 - September 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani army troops stationed near the post in Kupwara sector's Kel area of the LOC had  been shelling the Indian positions across the LOC. India suspected a troop build up situation near the border post that was similar to Kargil. Indian army planned a retaliation by sending troops to attack the Pakistani posts. After deliberations with the then Army Chief, General Sundararajan Padmanabhan, the plan was modified and instead of only a ground assault, the decision was made to first attack Pakistani positions using the IAF jets followed by a ground assault by the Indian Special Forces. At 1:30 pm on 2 August, IAF's No. 1 Tiger Squadron of Mirage 2000 H fighter aircraft loaded with laser guided weapons bombed the Pakistani bunkers located in the Kel. The attack destroyed the bunkers with an unknown number of casualty. Pakistani troops then opened heavy artillery fire on the Indian posts.  The Indian Special forces then followed up to kill the remaining Pakistani soldiers.&lt;ref name="HuffStrike"&gt;{{cite news |title=EXCLUSIVE: In 2002, India's Fighter Jets Hit Pakistan In A Surgical Strike You've Never Been Told About |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/01/26/exclusive-in-2002-india-s-fighter-jets-hit-pakistan-in-a-surgi_a_21701344/ |accessdate=9 September 2018 |publisher=Huffington Post |date=27 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909221838/https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/01/26/exclusive-in-2002-india-s-fighter-jets-hit-pakistan-in-a-surgi_a_21701344/ |archive-date=9 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IT_Twice"&gt;{{cite news |title=Twice in 2002, India was on the verge of striking against Pakistan.

==Easing of Tension==
While tensions remained high throughout the next few months, both governments began easing the situation in Kashmir.  By October 2002, India had begun to demobilize their troops along her border and later Pakistan did the same, and in November 2003 a cease-fire between the two nations was signed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/ceasefire-violation-pak-continues-firing-for-seventh-day-233448 "India-Pakistan Ceasefire Agreement"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111074126/http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/ceasefire-violation-pak-continues-firing-for-seventh-day-233448 |date=11 January 2013 }}, ''[[NDTV]]''.

== Biography ==
Andrey Shmalko was born in [[Kharkiv]], [[Soviet Ukraine]], on March 18, 1958. He began writing poetry in 1970, and wrote his first novel while at school. His first pen name was Alexander Nexø. From 1978 till early 2000s he was participating in different archaeological expeditions exploring the sites of [[Khazar]] culture, [[Scythians|Scythian]] burial mounds, Genoese castle and especially his favourite [[Chersonesus]], an ancient Greek colony founded approximately 2,500 years ago in the south-western part of the [[Crimean Peninsula]].

In 1980 he graduated from [[Kharkiv National University]] and became a school teacher of history. From 1982 till 1985 he was a post-graduate student at the Department of Ancient and Medieval History of Kharkiv National University. In 1985 he defended his PhD dissertation in Ancient History, ''Roman Policy in the Southern [[Black Sea]] Region in the 1st Century BC''. From 1985 to 1992 he taught history at Kharkiv University of Arts, also known as the Kharkiv Conservatory, where he introduced the first course of the [[Bible]] Studies in [[Ukraine]] that used to be a primarily atheistic state during the [[Soviet]] times.

In 1992 he finished his novel ''The Oversteps'', which was published in 1995 under the pen name of '''Andrey Valentinov'''.&lt;ref&gt;Андреева Юлия.

Valentinov is married.

== Main Images and Motifs ==

Valentinov creates his fictional world with the help of the repeating themes, images and motifs. One of them is about the people or race of Dhars (other names: Dars, Dergs, Logres and Chugs; Russian: дхары, дары, дэрги, логры, чуги). The etymology of their names might be [[Aryan]] (Dhars or Dars, compare with the Slavic ''dar'' – gift, talent), Eastern (Dergs), Celtic ([[Logres]], also Logris or Loegria is the name of [[King Arthur]]'s realm) or Slavic (chugs as diminutive for chugaisters or chugasters, kind wood goblins for Western Ukrainians living in the [[Carpathians]]). According to Valentinov, they are ambiguous creatures: half human, half bearlike, whose origin is very ancient and mysterious. The Dhars live in different places of the world and are endangered because of many enemies, from ignorant cruel people to the evil forces. They keep ancient secret knowledge and have psychic abilities. They usually look like humans, but some of them can transform into werebears. The Dhars might be the descendants of fallen angels and human females. Valentinov suggests that King Arthur whose name meant “bear” was one of them. They are presented in many Valentinov's books, especially in the Logrian series and ''The Eye of Power'' Series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1144">'''Aufidius Bassus''' was a Roman [[historian]] who lived in the reign of [[Tiberius]].

His work, which probably began with the [[Roman civil wars]] or the death of [[Julius Caesar]], was continued by [[Pliny the Elder]]. Pliny the Elder carried it down at least as far as the end of [[Nero]]'s reign. Bassus' other historical work was a ''Bellum Germanicum'', which was published before his ''Histories''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bassus, Aufidius|volume=3|page=498}} Endnotes:
* Pliny, ''Nat. Hist.'', praefatio, 20
* [[Tacitus]], ''[[Dialogus de Oratoribus]]'', 23
* [[Quintilian]], Instit x. I. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Elder]] speaks highly of Bassus as an historian; however, the fragments preserved in that writer's ''Suasoriae'' (vi. 23) relating to the death of [[Cicero]] are characterized by an [[Affect (linguistics)|affected]] style.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The '''Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party''' ({{lang-ar|حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي}} ''{{transl|ar|Ḥizb Al-Ba‘ath Al-‘Arabī Al-Ishtirākī}}'' {{IPA-ar|ˈħɪzb alˈbaʕaθ alˈʕarabiː alˈʔɪʃtɪraːkiː|}}) was a political party founded in [[Syria]] by [[Michel Aflaq]], [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], and associates of [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]]. The party espoused [[Ba'athism]] (from {{lang-ar|البعث}} ''Al-Ba'ath'' or ''Ba'ath'' meaning "renaissance" or "resurrection"), which is an ideology mixing [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]], [[pan-Arabism]], [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]], and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] interests. Ba'athism calls for unification of the [[Arab world]] into a single state. Its motto, "Unity, [[Liberty]], [[Socialism]]", refers to Arab unity, and freedom from non-Arab control and interference.

The party was founded by the merger of the [[Arab Ba'ath Movement]], led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, and the [[Arab Ba'ath]], led by al-Arsuzi, on 7 April 1947 as the '''Arab Ba'ath Party'''. The party quickly established branches in other Arab countries, although it would only hold power in [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]. The Arab Ba'ath Party merged with the [[Arab Socialist Movement]], led by [[Akram al-Hawrani]], in 1952 to form the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. The newly formed party was a relative success, and became the second-largest party in the Syrian parliament in the [[Syrian parliamentary election, 1954|1954 election]]. This, coupled with the increasing strength of the [[Syrian Communist Party]], led to the establishment of the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR), a union of Egypt and Syria. The union would prove unsuccessful, and a Syrian coup in 1961 dissolved it.

Following the break-up of the UAR, the Ba'ath Party was reconstituted. However, during the UAR, military activists had established the Military Committee to take control of the Ba'ath Party from civilian hands. In the meantime, in Iraq, [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|the local Ba'ath Party branch]] had taken power by orchestrating and leading the [[Ramadan Revolution]], only to [[November 1963 Iraqi coup d'état|lose power a couple of months later]]. The Military Committee, with Aflaq's consent, took power in Syria in the [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|8th of March Revolution]] of 1963.

A power struggle quickly developed between the civilian faction led by Aflaq, al-Bitar, and [[Munif Razzaz|Munif al-Razzaz]] and the Military Committee led by [[Salah Jadid]] and [[Hafez al-Assad]]. As relations between the two factions deteriorated, the Military Committee initiated the [[1966 Syrian coup d'état]], which ousted the National Command led by al-Razzaz, Aflaq, and their supporters. The 1966 coup split the Ba'ath Party between the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Iraqi-dominated Ba'ath movement]] and the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Syrian-dominated Ba'ath movement]].

==History==
{{main article|History of the Ba'ath Party}}

The party was founded on 7 April 1947 as the Arab Ba'ath Party by [[Michel Aflaq]] (an [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antiochian]] [[Christian]]), [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]] (a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]]), and the followers of [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]] (an [[Atheism|atheist]]) in [[Damascus]], Syria, leading to the establishment of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Syrian Regional Branch]].{{sfn|George|2003|p=66}} Other regional branches were established throughout the Arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s, in, among others, [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraq]],{{sfn|Polk|2006|p=109}} [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Yemen Region|Yemen]] and [[Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party|Jordan]].{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=98}} Throughout its existence, the National Command (the body responsible for all-Arab affairs), gave most attention to Syrian affairs.{{sfn|George|2003|p=66}} The 2nd National Congress was convened in June 1954, and elected a seven-man National Command; Aflaq, Bitar, and [[Akram al-Hawrani]] were elected and represented the Syrian Regional Branch,{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=10}} while [[Abdullah Rimawi]] and Abdallah Na'was were elected to represent the Jordanian Branch.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=231}} The congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the [[Arab Socialist Movement]] and the Ba'ath Party, which took place in 1952.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=65}}

The Syrian Regional Branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s; in the [[Syrian parliamentary election, 1954|1954 parliamentary elections]] the Syrian Regional Branch won 22 seats in parliament, becoming the second largest party in the country.{{sfn|Kaylani|1972|p=15}} 90 percent of Ba'ath Party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament.{{sfn|Kaylani|1972|p=15}} The failure of the traditional parties represented by the [[People's Party (Syria)|People's Party]] and the [[National Party (Syria)|National Party]], strengthened the Ba'ath Party's public credibility.{{sfn|Kaylani|1972|p=16}} Through this position, the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet; Bitar was appointed [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates (Syria)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and Khalil Kallas became Minister of Economics.{{sfn|Kaylani|1972|p=19}} Its new, strengthened position, was used successfully to garner support for Syria's merger with [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s Egypt, which led to the establishment of the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR) in 1958.{{sfn|Kaylani|1972|pp=19–21}}

On 24 June 1959, [[Fuad al-Rikabi]], the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch, accused the National Command of betraying Arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the UAR.{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=271}} In light of these criticisms, the Ba'ath convened the 3rd National Congress (held 27 August – 1 September 1959), which was attended by delegates from "Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, South Arabia, the Gulf, Arab South, Arab Maghreb, Palestine and Party student organisations in Arab and other universities outside the [Arab] homeland".{{sfn|Ministry of Information|1971|p=33}} The congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch, which had been decided by Aflaq and Bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958,{{sfn|Podeh|1999|p=219}} and for expelling Rimawi, the Regional Secretary of the Jordanian Regional Branch.{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=497}} Rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party, the [[Arab Socialist Revolutionary Ba'ath Party]], which established a rival National Command to compete with the original.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=203}} The National Command responded to the problems in Iraq by appointing a Temporary Regional Command on 2 February 1960, which appointed [[Talib El-Shibib]] as Regional Secretary,{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=271}} and on 15 June 1961 the National Command expelled Rikabi from the party.{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=271}}

In Iraq, the Iraqi Regional Branch had supported [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]]'s seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the Iraqi Monarchy.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=24–25}} The Iraqi Ba'athists supported Qasim on the ground that they believed he would enter Iraq into the UAR, enlarging the Arab nationalist republic.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=24–25}} However, this was proven to be a ruse, and after taking power Qasim launched an Iraq first policy.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=24–25}} In retaliation, the Ba'ath Party tried to assassinate Qasim in February 1959, but the operation (which was led by a young [[Saddam Hussein]]) failed.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|p=29}} Qasim was overthrown in the [[Ramadan Revolution]] led by young Ba'athist officer [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], and rumoured to be supported by the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|p=40}} Declassified documents and the testimony of former CIA officers indicate there was no direct American involvement, although the CIA had been previously notified of an earlier Ba'athist coup plot in July 1962 by a high-ranking informant within the Party. The CIA official working with [[Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.|Archie Roosevelt, Jr.]] on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against Qasim, and who later became the head of the CIA's operations in Iraq and Syria "from late 1968 to June 1970," has "denied any involvement in the Ba'ath Party's actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Bryan R.|title=Sold Out? US Foreign Policy, Iraq, the Kurds, and the Cold War|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-48711-7|pp=xxi, 45, 49, 57–58, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi Regional Branch, when it took power, was so riven by factionalism that its purported allies launched a counter-coup forcing them out of power in November 1963.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=44–46}}

The 4th National Congress, held in August 1960, criticized the leadership of Aflaq and Bitar, called for the reestablishment of the Syrian Regional Branch and deemphasized the party's commitment to Arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=66}}{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=24}} A year after, at the UAR's nadir in Syria, the Syrian General [[Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi]] launched a coup on 28 September 1961, which led to the reestablishment of the Syrian Arab Republic.&lt;ref name="USDoS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3580.htm|title=Background Note: Syria|work=[[United States Department of State]], Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs|date=May 2007|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule in Syria, infighting, the 1966 coup and split: 1963–1966===
The challenges of building a Ba'athist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle within the party.{{sfn|DeFronzo|2009|p=61}} The Iraqi Regional Branch was increasingly dominated by Ali Salih al-Sadi, a self-described [[Marxism|Marxist]].{{sfn|DeFronzo|2009|p=61}} He was supported in his ideological reorientation by [[Hammud al-Shufi]], the Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Branch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=[https://books.google.com/books?ei=dcemTqu4I4Hz-gaypoGjDw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=ciQ-AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22sa%27di%22+choufi&amp;q=shoufi#search_anchor 473]|title=[[The Spectator]]|volume=212|publisher=|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yasin al-Hafiz, one of the party’s few ideological theorists, and by certain members of the secret Military Committee.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=87}} The Marxist-wing gained new ground at the 6th National Congress (held in October 1963), in which the Iraqi and Syrian regional branches called for the establishment of "socialist planning",{{sfn|Ali|2004|p=105}} "[[Collective farming|collective farms]] run by peasants", "workers' democratic control of the means of production", and other demands reflecting a certain emulation of [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet-style socialism]].{{sfn|Hiro|1982|p=143}} Aflaq, angry at this transformation of his party, retained a nominal leadership role, but the National Command as a whole came under the control of the radicals.{{sfn|Ali|2004|pp=106–107}}

In 1963 the Ba'ath Party seized power, from then on the Ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized Syrian political party, but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=55}} On 23 February 1966, [[1966 Syrian coup d'état|a coup d'état]] led by [[Salah Jadid]], the informal head of the Military Committee, overthrew Aflaq and the Bitar's cabinet.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=59}} The coup sprung out of factional rivalry between Jadid's "regionalist" (qutri) camp, which promoted ambitions for a [[Greater Syria]] and the more traditionally pan-Arab, in power faction, called the "nationalist" (qawmi) faction.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=59}} Jadid's supporters are considered more left-wing then Aflaq and his peers.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=213}} Several of Jadid's opponents managed to make their escape and fled to [[Beirut]], Lebanon.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=59}} Jadid moved the party in a more radical direction. Although he and his supporters had not been supporters of the victorious far-left line at the 6th Party Congress, they had now moved to adopt its positions.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=213}} The moderate faction, formerly led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, were purged from the party.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=213}}

While it took some years, the 1966 coup resulted in the creation of two competing National Commands, [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|one Syrian-dominated]] and another [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Iraqi-dominated]].{{sfn|Ali|2004|pp=106–107}} However, both in Iraq and Syria, the Regional Command became the real centre of party power, and the membership of the National Command became a largely honorary position, often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership.{{sfn|Ali|2004|pp=106–107}} A consequence of the split was that [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]] took Aflaq's place as the official father of [[ba'athism|Ba'athist thought]] in the pro-Syrian Ba'ath movement, while the pro-Iraqi Ba'ath movement still considered Aflaq the ''[[de jure]]'' father of Ba'athist thought.{{sfn|Bengio|1998|p=218}}

==Organization==
The organizational structure of the Ba'ath Party was created at the 2nd National Congress by amending the party's Internal Regulations ({{transl|ar|An-Nidhāmu-d-Dākhilī}}), which was approved at the party's 1st National Congress in 1947.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=392}} The organizational structure ran from top to bottom, and members were forbidden to initiate contacts between groups on the same level of the organisation—all contacts had to pass through a higher command level.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}}

===National organization===
{{further information|National Command of the Ba'ath Party}}
The National Command was the ruling organ of the party between sessions of the National Congress, and was headed by a Secretary-General.{{sfn|Commins|2004|p=65}} Between National Congresses, the National Command was held accountable by the National Consultative Council (Arabic: ''al-majlis al-istishari al-quami'').{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=231}} The National Consultative Council was a forum made up of representatives from the party's regional branches.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=231}} However, the number of National Consultative Council members were decided by the size of the regional branch.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=231}} The National Congress elected the National Command, National Tribunal, the party's discipline body, and the Secretary-General, the party leader.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=231}} The congress delegates determined the party's policies and procedures.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=231}}

Before 1954, the party was ruled by the Executive Committee, but this organ, along with others too, were replaced at the 2nd National Congress.{{sfn|Commins|2004|p=65}} In Ba'athist jargon "Nation" means the Arab Nation, because of that, the National Command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the Ba'ath movement throughout the Arab world.{{sfn|Commins|2004|p=65}} The National Command had several bureaus, similar to those of the Regional Command.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=231}} National Command sessions were held monthly.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=231}} Of these, the National Liaisons Office was responsible for maintaining contact with the party's Regional Branches.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=148}}

===Regional organization===
The term ''region'' reflected the Party's refusal to acknowledge them as separate nation-states.{{sfn|Choueiri|2004|p=234}} A "Region" (''quṭr''), in Ba'athist parlance, is an Arab state such as Syria, Iraq, or Lebanon.{{sfn|Choueiri|2004|p=234}} The Regional Congress, which combined all the provincial branches, was the region's highest authority and elected a Regional Command, the party leadership in a specific region, the Regional Tribunal, the body responsible for discipline inspection, and a Regional Secretary, the regional party leader.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} The Regional Congress is made of delegates from the provincial branches; other members attended, but as observers.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} The Regional Congress was responsible for evaluating the party's performance since the last Regional Congress, while at the same time formulating new policies for the next period, which lasts until the next Regional Congress is held.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} How long this period lasts is decided by the Regional Command.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} The Regional Command, similar to the Branch Command, operated through bureaus and met for weekly-sessions.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}}

Below the Regional Commands there existed branches.{{sfn|Choueiri|2004|p=234}} The Branch came above the Subbranch; it comprised at least two to five subbranches,{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} and operated at the provincial level.{{sfn|Choueiri|2004|p=234}} The branch held a congress periodically in which it elected a Command and a Secretary (leader).{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} The Command operated through bureaus, such as the Workers Bureau and the Bureau of the Secretariat for instance.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} Underneath the branch was the Subbranch, which was made up of three to five sections, "and was the lowest level of the party to hold a periodical Congress."{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} Some subbranches were independent of central authority, and elected their own Command and secretaries, while other subbranches were incorporated into the Branches.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} In these cases the Subbranch Secretary is appointed by the superior Branch.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}}

A Section, which comprised two to five Divisions, functioned at the level of a large city quarter, a town, or a rural district.{{sfn|Commins|2004|p=65}} It elected its own Command, composed of five members, but the Subbranch appointed the Command's secretary.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}}  Below that there existed divisions.{{sfn|Commins|2004|p=65}} A division comprised two to seven Circles, controlled by a Division Commander.{{sfn|Commins|2004|p=65}} Such Ba'athist groups occurred throughout the bureaucracy and the military. They functioned as the Party’s watchdog and were an effective form of covert surveillance within a public administration.{{sfn|Choueiri|2004|p=234}} The lowest level was the circle. It was composed of three to seven members, constituted the basic organizational unit.{{sfn|Commins|2004|p=65}}

The Military Organization was made up of branches similar to those in the Ba'ath's civilian sector.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} However, unlike the civilian sector the Military Organization was controlled by a separate Military Bureau, and held periodical Military Congresses.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} The Military Organization and the Civilian Organization converged at the Regional Congress.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}}

===Membership===
There existed three types of membership categories in the Ba'ath Party; Active member (Arabic: udw ämil), Apprentice Member (Arabic: udw mutadarrib) and Supporter (Arabic: firqa).{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} An Active member had to attend all formal meetings of his party unit, was given the right to vote in party elections,{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} and could run for party office.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}} In the Syrian Regional Branch a member had to spend 18 months as a Supporter to be promoted to Apprentice status, and then wait another 18 months to be promoted to Active member status.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=230}}

==Ideology and policy==
{{further information|Ba'athism}}
===Classical Ba'ath: 1947–1960===
====Arab Nation====
[[File:Ba'ath Constitution.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the 1947 Ba'ath Party constitution]]
From its very beginning, the party was a manifestation of Arab nationalist thought, with the party itself referring to itself as "The Party of Arab Unity".{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=134}} The party's ideology also excluded and subjugated regional minorities like the Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians and others. The pan-Arab tendencies of the party's predecessor, the [[Arab Ba'ath Movement]], was strengthened 1945–1947 by recruiting members from the [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]]'s Arab Ba'ath.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=135}} The first article of the party's constitution stated "the Arabs form one nation. This nation has the natural right to live in  a single state. [As such,] the Arab fatherland constitutes an indivisible political and economic unit. No Arab can live apart from the others."{{sfn|Claessen|2010|p=24}}

To express his heartfelt belief in Arab nationalism, Aflaq coined the term "one Arab nation with an eternal message" ({{lang-ar|ummah arabiyyah wahidah thatu risalah khalidah}}).{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=30}} Party ideology, and Ba'athism in general, was not based on concepts such as the purity of the Arab race or ethnic chauvinism, but on idealistic thoughts borrowed from the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment era]].{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=30–31}} According to Middle East expert Tabitha Petran, the basic idea of the party's ideology was;{{sfn| Moaddel|2009|p=229}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
that the Arab nation is a permanent entity in history. The Arab nation is considered, philosophically speaking, not as a social and economic formation, but as a transcendent fact inspiring different forms, one of its highest contributions taking the form of [[Islam]]. It was not Islam that modeled the peoples of Arabia, the [[Fertile Crescent]], and [[North Africa]], equipping them with Islamic values, especially the Arabic language and the Arabic culture, but the Arab nation which created Islam. This conception of the Arab nation implicitly advantages the Arab contribution to history. On the other hand, Arab decadence  can be overcome through a purifying and spiritual action, not religious but moral."{{sfn| Moaddel|2009|p=229}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Peasant and workers====
The early Ba'ath gave little attention to the problems facing the peasants and workers.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} As [[Hanna Batatu]] notes, "Aflaq was basically urban in outlook. The peasants never constituted an object of his special concern. In his writing there is scarcely an expression of concentrated interest in the country's husbandsmen."{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} While peasants and issues facing them are mentioned in some of Aflaq's work, there was scarcely any depth given to them or the issues facing them.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} To take an example, in one instance Aflaq states "the [national struggle] ... can only be based on the generality of the Arabs and these will not take part in it if they are exploited."{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} Secondly, Aflaq never had any official enmity towards the traditional [[landlord]]s.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} Issues such as these would only gain prominence when [[Akram al-Hawrani]] became a leading party figure, and when the "transitional Ba'athists" took power.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} Of the four members in the 1st Executive Committee, [[Wahib al-Ghanim]] was the only who paid much attention to the problems of the peasants and workers,{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} because the other members (Aflaq, [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]] and Jalil al-Sayyide) had a [[middle class]] upbringing and upheld middle class values.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|pp=134–136}}

The early party organization never cultivated a deep following in rural areas.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} In fact, at the party's founding congress, only one peasant and one worker were present among the 217 delegates.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} Most of the delegates were either school teacher or students attending universities.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} When the [[Akram al-Hawrani]]'s [[Arab Socialist Movement|Arab Socialist Party]] (ASP) merged with the Ba'ath Party, the majority of ASP members of peasants origins did not join the Ba'ath Party, instead becoming personal followers of Hawrani.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} However, the majority of Ba'ath members were of rural upbringing.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|p=136}} The "Transitional Ba'ath", which grew out of the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch in 1958 dissolution and the Military Committee, were more rural in outlook, policy and ideology.{{sfn|Batatu|1999|pp=144–145}}

===="Unity, liberty, socialism"====
The slogan "Unity, liberty, socialism" is the key tenet in Ba'athist thought.{{sfn|Salem|1994|p=61}} Unity stood for the creation of an independent, strong Arab Nation.{{sfn|Salem|1994|p=61}} [[Liberty]] did not mean [[liberal democracy]], but rather freedom from colonial oppression and [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of thought|thought]].{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=67–68}} Aflaq believed that the Ba'ath Party, at least in theory, would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people,{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=67–68]}} however he did support intra-party democracy.{{sfn|Salem|1994|p=67}} The last tenet, 'socialism', did not mean socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of [[Arab socialism]].{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=69–70}} According to Ba'athist thought, socialism had originated under the rule of [[Muhammad]].{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=69–70}} The original interpretation of Arab socialism did not answer questions such as: how much [[State socialism|state control]] was necessary, or economic equality; but instead focused on freeing the Arab Nation and its people from colonization and oppression in general.{{sfn|Salem|1994|pp=69–70}}

===Transitional Ba'ath: 1960–1964===
====Regionalists versus nationalists====
After the failure of the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR), a union of Egypt and Syria, the Ba'ath Party was divided into two main factions, the Regionalists ({{lang-ar|Qutriyyun}}) and the Nationalists (pan-Arab) ({{lang-ar|gawmiyyun}}).{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=36}} When the union with Egypt collapsed, the Ba'ath Party was put in a difficult position, the party still sought Arab unity, but did not oppose the UAR's dissolution and did not want to seek another union with Egypt under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s rule.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=36}} However, being the unionist party that it was, the party's leaders could not state their position on this issue.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=36}} The end result was that the pro-Arab nationalists within the Ba'ath Party became committed Nasserists, while the more moderate Arab nationalists founded the pro-Nasserite [[Socialist Unionists]] party.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=36}} The third group, led by people disenchanted with both Nasser and the union period, remained in the Ba'ath Party, stopped believing in the feasibility pan-Arabism.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=36}} on 21 February 1962, the National Command issued a new policy regarding the pan-Arab project by first mentioning the successes and failures of the UAR, but ending the statement by calling for the reestablishment of the UAR as a decentralized [[Federation|federal union]] with Nasser's Egypt.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=37}} Many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy, with many members being both disenchanted with pan-Arabism and Aflaq's continued party rule.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=37}}

When the Syrian Regional Branch was reestablished, the majority of its members in the provinces were of communal origins–Druze, Alawi or Ismaili.{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|p=166}} The provincial party members had not been told of the Syrian Regional Branch's dissolution, which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the National Command.{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|p=166}} While its true that in 1962 the Regionalists supported the slogan, adopted at the 5th National Congress, "the renewal of the union with Egypt while taking note of past mistakes", they treated such a slogan as a propaganda slogan, and not as a feasible goal.{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|pp=166–167}}

====The "Arab road to socialism"====
The disillusionment felt among party members on the pan-Arab project, led to the radicalization of the party's interpretation of socialism.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=41}} Yasin al-Hafiz, a former member of the [[Syrian Communist Party]], was an early frontrunner for the party's radicalization.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=41}} While he didn't oppose the pan-Arab project, he wanted to turn the concept of Arab socialism into a [[Scientific socialism|scientific]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] ideology which adapted [[Marxism]] to local conditions.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=41}} [[Jamal al-Atassi]], who had been a moderate socialist for most of his life, called for the renunciation of Arab socialism in 1963 and the adoption of a "virtually Maxist concept of socialism" by claiming that [[Class conflict|class struggle]] was the moving force in society.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|pp=41–42}}

[[Hammud al-Shufi]] became the leader of the party's Marxist faction during his short stint as Syrian Regional Secretary, literally the head of the Syrian Regional Organization.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=77}} Shufi was able, due to his position as head of the Organization Bureau of the [[Regional Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Regional Command]], to recruit several Marxist or Marxist-leaning members to the top of the Syrian Regional party hierarchy.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|pp=77–78}} Radical socialists led by Ali Salih al-Sadi took control of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi Regional Branch]] in 1963, which led to the official radicalization of the party's ideology.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|pp=82–83}}

The delegates at the 6th National Congress elected an Ideology Committee that was responsible to write a charter about the party's ideology.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|pp=84–86}} The end result was the document ''Points of Departure''.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|pp=84–86}} The document, which was approved by the 6th National Congress, relegated Arab unity to a secondary role and gave socialism prominence.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|pp=84–86}} Marxists concepts were used interchangeably alongside Ba'athist ones, however, the document was reluctant in explicitly admitting that certain ideas were of Marxist origins.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=87}} While the ''Points of Departure'' didn't exist a break with party's traditional ideology, it criticized the party's old guard for given Arab unity primary over socialism and their failing in turning Ba'athism into a comprehensive theory.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=87}} While the documents says Arab unity is progressive, the reason for it being important changed.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=88}} The document stated; "Arab unity is an indispensable basis for the construction of a [[Socialist economics|socialist economy]]."{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=88}} Aflaq's also believed that Arab unity was only an intermediate goal, but it stood at the centre of classical Ba'athism.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=88}} In the Points of Departure, despite not firmly stating it, the goal of creating a socialist society seemed to be both an immediate goal and the main goal of the party.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=88}}

The concept of Arab socialism, accused of being narrow-minded and nationalistic, was replaced with the "Arab road to socialism" concept.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=88}}  The Points of Departure criticized the classical Ba'athist view regarding [[Private property|private ownership]].{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=88}} Classical Ba'athists supported private ownership as a way to recruit into the party many [[Petite bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] elements.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=89}} The document called for [[nationalization]] of the commanding heights of the economy, the slow incorporation of the petty bourgeoisie into the socialist economy and the elimination of the [[Bourgeoisie|national bourgeoisie]] and its allied classes.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=89}} To safeguard the party from evolving into one supporting [[state capitalism]], the socialist economy would be controlled by a [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] together with popular participation from the toiler masses.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=89}}

===Neo-Ba'ath: 1964–1966===
{{further information|Ba'athism#Neo-Ba'athism}}
[[Ba'athism#Neo-Ba'athism|Neo-Ba'athism]] is a term used to describe the dramatic changes that manifested in Ba'athist ideology from 1960 to 1964, and the Military Committee's takeover of the Syrian Regional Branch and the National Command in the period 1964 to 1966.{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|pp=170–175}} The 6th National Congress signified the takeover of the party by an anti-militarist left, which opposed both the traditional leaders in the National Command and the pragmatists in the Military Committee.{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|pp=174–175}} When the anti-military left called for [[popular democracy]], no involvement of the military in national politics and popular struggle, the Military Committee became concerned.{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|p=175}} By 1965 the anti-military leftists began to "spread rumors about the rightist character of the military junta [Military Committee] within the party and their subversive efforts to engulf it. There was not a single officer in the party who was not accused of conspiracy and reactionary tendencies."{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|p=177}} In collaboration with the National Command the Military Committee succeeded in expelling the anti-military left from the party at the 7th National Congress.{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|p=179}} The Military Committee, which now controlled the Syrian Regional Branch, took control of the Ba'ath Party in the [[1966 Syrian coup d'état|coup of 1966]].{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|p=180}} According to Middle East expert Avraham Ben-Tzur "the [neo-]Ba'th in its latest variant is a bureaucratic apparatus headed by the military, whose daily life and routine are shaped by the rigid military oppression on the home front, and [Soviet aid among others] military aid."{{sfn|Ben-Tzur|1968|p=181}}

==Regional branches==
===Iraq===
{{main article|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region}}
[[Fuad al-Rikabi]] founded the Iraqi Regional Branch in 1951{{sfn|Polk|2006|p=109}} or 1952.{{sfn|Ghareeb|Dougherty|2004|p=194}} There are those who trace the branch's founding to Abd ar Rahman ad Damin and Abd al Khaliq al Khudayri in 1947, after their return from the 1st National Congress, which was held in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Metz, Helen Chapin|url=http://countrystudies.us/iraq/77.htm|title=Iraq — Politics: The Baath Party|location=|publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version is that the branch was established in 1948 by Rikabi and Sa'dun Hamadi, a [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Muslim]].{{sfn|Sheffer|Ma'oz|2002|p=174}} However, Efraim Karsh and Inari Rautsi contend that the Regional Branch was established in the 1940s, but that it received official recognition as a Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party in 1952 by the National Command.{{sfn|Karsh|Rautsi|1991|p=13}} What is certain is that Rikabi was elected the Regional Branch's first Regional Secretary in 1952.{{sfn|Sheffer|Ma'oz|2002|p=174}}

The party initially consisted of a majority of Shia Muslims, as Rikabi recruited supporters mainly from his friends and family, but slowly became [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] dominated.{{sfn|Nakash|2003|p=136}} The Regional Branch, and other parties of pan-Arab inclination, had difficulties in recruiting Shia members.{{sfn|Dawisha|2005|p=174}} Most Shi'ites considered pan-Arab ideology as a Sunni project, since the majority of Arabs are Sunnis.{{sfn|Dawisha|2005|p=174}}

At the time of [[14 July Revolution]] in 1958, which overthrew the [[Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite monarchy]], the Regional Branch had 300 members.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|p=22}} The Iraqi Regional Branch supported [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]]'s rule on the grounds that he would seek Iraq's entry into the [[United Arab Republic]].{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=24–25}} Of the 16-members of Qasim's cabinet, 12 of them were Regional Branch members.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=24–25}} After taking power, Qasim's change his position on the UAR, reverting to the old "Iraq first policy".{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=24–25}} This turn displeased the Regional Branch and other Arab nationalists groups.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=25–26}} Because of his policy reversal, the Regional Branch gathered a group, led by [[Saddam Hussein]], which tried but failed to assassinate Qasim.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|p=26}}

The Regional Branch seized power in the [[Ramadan Revolution]].{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|p=39}} The coup was led by leading Regional Branch member [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]].{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|p=39}} The plotters appointed [[Abdul Salam Arif]], a Nasserite, to the [[President of Iraq|Presidency]] while al-Bakr was appointed the [[Prime Minister of Iraq|country's Prime Minister]].{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|p=41}} However, real power was in the hands of Ali Salih al-Sadi, the branch's Regional Secretary.{{sfn|Mufti|1996|p=161}} After taking power, the Regional Branch through its militia, the National Guard, initiated what Iraqi expert Con Coughlin referred to as an "orgy of violence" against [[Communism|communist]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] elements.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|p=41}} These repressive measures coupled with factionalism within the Regional Branch led to the [[November 1963 Iraqi coup d'état]] by President Arif and his Nasserite supporters.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|p=44}} Iraq expert Malik Mufti believes Aflaq may have supported Arif's coup because it weakened al-Sadi's position within the party and strengthened his own.{{sfn|Mufti|1996|p=165}} The coup forced the branch to go underground.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=46–48}} Because of the coup, several leading Ba'athist were jailed, such as al-Bakr and Saddam.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=46–48}} Despite this, the Regional Branch elected al-Bakr as Regional Secretary in 1964.{{sfn|Coughlin|2005|pp=46–48}}

===Jordan===
{{further|Arab Ba'ath Progressive Party|Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party}}
Following the party's establishment in Syria, Ba'athist ideas spread throughout the Arab world. In Jordan Ba'athist thought first spread to the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank]] in the late-1940s, most notably at universities.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=135}} While the Regional Branch was not formed until 1951, several meetings took place at the universities where students and professors alike would discuss the Ba'athist thought.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=135}} Despite the ideology being very popular, it took time before the actual Regional Branch was established.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} A group of teachers established the Regional Branch in the city by [[Al-Karak]].{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} At the very beginning, the clinic owned by Abd al-Rahman Shuqyar was used as the branch's meeting place.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} Bahjat Abu Gharbiyah became the Regional Branch's first member in the [[West Bank]], and was thus resigned the responsibility of building the party's organization in the area the branch secretary in the West Bank, and was thus responsible in that area.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} In the West Bank, the branch was most active in the cities of [[Jerusalem]] and [[Ramallah]].{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}}

The 1st Regional Congress was held in 1951 in the home of [[Abdullah Rimawi]].{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} The congress mapped out the "future course of the party".{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} The next year, the 2nd Regional Congress was held, this time in Abdallah Na'was' home.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} It elected a Regional Command and appointed Rimawi as the branch's Regional Secretary.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} Shugyar, Gharbiyah and Na'was agreed to serve in the Regional Branch's Central Committee.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} Rimawi and Na'was, his deputy, would prove effective leaders.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} Shortly after the 2nd Regional Congress, the branch launched a successful recruitment campaign in Jordanian and Palestinian neighbourhoods and cities.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} On 28 August 1956 the branch was legalized by a High Court.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|pp=136–137}}

Both Rimawi and Na'was were [[Parliament of Jordan|elected to Parliament]] in the [[Jordanian general election, 1950|1950]] and [[Jordanian general election, 1951|1951 elections]] as [[Independent (politics)|independents]] (the branch was not a legal party at the time).{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=137}} In the 1951 election, the branch managed to elect three members to parliament.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=135}} Rimawi was able to retain his seat in parliament until the [[Jordanian general election, 1956|1956 election]].{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}} None of these elections can be considered democratic.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=175}} Shuqyar, during the 1951 elections, was imprisoned by the authorities because his views were deemed to radical.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=175}} Less than a month before the election day, the British Embassy in Amman had estimated that Shuqyar would gain an easy victory.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=175}} However, because of the undemocratic nature of the election, Shuqyar was not elected.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=175}}  As voting patterns would prove, voters who voted for Ba'athist candidates lived in [[Irbid]] and [[Amman]] on the East Bank, and Jerusalem and [[Nablus]] on the West Bank.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=136}}

Shuqyar during a government-imposed exile to Southern Jordan, used his spare time reading Marxist and [[Leninism|Leninist]] literature.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=137}} While he never became a communist, Shuqyar began to support communist concepts.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=137}} On his return from exile he tried to persuade the Regional Branch to join in an electoral front with the [[Jordanian Communist Party]].{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=137}} However, the Regional Branch leaders Rimawi, Na'was, Gharbiyah and [[Munif al-Razzaz]] opposed such an idea, and because of it, Shuqyar left the Ba'ath Party.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=137}}

Rimawi and Na'was were elected to the National Command at the 2nd National Congress (held in 1952).{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=231}} At the 6th and 7th National Congress, the Regional Branch elected Razzaz to the National Command.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=227}}

===Lebanon===
{{Main article|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Lebanon Region}}
The Lebanese Regional Branch was formed in 1949–1950.{{sfn|Seddon|2004|p=85}} During the existence of the UAR, the Regional Branch was split into two factions, those supporting Nasser and those opposing him.{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=497}} However, in April 1960, the UAR denied the Regional Branch organ ''As Sahafäh'' access into the UAR-ruled Syria.{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=497}}

The Regional Branch was strongest in the city of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=356}} In the [[Lebanese general election, 1960|1960 elections]], [[Abd al-Majid al-Rafei]] was just a few votes short of being elected to parliament.{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=356}} However, a persistent problem for him during his election campaign was the vocal criticism of him and the Regional Branch by the [[Lebanese Communist Party]].{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=356}} In Tripoli the Communists supported the candidacy of [[Rashid Karami]], to ensure themselves of a Regional Branch victory.{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=348}} On 17 July 1961 a group of rival Ba'athists led by Rimawi opened fire on several of the Regional Branch's members.{{sfn|Oron|1960|p=378}}

During the UAR years, the same factional lines that developed in the Syrian Regional Branch came to the Lebanese Regional Branch.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=23}} At the 4th National Congress (held in Lebanon), which was mainly attended by delegates representing Lebanon, several resolutions with a pronounced anti-Nasser tone were approved.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|pp=23–24}} At the same time, criticism of Aflaq and Bitar was severe, both their leadership records and their ideology were criticized.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=24}} A resolution was approved, which stated that the party leaders [Aflaq, al-Bitar among others had to hastily entered into a union with Egypt, had wrongly dissolved the Syrian Regional Branch in 1958, given pan-Arabism primacy when socialism was the more important, the need to use Marxist, not Ba'athi, tools to analyze the current situation and the need for the party to strengthen their positions amongst the popular classes–the workers, peasants, artisans and shopkeepers.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=24}} Because of the position of the Lebanese Regional Branch, Aflaq at the 5th National Congress invited enough Iraqi Regional Branch delegates to neutralize the Lebanese delegates.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=37}} However, at the same time, the Lebanese Regional Branch opposed Hawrani and his faction.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=39}} At the 6th National Congress, the Lebanese Regional Branch elected Jubrän Majdalani and Khalid al-Ali to the National Command.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=227}}

At the 7th National Congress the National Command in collaboration with the Military Committee either expelled or removed leftists such as those found in the Lebanese Regional Branch from leadership position, and in the most severe cases, expelled them from the party.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=106}} The Lebanese Regional Branch managed to elect three members to the National Command at the 7th National Congress; Majdalani, al-Ali and Abd al-Majid Rafi.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=227}}

===Libya===
{{main|Libyan Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party}}
The Regional Branch was founded in the 1950s{{sfn|Simmons|1993|p=166}} by Amr Taher Deghayes.{{sfn|Wright|1981|p=227}} Ba'athism was a major political force in Libya following the establishment of the [[United Arab Republic]]. Many intellectuals were attracted to Ba'athist ideology during the later years of the [[Kingdom of Libya]]. However, with help from Nasserist propaganda, several Ba'athists changed affiliation and became Nasserists instead.{{sfn|Wright|1981|p=94}} The growth of these pan-Arab ideologies concerned the government, which led to the incarceration of several Nasserist and Ba'athist military officers in the early sixties.{{sfn|Wright|1981|p=96}} The Ba'athist were accused of working to overthrow "the political, economic and social system" of the Kingdom; the sentences ranged from everything to eight months to two years.{{sfn|Simmons|1993|p=161}} By 1964, the Libyan Regional Branch had only managed to establish one-level below the Regional Command, the branch-level.{{sfn|Devlin|1972|p=18}} Syrian specialist John Devlin estimated that the Libyan Regional Branch had been 50 and 150 members in 1964.{{sfn|Devlin|1972|p=18}}

===Syria===
{{main article|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region}}
Syrian politics took a dramatic turn in 1954 when the military government of [[Adib Shishakli]] was overthrown and the democratic system restored. The Ba'ath, now a large and popular organisation, won 15 out of 142 parliamentary seats in the [[Syrian parliamentary election, 1954|Syrian election]] that year, becoming the second-largest party in parliament. Aside from the [[Syrian Communist Party]] (SCP), the Ba'ath Party was the only party able to organise mass protests among workers.{{sfn|Peretz|1994|p=413}} The party was supported by the [[intelligentsia]] due to their pro-Egyptian and [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] stance along with their advocation of social reform.{{sfn|Finer|Stanley|2009|p=149}}

The Ba'ath faced considerable competition from ideological competitors, notably the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]] (SSNP), which supported the establishment of a [[Greater Syria]]. The Ba'ath Party's main adversary was the SCP, whose support for class struggle and internationalism was anathema to the Ba'ath.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=211}} In addition to parliamentary-level competition, all these parties (as well as [[Islamism|Islamists]]) competed in street-level activity and sought to recruit support among the military.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp=210–211}}

By the end of 1957, the SCP was able to weaken the Ba'ath Party to such an extent that the Ba'ath Party drafted a bill in December that called for a union with Egypt, a move that proved to be very popular.  The Ba'ath leadership dissolved the party in 1958, gambling that the illegalisation of certain parties would hurt the SCP more than it would the Ba'ath.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp=211–212}}

[[File:Hawrani Aflaq 1957.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Akram al-Hawrani]] (left) with [[Michel Aflaq]], 1957.]]
A [[1961 Syrian coup d'état|military coup]] in [[Damascus]] in 1961 brought the UAR to an end.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp=52–53}} Sixteen prominent politicians signed a statement supporting the coup, among them al-Hawrani and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]] (who later retracted his signature).{{sfn|Podeh|1999|pp=152–153}} Following the UAR's dissolution, the Ba'ath Party was reestablished at the 1962 congress.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=55}} The Military Committee did not show itself to the civilian wing of the party at this congress.{{sfn|George|2003|p=68}} During the congress, Aflaq and the Military Committee, through [[Muhammad Umran]], made contact for the first time; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d'état; Aflaq supported the conspiracy.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=75}}

Following the success of the [[Ramadan Revolution]], led by the Ba'ath Party's [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi Regional Branch]], the Military Committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against [[Nazim al-Kudsi]]'s presidency.{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=76–78}} The [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|8 March Revolution]] proved successful, and a Ba'athist government in Syria was established.{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=76–78}} The plotters first order was to establish the [[National Council for the Revolutionary Command]] (NCRC), consisting entirely of Ba'athists and Nasserists, and controlled by military personnel rather than civilians from the very beginning.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=78}}

While the Ba'ath Party had attained power, there was a problem; internal infighting.{{sfn|George|2003|pp=68–69}} The Military Committee, which was itself a tiny minority of the already small Ba'ath Party membership, was forced to rule by force.{{sfn|George|2003|pp=68–69}} The Ba'ath Party had only 2,500 members by mid-1963, the party lacked a popular base. Even if membership expanded, the authoritarian way of ruling it had introduced when coming to power would get worse, not better.{{sfn|George|2003|pp=68–69}}

Another problem was that the civilian wing was riven by infighting between the radical socialist and moderate faction, while the military stood more unified.{{sfn|George|2003|p=69}} Whatever the case, the [[Regional Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Syrian Regional Command]] slowly amassed its powers by weakening the National Command.{{sfn|George|2003|p=69}} This all came to a head in the [[1966 Syrian coup d'état]].{{sfn|George|2003|p=69}}

===Others===
Following the Ba'ath Party's founding, regional branches were established in [[Kuwait]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].{{sfn|Goldman|2002|p=60}} Not long after it established branches in [[North Yemen]] and [[Protectorate of South Arabia|South Yemen]].{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=169}} In [[Tunisia]], a [[Tunisian Ba'ath Movement|Regional Branch]] was established in the 1950s, but was forced underground for much of its existence.&lt;ref name="underground"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tunisia-live.net/2012/01/04/tunisian-baath-party-celebrates-5th-anniversary-of-saddam-husseins-death/|publisher=Tunisia-live.net|title=Tunisian Baath Party Celebrates 5th Anniversary of Saddam Hussein’s Death|date=4 January 2012|accessdate=19 February 2012|author=Ajmi, Sana|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310042933/http://www.tunisia-live.net/2012/01/04/tunisian-baath-party-celebrates-5th-anniversary-of-saddam-husseins-death/|archivedate=10 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saudi Regional Branches elected Ali Ghannäm to represent them at the 7th National Command.{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=227}} While its currently unknown which side the Saudi Ba'ath took after the 1966 split, it published a newspaper, ''Sawt al-Tal‘iyya'', from 1973 to 1980. It was an ardent critic of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]] and [[American imperialism]]. The majority of its members were [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/CTC_EmbattledInArabia_ShiisAndThePoliticsOfConfrontationInSaudiArabia.pdf|publisher=Human Security Gateway|title=Embattled in Arabia |accessdate=20 February 2012|date=3 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222114159/http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/CTC_EmbattledInArabia_ShiisAndThePoliticsOfConfrontationInSaudiArabia.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1963, Ba'ath cells were being established in Sudan, and there were even rumours that a Ba'ath cell had been established in Egypt.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=90}}

'''Baburam Acharya''' ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]: बाबुराम आचार्य) (1888–1971) was a [[Nepal]]ese historian and literary scholar who coined the name ''[[Mount Everest|Sagarmatha]]'' (सगरमाथा), for the mountain better known as [[Mount Everest]] or Chomolungma (in [[Sherpa language]]; Quomolungma  in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Datta, Amaresh. Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature. Vol. 1, A-Devo. New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, 1987. {{OCLC|34346316}} p.807.&lt;/ref&gt;

His main work was the study of ancient Nepalese inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Regmi, D. R. Inscriptions of Ancient Nepal. New Delhi: Abhinav Publications, 1983. {{ISBN|978-0-391-02559-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Baburam Acharya is known as the "ITIHAS SIROMANI" of Nepal.{{explain|date=May 2017}}

==Sagarmatha==  
Nepal’s eminent historian late Baburam Acharya is credited with the Nepali name Sagarmatha for Mount Everest that straddles Nepal-China border. Nepal had no official name of its own for the world’s tallest peak in Nepali (although official name among many Nepalese peoples - Sherpa, Limbu, etc., existed long ago) until the historian found out one. What may not be true however is that he coined the name for the mountain (as is put in the Wikipedia under his name).
Baburam wrote an essay in late 1930s in which he said that among the local populace of the remote Everest region the mountain was popular by the name Sagarmatha (meaning the Head of the Earth touching the Heaven); some even called it Jhomolongma. 
In his own words:
{{Cquote|In the map of Nepal published by the then Survey of India Office, the name of the tallest peak of the Himalayan Mountain range was written as Mount Everest.  In the map's second edition, the peak had two names: Mount Everest and the Tibetan name Chomolongma; but there was no Nepalese name was there.  With a view to providing a Nepalese name, especially for the map, an investigative essay entitled as Sagarmatha or Jhomolongma was published in the Sharada, a Nepalese-language monthly.}}
The then rulers of Nepal took exception of publication of the essay and its publication, and the historian was admonished. In his book ''A Brief Account of Nepal'', Baburam wrote
{{Cquote|I was charged with attempting to bring about insult to the British by giving a Nepalese name to the peak already named after 'our friends,' and nearly deported from the country for publishing the article...}}
In his another book ''China, Tibet and Nepal'' Baburam wrote: "The name Sagarmatha already existed; I only discovered it; it is not that I christened the mountain with a new name."

Two decades after publication of the essay, the Nepalese government gave official recognition to the name.

'''Burgenland''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbʊʁɡen̩lant|-|Burgenland.ogg}}; {{lang-hu|Őrvidék}}; {{lang-hr|Gradišće}}; {{lang-sl|Gradiščanska}}; {{lang-cz|Hradsko}};  is the easternmost and least populous [[Bundesland (Austria)|state]] of [[Austria]]. It consists of two [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] and seven rural districts, with in total 171 municipalities. It is {{convert|166|km|abbr=on}} long from north to south but much narrower from west to east ({{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} wide at [[Sieggraben]]). The region is part of the [[Centrope]] Project.

==Geography==
Burgenland is the seventh largest of Austria's nine [[States of Austria|states]], or ''Bundesländer'', at {{convert|3,962|km²|abbr=on}}. The highest point in the province is on the [[Geschriebenstein]], whose summit is {{convert|884|m|ft}} above sea level, but the highest point in Burgenland itself is 879 metres above sea level; the lowest point (which is also the lowest point of [[Austria]]) at {{convert|114|m|ft}}, is in the municipal area of [[Apetlon]].

Burgenland borders the Austrian state of [[Styria]] to the southwest, and the state of [[Lower Austria]] to the northwest. To the east it borders [[Hungary]] ([[Vas County]] and [[Győr-Moson-Sopron County]]). In the extreme north and south there are short borders with [[Slovakia]] ([[Bratislava Region]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Mura Statistical Region]]) respectively.

Burgenland and Hungary share the [[Neusiedler See]], a lake known for its reeds and shallowness, as well as its mild climate throughout the year. The Neusiedler See is Austria's largest lake, and is a great tourist attraction, bringing ornithologists, sailors, and wind and kite surfers into the region north of the lake.

==Politics==
{{main|Burgenland state election, 2015}}
Burgenland's state assembly ''(Landtag)'' has 36 seats. At the election held on [[Burgenland state election, 2015|31 May 2015]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ) won 15 seats, the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) won 11 seats, the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FPÖ) won 6 seats, the [[Austrian Green Party|Green Party]] won 2 seats and the [[List Burgenland]] won 2 seats as well. The provincial government is a coalition of the SPÖ and the FPÖ. The [[voting age]] for regional elections in Burgenland was reduced to 16 in 2003.

==Administrative divisions==
Burgenland consists of nine [[districts of Austria|districts]], two [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory cities]] and seven rural districts. From north to south:

==History==
The territory of present-day Burgenland was successively part of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Hun Empire]], the [[Kingdom of the Ostrogoths]], the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Kingdom of Odoacer]], the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], the [[Avar Khaganate]], the [[Frankish Empire]], Dominion Aba belonging to the [[Aba (family)]]; Aba - Koszegi, the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Austrian Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Austria]].

Burgenland is the only Austrian state which has never been part of the [[Archduchy of Austria]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[German Confederation]] nor Austria-Hungary's [[Cisleithania]].

===Prehistory and antiquity===
The first [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples appeared in this region around 3300 BC.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} From the 4th century BC, the area was dominated by [[Celts]] and in the 1st century AD it became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. During Roman administration, it was part of the province of [[Pannonia]], and later part of the provinces of [[Pannonia Superior]] (in the 2nd century) and [[Pannonia Prima]] (in the 3rd century). During the late Roman Empire, Pannonia Prima province was part of larger administrative units, such are [[Diocese of Pannonia]], [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]] and [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]].

=== Early Germanic states ===
[[File:MajorianEmpire.png|thumb|300px|right|Ostrogothic Kingdom in Pannonia]]
The first [[Germanic people]] to settle in this region were the [[Ostrogoths]], who came to Pannonia in AD 380. The Ostrogoths became allies of [[Rome]] and were allowed to settle in Pannonia, being tasked to defend the [[Limes|Roman borders]]. In the 5th century, the area was conquered by the [[Huns]], but after their defeat, an independent Kingdom of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia was formed. The territory of present-day Burgenland became part of the Italian [[Kingdom of Odoacer]], but at the end of the 5th century the Ostrogothic king [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] conquered this kingdom and restored Ostrogothic administration in western Pannonia.

In the 6th century, the territory was included in another Germanic state, the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]]. However, the Lombards subsequently left towards [[Italy]] and the area came under the control of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]]. Briefly in the 7th century, the area was part of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] State of [[Samo]], but was subsequently returned to Avar control. After the Avar defeat at the end of the 8th century, the area became part of the [[Frankish Empire]]. After the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] (or [[Augsburg]]) in 955, new [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlers came to the area.&lt;ref name="Fischer2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry A. Fischer|title=Emigrants and Exiles: Book Three, Volume One|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wb5Wm76_6NsC&amp;pg=PA252|date=23 February 2011|publisher=Author House|isbn=978-1-4567-4365-9|pages=252–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Kingdom of Hungary ===
In 1043 there was a peace treaty between [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] (who later in the same year married [[Agnes de Poitou]], a daughter of Duke [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Guillaume V]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]) and King [[Samuel Aba of Hungary|Samuel Aba]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], whose descendants owned large estates in western Slavonia and whose relative later married a daughter of Agnes of Poitou. On 20 September 1058 Agnes of Poitou and [[Andrew I of Hungary]], whose son later married a daughter of Agnes of Poitou, met to negotiate the border.&lt;ref&gt;Landeschronik Niederösterreich: 3000 Jahre in Daten, Dokumenten und Bildern, Seite 104, Karl Gutkas, C. Brandstätter, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The area of Burgenland remained the western border-zone of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century.

The majority of the population was Germanic, except for the Hungarian border-guards of the frontier March (''[[Gyepű]]''). Germanic immigration from neighbouring Austria was also continuous in the Middle Ages.

===Habsburg administration===
[[File:Habsburg mortgages between 15th and 17th centuries.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Habsburg mortgages in Burgenland between 15th and 17th centuries]]
In 1440 the territory of present-day Burgenland was controlled by the Habsburgs of Austria, and in 1463 the northern part of it (with the town of [[Kőszeg]]) became a mortgage-territory according to the peace treaty of [[Wiener Neustadt]]. In 1477 King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary had retaken the area, but in 1491 it was mortgaged again by King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]] to Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. In 1647 Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] returned it to the Kingdom of Hungary (which itself was a Habsburg possession in this time).

In the 16th century, medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] lost its independence and its north-western part that was not conquered by the Ottoman Empire was included in the Habsburg Empire. This Habsburg possession was known as Royal Hungary and it included territory of present-day Burgenland and western Hungary. Royal Hungary still had counties. What is today Burgenland it was in those times the Moson, Sopron Vas and Zala counties of Hungary.
[[File:Central europe 1572.png|thumb|The Kingdom of Hungary fallen into 3 parts]]

In the 16-17th centuries German [[Protestant]] refugees arrived in Western Royal Hungary to shelter from [[European wars of religion|the religious wars]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], particularly from the supression of the Reformation in Austrian territories, then ruled by the staunchly Roman Catholic Habsburgs. After the Habsburg military victory against the Ottomans at the end of the 17th century, the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary was enlarged to include much of the territory of the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary. In the 17th and 18th centuries the region of Western Hungary was dominated by the wealthy Catholic landowning families, for example the [[House of Esterházy|Esterházys]] and [[Batthyány]]s. In 1867, the Habsburg Empire was transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.

===Dissolution of Austria-Hungary===
According to the 1910 census 291,800 people lived on the territory of present-day Burgenland. Among them 217,072 were German-speaking (74%), 43,633 Croatian-speaking (15%) and 26,225 (9%) Hungarian-speaking. Roma people were counted according to their native language.

From March to August 1919, the Burgenland was part of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].

The area had also been discussed as the site of a [[Czech Corridor]] to Yugoslavia. The decision about "German West Hungary" (''Deutsch-Westungarn'') was fixed in the peace treaties of [[Treaty of Saint Germain|Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]]. Despite diplomatic efforts by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], the victorious parties of World War I set the date of Burgenland's official unification with Austria as 28 August 1921. In fact, the establishment of Austrian police control and customs was stopped on the same day, hindered by sharpshooters who offered armed resistance with the support of Hungary. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Pál Prónay]] with his men, the [[Rongyos Gárda]] defended Western Hungary from the occupying Austrian officials, and forces of the Austrian [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|Gendarmerie]]. He had help from the Hungarian and Croatian people, who did not want to live under Austrian rule. That became the [[Uprising in West Hungary]] in 1921. Prónay created the short state of [[Lajtabánság]]. Austria annexed the Western territory of [[Moson County]], [[Sopron County]], [[Vas County (former)|Vas County]] and [[Zala County (former)|Zala County]] with the help of the victorious' powers of World War I. In 1921, general elections were held in the area and as a result of that Sopron and surrunding larger territories were voted to stay in Hungary thus the Hungarian occupation ot the other territories ended. These areas was later handed over to Austria and '''Burgenland''' was created.

=== Ninth state of Austria ===

With the help of Italian diplomatic mediation in the [[Venice Protocol]], the crisis was almost resolved in the autumn of 1921, when Hungary committed to disarm the sharpshooters by 6 November 1921, in exchange for a plebiscite on the unification of certain territories, including Ödenburg ([[Sopron]]), the designated capital of Burgenland, and eight surrounding villages. The vote took place from 14 to 16 December, and resulted in a clear (but doubted by Austria){{citation needed|date=January 2013}} vote of the people who inhabited the Sopron district to be part of Hungary. Consequently, the territory was incorporated into Austria, except for the Sopron district which was united with Hungary.

In contrast to all the other present Austrian states, which had been part of [[Cisleithania]], Burgenland did not constitute a specific ''[[Crown land|Kronland]]'', and when it was formed it did not have its own regional political and administrative institutions such as a ''[[Landtag]]'' (representative assembly) and ''[[Statthalter]]'' (imperial governor).

On 18 July 1922, the first elections for the parliament of Burgenland took place. Various interim arrangements were required due to the changeover from Hungarian to Austrian jurisdiction. The parliament decided in 1925 on [[Eisenstadt]] as the capital of Burgenland, and moved from the various provisional estates throughout the country to the newly built ''Landhaus'' in 1929.

The first Austrian census in 1923 registered 285,600 people in Burgenland. The ethnic composition of the province had changed slightly: the percentage of Germans increased compared to 1910 (227,869 people, 80%) while the percentage of Hungarians rapidly declined (14,931 people, 5%). This was due to the emigration of the Hungarian civil servants and intellectuals after the union with Austria.

In 1923, emigration to the [[United States|United States of America]], which started in the late 19th century, reached its climax; in some places up to a quarter of the population went overseas.

After the [[Nazi German]] ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria, the administrative unit of Burgenland was dissolved. Northern and central Burgenland joined the district of Niederdonau (Lower Danube) while southern Burgenland joined [[Steiermark]] (Styria).

The policy of [[Germanization]] also affected other minorities, especially [[Burgenland Croats]] and Hungarians. Minority schools were closed and the use of their native language discouraged.

In 1944, the Nazis began, with the help of mostly Jewish forced labour and committed{{clarify|date=January 2013}} inhabitants, to build the ''[[South-east wall|Südostwall]]'' (South-east wall), which proved utterly useless when Soviet troops crossed the Hungarian–Austrian border and [[Soviet invasion of Austria|invaded Austria]]. In the last days of the Nazi regime many executions and death-marches of the Jewish forced labourers took place.

=== Minefields ===
[[File:Austria 1945-55.svg|thumb|300px|right|Burgenland under Soviet administration, 1945-1955]]
As of 1 October 1945 Burgenland was reestablished with Soviet support and given to the Soviet forces in exchange for [[Steiermark]] (Styria), which was in turn occupied by the [[United Kingdom]].

Under Soviet occupation, people in Burgenland had to endure a period of serious mistreatment and an extremely slow economic progress, the latter induced by the investor-discouraging presence of the Soviet troops. The Soviet occupation ended with the signing of the [[Austrian Independence Treaty]] of [[Vienna]] in 1955 by the Occupying Forces.

The brutally crushed [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungarian Revolution]] on 23 October 1956 resulted in a shockwave of Hungarian refugees at the Hungarian-Austrian border, especially at the Bridge of Andau ([[Brücke von Andau]]), who were received by the inhabitants of Burgenland with an overwhelming amount of hospitality.

In 1957, the construction of the "anti-Fascist Protective Barrier" resulted in a complete bulkheading of the area under Soviet influence from the rest of the world, rendering the Hungarian-Austrian border next to Burgenland a deadly zone of minefields (on the Hungarian border) and barbed wire, referred to as the [[Iron Curtain]]. Even during the era of the Iron Curtain, local trains between the north and south of Burgenland operated as "[[Korridorzug|corridor train]]s" (''Korridorzüge'') &amp;ndash; they had their doors locked as they traversed Hungarian territory.

Between 1965 and 1971, the minefields were cleared because people were often harmed by them,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} even on the Austrian side of the border. This could well be taken as a sign of the Soviet Union towards opening the borders to the Western countries, starting in the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

=== Wine and Iron Curtain ===
Despite Burgenland (especially the area around [[Neusiedler See]]) always producing excellent wine, some vintners in Burgenland [[1985 Diethylene Glycol Wine Scandal|added illegal substances to their wine]] in the mid-1980s. When this was revealed, Austria's wine exports dwindled dramatically. After recovering from the scandal, vintners in Austria, not only in Burgenland, started focusing on quality and mostly stopped producing poor quality wine.

On 27 July 1989, the [[Foreign minister]]s of Austria and Hungary, [[Alois Mock]] and [[Gyula Horn]], cut the [[Iron Curtain]] (in [[German language|German]]: "Eiserner Vorhang") in the village of [[Klingenbach]] in a symbolic act with far-reaching consequences. At the same time, the border crossing at Nickelsdorf (Austria) / Hegyeshalom (Hungary) was opened by the Hungarian border patrol and this enabled the escape of East Germans. Directly behind the wires special medic troops of the Austrian Red Cross awaited them and provided first assistance. Thousands of [[East Germany|East Germans]] used this possibility to flee to the West. Again, the inhabitants of Burgenland received them with great hospitality. Later, this was often referred to as the starting shot of the [[German reunification]].

After 1990 Burgenland regained its traditional role as a bridge between the western and eastern parts of [[Central Europe]]. Cross-border links were strengthened when [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] joined the [[European Union]] in 2004. All three countries became part of the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen zone]] in late 2007 when border controls finally ceased to exist in the region.

== Minorities ==
Burgenland has notable [[Burgenland Croats|Croatian]] (29,000–45,000) and [[Hungarians in Austria|Hungarian]] (5,000–15,000) populations.

===Croats===
{{main|Burgenland Croats}}
The Croats arrived after the devastating [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] war in 1532, when the Ottoman army destroyed some settlements in their ethnic territory. The emigration in great haste of the Catholic remained population of western [[Slavonia]] into the Burgenland was – as far as possible – organized by the estate owners. The archives of the [[Sabor]] (the Croatian parliament) from this period contain numerous references to such resettlements. As reported in the spring of 1538 by the [[Ban of Croatia]], Petar [[House of Keglević|Keglević]], who himself owned large estates in western Slavonia, that the country's population at the Ottoman border was preparing to emigrate.&lt;ref&gt;Kölner geographische Arbeiten, Ausgaben 15–18, Seite 69, Geographisches Institut der Universität zu Köln, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; Their resettlement by estate owners was finished only in 1584. They have preserved their strong Catholic faith and their language until today, and in the 19th century their national identity grew stronger because of the influence of the National Revival in Croatia. Between 1918 and 1921 Croats opposed the planned annexation of West-Hungary to Austria, and in 1923 seven Croatian villages voted for a return to Hungary. The Croatian Cultural Association of Burgenland was established in 1934. In the Nazi era (1938–45) the Croatian language was officially prohibited, and the state pursued an aggressive policy of Germanization. The [[Austrian State Treaty]] of 1955 guaranteed minority rights for every native ethnic minority in Austria but Croats had to fight for the use of their language in schools and offices even in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2000 51 new bilingual village name signs were erected in Burgenland (47 Croatian and 4 Hungarian).

The [[Burgenland Croatian language]] is an interesting 16th century dialect which is different from standard Croatian. In minority schools and media the local dialect is used, and it has had a written form since the 17th century (the Gospel was first translated to this dialect in 1711). Today the language is endangered by assimilation, according to the UNESCO's [[Red Book of Endangered Languages]]. The Croats of Burgenland belong to the same group as their relatives on the other side of the modern Austrian-Hungarian border.

===Hungarians===
Hungarians live in the villages of [[Oberwart]]/Felsőőr, [[Unterwart]]/Alsóőr  and [[Siget in der Wart]]/Őrisziget. The three villages together are called [[Upper Őrség]] (Hun: ''Felső-Őrség'', German: ''Wart''), and they have formed a language island since the 11th century. The other old Hungarian language island in [[Oberpullendorf]]/Felsőpulya has almost disappeared today. The Hungarians of Burgenland were "''őrök''", i.e. guards of the western frontier, and their special dialect is similar to the [[Székely]]s in Transylvania. Their cultural centre is Oberwart/Felsőőr. Another distinct Hungarian group were the indentured agricultural workers living on the huge estates north of Neusiedler See. They arrived mainly from the [[Rábaköz]] region. After the dissolution of the manors in the mid-20th century this group ceased to exist.

===Roma and Jews===
In addition to Germans, Croats and Hungarians, Burgenland used to have substantial Roma and Jewish populations, wiped out by the Nazi regime. Before their deportation during 1938, the traditionally very religious Burgenland Jews were concentrated in the famous "Seven Communities" ([[Siebengemeinden]]/Sheva kehillot) in [[Eisenstadt]], [[Mattersburg]], [[Kittsee]], [[Frauenkirchen]], [[Kobersdorf]], [[Lackenbach]] and [[Deutschkreutz]], where they formed a substantial part of the population: e.g. in Lackenbach, 62% of the population was Jewish as of 1869{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. After the war, Jews from Burgenland founded the Jerusalem [[haredi]] neighbourhood of [[Kiryat Mattersdorf]], reminding of the original name of Mattersburg, once a centre of a famous yeshiva.

==Name==
In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], it is known as ''Gradišće''; in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Őrvidék'', ''Felsőőrvidék'' or ''Várvidék''; in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] as ''Gradiščanska''; and in the [[Prekmurje dialect]] as ''Gradišče''.

As the region was not a territorial entity before 1921, it never had an official name. Until the end of [[World War I]] the German-speaking western borderland of the Kingdom of Hungary was sometimes unofficially called ''Deutsch-Westungarn'' (German West Hungary). The historical region included the border city of [[Sopron]] in Hungary (known as Ödenburg in German).

The name '''Vierburgenland''' (Land of Four Castles) was created in 1919 by Odo Rötig, a Viennese resident in Sopron. It was derived from the name of the four ''vármegye'' of the Kingdom of Hungary (in German ''Komitate'', 'counties') known in Hungarian as [[Pozsony County|Pozsony]], [[Moson County|Moson]], [[Sopron County|Sopron]] and [[Vas County (former)|Vas]], or in German as Pressburg, Wieselburg, Ödenburg and Eisenburg. After the town of Pozsony/Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) was assigned to [[Czechoslovakia]], the number ''vier'' was dropped, but the name was kept because it was deemed to be appropriate for a region with so many old frontier castles. The "Burgenland" name was adopted by the first provincial Landtag in 1922.

In Hungarian the German name is generally accepted but there are three modern alternatives  used by minor groups. The Hungarian translation of the German name, "Várvidék", was invented by [[László Juhász]], an expert of the region in the 1970s, and it is becoming increasingly popular especially in tourist publications. The other two names "Őrvidék" and "Felső-Őrvidék" are derived from the name of the most important old Magyar language island, the Felső-Őrség. This microregion is around the town Felsőőr/Oberwart so these new names are a bit misleading however they are sometimes used.

The Croatian and Slovenian names "{{lang|hr|Gradišće}}" and "{{lang|sl|Gradiščansko}}" are translations of the German name. The village of [[Jennersdorf]] is no more than 5 kilometers from the Slovenian and Hungarian borders (see the [[United Slovenia]] movement).

Alternatively, the Serbs, Czechs and Slovaks call the western shores of the [[Neusiedler See]] (lake) surrounding the town of Rust Luzic or Lusic. However, the descendants of [[Serbs|Luzic Serbs]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]], [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] were eventually assimilated into the [[ethnic German]] or [[Magyarization|Hungarian]] cultures over four centuries.

The province has a long history of Slavic, as well Austrian-German and Hungarian-Magyar settlement. The province's easternmost portion (the shores of the Neusiedler See) carried its own topographical term ''Seewinkel'' in Austrian-German. This is the least Austrian-German influenced area since the Hungarian and Slovak borders are less than 10 kilometers away.

==Symbols==
Heraldic description of the coat-of-arms of Burgenland:

:Or, standing upon a rock sable, an eagle regardant, wings displayed gules, langued of the same, crowned and armed of the first, on his breast an escutcheon paly of four, of the third and white fur, fimbriated of the field, and in dexter and sinister cantons two crosslets paty sable.

The arms were introduced in 1922 after the new province was created. They were composed from the arms of the two most important medieval noble families of the region, the counts of [[County of Nagymarton|Nagymarton]] and [[County of Fraknó|Fraknó]] (Mattersdorf-Forchtensten, eagle on the rock) and the counts of [[County of Németújvár|Németújvár]] (Güssing, three bars of red and white fur).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hu.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%C3%ADmerhat%C3%A1roz%C3%B3/Burgenland_c%C3%ADmere]&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag of the province shows two stripes of red and gold, the colours of the coat-of-arms. It was officially confirmed in 1971.

==Burgenländische Gemeinschaft==

The Burgenländische Gemeinschaft ("[[Burgenland Community]]") was founded in 1956, hoping to unite those from Burgenland who have emigrated and now span the globe.  The main goals include fostering Burgenland unity, establishing a global community, organizing family trips and gatherings, and reinforcing a sense of homeland attachment.  Efforts are also being made to ensure the security of important Burgenland historical documents.  Since its inception over 50 years ago, regional chapters have spread throughout the world, with large communities in USA, Canada, Argentina, Switzerland, and Germany.  In the USA alone, the Burgenländische Gemeinschaft services over 20,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgenlaender.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Wiener Blut Morbisch.jpg|thumb|right|Seefestspiele Mörbisch]]

The cultural offerings are diverse and especially in the summer famous for the Seefestspiele Mörbisch and the [[Nova Rock Festival]] with numerous international rockbands.

The permanent exhibition at [[Forchtenstein Castle]] shows an impressive collection of the dukes of [[Duchy of Esterházy|Esterházy]], at whose court at [[Schloss Esterházy|Esterházy Palace]] worked the world-famous musician [[Joseph Haydn]], who composed from the [[Burgenland Croatian]] folk-song ''"V jutro rano se ja stanem"'' ("In the morning I rise up early") the melody of ''"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]"'' ("God save Franz the Emperor"), which became the melody of today's [[national anthem of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Slavonic and East European review, Volume 34, page 2, University of London. School of Slavonic and East European Studies, Committee of American Scholars, Sir Bernard Pares, Robert William Seton-Watson, Harold Williams, Norman Brooke Jopson, Published by the Modern Humanities Research Association for the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also cultural events organized by the minorities such as Croatian or Hungarian folk evenings.

The dialect spoken in Burgenland is called Hianzisch.

'''Diarmaid Ferriter''' (born 1973&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/library/services/book_of_month/book_of_the_month_nov05.htm Book of the Month] 1974. Clare County Library. Accessed online 19 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] historian, and [[professor|university lecturer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsa.org.uk/events/speakerCloseUp.asp?speakerID=1004 Professor Diarmaid Ferriter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928084720/http://www.rsa.org.uk/events/speakerCloseUp.asp?speakerID=1004 |date=28 September 2007 }} Royal Society for the Arts. Accessed online 16 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He has written several books on the subject of [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]. Ferriter attended [[St. Benildus College]] in [[Kilmacud]] in Dublin.

==Career==
Ferriter is Professor of Modern Irish History at [[University College Dublin]]. He was formerly a senior lecturer in history at [[St. Patrick's College of Education (Drumcondra)|St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra]], [[Dublin City University]]. He is also the host of ''What If'', a radio programme that broadcasts weekly on [[RTÉ Radio 1|RTÉ 1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/radio1/whatif/ Official homepage of ''What If'' on RTÉ.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320003803/http://www.rte.ie/radio1/whatif/ |date=20 March 2007 }} In 2004, his book ''The Transformation of Ireland 1900–2000'', at 900 pages and containing many new perspectives on modern Irish history was considered a landmark publication. Accessed online 21 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Ferriter wrote the critically acclaimed biography, ''Judging Dev''. This was an insight into one of Ireland's most influential leaders, [[Éamon de Valera]]. It won in three categories of the 2008 [[Irish Book Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/education/2008/0916/1221430248977.html|title=Judging His latest book is ''Occasions of Sin: Sex and Society in modern Ireland'', considered the definitive history of Irish sexuality in the twentieth century. Diarmaid|last=Holden|first=Louise|date=16 September 2008|work=The Irish Times|pages=16|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was Burns Scholar at Boston College from 2008 to 2009.

In 2004, his book ''The Transformation of Ireland 1900–2000'', at 900 pages and containing many new perspectives on modern Irish history, was considered a landmark publication. His book ''Occasions of Sin: Sex and Society in Modern Ireland'' (2009), considered the definitive history of sexuality in twentieth century Ireland, was met with widespread praise from reviewers at home and abroad.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

In June 2010, he presented a three-part television series ''The Limits of Liberty'', about how the senior politicians of the [[Irish Republic]] and [[Irish Free State]] were more concerned about holding on to power than changing policy for the benefit of the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/tv/programmes/the_limits_of_liberty.html The limits of liberty page] (and see also [[Families in the Oireachtas]])&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in July 2012 that Tim Lyons of Athenry, Co Galway, "claimed a photo of him with two pints of stout on the cover of Prof Ferriter's A Nation of Extremes – The Pioneers in Twentieth Century Ireland depicts him as an alcoholic... [Ennis Circuit] Judge Keys reserved the issue of costs pending the outcome of the full hearing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0720/1224320450833.html 'Singer sues noted historian over alleged depiction as alcoholic'] The Irish Times online edition retrieved 20 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferriter's book, ''Ambiguous Republic: Ireland in the 1970s'', published in November 2012, considers the widespread social, cultural, economic and political upheavals of the decade, a time when the Northern Irish Troubles profoundly affected the governance of the Republic, when Ireland joined the EEC, when for the first time a majority of the population lived in urban areas, and when economic challenges abounded. The 1970s in Ireland also witnessed an increasingly visible feminist movement, and the political and legal establishments and other powerful institutions including the Church began to be subjected to a new criticism.

In 2013, in response to the release of tape recordings from [[Anglo Irish Bank]], Ferriter discussed his thoughts on what future historians would ask about contemporary Ireland, questions such as "Was there nothing that would bring the Irish to the barricades during the financial meltdown? Why did a country that fought a war of independence in the early 20th Century become so compliant and docile in the face of the exposure of systemic corruption and the destruction of that independence nearly a century later? And why were those responsible not made accountable and punished?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Diarmaid|last=Ferriter|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/anglo/diarmaid-ferriter-history-will-ask-how-we-could-be-so-docile-in-face-of-such-betrayal-29385047.html|title=Diarmaid Ferriter: History will ask how we could be so docile in face of such betrayal|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=1 July 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, Ferriter played a leading role in the Democracy Matters group that successfully campaigned against the government's proposal to abolish the Irish Senate; the proposal was defeated in a referendum in October 2013. In 2014 he became a weekly columnist with The Irish Times.

In 2015, Ferriter published his account of the revolutionary years of the early twentieth century in ''A Nation and Not a Rabble: The Irish Revolution 1913-1923''. Based on new sources and perspectives, it was acclaimed by the Irish Independent as "magisterial", and "Giving Voice to history's silent souls" . (Irish Independent, 14 March 2015)

'''Dick Walther Harrison''' (born April 10, 1966) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] historian who was born in [[Huddinge]], [[Stockholm County]], [[Sweden]] and spent much of his youth in [[Staffanstorp]] in [[Skåne]]. On June 12, 2010 he married Katarina Lindbergh in Kalmar Cathedral. He is currently a [[Professor]] of [[History]] at [[Lund University]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lu.se/lund-university Lund University]&lt;/ref&gt;

His main areas of interest are the European [[Middle Ages]], including the medical history of the period, and the history of slavery. Harrison regularly writes articles for the Swedish journal ''[[Populär Historia]]'' (Popular History). He has also written popular historical works and, during Spring 2010, a blog covering the history of monarchs and monarchies with emphasis on the Swedish monarchy. Harrison regularly gives lectures to the general public on a broad range of historical topics.

Harrison is the editor-in-chief of a comprehensive series about Swedish history published by Norstedts with the first volume released in September, 2009. The Swedish TV channel TV4 has made a companion television series for which Harrison is the historical consultant and co-host along with [[Martin Timell]]. The TV series has 12 episodes of which the first six aired on TV4 during spring 2010. The second set of six episodes aired spring 2011.

In addition to his historical writing, Harrison has written three historical novels about Ulvbjörn Vamodsson, a 7th-century (fictitious) warrior: ''Ofärd,'' ''Niding'' and ''Illdåd''.

Raised in [[Utah]] in a respected, if impoverished, [[Latter-day Saint]] (LDS Church) family, Fawn McKay drifted away from Mormonism during her years of graduate work at the [[University of Chicago]]. She married [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]], an ethnically Jewish academic who became a national defense expert; they had three children. Although Fawn Brodie eventually became one of the first [[tenure]]d female professors of history at [[UCLA]], she is best known for her five biographies, four of which incorporate insights from [[Freudian psychology]].

Brodie's depiction of [[Joseph Smith]] in 1945 as a fraudulent "genius of improvisation"&lt;ref&gt;Fawn Brodie, ''No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2nd. ed., 1971), 403.&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as both a "beautifully written biography ... the work of a mature scholar [that] represented the first genuine effort to come to grips with the contradictory evidence about Smith's early life"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Shipps]], ''Sojourner in the Promised Land: Forty Years among the Mormons'' (University of Illinois Press, 2000), 165. However, the Mormon apologist [[Hugh Nibley]] claimed he was immediately struck "by the brazen inconsistencies that swarm in its pages." ''No, Ma'am, That's Not History'' (Salt Lake City: [[Bookcraft]], 1960), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a work that presented conjecture as fact.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times Book Review'', November 25, 1945, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Her best-selling psychobiography of [[Thomas Jefferson]], published in 1974, was the first serious study to examine evidence related to accounts that he had taken his slave [[Sally Hemings]] as a concubine. Brodie concluded these accounts were true, a conclusion supported by a 1998 DNA analysis and current scholarly consensus.

==Early life==
Fawn McKay was the second of five children of [[Thomas E. McKay]] and Fawn Brimhall. Born in [[Ogden, Utah]], she grew up in [[Huntsville, Utah|Huntsville]], about ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) east.  Both her parents descended from families influential in early Mormonism.  Her maternal grandfather, [[George H. Brimhall]], was president of [[Brigham Young University]]. Her father, Thomas Evans McKay, was a bishop, president of the LDS Swiss-Austrian mission, and an [[Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]. Brodie's paternal uncle was [[David O. McKay]],  an [[Apostle (Mormonism)|apostle]] in the LDS Church when Brodie was born, who later became the ninth [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WSaMu4F06AQC&amp;pg=PA79 Notable American Women]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prominence of her family in the church, they lived in genteel poverty, their property burdened by unpayable debt.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst"&gt;The farmhouse Brodie lived in was owned not by her parents but by the extended McKay clan, the McKay Family Corporation.  Her relatives visited regularly and for extended periods each summer, but the corporation refused to provide indoor plumbing, although the Thomas McKay family desperately wanted it, and the corporation could afford to pay for it.  The mortgage debt grew to thirty-five thousand dollars, "an astronomical sum for the time" that Fawn's father bore for the next thirty years "like Atlas, without hope and without lament." {{cite book|title=Fawn McKay Brodie: a biographer's life |author=Newell G. Bringhurst |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-3181-8 | oclc=41528123| year=1999| ref=harv|pages=15–17, 30–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The young Fawn was perpetually embarrassed that their house did not have indoor plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;"Fawn bitterly recalled that as she 'grew older and became aware of the social implications of [the privy's] permanence [it] became. . .a scandalous anachronism.  The coming of guests, whether our parents' friends or our own, always meant a moment of apologetic explanation, which was humiliating to make or even to overhear.'"  In winter, human wastes in chamber pots had to be thawed on the kitchen stove before they could be disposed of. {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fawn early demonstrated precociousness. At three she memorized and recited lengthy poems. When a [[whooping cough]] epidemic convinced Brodie's mother to [[Homeschooling|homeschool]] Fawn's sister Flora, who was two years older, Fawn more than kept pace. Introduced to school in 1921, the six-year-old Fawn was advanced to the fourth grade; when she lost the school spelling bee to a twelve-year-old, "she cried and cried that this bright boy, twice her age, had spelled her down."&lt;ref&gt;Flora McKay Crawford in {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At ten she had a poem printed in the LDS youth periodical, ''[[The Juvenile Instructor]]''; at fourteen she was [[salutatorian]] of Weber High School.

Although Fawn grew to maturity in a rigorously religious environment that included strict [[Sunday Sabbatarianism|Sabbatarianism]] and evening prayers on her knees,&lt;ref&gt;There was a blessing at every meal, and the McKay children were not allowed to play either outside or inside the house. Even the sewing of doll clothes was forbidden. The "[[Word of Wisdom]]" was obeyed, and no coffee, tea, or alcoholic beverages were consumed.&lt;/ref&gt; her mother was a closet skeptic who thought the LDS Church a "wonderful social order" but who doubted its dogma.&lt;ref&gt;Flora McKay recalled that her mother "hated the temple ceremonies so bad that it was just ghastly." Among other things, her mother rejected the Mormon view of eternity and instead insisted that "eternity is one generation to another." {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=20–21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brodie, in the late 1930s, while her father headed [[Mormon missionary|Mormon mission]] activities in German-speaking Europe, her mother became a "thoroughgoing heretic" while accompanying him there.&lt;ref&gt;Brodie said that two years of "playing hostess to itinerant apostles, plus some sophisticated literature and the overwhelmingly impressive spectacle of twenty centuries of European art really shocked her out of that provincialism in which twenty-five years in Huntsville had tried to enshroud her." Brodie was pleasantly surprised that at her mother's age, "there could come such delightful blossoming of courageous heresy." {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and marriage==
From 1930 to 1932 Fawn attended [[Weber State University|Weber College]], a two-year institution in Ogden then owned by the LDS Church, where she became an accomplished public speaker and participated in intercollegiate debate. She completed her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[English literature]] at the [[University of Utah]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;The choice of the University of Utah rather than Brigham Young University was made by Fawn's mother who, besides her own heterodoxy, did not want her girls a hundred miles away in Provo, where they would be encouraged to marry. {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=45–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There she began to question core Mormon beliefs, such as that the Native Americans had originated in ancient Palestine. After graduation at age nineteen, she returned to teach English at Weber College.

In high school, McKay had begun dating a classmate, Dilworth Jensen.  They wrote to each other faithfully during Jensen's long absence on an [[Mormon missionary|LDS mission]] in Europe. In June 1935, both McKay and Jensen were accepted for graduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and friends assumed they would marry.  Her sister Flora McKay had recently eloped with Jensen's brother, whom the McKays disliked. They encouraged Fawn to attend the [[University of Chicago]] rather than marry. McKay seemed to have had "growing doubts about marrying" Jensen.&lt;ref&gt;Although Fawn remained fond of Jensen, she wanted "freedom and a chance to be on her own. Dilworth himself apparently sensed this." The "couple continued to talk marriage, and it seemed to those who knew them that their relationship would continue despite the separation." {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the University of Chicago, where she earned an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1936, Brodie lost her faith in religion entirely. In 1975, she recalled, "It was like taking a hot coat off in the summertime. The sense of liberation I had at the University of Chicago was exhilarating. I felt very quickly that I could not go back to the old life, and I never did."&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Stephenson, ''Biography of Fawn McKay Brodie'', quoted in {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to write to Jensen until shortly before she married [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]] on her graduation day, August 28, 1936.

Brodie was a native of Chicago, the son of [[Latvian people|Latvian]] [[Jewish]] immigrants, who was alienated from both his family and his family's religion. A bright graduate student in international relations, Brodie eventually became a noted expert in military strategy during the Cold War era. The McKays were horrified at their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections. Out of consideration for her mother, Fawn scheduled the wedding in an LDS chapel, but of the McKays, only Fawn's mother attended. None of Brodie's family did.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==''No Man Knows My History''==
{{main|No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith}}

===Composition===
Having found temporary employment at the Harper Library of the University of Chicago, Brodie began researching the origins of the [[Book of Mormon]].  By mid-1939, she confided to her uncle, Dean R. Brimhall (another ex-Mormon),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=48, 72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that she intended to write a scholarly biography of [[Joseph Smith]].  Progress toward that goal was slowed by the birth of the Brodies' first child and by three rapid moves, a consequence of her husband's search for a permanent position.  In 1943 Fawn Brodie was encouraged enough by her progress to enter her 300-page draft in a contest for the [[Alfred A. Knopf]] literary fellowship. In May her application was judged the best of the 44 entries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kammen, ''In the Past Lane: Historical Perspectives on American Culture'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), 21; {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodie continued her research at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C., where the Brodies had moved for her husband's work, as well as at the headquarters of the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints|Reorganized LDS Church]] in Independence, Missouri. Eventually she returned to Utah, where she did research in the LDS Church Archives. She gained access to some highly restricted materials by claiming to be "Brother McKay's daughter," a subterfuge that made her feel "guilty as hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her pursuit of little-known documents eventually  attracted the attention of her uncle David O. McKay. After a "painful, acrimonious encounter" with her uncle, Brodie promised never again to consult materials in the Church Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=84–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodie's research was enlarged by other students of Mormonism, most notably [[Dale L. Morgan]] (1914–1971), who became a lifelong friend, mentor, and sounding board.&lt;ref&gt;"Despite his own deep fascination with Mormonism's past, Morgan...was not a practicing Latter-day Saint." {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=86}}.  Yet Morgan twice critiqued Brodie's manuscript with "alarming frankness," convincing Brodie that what she had already written read too much like an exposé. "In general, Morgan was much more incisive and penetrating in his critique than the Knopf panel had been in awarding Brodie her fellowship.  The difference was that Morgan knew Mormon history and the Knopf readers did not." (88) After Brodie published ''[[No Man Knows My History]]'', Morgan wrote  a glowing review of it for the [[Saturday Review (US magazine)|''Saturday Review of Literature'']]. He did not reveal his own role in the book.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie completed her biography of Joseph Smith in 1944, and it was published in 1945 by Alfred A. Knopf, when she was thirty years old.

===Thesis===
Its title, ''[[No Man Knows My History]]'', alludes to a comment Joseph Smith made in a speech shortly before [[death of Joseph Smith|his assassination]] in 1844.  Brodie presents the young Joseph as a lazy, good-natured, extroverted, and unsuccessful treasure seeker. In an attempt to improve his family's fortunes, he developed the notion of [[golden plates]] and then the concept of a religious novel, the [[Book of Mormon]].  It was based in part on ''[[View of the Hebrews]]'', an earlier work by a contemporary clergyman [[Ethan Smith (clergyman)|Ethan Smith]]. Brodie asserts that at first Joseph Smith was a deliberate impostor; but at some point, in nearly untraceable steps, he became convinced that he was a prophet. She wrote that he never escaped "the memory of the conscious artifice" that created the Book of Mormon.

===Reviews===
Non-Mormon reviewers praised either the author's research, the excellence of her literary style, or both.&lt;ref&gt;''No Man Knows My History'' was lauded in the ''[[Mississippi Valley Historical Review]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''. Even in a generally negative review, Vardis Fisher praised Brodie for turning up primary sources that had previously been neglected. ''New York Times Book Review'', November 25, 1945, 5. And not surprisingly, Brodie's friend and fellow historian Dale L. Morgan declared Brodie’s book the "finest job of scholarship yet done in Mormon history and perhaps the outstanding biography in several years—-a book distinguished in the range and originality of its research, the informed and searching objectivity of its viewpoint, the richness and suppleness of its prose, and its narrative power."'' Saturday Review of Literature'', 28 (November 28, 1945), 7-8. Bermad DeVoto called it "the best thing about Mormons so far published; it is in a class by itself." ''Weekly Book Review'' (December 16, 1945), 1. F.W. Walbridge in ''Library Journal'', 70 (November 15, 1945), 1086, said that Brodie had treated her material with "taste, skill, and scholarship." An anonymous review in the ''New Yorker'', 21 (November 24, 1945), 109, commented that Brodie had written about Joseph Smith "entertainingly."&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' called Brodie's book "a definitive biography in the finest sense of the word," and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' praised the author for her "skill and scholarship and admirable detachment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=104–05}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews were less positive. Brodie was especially annoyed by the review of novelist [[Vardis Fisher]], who accused her of stating "as indisputable facts what can only be regarded as conjectures supported by doubtful evidence."&lt;ref&gt;"It is this reviewer's notion that she will turn novelist in her next book, and that she should." ''NYTBR'', 25 November 1945, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard DeVoto]] wrote a mixed review, but he praised the biography as "the best book about the Mormons so far published." DeVoto, who believed Joseph Smith was "paranoid," said that Brodie had not provided adequate psychological explanations for Smith's behavior. Brodie also came to believe that a thorough psychological analysis of Smith was essential and that she "hadn't gone far enough in this direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=106}}. In the revised edition of 1971, Brodie made minimal changes to the text but added a supplementary chapter that reflected her greater reliance on psychohistory, at least partially crediting Smith's prophetic claims to a complex "identity problem." {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction of the LDS Church===
Although ''No Man Knows My History'' criticized many foundational Mormon beliefs about Joseph Smith, the LDS Church was slow to condemn the work, even as the book went into a second printing.  In 1946, ''[[The Improvement Era]]'', an official periodical of the Church, said that many of the book's citations were from "doubtful sources" and that the biography was "of no interest to Latter-day Saints who have correct knowledge of the history of Joseph Smith." The "Church News" section of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' had a lengthy critique: it praised the biography's "fine literary style" and denounced it as "a composite of all [[anti-Mormon]] books that have gone before."&lt;ref&gt;This review was soon reprinted as a pamphlet and missionary tract. {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the booklet, "No, Ma'am, That's Not History", [[Hugh Nibley]], a BYU professor and LDS historian and apologist, challenged Brodie.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation |last= Nibley |first= Hugh W. |authorlink= Hugh Nibley |title= No, Ma'am, That's Not History |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/transcripts/?id=47 |location= Provo, Utah |publisher= [[Maxwell Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He asserted that she had cited sources supportive only of her conclusions while conveniently ignoring others. Brodie described the ''Deseret News'' pamphlet as "a well-written, clever piece of Mormon propaganda," but she dismissed the more popular "No, Ma'am, That's Not History" as "a flippant and shallow piece."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1946, the LDS Church excommunicated Brodie. She never tried to regain her membership.&lt;ref&gt;In answer to a student's question in 1980, Brodie said that she had come to her opinion before writing the biography, saying, "I was not a devout Mormon when I began the research on my book." Kammen, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie once wrote to a friend that what she suffered from her disillusionment with Mormonism "had to do with the pain I caused my family.  The disillusionment itself was...a liberating experience." Before ''No Man Knows My History'' was published, Brodie sought to comfort her parents, "You brought us all up to revere the truth, which is the noblest ideal a parent can instill in his children, and the fact that we come out on somewhat different roads certainly is no reflection on you."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kammen, ''In the Past Lane: Historical Perspectives on American Culture'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie's mother and three sisters were enthusiastic about the book, but Thomas McKay refused to read it.&lt;ref&gt;Brodie said that her father's refusal to read or discuss the book "hurt me more, I think, than an angry argument about the contents would have done." {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical success with psychobiography==

===''Thaddeus Stevens: Scourge of the South''===
Fawn Brodie genuinely enjoyed her roles as wife and mother, believing that rearing children, especially when they were small, was "enormously fulfilling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Brodies had two boys and a girl.&lt;ref&gt;Fawn Brodie had two miscarriages; at the time of the second, some unidentified members of her extended family intimated it was "just punishment" for her "sins." Brodie said that the miscarriage was "the worst thing" that had ever happened to her but that it "had brought a 'complete erasing of the feelings of guilt' she had had since the Joseph Smith biography had come out." {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Brodie was not content to be without a writing project for long. After some desultory investigation of other possibilities, she settled on a biography of [[Thaddeus Stevens]], a Republican representative from Pennsylvania who was a Congressional leader during the [[Reconstruction Era]].

Brodie believed that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she relished the prospect of rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens as a champion of black people was a timely interest as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie also wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by having a [[club foot]].

In the view of students of historiography such as Ernst Breisach, all biographers are to some degree [[psychohistory|psychohistorians]], and any biography that refused to examine motives, character traits, and the depth of personality would be flat and uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;"Historians, beginning with the ancient writers, had all along been aware of the psyche's importance whenever they spoke of a human nature with perennial motives, sketched biographical or character portraits, or analyzed human behavior under tyrants." Ernst Breisach, ''Historiography: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994), 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie became interested in applying the theories of professional [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]] to the study of historical personalities, a subject especially popular during the mid-twentieth century. At first Brodie was amused at how much psychoanalysis had "become a religion" to its practitioners, but she later become a committed devotee of psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=140}}. For a critical analysis of psychotherapy in American religious and intellectual life, see William M. Epstein, ''Psychotherapy as Religion: The Civil Divine in America'' (University of Nevada Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie made a number of acquaintances among psychoanalysts, who helped her evaluate Thaddeus Stevens, notably Ralph R. Greenson, with whom she developed a close personal and professional relationship. Both the Brodies also undertook psychoanalysis, he for insomnia and she for chronic mild depression and sexual problems. (Bernard's employer, the [[RAND]] Corporation, paid most of the bills.) Brodie's interest in psychology during this period was heightened by family problems: her mother attempted suicide three times, the second by cutting herself with a Catholic crucifix, and the third (which succeeded) by setting herself on fire.&lt;ref&gt;143, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stevens biography took the better part of a decade to complete.

====Reviews====
When Brodie published the Stevens book in 1959, it enjoyed virtually unanimous praise from critics. Major historians of the Civil War and Reconstruction era, including [[David Herbert Donald]] and [[C. Vann Woodward]], praised the biography. Donald called Brodie's psychoanalysis of Stevens "a tour de force." Most gracious was [[Richard N. Current]], who had written a less favorable account of Stevens, which Brodie had earlier criticized. Current not only urged [[W. W. Norton]] to publish a paperback edition of Brodie's book, but wrote a blurb praising the author for writing "more imaginatively" and "more resourcefully...than any other Stevens biographer." Nevertheless, ''Thaddeus Stevens'' was a commercial failure that sold fewer than fifteen hundred copies before going out of print in less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=151–53, 176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other work==
In 1960 the Brodies spent a year in France, during which Fawn spent considerable energy researching and writing ''From Crossbow to H-Bomb'', a co-authored paperback intended as a college text.  It treated the influence of science on military technology. Bernard Brodie had signed the contract with [[Random House]], but his wife did most of the research and writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=154, 159, 161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Devil Drives: A Life of Sir Richard Burton''===
When the family returned to California, [[Alfred A. Knopf (person)|Alfred Knopf]] asked Brodie to edit and write a new introduction for Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]]'s memoir, ''The City of the Saints and Across the Rocky Mountains to California'' (1862). Almost immediately she "was lost" to Burton, a man whom she described as "fascinating beyond belief."  She soon planned a full biography. Like Brodie, Burton was an agnostic who was fascinated by religion and all things sexual.&lt;ref&gt;"With unabashed admiration, Brodie characterized Burton as 'a great sexologist.'" {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=155–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie consulted with the psychoanalyst community and used her own [[free association (psychology)|free association]] to explore Burton's subconscious. For instance, she noted that immediately before and after Burton wrote about his mother, he talked "about cheating, decapitation, mutilations, smashings—all the stories and metaphors are violent, negative, and hostile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=172–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reviews====
''The Devil Drives: A Life of Sir Richard Burton'' was published in May 1967 and was chosen as a featured selection by both the Literary Guild Book Club and the [[History Book Club]].  Reviews were again generally positive.  The ''New York Times Book Review'' promoted it as an "[e]xcellent biography of a bizarre man who had a bizarre wife—and life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professorship at UCLA===
The publication of three acclaimed biographies allowed Brodie to become a part-time lecturer in history at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] although she had not earned a Ph.D. (Both her bachelor's and master's degrees were in English.)  As a woman, Brodie met some resistance from the large and overwhelmingly male history faculty, but her specialty in the current field of [[psychohistory]] aided her original appointment and her eventual promotion to full professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=181–82, 202-02}}. When Brodie sought promotion to full professor in 1971, some members of the department opposed her based on her lack of a PhD and their perception of her as a popularizer.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brodie taught both larger upper-division lectures in American history and small seminars on American political biography, preferring the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=182}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History''==
[[Thomas Jefferson]] was a natural subject for Brodie's fourth biography.  One of her courses focused on the United States from 1800 to 1830, and her seminar in political biography could serve as an appropriate forum for a work-in-progress.  Throughout this period, Brodie was attracted to Mormon studies and was importuned by several publishers to write a biography of [[Brigham Young]].  The LDS entrepreneur, [[O.C. Tanner (person)|O.C. Tanner]] (1904–1993), offered Brodie $10,000 in advance to produce a manuscript.  But Dale Morgan told Brodie that Madeline Reeder McQuown, a close friend, had nearly completed a huge manuscript on Young.  In fact, McQuown's biography was little more than a few rough drafts of early chapters, but Brodie was dissuaded and abandoned Young for Thomas Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=182, 185–86}}. Morgan and McQuown engaged in a relationship described as unusual and complex. Craig L. Foster, “Madeline McQuown, Dale Morgan, and the Great Unfinished Brigham Young Biography,” ''Dialogue: Journal of Mormon Thought'', 31 (Summer 1998), 111-23. "Morgan carried the weight of the deceit by encouraging and promoting a book that would never appear, thus risking his reputation as a scholar and mentor on a woman who, by the later stages of their relationship, was, at best, indifferent." (122)&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 1968, Brodie was committed to writing the Jefferson biography.  She understood that it could not be a full account. The study of Jefferson had become a virtual career for several living historians.  For instance, [[Dumas Malone]] was in the process of completing a six-volume biography of Jefferson, which won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1975. Brodie decided to concentrate on a biography of “the private man.” She decided to build on several recently published articles on the [[Jefferson–Hemings controversy|historical controversy]] describing a reported sexual relationship between Jefferson and [[Sally Hemings]], a [[quadroon]] slave said to be the half-sister of his late wife. The topic was timely during a period of increased national interest in race, sex, and presidential hypocrisy.  Brodie had personal reasons as well, having discovered that her husband had been conducting an extramarital affair.&lt;ref&gt;"[I]n weighing her husband's indiscretion against the overwhelmingly positive aspects of their relationship, Fawn concluded that their marriage of some thirty years was worth preserving." Jefferson reminded Brodie of her father: orderly, self-controlled, and chronically in debt. {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=185–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To Brodie, Jefferson's ambiguous posturings on slavery could be explained by his personal life. If he had been conducting a 28-year affair with a slave, then he could not free his slaves because once they were freed, Virginia law would force them from the state, unless he gained permission from the legislature for them to stay. He could continue his liaison with Hemings only if his slaves remained slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most prominent Jefferson biographers of the twentieth century, [[Dumas Malone]] and [[Merrill Peterson]], had relied on Jefferson family testimony by two Randolph grandchildren, who named his Carr nephews as fathers. They discounted other evidence about this alleged sexual relationship, including by [[Madison Hemings]] in 1873, who identified Jefferson as his father and said he had a long relationship with his mother. The relationship was first reported in 1802 by the journalist [[James T. Callender]] when Jefferson was President, after Callender failed to win an appointment by the president.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Williams, ''The Historian's Toolbox: A Student's Guide to the Theory and Craft of History'' (Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 2003), 76-77. On Callender's career, see Michael J. Durey, "Callender, James Thomson,"&lt;/ref&gt;

Working from [[Winthrop Jordan]]'s ''Black on White'' (1968), Brodie also used [[Dumas Malone]]'s documentation of Jefferson's activities to correlate his stays at [[Monticello]] with the conception period of each of Sally Hemings' children, whose births he recorded in the Farm Book. She discovered that Hemings never conceived when Jefferson was not at Monticello, during years when he was often away for months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Ellis, ''American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson'' (New York: Vintage, 1996), 365: "Although Brodie's book ignited a raging debate within the scholarly world and then a proliferation of biographies, novels, films and popular magazine stories, it was in truth Malone's findings about the chronology of Sally's pregnancies that constituted the most tangible piece of new evidence to support the charge of a sexual liaison."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
By 1971 Brodie had a $15,000 advance from her publisher and had presented a summary of her arguments at the annual meeting of the [[Organization of American Historians]]. The Jefferson biographer Merrill Peterson "blasted" the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote an article for ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' of her work in progress, entitled "The Great Jefferson Taboo," about her conclusion that the Jefferson&amp;ndash;Hemings relationship took place.  In a change from its usual practice, the magazine included all her notes to show the sources of her conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/great-jefferson-taboo Fawn M. Brodie, "The Great Jefferson Taboo"], ''American Heritage'', June 1972, Volume 23, Issue 4, accessed 1 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodie and her publisher understood that the biography would be controversial. An in-house editor at [[W. W. Norton]] was critical: "Doesn't [Brodie] know about making the theory fit the facts instead of trying to explain the facts to fit the theory? It's pretty fascinating, like working out a detective story, but she doesn't play fair."&lt;ref&gt;Thelma Sargent to George Brockway, April 12, 1973 in {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=212}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History'' was published in February 1974, and it was the main spring selection of the [[Book-of-the-Month Club]]. Brodie tried to ensure that none of the three foremost Jefferson scholars, [[Dumas Malone]], [[Merrill Peterson]], and [[Julian P. Boyd|Julian Boyd]], would review the book. Brodie was interviewed on NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]],'' and the book quickly "became a topic of comment in elite social-literary circles," as well as among political people.  The biography was an immediate commercial success; it was on the ''New  York Times'' bestseller list for thirteen weeks.  ''Jefferson'' sold 80,000 copies in hardback and 270,000 copies in paperback, and netted Brodie $350,000 in royalties&amp;mdash;adjusted for inflation, more than a million dollars in the early twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=215, 217, 185}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary reviews were generally positive, while historians were often critical of Brodie's speculations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/1974brodie.html "1974-"A Popular but Controversial Biography'"], ''Jefferson's Blood: Chronology'', 2000, PBS ''Frontline,'' accessed 29 February 2012. "The ''New York Times Book Review'' staff made Brodie's biography an "Editor's Choice," calling it "a fascinating, and generally convincing, speculative study focusing on Jefferson's inner life, especially his tragic irresolution about slavery.""&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Garry Wills]] savaged Brodie's work in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Two vast things, each wondrous in itself, combine to make this book a prodigy&amp;mdash;the author's industry, and her ignorance. One can only be so intricately wrong by deep study and long effort, enough to make Ms. Brodie the fasting hermit and very saint of ignorance. The result has an eerie perfection, as if all the world's greatest builders had agreed to rear, with infinite skill, the world's ugliest building."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wills complained that Brodie had consistently found double meanings in the language of colonial America based on twentieth-century usage. {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=217–18}};''New York Review of Books'', 21 (April 18, 1974), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream historians had long denied the possibility of Jefferson's relation with Sally Hemings, although such interracial liaisons were so common that by the late eighteenth century, visitors remarked on the numerous white slaves in Virginia and the Upper South.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ellis, ''American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson'', Alfred A. Knopf, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; "''The Richmond Examiner'' on September 25, 1802, in a rare admission, stated that “thousands” of mulatto children were then being born in the South."&lt;ref name="american"/&gt; [[Mary Chesnut]] and [[Fanny Kemble]], educated women of the planter elite, also wrote about many interracial families in the era shortly before the [[American Civil War]]. Jefferson had been discreet, protecting his privacy, and he was an icon whom historians were determined to "defend".

Like many previous Jefferson biographers, Brodie developed an intense affection for her protagonist.  She claimed that in dreams, she and Jefferson became "man and wife."  Bernard Brodie is supposed to have muttered, "God, I'm glad that man is out of the house."&lt;ref name="Bringhurst 1999 222"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=222}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fawn Brodie wondered where one could go after Jefferson, "but down."&lt;ref name="Bringhurst 1999 222"/&gt;

After her book was published, Brodie was contacted by some [[Eston Hemings]] Jefferson descendants who recognized his name from her account. His descendants had married white, and this generation appeared to be white. They discovered that their fathers in the 1940s had decided that, to protect their children from racial discrimination associated with descent from Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, they would tell the children they were descended from Jefferson's uncle. All these Jefferson descendants learned in the 1970s of their alleged descent from Eston Hemings, Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. Brodie wrote a follow-up article about the Jefferson-Hemings grandchildren in 1976, entitled "Thomas Jefferson’s Unknown Grandchildren: A Study in Historical Silences"], published in October 1976 in ''American Heritage'' magazine. Photographs and other documentary material they gave her have been donated to UCLA archives.&lt;ref name="american"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/thomas-jefferson%E2%80%99s-unknown-grandchildren Fawn M. Brodie, "Thomas Jefferson’s Unknown Grandchildren: A Study in Historical Silences", ''American Heritage,'' October 1976, Vol. 27, Issue 6, accessed 1 March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998 Jefferson DNA study and new consensus===
{{main|Jefferson–Hemings controversy}}
In 1997 [[Annette Gordon-Reed]] published ''Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,'' in which she analyzed the historiography and noted the bias of historians in assessing conflicting accounts by descendants of the Jefferson family and the Hemings family, as well as evidence that they overlooked. She also noted Malone's data, which established that Jefferson was at Monticello during the conception period for each of Sally Heming's children.

To try to resolve the renewed controversy with modern techniques, in 1998 a [[Y-DNA]] study was conducted of descendants of the Jefferson male line, [[Eston Hemings]] (the youngest son of Sally Hemings), the Carr nephews, and Thomas Woodson (whose family also claimed descent from Jefferson). It found that the Y-DNA of the Eston Hemings descendant matched the rare [[haplotype]] of the male Jefferson line.  In addition, the tests conclusively found that there was no match between the Carr line and the Hemings descendant.&lt;ref&gt;Originally published by E. A. Forster et al., "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v396/n6706/full/396027a0.html Jefferson Fathered Slave's Last Child]", ''Nature'' (November 5, 1998), 27-28. The likelihood that a non-Jefferson fathered Eston was estimated at 0.1%. The study also found that there was no match between the Jefferson male line and descendants of Thomas Woodson. The Monticello Foundation had long believed that the historical evidence disproved this account, and the DNA made that conclusive.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, a research committee commissioned by the [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]], which operates [[Monticello]], concluded that there was a high probability that Jefferson had been the father of Eston Hemings and likely of all Hemings children listed in the [[Monticello]] records. Since then the Foundation has revised exhibits and tour commentary to reflect Jefferson's paternity of all Hemings' children, and it has sponsored new research into the interracial society of Monticello and Charlottesville.  Since 2000, most academics, including biographers such as [[Joseph Ellis]], have agreed with the new consensus.

Other historians, including those associated with the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, founded after the DNA study, continue to disagree.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society concluded in 2001 that it was unlikely that Hemings' children were Jefferson's, and suggested that they might be the children of Jefferson's brother [[Randolph Jefferson|Randolph]].{{cite web|url=http://www.tjheritage.org/documents/SCReport1.pdf |title=Jefferson-Hemings Scholars Commission, Report on the Jefferson-Hemings Matter'&amp;#39 |publisher=Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society |format=PDF |date=April 2001 |accessdate=2011-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004165825/http://www.tjheritage.org/documents/SCReport1.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2006 }} This view is not widely accepted within academia. See Joseph J. Ellis, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/enigma/ellis.html "Jefferson: Post-DNA"], ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', 3rd Ser., 57, No. 1, (January 2000), 125, 126, 129 (Stating that the Randolph theory is a "last stand" among Jefferson loyalists, but disagreeing with Brodie's portrayal of Jefferson's relationship with Hemings as a "love affair"). In 2012 the Smithsonian and Monticello collaborated on an exhibit that opened in Washington, DC: ''Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty''. It focused on six major slave families. One was the Hemingses, and the exhibit included the consensus that Jefferson was the father of Sally's children.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character''==
Brodie considered a range of subjects for a new biography.  [[Brigham Young]] was a clear field, but she decided not to “return to old ground.”  [[Richard Nixon]] had resigned the presidency shortly after she had finished ''Jefferson,'' and Brodie had spoken formally to both students and others about the former president.  As a liberal Democrat, Brodie had developed a “repellent fascination" with Nixon, a man whom she called “a rattlesnake,” a “plain damn liar,” and a "shabby, pathetic felon."&lt;ref name="Bringhurst 1999 224–26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=224–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brodie thought Nixon was an imposter like [[Joseph Smith]], she did not believe him to be the “charming imposter the Mormon leader was."&lt;ref name="Bringhurst 1999 224–26"/&gt;

Her interest in the former president had a personal basis as well.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst 1999 206–07"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=206–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her sons had nearly been drafted in 1969 shortly after Nixon had won election on the promise to end the [[Vietnam War]]. (At the last minute, sympathetic physicians had reclassified Bruce Brodie as unfit for military service on the basis of his allergies.)&lt;ref name="Bringhurst 1999 206–07"/&gt;

Also, when Nixon had sought information to discredit [[Daniel Ellsberg]], who had leaked the [[Pentagon Papers]], his operatives had burglarized the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis Fielding.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon ordered the collection of derogatory material about Ellsberg.  He also approved of the method taken by the “Plumbers.” In a White House tape released in 1996, Nixon can be heard telling his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman to "break in" to the offices of the Brookings Institution, to "rifle the files" and to bring him the material he wanted. "Break in and take it out!" Nixon demanded. "You understand?" The following day the President ordered his chief of staff to launch a smear campaign against Ellsberg. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/examiner/archive/1996/11/24/EDITORIAL9534.dtl]&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsberg was a close friend and former [[RAND]] associate of Bernard Brodie. Fielding was Fawn Brodie's long-time therapist. Brodie considered “Nixon the perpetrator of an assault on her privacy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neither Bernard nor her publisher was enthusiastic about her choice, Brodie began to work on her new project. She resigned her professorship at [[UCLA]] in 1977 to devote herself to research, including, for the first time, in [[oral history]] collections.  Brodie conducted 150 interviews.  She tried unsuccessfully to interview [[Henry Kissinger]]—whom she knew on a first-name basis—and Nixon for what she described in a letter to him as “a compassionate and accurate study.” (Nixon did not reply.) Although she could find no evidence, Brodie began to think that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship with his good friend [[Bebe Rebozo]]. Her psychoanalyst friends tried to warn her off this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=230–32, 245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness===
In November 1977, Bernard Brodie was diagnosed with a serious cancer, and Fawn Brodie suspended her research on Nixon: “That son of a bitch can wait.”&lt;ref name="Bringhurst 1999 236–37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=236–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  She nursed her husband until his death a year later.  Afterward, she struggled with “a depression from which she would never really emerge.” Under the circumstances, Nixon's biography seemed “like a total obscenity.”&lt;ref name="Bringhurst 1999 236–37"/&gt;

While hiking at a family reunion in 1980, Brodie became unusually tired. She was shortly diagnosed with metastatic [[lung cancer]], although she had never smoked. Between chemotherapy treatments, she pushed ahead to complete the Nixon study. Her three children and a daughter-in-law provided moral and editorial support. Knowing that she could never complete a full biography, Brodie ended the manuscript with Nixon's pre-presidential years, lending it an unfinished quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=250–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
''Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character'' was published in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than for any of her earlier books. Writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “[W]e are in danger of having the insights of psychotherapy used as a tool for character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.”&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey Hodgson, "The Liar on the Couch", ''New Republic'' 185 (September 9, 1981): 25-27; {{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=262–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   According to J. Philipp Rosenberg,  Brodie's study of [[Richard Nixon]]'s early career demonstrated a weakness of psychobiography because it was written by an author who disliked her subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|p=264}}: "Most critical was political scientist J. Philipp Rosenberg...."After finishing the Nixon book, I have an urge to demand that psychobiographers be barred from writing about people they dislike. While this would create a huge gap in the literature, it would do wonders for the reputation of psychobiography."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of the book were disappointing, in part because of the reviews, and in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as [[Henry Kissinger]], [[John Ehrlichman]], and [[John Dean]] had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie's book was most influential in stimulating [[Oliver Stone]] to create his controversial 1995 movie ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=265–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Brodie died nine months before publication of the book. As death neared, the cancer spread to her brain and bones, and Brodie suffered intense pain. During this period, she was visited in the hospital by her brother Thomas, who had remained a practicing Latter-day Saint. Brodie asked him to “give me a blessing,” although she had long been estranged from both her brother and the LDS Church. A few days later, Brodie released a note saying that her request for a [[priesthood blessing]] should not be misinterpreted as a request to return to the Church. It was Brodie's last signed statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=255–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with her wishes, friends spread her ashes over the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], which she loved and had successfully helped to protect from real estate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bringhurst|1999|pp=168–70}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Female  education'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hamariweb.com/articles/106714|title=تعلیم البنات|work=Hamariweb.com Articles|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a catch-all term of a complex set of issues and debates surrounding education ([[primary education]], [[secondary education]], [[tertiary education]], and [[health education]] in particular) for girls and women. It includes areas of [[gender equality]] and access to education, and its connection to the alleviation of poverty. Also involved are the issues of [[single-sex education]] and [[religious education]], in that the division of education along gender lines as well as religious teachings on education have been traditionally dominant and are still highly relevant in contemporary discussions of educating females as a global consideration. In the field of [[female education in STEM]], it has been shown that girls’ and women under-representation in [[Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network|science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)]] education is deep rooted.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the feminist movement certainly promoted the importance of the issues attached to female education, the discussion is wide-ranging and by no means narrowly defined.  It may include, for example, AIDS education.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Brent, ''Does female education prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa?'', Applied Economics, 2006, vol. 38, issue 5, pages 491-503&lt;/ref&gt; Universal education, meaning state-provided primary and secondary education independent of gender is not yet a global norm, even if it is assumed in most developed countries.
In some Western countries, women have surpassed men at many levels of education. For example, in the United States in 2005/2006, women earned 62% of associate degrees, 58% of bachelor's degrees, 60% of master's degrees, and 50% of doctorates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_178.asp |title=Historical summary of faculty, students, degrees, and finances in degree-granting institutions: Selected years, 1869-70 through 2005-06 |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education for disabled women has also improved. In 2011, Giusi Spagnolo became the first woman with Down Syndrome to graduate college in Europe (she graduated from the University of Palermo in Italy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lastampa.it/2011/03/22/italia/a-palermo-la-favola-della-down-diventata-dottoressa-RK1UzN9gPjq5siRois5ApO/pagina.html|title=A Palermo la favola della Down diventata dottoressa|last=Anello|first=Laura|newspaper=La Stampa Italia|language=it |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lottimista.com/2011/04/18/giusi-spagnolo-la-prima-laureata-down-d%E2%80%99italia/ |title=Giusi Spagnolo, la prima laureata Down d Italia |publisher=Lottimista.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925122858/http://www.lottimista.com/2011/04/18/giusi-spagnolo-la-prima-laureata-down-d%E2%80%99italia/ |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving girls' educational levels has been demonstrated to have clear impacts on the health and economic future of young women, which in turn improves the prospects of their entire community .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAMFED USA: What we do|url=http://us.camfed.org/site/PageServer?pagename=home_index|publisher=CAMFED|accessdate=October 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009011622/http://us.camfed.org/site/PageServer?pagename=home_index|archivedate=October 9, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infant mortality rate of babies whose mothers have received primary education is half that of children whose mothers are [[Literacy|illiterate]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the poorest countries of the world, 50% of girls do not attend secondary school. Yet, research shows that every extra year of school for girls increases their lifetime income by 15%. Improving female education, and thus the earning potential of women, improves the standard of living for their own children, as women invest more of their income in their families than men do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plan Overseas - Why Girls? |url=http://becauseiamagirl.ca/page.aspx?pid=3894 |publisher=Plan Canada |accessdate=October 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113021252/http://becauseiamagirl.ca/Page.aspx?pid=3894 |archivedate=November 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, many barriers to education for girls remain. In some African countries, such as Burkina Faso, girls are unlikely to attend school for such basic reasons as a lack of private latrine facilities for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plan Overseas - Education Girl-friendly schools see enrollment rates soar in Burkina Faso |url=http://becauseiamagirl.ca/page.aspx?pid=3859 |publisher=Plan Canada |accessdate=October 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011143727/http://becauseiamagirl.ca/page.aspx?pid=3859 |archivedate=October 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher attendance rates of high schools and university education among women, particularly in developing countries, have helped them make inroads to professional careers with better-paying salaries and wages. Education increases a woman's (and her partner and the family's) level of health and health awareness. Furthering women's levels of education and advanced training also tends to lead to later ages of initiation of sexual activity and first intercourse, later age at first marriage, and later age at first childbirth, as well as an increased likelihood to remain single, have no children, or have no formal marriage and alternatively, have increasing levels of long-term partnerships. It can lead to higher rates of barrier and chemical contraceptive use (and a lower level of sexually transmitted infections among women and their partners and children), and can increase the level of resources available to women who divorce or are in a situation of domestic violence. It has been shown, in addition, to increase women's communication with their partners and their employers, and to improve rates of civic participation such as voting or the holding of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Farzaneh Roudi-Fahimi|author2=Valentine M.

===Education and violence against women===

In Pakistan, a negative relationship was found between the formal level of education a woman attains and the likelihood of violence against that woman (After, 2013).  The researcher used snowball convenient sampling, a sampling method where participants are referred.  Ethical and privacy issues made this the most convenient method.  An informant played a major role in gathering information that was then cross-checked.  The sample of victims of violence was made up of married women from ages 18–60 both from rural and urban communities.  The study described different forms of physical violence that are already present and provided an idea of what women go through, even across communities (rural and urban).  Education in this study was stressed to be the solution and a necessity in eliminating violence.  A discussion of political and social barriers is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ather Khan|first=Hafiz Muhammad|date=2013|title=Studying the Role of Education in Eliminating Violence Against Women|url=|journal=Pakistan Journal of Commerce and Social Sciences|volume=7|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship is a lot more complicated than it seems, women can be illiterate but still become empowered (Marrs Fuchsel, 2014). Immigrant Latina Women (ILW) were part of a qualitative study of 8 to 10 participant groups, at a time, and completed an 11-week program centered on self-esteem, domestic violence awareness and healthy relationships.  Immigrant Latina Women (ILW) are a highly affected group by domestic violence.  Though this program took place outside of a traditional classroom, dialogue, critical thinking and emotional well-being were stressed, areas that should be acquired while in school.  Lastly, though many of the women were illiterate they were still able to come away with a stronger sense of control over their own lives, an important life skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marrs Fuchsel|first=Catherine L.|date=2014|title="YEs, I Feel Stronger With More Confidence and Strength:" Examining The Experiences of Immigrant Latina Women (ILW) Participating in The Si, Yo Puedo Curriculum|url=|journal=Journal of Ethnographic &amp; Qualitative Research|volume=8|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female Education associates with violence action towards women. The study of education and intimate partner violence (IPV). From a social causation perspective, improving women's education should protect them from violence, yet from a social selection perspective, education could proxy for unobserved factors that explain negative associations between education and IPV. Consistent with the social causation perspective, increasing women's schooling reduced both their recent and longer term probabilities of psychological, physical, and sexual IPV, as well as their recent and longer term probabilities of experiencing any IPV and polyvictimization. The results of supplemental mediation analyses provide support for three interrelated causal pathways—improvements in women's personal resources, delayed family formation, and changes in partner selection. These findings confirm the protective effects of women's education and further illuminate the mechanistic processes by which this occurs.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WEITZMAN|first=ABIGAIL|date=2018-06-25|title=DOES INCREASING WOMEN'S EDUCATION REDUCE THEIR RISK OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE? EVIDENCE FROM AN EDUCATION POLICY REFORM|journal=Criminology|volume=56|issue=3|pages=574–607|doi=10.1111/1745-9125.12181|issn=0011-1384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to reduce the risk of IPV for women by education?'''''

First, increasing women's education should expand their personal resource bases, including their cognitive skills, employment opportunities, and occupational status (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2004; Smith‐Greenaway, 2013).Second, the timing of secondary schooling may compete with early marriage and fertility (Duflo et al., 2007; Flórez and Núñez, 2003). If delayed entrance into marriage allows women more time to accumulate their material resources, then increasing education should implicitly provide them with more leverage to bargain with their partners and, thus, make them better able to minimize the risk of abuse or violent conflict (Kalmuss and Straus, 1982). Similarly, delaying fertility should reduce women's vulnerability to IPV by reducing the economic and physical dependence that stems from children (Kalmuss and Straus, 1982). Moreover, delaying marriage and fertility may afford women more opportunities to find personal fulfillment outside the domestic realm.Third, resource theory and family stress theory argue that the wealth or poverty of a woman's partner may affect her risk of IPV. The former, resource theory, asserts that men sometimes use violence as a way to influence relationship outcomes when they lack other means of negotiation (Felson and Messner, 2000; Fox et al., 2002; Goode, 1971). The latter, family stress theory, argues that a couples’ joint resource base affects IPV by influencing the household's level of financial stress and conflict (Fox et al., 2002). Evidence that IPV occurs more frequently in poorer households has indeed been found in several countries, including the United States, Thailand, India, and Colombia (Allen and Straus, 1980; Friedemann‐Sánchez and Lovatón, 2012; Hoffman, Demo, and Edwards, 1994; Weitzman, 2014). If a woman's education affects the characteristics of the potential partners she attracts, including their education, then having more education may reduce her likelihood of household poverty and associated financial conflict via her ability to attract partners with greater human capital.Fourth, schools are often important sites of public health campaigns, information dissemination, and socialization (Merakou et al., 2002). If women are exposed to anti‐violence messaging while in school, then this may influence their attitudes toward intimate partner violence and in turn their tolerance and/or use of violence in their own lives (Boyle et al., 2009; Gage and Hutchinson, 2006).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Female education with Violence and Divorce ====
The experiment of seeking the relationship between female education with violence and divorce based on the data from 914 married women from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Women from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The evidence suggests that the negative relationship between women's education and divorce is weaker when marriages involve abuse than when they do not. Supplementary analyses suggested that marital satisfaction explains some of the association among women's resources, victimization, and divorce but that marital violence continues to be a significant moderator of the education–divorce association. In sum, education appears to benefit women by both maintaining stable marriages and dissolving violent ones.

Women's educational attainment has risen dramatically in the past three decades, with the yearly number of American women awarded a 4‐year college degree now exceeding men by over 10% (National Center for Education Statistics, 2010). Accompanying this trend is an increasingly negative correlation between women's education and divorce (Amato, 2010; Cherlin, 2010). A comparison of American women who married in 1975–1979 to those who married in 1990–1994 revealed a 10% drop in the divorce rate for women with a 4‐year college degree and an 8% increase in the divorce rate for women without a high school degree (Martin, 2006). This divergence creates the current educational gradient in divorce, whereby college‐educated women are less than half as likely to get a divorce as women with a high school degree or less (Martin, 2006; McLanahan, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kreager|first=Derek A.|last2=Felson|first2=Richard B.|last3=Warner|first3=Cody|last4=Wenger|first4=Marin R.|date=2013-05-20|title=Women's Education, Marital Violence, and Divorce: A Social Exchange Perspective|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=75|issue=3|pages=565–581|doi=10.1111/jomf.12018|issn=0022-2445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female Education and Health ===
Female education have a tie relationship with women health. A research in Peru shows that increasing women's education is found to decrease the probability of short birth intervals and unwanted pregnancies (which may result in unsafe abortions) and to increase antenatal healthcare use, potentially owing to changes in women's cognitive skills, economic resources, and autonomy. These findings underscore the influential role of education in reducing maternal morbidity and highlight the contributions of women's education to population health and health transitions. A positive relationship between women's education and maternal health is well documented (Falkingham, 2003, Karlsen et al., 2011, Onah et al., 2006, Raghupathy, 1996).By improving women's access to schooling decreases their desired and realized fertility (Behrman, 2015a, Breierova and Duflo, 2004), delays their sexual debut (Baird et al., 2010), and improves their ability to negotiate sex (Baird et al., 2010). They've also shown that increasing women's education protects against sexually transmitted infections (Behrman, 2015b, De Neve et al., 2015) and reduces the risk of child mortality (Grépin and Bharadwaj, 2015). These effects of women's education on fertility, disease transmission, and child wellbeing give rise to the possibility that women's education affects maternal health as well: as education expands and fertility falls, women's exposure to maternal health complications should diminish alongside their number of pregnancies and births (Winikoff and Sullivan, 1987). Moreover, if education enhances health-seeking behaviors, then this may lead to the prevention and early detection of complications during pregnancy and childbirth and reduce the risk of death when complications arise (Carroli et al., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weitzman |first1=Abigail |title=The effects of women's education on maternal health: Evidence from Peru. |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |date=May 2017 |volume=180 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.03.004 |pmid=28301806 |pmc=5423409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and women's empowerment===

[http://Zeynalabdin_Taghiyev The Empress Alexandra Russian Muslim School for Girls (Russian: Александрийское императорское женское русско-мусульманское училище; Azeri: Aleksandra imperator rus-müsəlman qız məktəbi) of Baku (present-day Azerbaijan) was the first secular school for Muslim girls in the world, it was established in Baku, Azerbaijan by Z.Tagiyev, national industrial magnate and philanthropist. Despite what might seem to have been a project worthy of much praise, Zeynalabdin Taghiyev had great difficulty in gaining permission to open the school. He met with vigorous resistance; both from the Imperial Russian authorities and the conservative Muslim clergy.]

Education systems vary in administration, curriculum and personnel, but all have an influence on the students that they serve.  As women have gained rights, formal education has become a symbol of progress and a step toward gender equity.  In order for true gender equity to exist, a holistic approach needs to be taken.  The discussion of girl power and women’s education as solutions for eliminating violence against women and economic dependence on men can sometimes take dominance and result in the suppression of understanding how context, history and other factors affect women (Khoja-Moolji, 2015).  For example, when past secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, referenced the tragedies of Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan and the girls kidnapping in Chibok, Nigeria as comparable, using girls’ education as the focus, history and context were ignored.  What led to the shooting of Malala was reduced to being solely about her educating herself as a girl. United States interference, poverty, and government corruption and instability were not addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khoja-Moolji|first=Shenila|date=2015|title=Suturing Together Girls and Education: An Investigation Into the Social (Re)Production of Girls' Education as a Hegemonic Ideology|url=|journal=Diaspora, Indigenous, and Minority Education|volume=9|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education systems and schools play a central role in determining girls’ interest in various subjects, including STEM subjects, which can contribute to women's empowerment by providing equal opportunities to access and benefit from quality STEM education.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Women's empowerment and international development===

Micro- and macro level factors that get attention by international development agencies (IDA) vary.  For example, reaching a quota of representatives in political positions (macro level) but ignoring how home life pressures (micro level) do not actually leave women at a position of free self-expression (Stromquist, 2015).  IDA’s tend to focus on numbers and on information provided by the national governments.  This ignores the possibility that national governments are not the most reliable or trust worthy.  Programs put on by FAWE (Forum for African American Educationalists) called Tuseme clubs in Africa, which are Non Formal Education programs, are explored as they have proven successful and effective but do not get enough support from the government to be replicated.  Tuseme means “let’s speak out” in Swahili and in action the programs tailor to each participating school, focusing on communication and life skills, keeping the community in mind.  The program is set up as an extracurricular activity that focuses on issues through tools like school newspapers, dance and theater.  In this example, education and empowerment are tackled on outside the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stromquist|first=Nelly P.|date=2015|title=Women's Empowerment and Education: linking knowledge to transformative action|url=|journal=European Journal of Education|volume=50|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===China===

Along with the custom of [[footbinding]] among Chinese women that lasted through the end of the 19th century, it was recognized that a woman's virtue lay with her lack of knowledge.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} As a result, female education was not considered to be worthy of attention.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  With the arrival of numerous Christian missionaries from Britain and the US to China in the 19th century and some of them being involved in the starting of schools for women, female education started to receive some attention.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near one another, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors of Western medicine.This resulted in a tremendous need for women in Western medicine in China.Thus, female medical missionary, Dr.Mary H. Fulton (1854-1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Inasmuch.html?id=04TOSAAACAAJ |title=Inasmuch |author=Mary H. Fulton|editor=The United Study of Forring |publisher=BiblioBazaar |year=2010 |isbn=978-1140341796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was sent by the Foreign Missions Board of the Presbyterian Church (USA)to found the first medical college for women in China.  Known as the [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)#Hackett|Hackett Medical College for Women]] (夏葛女子醫學院),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=PANG Suk Man |url=http://lib-nt2.hkbu.edu.hk/cil-image/theses/abstracts/b15564174a.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Hackett Medical College for Women in China (1899-1936) |publisher=Hong Kong Baptist University |date=February 1998|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cqvip.com/qk/83891A/200203/6479902.html |title=中国近代第一所女子医学院－－夏葛医学院-【维普网】-仓储式在线作品出版平台-www.cqvip.com |publisher=Cqvip.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; this College was located in Guangzhou, China, and was enabled by a large donation from Mr. Edward A.K. Hackett (1851-1916) of Indiana, United States.  The College was dedicated in 1902 and offered a four-year curriculum.  By 1915, there were more than 60 students, mostly in residence. Most students became Christians, due to the influence of Dr. Fulton.   The College was officially recognized, with its diplomas marked with the official stamp of the Guangdong provincial government.  The College was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status.  The David Gregg Hospital for Women and Children (also known as Yuji Hospital 柔濟醫院&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Crusade_of_Compassion_for_the_Healing.html?id=UpkNAAAAYAAJ|title=A Crusade of Compassion for the Healing of the Nations: A Study of Medical Missions for Women and Children |author=Belle Jane Allen |editor=Caroline Atwater Mason |others=Compiler: Belle Jane Allen |publisher=Central committee on the united study of foreign missions |year=1919 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.qq.com/a/20100411/001143.htm |title=柔济医院的实验室_新闻_腾讯网 |publisher=News.qq.com |date=2012-01-17 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was affiliated with this College. The graduates of this College included [[Lee Sun Chau]] (周理信, 1890-1979, alumna of ([[Belilios Public School]]) and WONG Yuen-hing (黃婉卿), both of whom graduated in the late 1910s &lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, "Piloted to Serve", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PilotedToServe |title=Piloted to Serve |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then practiced medicine in the hospitals in Guangdong province.

====Education after the establishment of the People's Republic of China====
Between the years 1931 and 1945, the percent of uneducated women was over 90%, and most of the women who were educated had only completed the elementary level.&lt;ref name="docin.com"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.docin.com/p-267194495.html |script-title=zh:中国女性教育发展 - 豆丁网 |publisher=Docin.com |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2015-04-17|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1950s, after the establishment of People Republic China, the government started a civilization project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.163.com/14/0917/16/A6BULAB100234KKR.html |title=1950年："扫盲"字眼消失 一个落后时代的远去_网易政务 |publisher=Gov.163.com |date=2014-09-17 |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enabled large amounts of uneducated women to learn basic writing and calculation. This project raised the proportion of educated women. It was promoted not only in cities but also in rural area. Villages had their own elementary schools. Instead of only taking care of children and chores at home, middle-aged women had chances to learn writing and reading in local schools.

In the 1980s, Chinese central government passed a new education law, which required local governments to promote 9-year obligation education nationwide &lt;ref name="中华人民共和国义务教育法_教育部门户网站_MOE.GOV.CN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.edu.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/moe_619/200606/15687.html|title=中华人民共和国义务教育法_教育部门户网站_MOE.GOV.CN|date=2006-06-30|publisher=Moe.edu.cn|accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new education law guaranteed education rights until middle school. Before the 1960s, female enrollment in elementary school was 20%. 20 years after publishment of education law, in the year 1995, this percentage had increased to 98.2%. By 2003, proportion of female who dropped from middle school decreased to  2.49%.&lt;ref name="Comparative Education Review p193"&gt;Comparative Education Review. May99, Vol. 43 Issue 2, p193. 18p. 3 Charts, 4 Graphs.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the fifth national census in 2000, the average education length of females is up to 7.4 years. This digit increases from 7.0 years to 7.4 years in 3 years. However, the female education duration is still 0.8 year less than male's duration. This gap in higher-level of education is larger in rural areas.In the countryside, parents tend to use their limited resources for sons because they believe sons have abilities to bring more back and their contributions to family in the future are more significant than daughters. In an investigation, parents are 21.9% more likely to stop financing girls' education if they come into financial problems and family issues. Boys are provided with more opportunities for further studying, especially after middle school. This difference became more evident in the universities.&lt;ref&gt;William Lavely, Xiao Zhenyu, Li Bohua and Ronald Freedman (1990). The Rise in Female Education in China: National and Regional Patterns. The China Quarterly, 121, pp 61-93. doi:10.1017/S0305741000013515.&lt;/ref&gt;

When time comes into the 21st century, university education is becoming more prevalent.The total enrollment goes up. Compare to the year of 1977, which is the first year when college entrance examination was recovered, the admission rate increased from 4.8% to 74.86%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.cn/gao_kao_1051/20130507/t20130507_939505.shtml |title=全国历年参加高考人数和录取人数统计-中国教育 |publisher=Edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the general admission has largely risen, more students got into universities. Although women are assumed to own the same rights of general education, they are forced to do better in the Chinese college entrance examination ([[Gaokao]]) than males. Girls need to achieve higher grades than male students in order to get into the same level university. It is an invisible ceiling for Chinese female, especially in the top universities. It is not a public rule but a mainstream consensus among most of Chinese university admission offices. According to a telephone interview with an officer, who declined to give her name, at the Teaching Office at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]], "female students must account for less than 15 percent of students because of the nature of their future career."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/world/asia/08iht-educlede08.html?pagewanted=all |title=Women in China Face Rising University Entry Barriers |work=nytimes.com |accessdate=11 October 2015|date=2012-10-07 |last1=Tatlow |first1=Didi Kirsten }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in Islam played an important role in the foundations of many educational institutions, such as [[Fatima al-Fihri]]'s founding of the [[University of Al Karaouine]], the oldest existing, continually operating and first degree awarding educational institution in the world according to [[UNESCO]] and [[Guinness World Records]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/3000/oldest-university Oldest University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medina of Fez|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/170|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 859. This continued through to the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] in the 12th and 13th centuries, when 160 mosques (places of worship) and [[madrasas]] (places of education) were established in [[Damascus]], 26 of which were funded by women through the [[Waqf]] (charitable trust or trust law) system. Half of all the royal [[Patronage|patrons]] for these institutions were also women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=978-0-313-32270-9|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sunni scholar [[Ibn Asakir]], in the 12th century, there were opportunities for female education in the [[Islamic Golden Age|mediaeval Islamic world]]. Asakir wrote that women should study, earn ''ijazahs'' (academic degrees), and qualify as [[Ulema|scholars]] and teachers. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=978-0-313-32270-9|pages=196 &amp; 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Asakir himself had studied under 80 different female teachers in his time. According to a hadith collected in the ''Saḥih'' of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|al-Bukhārī]], the women of [[Medina]] who aided [[Muhammad]] were notable for not letting social mores restrain their education in religious knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berkey|first1=Jonathan|title=The Transmission of Knowledge in Medieval Cairo: A Social History of Islamic Education|date=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-03191-0|page=162|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1318410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text="How splendid were the women of the [[Ansar (Islam)|''anṣār'']]; shame did not prevent them from becoming learned [''yatafaqqahna''] in the faith."}}

While it was unusual for females to enroll as students in formal [[Class (education)|classes]], it was common for women to attend informal lectures and study sessions at mosques, madrasas, and other public places. While there were no legal restrictions on female education, some men, such as [[Moḥammed ibn al-Haj al-Abdari al-Fasi|Muhammad ibn al-Hajj]] (d. 1336), did not approve of this practice and were appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally audited lectures in his time.&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=978-0-313-32270-9|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women accounted for no more than one percent of Islamic scholars prior to the 12th century, there was a large increase of female scholars after this. In the 15th century, [[al-Sakhawi]] devoted an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionary ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Ḍawʾ al-lāmiʻ}}'' to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Women in Iran from the Rise of Islam to 1800|last=Guity Nashat|first=Lois Beck|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-252-07121-8|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the scholar [[Mohammad Akram Nadwi]], currently a researcher from the [[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]], has written 40 volumes on the [[muhaddith|{{transl|ar|ALA|muḥaddithāt}}]] (the women scholars of [[hadith|{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥadīth}})]], and found at least 8,000 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/magazine/25wwlnEssay.t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print |title=Reconsideration: A Secret History |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2007-02-25 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's unequal status in the Muslim world has been the subject of widespread debate. Comparing to other country,women in the Middle East and other Muslim‐majority countries tend to have fewer years of schooling, on average, lower rates of labor force participation, less representation in politics, and wider gender gaps on these measures compared with women in other countries (Cherif 2010; Fish 2002; Rahman 2012; M.L. Ross 2008). Low education levels among women in Muslim‐majority countries are part of a broader clash of civilizations between traditional or conservative Islam and the West over issues related to gender and sexuality. Drawing on data from the World Values Survey, Inglehart and Norris (2003) find that, compared with residents of Western countries, larger shares of Muslims support traditional gender roles for men and women and say higher education is more important for boys than for girls.

Conservative gender norms and sexual mores could shape Muslim women's educational attainment through a number of pathways. If girls are expected to become wives and mothers at young ages, families may see little need to invest in their daughters’ education, especially if the financial and opportunity costs are high and gender segregation of the labor market offers little hope for strong economic returns (Lehrer 1999). Girls may also internalize gendered expectations and either perform poorly in school or end their schooling earlier than boys (Buchmann, DiPrete, and McDaniel 2008). High‐achieving girls might also face discrimination in the classroom or be prevented from advancing through school. The influence of cultural values could also be indirect: for instance, early marriage and childbearing could interrupt girls’ schooling, leading to lower attainment (Johnson‐Hanks 2006; Takyi and Addai 2002). Higher fertility, too, may stretch families’ resources and lead to lower investment in daughters’ educational opportunities (Buchmann and Hannum 2001). Finally, widely held conservative gender attitudes may influence how governments allocate resources for women's education (Østby, Urdal, and Rudolfsen 2016).

Muslim women's educational disadvantage might also be rooted more in the past than in the present.contemporary religious differences in women's education levels may be left over from an era when religious beliefs and attitudes were more tightly linked to educational outcomes. Economic and structural barriers may still prevent some countries and groups from achieving universal access to education or increasing enrollments in secondary or higher education to Western levels (Østby, Urdal, and Rudolfsen 2016). But religious differences in women's education and gender equality should be diminishing over time as countries and regions that were further behind, in part for religious reasons, catch up with the West, where education levels have reached a plateau (Courbage and Todd 2007; Fukuyama 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClendon|first=David|last2=Hackett|first2=Conrad|last3=Potančoková|first3=Michaela|last4=Stonawski|first4=Marcin|last5=Skirbekk|first5=Vegard|date=2018-04-06|title=Women's Education in the Muslim World|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=44|issue=2|pages=311–342|doi=10.1111/padr.12142|issn=0098-7921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global discourses on women’s education are also grounded in a mod- ern versus traditional binary, where the West is seen as progressive, mod- ern, and secular and Muslim societies are positioned as backward, traditional, and religious (Abu-Lughod 2009; Ahmed 1992; Asad 2003; Mahmood 2005; Scott 2007). In these international projects, women’s education becomes an individualistic and market-oriented goal, whereas Islam is treated as a challenge that restricts women’s access to schools, job markets, and political participation (Abu-Lughod 2009; Cornwall 2007; Kandiyoti 2005). Reconfigurations of gender, class, and Islam produced new regulations as well as new possibilities for middle-class Muslim women.For women, being educated through practicing politeness, orderliness, thrift, cleanliness, accounting, and hygiene was set in opposi- tion to the coarse, vulgar, loud, quarrelsome, and sexually promiscuous “un-Islamic” mannerisms associated with lower-class females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khurshid|first=Ayesha|date=2014-09-11|title=Islamic Traditions of Modernity|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–121|doi=10.1177/0891243214549193|issn=0891-2432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islamic Republic of Iran====

Since the 1979 revolution, Iran was under control of [[Islamic rules]], the progress of female education was affected by Islamic ecclesiocracy. Women are forced to wear [[veiling]] and are prevented from going to the same school as male students. Female students have to learn different versions of textbooks, which are special editions only for female students. Unmarried women are ineligible for financial aid if they attempt to study abroad. Throughout the past 30 years, the issue of female education has been constantly under debate.&lt;ref name="web.a.ebscohost.com"&gt;Mehran, Golnar. ""Doing And Undoing Gender": Female Higher Education In The Islamic Republic Of Iran." International Review of Education 55.5/6 (2009): 541-559. Academic Search Complete. Web. 17 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian women do have desires and abilities to pursue further education. An Iranian high school student can earn a diploma after studying 3 years. If students aim to enter colleges, they will stay in the high schools for the fourth year study, which has very intense study. According to researches, 42% of female students choose to have fourth year in the high school but only 28% of male students choose to study in order to enter university. Moreover, women have a much higher probability than men to pass college entrance exams. Islamic female are in need of achieving higher education and truth proved that their abilities are enough for getting higher education. The education opportunities for female need more national attention and less regulations.&lt;ref name="web.a.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

During 1978 and 1979, the proportion of women who participated in universities as students or faculties was rather low. 31% of students admitted to universities were women. For faculty gender composition, there are 14% female. This situation has changed with time passing by. University enrollment was decreased under the influence of [[Iranian Cultural Revolution]]. The general enrollment population declined during that time. After the cultural revolution, the amount of enrollment was going up. The increase in the number of university students is accompanied with an increase in female rate.&lt;ref name="web.a.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

Islamic higher education contains 5 levels. The 5 levels are associate, bachelor's, master's, professional doctorate and specialized doctorate.&lt;ref name="web.a.ebscohost.com"/&gt; Before the revolution, the gender gap is obvious in master level and specialized doctorate, which are only 20% and 27%. It has changed after 30 years. In 2007, the female percent in master's degree rose up to 43% and for specialized doctorate degree, this data rose up to 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/6046/education-levels-nine-predominantly-islamic-countries.aspx |title=Education Levels: Nine Predominantly Islamic Countries |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female rate has not only increased in the students but also in faculty. 20 years ago, only 6% of all professors and 8% of all associated professors were women. Now 8% of all professors and 17% of all associated professors are female.&lt;ref name="web.a.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

=====Literacy programs=====

While formal education is prevalent amongst Iranian women, non-formal educational intuitions are an option as well. Non-formal education in the Islamic Republic of Iran originated from the Literary Movement Organization (LMO), which aspired to decrease illiteracy rates in the country. Established in 1984, LMO’s tremendous efforts rectified the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] regime’s neglect in regards to educating children and populations in rural areas. In the late 1980s, LMO created adult literacy programs, vocational-technical schools, and religious institutions to combat high illiteracy rates. Adult literacy programs teach introductory reading, writing, and math in two cycles. While reading, writing, dictation, and arithmetic are introduced in the first cycle, the second cycle delves into Islamic studies, experimental and social sciences, and the Persian language. Although these educational organizations are gender inclusive, they mainly cater to women; in fact, 71% of enrollees are women between the ages of 15-45. Throughout the 1990s, two-thirds of enrollees in literacy programs were women, which directly led to a dramatic rise (20%) in female literacy rates in Iran from 1987 to 1997.

=====Religious schools=====

Religious schools are another educational route for Iranian women. Their popularity is illustrated by the rise in the institution of "female seminaries" as of 2010. In 1984, Ayatollah Khomeini, former supreme leader of Iran, called for the creation of [[Jamiat al-Zahra|Jami‘at al-Zahra]], an alliance of smaller religious schools. This led to the creation of the first female seminary in Iran. These institutions offer the opportunity to earn anything from high school diplomas to doctoral degrees. The acceptance rate for women into these religious institutions was 28% in 2010 (7,000 accepted out of 25,000 applicants).

=====Other educational routes=====

Newlyweds (women specifically) are educated on family planning, safe sex, and birth control in population control programs. In addition, the government has established rural health houses managed by local health workers. These health professionals travel to different areas in order to impart information about women’s health and birth control.

====Ancient period====
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002.jpg|thumb|Portrait emphasizing the female subject's literacy, from [[Pompeii]], mid-1st century AD]]
In ancient Rome, [[nobiles|upperclass]] women seem to have been well-educated, some highly so, and were sometimes praised by male historians of the time for their learning and cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family," in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), pp. 30, 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelia Metella]], for instance, was distinguished for her knowledge of geometry, literature, music, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'' 55 LacusCurtius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#55 edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the wall paintings of Pompeii, women are more likely than men to be pictured with writing implements.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zanker, ''The Mask of Socrates: The Image of the Intellectual in Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1995), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Some women had sufficient knowledge of Roman [[law|the law]] and oratorical training to conduct court cases on their own behalf, or on behalf of others.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50 ''et passim'', citing a section from the historian Valerius Maximus that deals with women's abilities in the courtroom.&lt;/ref&gt; Among occupations that required education, women could be scribes and secretaries, [[calligraphy|calligraphers]],&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder,''Natural History'', 35.147, gives a list of female artists and their painters.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some and perhaps many Roman girls went to a [[ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]]. Boys and girls were educated either together or with similar methods and curriculum. One passage in [[Livy]]'s history assumes that the daughter of a [[centurion]] would be in school; the social rank of a centurion was typically equivalent to modern perceptions of the "middle class".&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', pp. 197-198, citing also evidence from [[Ovid]] and [[Martial]].&lt;/ref&gt; Girls as well as boys participated in public [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]], and sang advanced choral compositions that would require formal musical training.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval period====
[[File:Choir-of-Virgins---Benedictional-of-St-Aethelwold---c-9751-AD.jpg|thumb|right|Page from an illuminated manuscript from the late 10th century. The three nuns in front are all holding books, and the middle one appears to be teaching, gesturing to make a point.]]
Medieval education for females was typically tied to a convent. Research has uncovered that several early women educators were in charge of schools for girls:

'''[[Íte of Killeedy|St. Ita of Ireland]]''' - died 570 AD. Founder and teacher of a co-ed school for girls and boys at her monastery of Cell Ide. Several important saints studied under her, including [[Brendan|St. Brendan the Navigator]].&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg, Jane. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w8FMjgPTWBUC Forgetful of their Sex: Female Sanctity and Society, ca. 500-1100.] Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998. p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caesaria the Younger''' - died 550 AD. Successor to the sister of [[Caesarius of Arles|St. Caesarius]] and abbess of the convent he founded for her nuns, Caesaria the Younger continued the teaching of over a hundred women at the convent and aided in the copying and preservation of books.&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg (1998), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. [[Hilda of Whitby]]''' - died 680 AD. Founder of the co-ed monastery of Whitby (men and women lived in separate houses), she established a center of education in her monastery similar to what was founded by the Frankish nuns. According to the Venerable Bede, "Her prudence was so great, that not only meaner men in their need, but sometimes even kings and princes, sought and received her counsel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_IV_Chap_XXIII |title=Bede. Ecclesiastical History of England. Book IV, Chapter XXIII |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2011-12-17 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Bertilla''' - died c. 700 AD. Queen [[Bathild]] requested her services for the convent she had founded at Chelle. Her pupils founded convents in other parts of western Europe, including Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg (1998), p. 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Leoba|St. Leoba]]''' - died 782 AD. St. [[Boniface]] requested her presence on his mission to the Germans and while there she founded an influential convent and school.

[[Bede|St. Bede the Venerable]] reports that noble-women were often sent to these schools for girls even if they did not intend to pursue the religious life,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_III_Chap_VIII |title=Bede. Ecclesiastical History of England. Book III, Chapter VIII |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2011-12-17 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and St. Aldhelm praised their curriculum for including grammar, poetry, and Scriptural study.&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg, Jane . Forgetful of their Sex: Female Sanctity and Society, ca. 500-1100. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998. p. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; The biography of Sts. Herlinda and Renilda also demonstrates that women in these convent schools could be trained in art and music.&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg (1998), pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Emperor Charlemagne, he had his wife and daughters educated in the liberal arts at the Palace Academy of Aachen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.asp#Private%20Life%20(continued) |title=Einhard. Life of Charlemagne. Written before 840 AD. Chapter 19 |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he is praised in the Vita Karolini Magni. There is evidence that other nobles had their daughters educated at the Palace Academy as well. In line with this, authors such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]] indicate that the daughters of the nobility were widely given to education so that they could live up to their social position to come.

====Early modern period, humanist attitudes====
[[File:Katharinaundmagdalena.jpg|thumb| 250 px| [[Konrad Witz]] depicted [[Saint Catharine of Alexandria]] (on the right) as a crowned scholar holding a book. The patron saint of learning, Catholic hagiography credited Catharine with having won a dispute with fifty of the best pagan philosophers and orators of her time.]] 
In [[early modern]] Europe, the question of female education had become a commonplace one, in other words a [[literary topos]] for discussion. Around 1405 [[Leonardo Bruni]] wrote ''De studies et letteris'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/bruni.html |title=Online English text |publisher=History.hanover.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed to Baptista di Montefeltro, the daughter of Antonio II da Montefeltro, [[Duke of Urbino]]; it commends the study of Latin, but warns against [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], astrology and [[rhetoric]]. In discussing the classical scholar [[Isotta Nogarola]], however, [[Lisa Jardine]]&lt;ref&gt;''Women Humanists: Education for What?'', pp. 48-81 in ''Feminism and Renaissance Studies'' (1999), edited by [[Lorna Hudson]].&lt;/ref&gt; notes that (in the middle of the 15th century), ''‘Cultivation’ is in order for a noblewoman; formal competence is positively unbecoming.'' [[Christine de Pisan]]'s ''Livre des Trois Vertus'' is contemporary with Bruni's book, and ''sets down the things which a lady or baroness living on her estates ought to be able to do''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eileen Power]], ''The Position of Women'', p. 418, in ''The Legacy of the Middle Ages'' (1926), edited by [[G. C. Crump]] and [[E. F. Jacob]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1516 book ''[[Utopia]]'', [[Thomas More]] advocated for women to have the right to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics|author=Riane Eisler|date=2007|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erasmus]] wrote at length about education in ''De pueris instituendis'' (1529, written two decades before); not mostly concerned with female education,&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Sowards, ''Erasmus and the Education of Women'' Sixteenth Century Journal, Vol. 13, No. 4 (Winter, 1982), pp. 77-89.&lt;/ref&gt; in this work he does mention with approbation the trouble Thomas More took with teaching his whole family.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Erasmus Reader'' (1990), edited by Erika Rummel, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine of Aragon]] "had been born and reared in one of the most brilliant and enlightened of European courts, where the cultural equality of men and women was normal".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Marples, ''Princes in the Making: A Study of Royal Education'' (1965), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; By her influence, she made education for English women both popular and fashionable. In 1523, [[Juan Luis Vives]], a follower of Erasmus, wrote in Latin his ''[[De institutione feminae Christianae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gloria Kaufman]], ''Juan Luis Vives on the Education of Women'', Signs, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Summer, 1978), pp. 891-896. In print as ''The Instruction of a Christian Woman'', edited by Virginia Walcott Beauchamp, Elizabeth H. Hageman and Margaret Mikesell, {{ISBN|978-0-252-02677-5}}, {{ISBN|0-252-02677-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was commissioned by Catherine, who had charge of the education of her daughter for the future [[Queen Mary I of England]]; in translation it appeared as ''Education of a Christian Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Translated in 1524, by [[Richard Hyrde]]; [http://www.valpo.edu/english/emtexts/vives1.html excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625163032/http://www.valpo.edu/english/emtexts/vives1.html |date=2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in line with traditional [[didactic literature]], taking a strongly religious direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/vivese.pdf PDF], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It also placed a strong emphasis on Latin literature.&lt;ref&gt;Marples, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Comenius]] was an advocate of formal education for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About John Amos Comenius|url=http://www.comeniusfoundation.org/comenius.htm|website=Comenius Foundation|publisher=Comenius Foundation|accessdate=22 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015013145/http://www.comeniusfoundation.org/comenius.htm|archivedate=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact his emphasis was on a type of universal education making no distinction between humans; with an important component allowed to parental input, he advocated in his ''Pampaedia'' schooling rather than other forms of tutoring, for all.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Murphy, ''Comenius: A Critical Reassessment of his Life and Works'' (1995), Chapter IV, ''The Comenian Vision of Universal Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reformation]] prompted the establishment of compulsory education for boys and girls. Most important was [[Martin Luther]]'s text 'An die Ratsherren aller Städte deutschen Landes,' (1524) with the call for establishing schools for both girls and boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=LmOsRpe0nC0C |page=70 |title=Luther deutsch }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the Protestant South-West of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with cities like [[Strassburg]], became pioneers in educational questions. Under the influence of Strasbourg in 1592 the German Duchy Pfalz-Zweibrücken became the first territory of the world with compulsory education for girls and boys.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Sehling (ed.), Die evangelischen Kirchenordnungen des 16. Jahrhunderts. Vol 18: Rheinland-Pfalz I. Tübingen 2006, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth I of England]] had a strong humanist education, and was praised by her tutor [[Roger Ascham]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Charleton, ''Education in Renaissance England'' (1965), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; She fits the pattern of education for leadership, rather than for the generality of women. When [[Johannes Sturm]] published Latin correspondence with Ascham centred on the achievements in humanist study of Elizabeth and other high-ranking English persons, in [[Konrad Heresbach]]'s ''De laudibus Graecarum literarum oratio'' (1551), the emphasis was on the nobility of those tackling the classics, rather than gender.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence V. Ryan, ''Roger Ascham'' (1963) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern period====
[[File:Nikolaj Alexandrowitsch Jaroschenko - Girl student.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A student of the [[Bestuzhev Courses]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], 1880]]
The issue of female education in the large, as emancipatory and rational, is broached seriously in [[the Enlightenment]]. [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], who worked as a teacher, governess, and school-owner, wrote of it in those terms. Her first book was ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'', years before the publication of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''.

The [[Commission of National Education]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], founded in 1777, considered the first [[Ministry of Education]] in history, was a central, autonomous body responsible for nationwide, secular and coeducational training. In the late 19th century, in what was then the Russian province of [[Poland]], in response to the lack of higher training for women, the so-called [[Flying University]] was organized, where women were taught covertly by Polish scholars and academics. Its most famous student was [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]], better known as Marie Curie, who went on to win two [[Nobel Prizes]].

Much education was channelled through religious establishments. Not all of these educated women only for marriage and motherhood; for example, [[Quaker views on women]] had allowed much equality from the foundation of the denomination in the mid-17th century. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] and his wife [[Grizell Hoare]] set up the [[Newington Academy for Girls]] in 1824, teaching an unusually wide range of subjects from languages to sciences. The first state-financed higher education institution for women in Europe, was established by [[Catherine II of Russia]]
[[File:Elementary education of Bosnian women in 1948.jpg|thumb|Bosnian Muslim and Christian women learning to read and write in 1948.]]
Actual progress in institutional terms, for secular education of women, began in the West in the 19th century, with the founding of colleges offering single-sex education to young women. These appeared in the middle of the century. ''The Princess: A Medley'', a [[narrative poem]] by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], is a satire of women's education, still a controversial subject in 1848, when [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] first opened in London. [[Emily Davies]] campaigned for women's education in the 1860s, and founded [[Girton College]] in 1869, as did [[Anne Clough]] found [[Newnham College]] in 1875. Progress was gradual, and often depended on individual efforts - for example, those of [[Frances Lupton]], which led to the founding of the [[Leeds Girls' High School]] in 1876.  [[W. S. Gilbert]] parodied Tennyson's poem and treated the themes of women's higher education and [[feminism]] in general with ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]'' in (1870) and ''[[Princess Ida]]'' in 1883.

Once women began to graduate from institutions of higher education, there steadily developed also a stronger academic stream of schooling, and the [[teacher training]] of women in larger numbers, principally to provide primary education. Women's access to traditionally all-male institutions took several generations to become complete.

====Educational reform====
[[Image:Mary Lyon ivory miniature cropped.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Mary Lyon]] (1797-1849) founded the first woman's college in the United States]]
The interrelated themes of barriers to education and employment continued to form the backbone of feminist thought in the 19th century, as described, for instance by [[Harriet Martineau]] in her 1859 article "Female Industry" in the ''[[Edinburgh Journal]]''. Despite the changes in the economy, the position of women in society had not greatly improved and unlike [[Frances Power Cobbe]], Martineau did not support the emerging call for the vote for practical reasons.

Slowly the efforts of women like  Emily Davies and [[English Woman's Journal#Like-minded women|the Langham group]] (under [[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon]]) started to make inroads. [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] (1848) and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]] (1849) in London started to offer some education to women, and by 1862 Davies was establishing a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established (1858) [[UCLES|Cambridge Local Examinations]], with partial success (1865). A year later she published ''The Higher Education of Women.'' She and Bodichon founded the first higher educational institution for women, with five students, which became [[Girton College, Cambridge]] in 1873, followed by [[Lady Margaret Hall]] at Oxford in 1879. Bedford had started awarding degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, few could take advantage of them and life for women students was very difficult.

As part of the continuing dialogue between British and American feminists, [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]], the first woman in the US to graduate in medicine (1849), lectured in Britain with Langham support. They also supported [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson|Elizabeth Garrett’s]] attempts to assail the walls of British medical education against strong opposition; she eventually took her degree in France. Garrett's successful campaign to run for office on the [[London School Board]] in 1870 is another example of how a small band of determined women were starting to reach positions of influence at the level of local government and public bodies.

===Africa===
Christian missionaries in the 19th century opened modern educational methods, but they usually focused on boys.  After early experiments they settled on promoting  ideology of domestic femininity imparted through girls' schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Leach, "Resisting conformity: Anglican mission women and the schooling of girls in early nineteenth-century West Africa" ''History of Education'' (2012) 41#2 2, pp133-153.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[South Africa]] after 1820, male Scottish missionaries decided that only the most basic education was necessary to prepare native women for the propagation of Christianity within the home. They prevented female teachers from operating in the Scottish mission's territory. They delayed the establishment of a Girls' Department at [[Lovedale Institution]]. Finally new leadership arrived who had a broader vision of uplifting native women so they could promote Christianity and Western gender codes.&lt;ref&gt;

Women's education in West Africa manifested in both formal and informal structures, with one of the more notable structures that had influence on women's education being preparatory schools labeled "Bush Schools." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Day|first=Lynda|date=1998|title=Rites and Reason: Precolonial Education and Its Relevance to the Current Production and Transmission of Knowledge|url=|journal=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bush schools were institutions that would oftentimes boast near 100% graduation rates and completed courses. They were organized by women and had a planned, structured curriculum, which included learning how to do skills such as learning how to "fish, cook, weave, spin cotton, dress hair, and make baskets, musical instruments, pots, and fishing nets."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   Much of the scholarship and research on these schools arises from the Bundu schools of Sierra Leone. In addition to these skills, girls would often be given reproductive education, such as birth control techniques or child rearing skills. In particular to the Bundu schools, women would be given an intense education in medicinal herbs and home medicinal skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These schools didn't just teach educational curriculum (such as history passed on through songs and dances), but enabled the transmission of cultural values and were centers of female power. Despite the colonial and post-colonial ideal that women ought to be educated just to serve decorative or child-bearing maternal roles, these institutions taught women to play central economic, corporate and familial roles in their communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Colonial =====

Early colonial forms of education on the West African coasts, particularly among the [[Dahomey]], [[Ashanti people|Asante]] and [[Yoruba people|Yorùbá]] people, were pioneered by missionaries and institutions that were trying to educate religious thought in addition to teaching more traditional western educational topics such as reading and writing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Education in Ghana: From the Earliest Times to the Declaration of Independence|last=Graham|first=C.K.|publisher=Routeledge|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1529, King John III of Portugal had given instruction to open schools and provide education in "religious thought, reading and writing" and for the instructors to be paid by the pupil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   For women in particular however, these colonial forms of education brought with them European ideals of women's roles in the family, society and economy. These Western ideas of womanhood oftentimes contrasted with women's roles in the economy, society, or in the home.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allman|first=Jean|date=Autumn 1994|title=Making Mothers: Missionaries, Medical Officers and Women's Work in Colonial Asante, 1924-1945|url=|journal=History Workshop Journal|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Igbo people|Igbo]] women had associations known as [[Sitting on a man|Mikiri]], which were economic and social forums for women in which they discussed direct action to enforce their interests, that were largely misunderstood and disregarded by the British colonial government. Hence, as the British colonial government introduced schools to the region, they ignored educating women to fill economic roles in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Allen|first=Judith|date=1972|title="Sitting on a Man": Colonialism and the Lost Political Institutions of Igbo Women|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies|volume=6|pages=165–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the educational ideal of men as "[[Breadwinner model|breadwinners]]", i.e. the primary financial support of a nuclear family structure, was introduced by the British colonial state in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Africa After Gender?|last=Lindsay|first=Lisa|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Bloomington|pages=Chapter: Working with Gender: The Emergence of the "Male Breadwinner" in Colonial Southwestern Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the groups of people that the colonial governments in West Africa put heavy import on educating were the mixed children of white people, typically men, and indigenous people, typically women. In pre-British colonist state Ghana, when much of the interaction between indigenous people and Europeans was through Dutch traders, mixed race children of traders and indigenous people were removed from their indigenous communities and placed in Dutch educational institutions in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crossing the Color Line: Race, Sex, and the Contested Politics of Colonialism in Ghana|last=Ray|first=Carina|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Athens|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these early colonial schools the education was also gendered by Western standards: the boys were educated from a young age to be military officers in the Dutch army and the girls were educated to be married to Dutch military officers in the region.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

One of the other ways through which colonizing countries were able to exert influence and indirect rule over the indigenous people was through maternal education. In colonial Ghana, [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist]] missionaries led classes teaching western methods of hygiene and child birth to the indigenous mothers or mothers-to-be.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The missionaries tried to construct an ideal of motherhood that matched white European middle-class standards, irrespective of the social context of the ideals of motherhood in place in the [[Ashanti Empire|Asante]] societies they were located in.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===== Contemporary =====
In post-colonial West Africa, many of the ideals of Western education have remained while much of the infrastructure and funding left with the colonial presence.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hollos|first=Marida|date=1998|title=The Status of Women in Southern Nigeria: Is Education a Help or a Hindrance?|url=|journal=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|volume=|pages=247–277|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in Nigeria, formal education was seen as a policy making tool, as women's formal education has been linked to having effects on "population growth, health, nutrition, fertility, infant mortality, and changes in women's productivity and earnings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Female Participation in Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|last=UNESCO Division of Statistics, African|publisher=UNESCO Division of Statistics, African Academy of Sciences|year=1995|isbn=|location=Nairobi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Researchers have cited some disadvantages however to this reliance on women's formal education. One, there is concern for women being alienated from their indigenous cultures and not receiving the education in values that were typically received through pre-colonial indigenous educational systems.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, there is an increasing body of literature that suggests how the formal education institutions channel women into particular lower-earning job fields such as the humanities, while guiding women away from more technical jobs with higher wages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In regards to academic achievement, according to the FAWE Conference girls across the Sub-Saharan region reported lower scores in Math and Science subjects.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Education of Girls and Women in Africa|last=Gachukia|first=Edduh|publisher=Forum for African Women Educationalists|year=1995|isbn=|location=Nairobi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency for girls to be pushed into clerical positions upon finishing school is also a widely researched and held belief.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;   Despite this, formal education offers many benefits recognized internationally. The Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women has released publications citing numerous ways through which women's education in Africa is beneficial to society as a whole. These entail an increase in family health, in higher wage jobs available to women, an improvement in quality standards of childhood development, and a greater inclusion of women in decisions making that can impact a nation in environmental, political, social and economic ways.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Despite there being a drop in participation of women in education in the majority of countries in West Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, rates of women education have been steadily climbing since then. However, there is still much statistical gender disparity as according to UNESCO statistics on women's enrollment and graduation rates.

===== Gender disparities =====
One of the primary ways in which there are gender disparities in education in West Africa are in the ratios of male to female participation: 43.6% of men have completed primary education as opposed to 35.4% of women, 6.0% of men have completed secondary education as opposed to 3.3% of women, and 0.7% of men have completed tertiary education as opposed to 0.2% of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stromquist|first=Nelly|date=1998|title=Agents in Women's Education: Some Trends in the African Context|url=|journal=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for poor enrollment and participation is the "male breadwinner" ideal that prioritizes educating boys over girls and limited funds available to families for education. In addition, in West Africa women are seen as the primary providers of [[Care work|unpaid care work]]. This offers competing demands on the time of girls and oftentimes their families will prioritize girls' spending time taking care of siblings or doing [[domestic labor]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, a leading cause of gender disparities in education are gender disparities in the labor market, which lead to gendered ideas of women's role in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloch, Vavrus|first=Marianne, Frances|date=1998|title=Gender and Educational Research, Policy and Practice in Sub-Saharan Africa: Theoretical and Empirical Problems and Prospects|url=|journal=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|volume=|pages=1–24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, some gender disparities are caused by teacher's attitudes towards students in the classroom according to the students' gender.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson-Levitt, Soumaré|first=Kathryn M. and Aminata Maiga|date=1998|title=Inside Classrooms in Guinea: Girls Experiences|url=|journal=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|volume=|pages=99–131|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some preconceived notions that boys are more intelligent and harder working than girls in some West African countries. In particular in [[Guinea]], surveys have been taken by researchers suggesting that school teachers, particularly in rural schools, believe that boys learn lessons better, have more ambition, are smarter, and work harder, while girls make less effort, rarely give good responses to questions, and use poor French expression.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition in both urban and rural schools analyzed, girls were expected to do the manual labor to keep the schools clean while this expectation was not held for the boys.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Gender disparities in higher education persist as well, with women accounting for a little over 20% of university level enrollment in all of Sub-Saharan Africa, and countries in West Africa such as Niger and Ghana reporting rates of 15% and 21%, respectively.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beoku-Betts|first=Josephine|date=1998|title=Gender and Formal Education in Africa: An Exploration of the Opportunity Structure at the Secondary and Tertiary Levels|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered a contributing factor to why there are so few women in higher level management and administrative jobs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Ghana in 1990, women made up less than 1% of managers in the labor market, but with an average annual growth rate of 3.2%.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Researchers hope that improving primary education attainment and accomplishment will lead to more attainment and accomplishment in the tertiary educational level and in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Ancient Vedic age (1000 BC) ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The history of female education in India has its roots in ancient Vedic age.

During the Vedic age, more than 3,000 years ago, women were assigned a high place in society. They shared an equal standing with their men folk and enjoyed a kind of liberty that actually had societal sanctions. The ancient Hindu philosophical concept of 'shakti', the feminine principle of energy, was also a product of this age. This took the form of worship of the female idols or goddesses.  In India even today people worship  Goddess "Saraswati" as the Goddess of education. Vedic literature praises the birth of a scholarly daughter in these words: "A girl also should be brought up and educated with great effort and care." (Mahanirvana Tantra); and "All forms of knowledge are aspects of Thee; and all women throughout the world are Thy forms." (Devi Mahatmya).

Women, who so desired, could undergo the sacred thread ceremony or 'Upanayana' (a sacrament to pursue Vedic studies), which is only meant for males even to this day. The mention of female scholars and sages of the Vedic age like Vac, Ambhrni, Romasa, Gargi, Khona in the Vedic lore corroborates this view. These highly intelligent and greatly learned women, who chose the path of Vedic studies, were called 'brahmavadinis', and women who opted out of education for married life were called 'sadyovadhus'. Co-education seems to have existed in this period and both the sexes got equal attention from the teacher. Moreover, ladies from the Kshatriya caste received martial arts courses and arms training. The Vedas have volumes to say about these women, who both complemented and supplemented their male partners.

Although in the Vedic period women had access to education in India, they had gradually lost this right. However, in the British period there was revival of interest in women’s education in India. During this period, various socio religious movements led by eminent persons like [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Ram Mohan Roy]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] emphasized on women’s education in India. Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Periyar and Baba Saheb Ambedkar were leaders of the lower castes in India who took various initiatives to make education available to the women of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/education/the-history-of-womens-education-in-india/9982 | title=The History of Women's Education in India| date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of the Vedic period (circa 1500-1200 BCE), were epitomes of intellectual and spiritual attainments. The Vedas have volumes to say about these women, who both complemented and supplemented their male partners. When it comes to talking about significant female figures of the Vedic period, four names - Ghosha, Lopamudra, Sulabha Maitreyi, and Gargi - come to mind.

===== Ghosha =====

Vedic wisdom is encapsulated in myriad hymns and 27 women-seers emerge from them. But most of them are mere abstractions except for a few, such as Ghosha, who has a definite human form. Granddaughter of Dirghatamas and daughter of Kakshivat, both composers of hymns (mainly saying good about someone)
 in praise of Ashwins, Ghosha has two entire hymns of the tenth book, each containing 14 verses, assigned to her name. The first eulogizes the Ashwins, the heavenly twins who are also physicians; the second is a personal wish expressing her intimate feelings and desires for married life. Ghosha suffered from an incurable disfiguring disease, probably leprosy, and remained a spinster at her father's house. Her implorations with the Ashwins, and the devotion of her forefathers towards them made them cure her disease and allow her to experience wedded bliss.

===== Lopamudra =====

The Rig Veda ('Royal Knowledge') has long conversations between the sage Agasthya and his wife Lopamudra that testifies to the great intelligence and goodness of the latter. As the legend goes, Lopamudra was created by sage Agasthya and was given as a daughter to the King of Vidarbha. The royal couple gave her the best possible education and brought her up amidst luxury. When she attained a marriageable age, Agasthya, the sage who was under vows of celibacy and poverty, wanted to own her. Lopa agreed to marry him, and left her palace for Agasthya's hermitage. After serving her husband faithfully for a long period, Lopa grew tired of his austere practices. She wrote a hymn of two stanzas making an impassioned plea for his attention and love. Soon afterwards, the sage realized his duties towards his wife and performed both his domestic and ascetic life with equal zeal, reaching a wholeness of spiritual and physical powers. A son was born to them. He was named Dridhasyu, who later became a great poet.

===== Maitreyi =====

The Rig Veda contains about one thousand hymns, of which about 10 are accredited to Maitreyi, the woman seer and philosopher. She contributed towards the enhancement of her sage-husband Yajnavalkya's personality and the flowering of his spiritual thoughts. Yajnavalkya had two wives Maitreyi and Katyayani. While Maitreyi was well versed in the Hindu scriptures and was a 'brahmavadini', Katyayani was an ordinary woman. One day the sage decided to make a settlement of his worldly possessions between his two wives and renounce the world by taking up ascetic vows. He asked his wives their wishes. The learned Maitreyi asked her husband if all the wealth in the world would make her immortal. The sage replied that wealth could only make one rich, nothing else. She then asked for the wealth of immortality. Yajnavalkya was happy to hear this, and imparted Maitreyi the doctrine of the soul and his knowledge of attaining immortality.

===== Gargi =====

Gargi, the Vedic prophetess and daughter of sage Vachaknu, composed several hymns that questioned the origin of all existence. When King Janak of Videha organized a 'brahmayajna', a philosophic congress centered around the fire sacrament, Gargi was one of the eminent participants. She challenged the sage Yajnavalkya with a volley of perturbing questions on the soul or 'atman' that confounded the learned man who had till then silenced many an eminent scholar. Her question - "The layer that is above the sky and below the earth, which is described as being situated between the earth and the sky and which is indicated as the symbol of the past, present and future, where is that situated?" - bamboozled even the great Vedic men of letters.

====British India====
[[File:Bengali Girls' School, Calcutta (LMS, 1869, p.12).jpg|thumb|260px|London Mission Bengali Girls' School, Calcutta ([[London Missionary Society|LMS]], 1869, p.12)&lt;ref name="Fruits-LMS"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=London Missionary Society|title=Fruits of Toil in the London Missionary Society|date=1869|publisher=John Snow &amp; Co.|location=London|page=12|url=https://archive.org/details/fruitsoftoilinth17115gut|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Church Missionary Society tasted greater success in South India. The first boarding school for girls came up in Tirunelveli in 1821. By 1840 the Scottish Church Society constructed six schools with roll strength of 200 Hindu girls. When it was mid-century, the missionaries in Madras had included under its banner, 8,000 girls.
Women's employment and education was acknowledged in 1854 by the East Indian Company's Programme: Wood's Dispatch. Slowly, after that, there was progress in female education, but it initially tended to be focused on the primary school level and was related to the richer sections of society. The overall literacy rate for women increased from 0.2% in 1882 to 6% in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/s/3N/EP/3NEP0401.htm |title=Educational Development of Girls and Women |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022012638/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/s/3N/EP/3NEP0401.htm |archivedate=2011-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In western India, Jyotiba Phule and his wife Savitri Bai  became  pioneers of female  education when they started a school for girls in 1848 in Pune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cuhciewLjbUC&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq=phule+poona+bhide++girls+school#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The sexual life of English : caste and desire in modern India|last1=Chandra|first1=Shefali|date=2012|publisher=Duke Univ.

With participation of like-minded social reformers like Ramgopal Ghosh, Raja Dakshinaranjan Mukherjee and Pandit Madan Mohan Tarkalankar, he established Calcutta's (now Kolkata) first school for girls in 1849 called the secular Native Female School, which later came to be known as Bethune School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bethunecollege.ac.in/BethuneCollege/BethuneCollege.htm | title=Bethune College, Kolkata : History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, Poromesh. "Education in Old Calcutta". In Chaudhuri, Sukanta. Calcutta, the Living City. 1. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 86–7. {{ISBN|0-19-563696-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, [[Bethune College]], affiliated to the [[University of Calcutta]],  was established which is the oldest women's college in Asia.

In 1878, the [[University of Calcutta]] became one of the first universities to admit female graduates to its degree programmes, before any of the British universities had later done the same. This point was raised during the [[Ilbert Bill]] controversy in 1883, when it was being considered whether Indian judges should be given the right to judge British offenders. The role of women featured prominently in the controversy, where English women who opposed the bill argued that [[Bengali people|Bengali]] women, whom they [[stereotypes of South Asians|stereotyped]] as "ignorant" and neglected by their men and that Indian men should therefore not be given the right to judge cases involving English women. Bengali women who supported the bill responded by claiming that they were more educated than the English women opposed to the bill and pointed out that more [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] women had degrees than British women did at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Feminist Postcolonial Theory: A Reader|last=Reina Lewis|first=Sara Mills|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-94275-1|pages=451–3|location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Independent India====
[[File:Sacred Heart College.jpg|thumbnail|A girls' college in [[Palakkad]], India.]]
After India attained independence in 1947, the University Education Commission was created to recommend suggestions to improve the quality of education. However, their report spoke against female education, referring to it as: "Women's present education is entirely irrelevant to the life they have to lead. It is not only a waste but often a definite disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. P. Agrawal|author2=J. C. Aggarwal|title=Women's Education in India: 1986-1987|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJD4EM2kvt0C&amp;pg=PA31|year=1992|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=31|isbn=9788170223184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fact that the female literacy rate was at 8.9% post-Independence could not be ignored. Thus, in 1958, a national committee on women's education was appointed by the government, and most of its recommendations were accepted. The crux of its recommendations were to bring female education on the same footing as offered for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, committees were created that talked about equality between men and women in the field of education. For example, one committee on differentiation of curriculum for boys and girls (1959) recommended equality and a common curricula at various stages of their learning. Further efforts were made to expand the education system, and the Education Commission was set up in 1964, which largely talked about female education, which recommended a national policy to be developed by the government. This occurred in 1968, providing increased emphasis on female education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/Post-IndependenceEducational.pdf|title=Post- Independence Educational|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222012631/http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/Post-IndependenceEducational.pdf|archivedate=2013-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current policies====
[[File:Indian schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|Schoolgirls in Delhi, India. As seen in this photo, Indian schoolgirls can have uniform of both shirt and skirt, as well as ''[[shalwar kameez]]''.]]
Before and after Independence, India has been taking active steps towards women's status and education. The 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2001, has been a path breaking step towards the growth of education, especially for females. According to this act, elementary education is a fundamental right for children between the ages of 6 and 14. The government has undertaken to provide this education free of cost and make it compulsory for those in that age group. This undertaking is more widely known as [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] (SSA).

Since then, the SSA has come up with many schemes for inclusive as well as exclusive growth of Indian education as a whole, including schemes to help foster the growth of female education.

The major schemes are the following:

* ''Mahila Samakhya Program'': This program was launched in 1988 as a result of the New Education Policy (1968). It was created for the empowerment of women from rural areas especially socially and economically marginalized groups. When the SSA was formed, it initially set up a committee to look into this programme, how it was working and recommend new changes that could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya Scheme(KGBV):''' This scheme was launched in July, 2004, to provide education to girls at primary level. It is primarily for the underprivileged and rural areas where literacy level for females is very low. The schools that were set up have 100% reservation: 75% for backward class and 25% for BPL (below Poverty line) females.
* '''National Programme for Education of Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL):''' This programme was launched in July, 2003. It was an incentive to reach out to the girls who the SSA was not able to reach through other schemes. The SSA called out to the "hardest to reach girls". This scheme has covered 24 states in India. Under the NPEGEL, "model schools" have been set up to provide better opportunities to girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One notable success came in 2013, when the first two girls ever scored in the top 10 ranks of the entrance exam to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-22/entrance-exams/40133825_1_jee-mains-jee-advanced-the-iits |title=In a first, girls among IIT entrance test toppers - Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sibbala Leena Madhuri ranked eighth, and Aditi Laddha ranked sixth.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt;

In addition, the status and literacy rates between West Bengal and Mizoram were found to be profound; a study compared the two states as they took on politically different approaches to helping empower women (Ghosh, Chakravarti, &amp; Mansi, 2015).  In West Bengal, literacy rates were found to be low even after fulfilling the 73rd amendment from 1992.  The amendment established affirmative action by allotting 33% of seats at panchayats, or local self-governments, to women.  Mizoram chose not to partake in the 73rd Amendment but has seen greater literacy rates, it is second highest in the country, and also has a better sex ratio.  It was thus found that affirmative actions steps alone were not enough.  Women also need to be given the opportunity to develop through formal education to be empowered to serve and profit from holding these public leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Ratna|date=2015|title=Women's Empowerment and Education: Panchayats and Women's Self-Help Groups in India|url=|journal=Policy Futures in Education|volume=13|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Female College Education in India =====
Despite the fact that many girls stop their education after school, the number of girls seeking admission to universities is growing so rapidly that the problem of admission to colleges is becoming more and more difficult. The num  ber of students, both men and women, who enrolled in colleges at the end of the First Plan was 7,20,000 as against 4,20,000 five years earlier, during which period the number passing out as holders of degrees and higher examinations rose from 41,000 to 58,000.After a good multipurpose school education a girl comes to a University, well-equipped, keen and happy, ready to take up a further three years course in a college. Women’s colleges, though increasing in number, however, could still further be increased, as is the intention of both Central and State Governments. Here(resident school) is nothing so good for a girl its a healthy, congenial hostel life. Here she learns to be cosmo politan, to help her weaker sister, to break caste rules, re actionary customs and creed prejudices and to live a life of service to her Alma Mater. This training which a girl auto matically receives when staying in a residential college fits her for a better and more useful life in the years that follow and serves the main purpose of education, which is better living.The syllabus therefore in colleges should be the same for girls as for boys am all cqllegies should not include the Home Sciences as compulsory course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's education in India|last=Sengupta|first=Padmini|publisher=Ministry of Education, Government of India|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian start-up Decode Global has developed the mobile game [[Get Water!]], a game for social change focusing on the [[water scarcity in India]] and the effect it has on girls' education, especially in slums and rural areas. In areas with no ready access to water, girls are often pulled out of school to collect water for their families.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Jordan (2013-03-22).

==Catholic tradition==
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition, concern for female education has expressed itself from the days of the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]], which in the 200s AD had courses for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesaria. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm Ecclesiastical History, Book VI], Chapter VIII, Paragraph I. Written before 340 AD&lt;/ref&gt; Later Church writers such as St. [[Ambrose]], St. [[Augustine]], and St. [[Jerome]] all left letters of instruction for women in [[convent]]s that they either founded or supported. In the medieval ages, several [[religious institute]]s were established with ministries addressing women's education. For medieval examples of convent schools, which are one form of such institutions, see the examples at [[Female education#Medieval period|the section on the medieval period]]. In the early modern period, this tradition was continued with the [[Ursulines]] (1535) and the [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] (1849).&lt;ref&gt;Others are [[Society of the Holy Child Jesus]], the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]], [[Sisters of the Holy of Jesus and Mary]], [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]], [[Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur]], [[Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco]].&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary convent schools are usually not restricted to Catholic pupils. Students in contemporary convent education may be boys (particularly in India).

'''Hanan Yoran''' is a [[lecturer]] in the department of [[History]] at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Ahva Academic College]] and at the [[Interdisciplinary Center]], [[Israel]].

==Life==
Hanan Yoran studied for his BA degree in [[Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and graduated in 1987. In 1999 he completed his PhD at the [[Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas]] at the [[Tel Aviv University]], under the supervision of Professor [[Rivka Feldhay]] and Professor [[Miriam Eliav Feldon]]. The title of the dissertation was: ''[[Erasmus]] and [[Thomas More]] between the [[Republic of Letters]] and the World of Politics''.

==Works==
Hanan Yoran main field of interest is intellectual and cultural history of [[early modern Europe]], especially the various historical and theoretical aspects of the questions of modernity and secularization. His research focuses on [[Renaissance humanism]], as the intellectual current that undermined the premises of classical and medieval intellectual tradition, and elaborated new language for understanding and representing reality. From this perspective he examined in his book, entitled ''Between Utopia and Dystopia: Erasmus, Thomas More and the Humanist Republic of Letters'', the construction of the identity of the universal intellectual—the autonomous man of letters whose activity do not represent the ideology of a distinct social group, but rather the common good (as he understands it) – by the Erasmus and the humanists gathered around him in the beginning of the 16th century. Yoran also exposed the problems and paradoxes of inherent in this identity as well as the inability of the Erasmian humanists to account for and legitimize it in their own terms. From a similar theoretical point of view, Yoran examined in several articles the ethical and political views developed by various humanists, including More, [[Lorenzo Valla]], the Florentine civic humanists and [[Machiavelli]].

'''Helge Marcus Ingstad''' (30 December 1899 – 29 March 2001) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] explorer. After mapping some Norse settlements, Ingstad and his wife [[Anne Stine Ingstad|Anne Stine]], an archaeologist, in 1960 found remnants of a [[Viking]] settlement in [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="Maud" /&gt;&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; They were thus the first to prove conclusively that the [[Iceland]]ic [[Norsemen]] such as [[Leif Erickson]] had found a way across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[North America]], roughly 500 years before [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[John Cabot]]. He also thought that the mysterious disappearance of the [[Greenland]] Viking settlement in the 14/15th century could be explained by their emigration to [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Helge_Marcus_Ingstad Helge Marcus Ingstad] Store norske leksikon &lt;/ref&gt;

Helge Ingstad died at [[Diakonhjemmet Hospital]] in Oslo at the age of [[Centenarian#Explorers|101]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/30/world/helge-ingstad-discoverer-of-viking-site-is-dead-at-101.html

|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Helge Ingstad was the son of Olav Ingstad  (1867–1958) and Olga Marie Qvam (1869–1946) in [[Meråker]], [[Nord-Trøndelag]]. His father was municipal engineer in [[Tromsø]] and held the title of factory supervisor. He was the grandson of lawyer professor, [[Marcus Pløen Ingstad]]. Helge and his family moved to [[Bergen]] in 1915 where he attended the [[Bergen Katedralskole]] (1915–1918), and after graduating [[Candidate of Law|cand. jur.]] in 1922 he took up a practice of lawyer in [[Levanger]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://snl.no/Ingstad  |title=   Ingstad    |publisher =      Store norske leksikon |author=   Jon Gunnar Arntzen
|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:In memory H Ingstad.jpg|thumb|250px|Quarterboard in memory of Helge Ingstad, the governor (Sysselmann) of Erik the Red's Land in 1932–33. Antarctic Havn, Northeast Greenland]]

Helge Ingstad was originally a lawyer by profession, but, ever an outdoorsman, he sold his successful law practice in [[Levanger]] and went to [[Canada]]'s [[Northwest Territories]] as a [[Trapping|trapper]] in 1926. For the next three years, the Norwegian travelled with the local [[First Nations|Indian]] [[tribe]] known as the [[Caribou]] Eaters. After returning to Norway, he wrote the bestselling ''Pelsjegerliv'' ("Trapper Life") about his time in Canada, published in English as ''The Land of Feast and Famine'' (Knopf, 1933).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://hrsbstaff.ednet.ns.ca/phillie/webquest/iobit.htm
|title=  Helge Ingstad, 101, Discoverer of Viking Site |publisher =    Halifax Sunday Herald |date=     April 1, 2001|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingstad was the governor ([[Sysselmann]]) of [[Erik the Red's Land]] in 1932&amp;ndash;33, when Norway annexed that eastern part of [[Greenland]]. The [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in [[The Hague]] decided that the lands belonged to [[Denmark]], and so the official Norwegian presence had to end. Following the verdict, Ingstad was summoned by the government to the job as governor of [[Svalbard]] (Spitsbergen and the surrounding islands) &amp;mdash; a position suiting him uniquely, considering his profession of law and his experience in Arctic living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.polarhistorie.no/personer/Ingstad,%20Helge
|title=     Helge Ingstad|publisher =      Norsk Polarhistorie|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage ==

During his years on Svalbard Helge Ingstad met [[Anne Stine Ingstad|Anne Stine Moe]], nearly twenty years his junior. She had read his books from Canada and Greenland with great admiration, and developed a crush on the explorer; she wrote to him, and after some time of correspondence and dating they were engaged, and married in 1941. In 1946, the Ingstads made themselves a home near the [[Holmenkollen]] area of Norway's capital, [[Oslo, Norway|Oslo]], where they spent the rest of their lives when not travelling the world. They had one daughter, Benedicte, who became a professor in medical anthropology at the University in Oslo. From her teenage years, Benedicte accompanied her parents on their exploration journeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://nbl.snl.no/Anne_Stine_Ingstad|title=   Anne Stine Ingstad|publisher =      Norsk biografisk leksikon |author=   Bergljot Solberg|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author ==

Helge Ingstad was a popular author, whose books on his visits to remote parts of the world gained him fame in Norway. From Greenland he wrote ''Øst for den store bre'' ("East of the Great Glacier"), from Svalbard he wrote ''Landet med de kalde kyster'' ("The Land With the Chilly Coasts"). He also visited the [[Apache]] Indians of northwestern [[Mexico]], from which he wrote ''Apache-indianerne - jakten på den tapte stamme'' ("The Apaches - The Hunt for the Lost Tribe"). After [[World War II]] he stayed for a period in the [[Brooks Range]] in northern [[Alaska]] among the [[Nunamiut]] [[Iñupiat]], and afterwards wrote ''Nunamiut - blant Alaskas innlandseskimoer'' ("Nunamiut - Inland Eskimos of Alaska").

== Viking settlement of North America ==
[[File:Ingstad-byste.jpg|thumb|300 px|Bust of Helge Ingstad and Anne Stine Ingstad outside the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo]]
[[File:LanseAuxMeadows LargeBuilding.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Remains of Viking building at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]]]
In 1960, he discovered the remains of what later proved to be a [[Viking]] settlement at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] at the northernmost tip of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in [[Canada]]. 
It is the only known site of a Norse or Viking village in Canada, and in North America outside of [[Greenland]]. Dating to around the year 1000, L'Anse aux Meadows remains the only widely accepted instance of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact and is notable for its possible connection with the attempted colony of [[Vinland]] established by [[Leif Ericson]] around the same time period or, more broadly, with Norse exploration of the Americas.

Archaeological excavation at the site was conducted in the 1960s by an international team led by [[archaeology|archaeologist]] Anne Stine Ingstad (Helge Ingstad's wife) and under the direction of [[Parks Canada]] of the Government of Canada in the 1970s. Following each period of excavation, the site was reburied to protect and conserve the cultural resources.
[[Image:Erikr-eng.png|thumb|350 px|The different sailing routes to Greenland, Vinland (Newfoundland), Helluland (Baffin Island) and Markland (Labrador) travelled by different characters in the Icelandic Sagas, mainly ''Saga of Erik the Red'' and ''Saga of the Greenlanders''. The names are the common modern English versions of the old Norse names]]
The settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows has been dated to approximately 1,000 years ago, an assessment that tallies with the relative dating of artifact and structure types.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | author= Nydal, Reidar | title= A critical review of radiocarbon dating of a Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada | journal= [[Radiocarbon (magazine)|Radiocarbon]] | volume= 31 | pages= 976–985 | year= 1989  | url = http://www.digitalcommons.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume31/Number3/azu_radiocarbon_v31_n3_976_985_v.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of eight buildings were located. They are believed to have been constructed of [[sod]] placed over a wooden frame. Based on associated artifacts, the buildings were variously identified as dwellings or workshops. The largest dwelling measured {{convert|28.8|by|15.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and consisted of several rooms.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=J1ARTJ0004527 Canadian Encyclopedia article on L'Anse aux Meadows].&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops were identified as an [[iron]] [[forge|smithy]] containing a [[hearth|forge]] and iron [[slag]], a carpentry workshop, which generated wood debris, and a specialized boat repair area containing worn [[rivet]]s. Besides those related to iron working, carpentry, and boat repair, other artifacts found at the site consisted of common everyday Norse items, including a stone oil lamp, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]], a bronze fastening pin, a bone knitting needle, and part of a spindle. The presence of the spindle and needle suggests that women were present as well as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site of Canada | publisher = Parks Canada | year = 2008 | url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/nl/meadows/natcul/decouverte_discovery.aspx | accessdate = 2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food remains included [[Juglans cinerea|butternut]]s, which are significant because they do not grow naturally north of [[New Brunswick]], and their presence probably indicates the Norse inhabitants travelled farther south to obtain them.&lt;ref name="Vinland"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Is L'Anse aux Meadows Vinland?  | work = L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site of Canada  | publisher = Parks Canada  | year = 2003  | url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/nl/meadows/natcul/vinland_e.asp  | accessdate = 2008-01-20  | quote = ...Vinland was a country, not a place...  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070522105216/http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/nl/meadows/natcul/vinland_e.asp  | archivedate = 2007-05-22  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists concluded that the site was inhabited by the Norse for a relatively short period of time.

== Norse sagas ==

[[Norse saga]]s are written versions of older oral traditions. Two [[Icelandic sagas]], commonly called the ''[[Saga of the Greenlanders]]'' and the ''[[Saga of Eric the Red]]'', describe the experiences of Norse Greenlanders who discovered and attempted to settle land to the west of Greenland, identified by them as Vinland. The sagas suggest that the Vinland settlement failed because of conflicts within the Norse community, as well as between the Norse and the native people they encountered, whom they called [[Skræling]]ar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People, Compact|first1=John M|last1= Murrin|first2=Paul E|last2=Johnson|first3=James M|last3=McPherson|first4=Gary |last4=Gerstle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4aNIeXqWz9YC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=1014:+The+first+European+colony+in+North+America+is+established+at+L%27Anse+aux+Meadows#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|page=6|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-41101-7|accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent archaeological studies suggest that the L'Anse aux Meadows site is not Vinland itself but was within a land called Vinland&lt;ref name="Vinland"/&gt; that spread farther south from L'Anse aux Meadows, extending to the [[St. Lawrence River]] and [[New Brunswick]]. The village at L'Anse aux Meadows served as an exploration base and winter camp for expeditions heading southward into the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="Vinland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="damals"&gt;{{cite magazine| title=Vinland-Rätsel gelöst (Vinland Riddle Solved)| first=Birgitta |last=Wallace |author2=Gerhard E.

== Named features ==

Helge Ingstad has two geographic features in North America named after him. In Canada, a small river, Ingstad Creek, flows into [[Great Slave Lake]]. In Alaska, the 1461-meter-high Ingstad Mountain in the [[Brooks Range]] was officially approved by the U.S. [[Board on Geographic Names]] on 19 April 2006. The name was suggested by the [[Nunamiut]] tribe in gratitude for Ingstad's efforts on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=    http://www.norway.org/PageFiles/243249/NewsofNorway3-06.pdf|title=    Helge Ingstad and the Nunamiut People of Alaska|publisher =      News of Norway
|author=  Grant Spearman |date=  2006|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last few years of his life, he worked on categorizing and annotating the large quantity of photos and [[audio recording]]s (141 songs) he had made while living with the Nunamiut in 1950. The effort resulted in a booklet, ''Songs of the Nunamiut'', with an accompanying CD containing the audio material. This is an extremely valuable contribution to the preservation of the [[Nunamiut]] culture, because it turned out that much of what he had gathered in the mid-20th century was now lost locally and was only preserved in his recordings.

== Honours ==

He was an honorary member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]. He also held honorary doctorates at the [[University of Oslo]], [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] in Canada, and at [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Minnesota]]. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] (in 1991; previously Knight 1st class in 1965, and Commander in 1970), Knight of the [[Order of Vasa]], and he was presented with the Norwegian [[Red Cross Badge of Honour]] for his efforts in [[Finnmark]] during [[World War II]]. He received a lifetime government grant from the Norwegian government from 1970. He was the subject of a 1981 [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) documentary ''The Man Who Discovered America'',&lt;ref name="Maud"/&gt; and subsequently appeared along with his wife in the 1984 NFB film, ''The Vinland Mystery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pettigrew|first=William|title=The Vinland Mystery|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/vinland_mystery/|work=Documentary film|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=13 September 2012|format=Requires [[Adobe Flash]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, he was presented [[Arts Council Norway]]'s honor award. {{HNoMS|Helge Ingstad|F313}}, the fourth of the five {{sclass-|Fridtjof Nansen|frigate|2}}s of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] was named after Helge Ingstad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revistatenea.es/RevistaAtenea/REVISTA/articulos/GestionNoticias_938_ESP.asp Navantia deliveries the frigate Helge Ingstad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001040048/http://www.revistatenea.es/RevistaAtenea/REVISTA/articulos/GestionNoticias_938_ESP.asp |date=2010-10-01 }} onemagazine.es&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner [[main-belt]] asteroid [[8993 Ingstad]], discovered by Danish astronomer [[Richard Martin West]] at ESO's [[La Silla Observatory]] in Chile in 1980, was named in his memory. The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center|MPC]] on 24 June 2002 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 46009}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

A '''hierophany''' is a manifestation of the [[sacred]]. The word is a formation of the Greek adjective ''hieros'' ({{lang-gr|ἱερός}}; sacred/holy) and the verb ''phainein'' (φαίνειν; to reveal / to bring to light).

When the sacred is revealed in some form or other to an entity, it brings with it great pleasure and suffering, as one who has become familiar with the [[Divinity|Godhead]] would ascribe. This information can be then used by the recipient to assist others on their own path.

==In Mircea Eliade's writings==
The word ''hierophany'' recurs frequently in the works of the religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]], which he preferred to the more constrictive word ''[[theophany]]'' (an appearance of a god).&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that religion is based on a sharp distinction between the sacred (God, gods, mythical ancestors, etc.) and the profane.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, for traditional man, myths describe "breakthroughs of the sacred (or the 'supernatural') into the World"—that is, hierophanies.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the hierophanies recorded in myth, the sacred appears in the form of ideal models (the actions and commandments of gods, heroes, etc.). By manifesting itself as an ideal model, the sacred gives the world value, direction, and purpose: "The manifestation of the sacred, ontologically founds the world".&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, all things need to imitate or conform to the sacred models established by hierophanies, in order to have true reality: to traditional man, things "acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality".&lt;ref&gt;''Comos and History'', pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hogarth Club porter by Holman Hunt.jpg|thumb|A porter at the club carrying a bottle of wine, drawing by Holman Hunt]]
The '''Hogarth Club''' was an exhibition society of artists, based at 84 Charlotte Street, [[Fitzrovia]], London, UK, which existed between 1858 and 1861. It was founded by former members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] after the original PRB had been dissolved. It was envisaged that the club would provide an alternative meeting space and exhibition venue to overcome prejudice against the Pre-Raphaelites at the [[Royal Academy]]. Unlike the PRB, the Hogarth Club was established on a professional basis, with two classes of members, artistic and non-artistic, and a distinction between London-based "resident" and provincial "non-resident" members. 

[[Ford Madox Brown]] suggested that the club be named after [[William Hogarth]] since Hogarth was "a painter whom he deeply reverenced as the originator of moral invention and drama in modern art".&lt;ref&gt;Rossetti, W. M., ''Some Reminiscences'', London, 1906, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had worked on some previous independent exhibitions, but became determined to form a permanent exhibition space after the rejection of Pre-Raphaelite work by the Academy in 1857. In response they created their own exhibition, later founding the Hogarth Club in tandem with other sympathetic artists, most notably [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]].&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, D., [https://www.jstor.org/pss/879933 The Hogarth Club: 1858-1861], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 122, No. 925 (April 1980), pp. 236–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial success, the Hogarth Club failed to maintain its momentum, and was finally closed in 1861 after failing to adequately build up its membership in the face of hostility from the Royal Academy. Even the former leading Pre-Raphaelite [[John Everett Millais]] refused to join, as did otherwise sympathetic Royal Academicians such as [[Augustus Egg]].

He and his first wife Sumie Tani had a daughter Isabel and have divorced. He and his current second wife Hotta Eri have a daughter Josephine.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/A-new-cosmopolitan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/article/678906/objective-subjects&lt;/ref&gt; Buruma is a nephew of the English film director [[John Schlesinger]], with whom he published a series of interviews in book form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Conversations with John Schlesinger |publisher=[[Random House]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived in Japan from 1975 to 1981, where he worked as a film reviewer, photographer and documentary filmmaker. During the 1980s, he edited the cultural section of the ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'' in Hong Kong. He later traveled throughout Asia working as a freelance writer. Buruma is a board member of [[Human Rights in China]] and a fellow of the [[European Council of Foreign Relations]]. Buruma has contributed numerous articles to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' since 1985.&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt; He held fellowships at the [[Berlin Institute for Advanced Study|Wissenschaftskolleg]] in Berlin (1991) and the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in Washington, D.C. (1999), and he is a fellow of [[St. Antony's College, Oxford|St&amp;nbsp;Antony's College]] in [[Oxford]], UK. In 2000, he delivered the [[Huizinga Lecture]] (on "[[Neoromanticism]] of writers in exile") in the [[Pieterskerk, Leiden|Pieterskerk]] in [[Leiden]], Netherlands.

From 2003 to 2017, Buruma was Luce Professor of Democracy, Human Rights and Journalism at [[Bard College]], New York. In 2017, he became editor of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', succeeding founding editor [[Robert B. Silvers]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuessler, Jennifer.

===New York Review of Books Controversy===
In September 2018, Buruma left the ''NYRB'' position, in the wake of a controversy over an essay by [[Jian Ghomeshi]] in which the Canadian talk show host, among other things, claimed that accusations of sexual violence made against him by more than 20 women were "inaccurate". In an interview with ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, Buruma defended his decision to publish Ghomeshi's piece and denied that the article was misleading because it failed to mention that Ghomeshi was required to issue an apology to one of the victims as part of the terms of a case against him that was settled. He also denied that the title "Reflections from a Hashtag" was dismissive of the #MeToo movement, stated that the movement has resulted in "undesirable consequences", and said: "I’m no judge of the rights and wrongs of every allegation. ... The exact nature of [Ghomeshi's] behavior – how much consent was involved – I have no idea, nor is it really my concern."&lt;ref&gt;Chotiner, Isaac. [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/jian-ghomeshi-new-york-review-of-books-essay.html "Why Did the ''New York Review of Books'' Publish That Jian Ghomeshi Essay?"], ''Slate'', Sept 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Buruma subsequently left ''The New York Review of Books'' amid "outrage" over his defense of the article.&lt;ref&gt;Pilkington, Ed.

==Scholarship==
Buruma argues for wholehearted British participation in the [[European Union]] because they are the "strongest champions in Europe of a liberal approach to commerce and politics".&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite news|title=In praise of Englishness|url=http://www.economist.com/node/378742|work=[[The Economist]]|date=23 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2008, Buruma was awarded the [[Erasmus Prize]], which is awarded to an individual who has made "an especially important contribution to culture, society or social science in Europe".&lt;ref name=erasm&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Laureates: Ian Buruma, 2008|url=http://www.erasmusprijs.org/index.cfm?lang=en&amp;page=Prijswinnaars&amp;mode=detail&amp;itemID=D591473D-0144-979E-9F80CE5CD18A9197|website=[[Praemium Erasmianum Foundation]]|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is among [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|the 100 top global thinkers]] of 2010, as selected by the ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=full "The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers"], ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', 29 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Foreign Policy'' explained his contribution as a public intellectual:

{{quote|Many liberals these days seem at pains to establish their bona fides as tough-minded hawks when it comes to global threats, but the Dutch man of letters has made a career out of affirming the [[classic liberalism]] of the open-door variety. His writing in recent years has attracted the ire of critics who think he equivocates on the dangers of [[radical Islam]], but Ian Buruma made his response this year with a typically judicious and politically relevant book, ''Taming the Gods'', that reflects on the Western capacity for [[religious pluralism]]. According to Buruma, Western society is robust enough to embrace even illiberal practices, so long as these are not violent. "Living with values that one does not share", he wrote in a recent column on France's [[French ban on face covering|burqa ban]], "is a price to be paid for living in a [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] society".}}

In April 2012, he was awarded the [[Abraham Kuyper]] Prize for Excellence in Reformed Theology and Public Life at the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kuyper Prize|url=http://kcpt.ptsem.edu/the-kuyper-prize/|website=Princeton Theological Seminary|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buruma has won several prizes for his books, including the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize|''Los Angeles Times'' Book Prize]] and the [[PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay]] for ''Theater of Cruelty''.&lt;ref name=Contributors/&gt; He has held a number of editorial and academic positions and has been termed a "well-regarded European intellectual".&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt; He has also been a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3795">The '''Institute of Contemporary History''' (''Institut für Zeitgeschichte'') in Munich was conceived in 1947 under the name ''Deutsches Institut für Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Zeit'' ("German Institute of the History of the National Socialist Era"). Founded by the German government and the State of [[Bavaria]] at the suggestion of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], it was established in 1949 and renamed in 1952. Its purpose is the analysis of contemporary [[German history]].

The Institute is funded by the [[Politics of Germany|German government]], and the German states of [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Saxony]]. The first director of the Institute was [[Hans Rothfels]], the second director was [[Martin Broszat]]. Representatives of the supporting states are also members of the Institute's board.

Since 1953, the Institute has been publishing the journal ''{{ill|Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte|de}}'' ("Contemporary History Quarterly"), which is regarded as one of the most important publications of German historical research. The Institute has also published extensive editions of contemporary historical documents, such as ''The Foreign Policy Files of the [[Bundesrepublik Deutschland]]'' and ''[[Goebbels Diaries|The Diaries of Joseph Goebbels]]''.

In 1994, the Institute founded a branch in [[Potsdam]], which has been based near the [[German Federal Archives]] since 1996. The focus of research at the Berlin branch of the Institute is the history of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). The branch ''Abteilung des IfZ im Auswärtigen Amt'' ("IfZ Department in the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]]"), founded in 1990 (first situated in [[Bonn]]; in Berlin, since 2000), publishes documents from the [[German Foreign Office]].

In 1999, the Institute conceived the ''[[Dokumentationszentrum Obersalzberg]]''  museum on the [[Obersalzberg]] near [[Berchtesgaden]] at the request of the [[Bavarian government]]. This exhibition documents the construction of the Obersalzberg into a showy residence for [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[National Socialist]] leadership circles. Visitors can tour the bunker complex. (Access to the bunkers was closed for construction in September 2017 and remained closed in July 2018 "until further notice".)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.obersalzberg.de/en/aktuelle-infos/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=743&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=18&amp;cHash=f9571a6dee9741f6047d8f2e2b20e2ff]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.obersalzberg.de/en/home/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob van Maerlant''' (c.&amp;nbsp;1230–40&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;1288–1300) was the greatest [[Flemings|Flemish]] poet of the 13th century and one of the most important [[Middle Dutch]] authors during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Jacob van Maerlant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Van Maerlant was born near [[Bruges]].  He became [[sacristan]] of [[Maerlant]], in the island of [[Oostvoorne]], where he lived for some time, employed as a [[Sexton (office)|sexton]], whence his surname "de Coster". Later he resided at Damme, near [[Bruges]], where, according to tradition, he held the position of town clerk.

His early works are [[Middle Dutch]] translations of [[French language|French]] [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]]s. Jacob's most serious work in the field of romance was his ''Historie van Troyen'' (c. 1264), a poem of some forty thousand lines, translated and amplified from the ''Roman de Troie'' of [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]].
[[File:Der naturen bloeme - Jacob van Maerlant - KB KA 16 - 040v-041r.jpg|thumb|Strange peoples in ''Der naturen bloeme'']]
From this time Jacob rejected romance as idle, and devoted himself to writing scientific and historical works for the education and, enlightenment of the Flemish and Dutch nobility. His ''Heimelicheit der Heimelicheden'' (c. 1266) is a translation of the ''Secreta secretorum'', a manual for the education of princes, ascribed throughout the Middle Ages to [[Aristotle]]. ''Van der Naturen Bloeme''&lt;ref&gt;van Maerlant, J., Van der Naturen Bloeme, met miniaturen, fol. oude band met sloten, Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Den Haag, KA_16 (XVI 9869)&lt;/ref&gt; is a free translation of ''De natura rerum'', a natural history in twenty books by a native of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[Thomas of Cantimpré]]; and his ''Rijmbijbel'' is taken, with many omissions and additions, from the ''Historia scholastica'' of [[Petrus Comestor]]. He supplemented this metrical paraphrase of [[scripture]] history by ''Die Wrake van Jherusalem'' (1271) from [[Josephus]]. He also translated a ''Life of St. Francis'' (''Leven van St. Franciscus'') from the [[Latin]] of [[Bonaventure]]. Jacob's most extensive work is the ''Spiegel Historiael'', a rhymed chronicle of the world, translated, with omissions and important additions, from the ''Speculum historiale'' of [[Vincent de Beauvais]]. It is dedicated to [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Count Floris V]] and was begun in 1283, but was left unfinished at the poet's death. Continuations were given by [[Philip Utenbroeke]] and [[Lodewijc van Velthem]], a Brabant priest. He wrote three [[Arthurian]] works: ''Torec'', which survives in the massive ''[[Lancelot-Compilatie]]'';, and two romances based on the works of [[Robert de Boron]], ''Historie van den Grale'' and ''Boec van Merline'', which tell the stories of [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and [[Merlin]].

Van Maerlant is also the author of a number of strophic poems, which date from different periods of his life. Of these the best known is the ''Wapene Martijn'' ("Alas! Martin") so called from the opening words. It is a dialogue on the course of events held between the poet himself and a character named Martin. Altogether there are three parts, of which the above-mentioned is the first. The other two parts are known as ''Dander Martijn'' ("Second Martin") and ''Derden Martijn'' ("Third Martin").

Other poems of this kind are ''Van ons Heren wonden'', a translation of the hymn ''Salve mea! o patrona''; ''Die Clausule van der Bible'', an allegorical poem in praise of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]; the ''Disputacie van onser Vrouwen ende van den helighen Cruce'', which bewails the sad situation of the [[Holy Land]]. Jacob's last poem ''Van den Lande van Oversee'' was written after the fall of [[City of Acre|Acre]] (1291) and is a stirring summons to a crusade against the infidels, with bitter complaints about abuses in the Church. The ''Geesten'' were edited by Franck ([[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], 1882). Complete editions of the strophic poems were given by E. Verwijs (Groningen, 1880) and by J. Franck and J. Verdam (Groningen, 1898).

Based on doctoral research (Van Anrooij 1997), it is now thought likely that van Maerlant was also the author of the hitherto anonymous ''Van neghen den besten'' ("On the Nine Worthies"). This would be his last work. It is one of the few works with European distribution whose source text was written in [[Middle Dutch]].  The work had a profound and lasting impact on the honor code of the Western European knightly elite.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Jacob died in the closing years of the 13th century. The greater part of his work consists of translations, but he also produced poems which prove him to have had real original poetic faculty. Among these are ''Die Clausule van der Bible'', ''Der Kerken Clage'', imitated from a ''Complainte'' of [[Rutebeuf]], and the three dialogues entitled ''Martijn'', in which the fundamental questions of theology and ethics were discussed.

Although Jacob was an orthodox [[Roman Catholic]], he is said to have been called to account by the priests for translating the [[Bible]] into the [[Vernacular|vulgar]] tongue. In spite of his orthodoxy, Jacob was a keen [[Satire|satirist]] of the corruptions of the clergy. He was one of the most learned men of his age, and for two centuries was the most celebrated of Flemish poets. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Uncertainty about biography==
Jacob van Maerlant is the modern name of a medieval Dutch author, who called himself Jacob van Merlant. Merlant was the name of a harbour at the island of [[Oostvoorne|Oost-Voorne]], which was part of the [[County of Holland]] (and [[Zeeland]]), where the viscount of Zeeland held residence. In the 14th century Merlant disappeared from the map and became a part of the city of [[Brielle]], also known as Den Briel. In the year 1261 or shortly after Jacob got a job as a 'custos' at the church of Saint Martin at Merlant, from which he took his second name.

The date and year of his birth are unknown. Estimates usually range between 1230 and 1240, due to the 'fact' that his oldest work, ''Alexanders geesten'' (The deeds of Alexander [the Great]), was probably written (shortly) after 1260. Also unknown is where Jacob was born and from what parents or family. His language has been analyzed by the Dutch linguists Amand Berteloot and Evert van den Berg, who came to the conclusion that he grew up and learned to speak in the [[County of Flanders]], somewhere south of the city of [[Bruges]], Belgium.

Also unknown is when and where Jacob died. Tradition holds that Jacob must have been alive in 1291, because he is considered to be the author of a poem ''Vanden lande van Overzee'' (On the Land across the Sea [the Holy Land]), which was written as a 'complaint' of the fall of the last Christian city in the Holy Land, [[Acre, Israel|Saint-Jean d'Acres]].
This poem however, which survived in only one manuscript (UB Groningen, Ms. 405), has no name attached to it in the manuscript itself. None of the texts in this manuscript bears the name of its author.  But since the main body of this manuscript is Jacob van Maerlant's translation/adaptation of [[Petrus Comestor]]'s ''Historia scholastica'', traditionally known as ''Rijmbijbel'' (rhymed Bible) and Jacob's adaptation/translation of [[Flavius Josephus]]'s ''De bello judaeico''. In his recent edition of the oldest surviving manuscript (BR/KB Brussel, Ms. 15001) Maurits Gysseling treats Jacob's Josephus-translation as belonging to the Comestor-translation, yet it is a different text which Jacob named ''Die wrake van Jherusalem'' (The vengeance of Jeruzalem), thereby showing his interpretation of what happened&amp;nbsp;– and why it happened&amp;nbsp;– during the Jewish revolt against the Roman oppressors, which ended in the capture of Jeruzalem and the destruction of the Temple by emperor [[Vespasianus]]' son [[Titus]] in AD 70. Nineteenth century Dutch scholars who were used to consider rhymed texts as 'poetry' were not too happy with Jacob's rhyming [[couplet]]s, which they thought were lacking poetical beauty, so they needed his authorship of these 'real' poems at the end of manuscript to prove that he was a real poet or could be a real poet, if only he wanted to.

That Jacob was the author of this poem ''Vanden lande van Overzee'' was based on a verse in the 19th and last [[stanza]]: "Ghi heren, dit is Jacobs vont. (v. 235): Gentlemen, this is Jacob's creation". This is no evidence in the modern sense of the word, but in the middle of the 19th century it was more than enough proof that&amp;nbsp;– considering the subject and the way the poet expresses humself&amp;nbsp;– could not have been anybody else than Jacob van Maerlant. Fact is that Jacob only called himself Jacob when he was young and before he went to Merlant at Oost-voorne. Than he called hemself 'Jacob (die coster) van Merlant'. At older age when he was known and famous as the author of ''Scolastica in dietschen'' alias the ''Rijmbijbel'', finished on March 25, 1271, he simply called himself 'Merlant'. It was not uncommon in medieval literature to use alloniems to give a text more 'weight'. It is very well possible that some poet used the name Jacob – if it wasn't his name, and an often given name to celebrate the apostle Jacobus who lied buried in [[Santiago de Compostella]] – to make the impression that it was written by the famous Jacob van Maerlant. The same technique was used to appoint Jacob of Maerlant as the author (and inventor!) of a Dutch poem about the Nine Worthies. In this case the 'pia fraus' was written in Latin.

Recent examination of the manuscript Groningen 405 by bookhistorian Jos Biemans has revealed that this codex is a mixture of older and younger quires. Jacob's ''Scolastica/Wrake'' belongs to the younger part, ''Vanden lande van Overzee'' to the older part. It took probably some 10 years (1330–1340)? to write and to assemble this book, which was presumably done in the Brabantine city [[Den Bosch]] for the nearby monastery 'Marienweerd'. Most likely the main guideline to collect the quires into one codex was not the authorship of Jacob van Maerlant but the virgin Mary, which is in perfect harmony with the name of the monastery 'Marienweert'. To make a long story short: there is no real evidence or reason to think that this manuscript Groningen 405 has to be a 'Maerlant'-collection. There is too much wishful thinking involved.

Tradition says he died at [[Damme]]; ca. 1300, yet ca. 1288 is more realistic.

'''''Keep the Widow Waking''''' is a lost [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] play, significant chiefly for the light it throws on the complexities of collaborative authorship in English Renaissance drama.

''A Late Murder of the Son Upon the Mother, or Keep the Widow Waking'' was a [[tragedy]] licensed by the [[Master of the Revels]] (the Court official in charge of regulating drama) in September [[1624 in literature|1624]], as the work of [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] and [[John Webster]] ("Written by Forde, and Webster," the record states).&lt;ref&gt;Sisson, CJ. ''Lost Plays of Shakespeare's Age.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an entry in the Revels accounts is generally accepted by scholars as strong evidence of authorship. In the case of this play, however, documents relating to a lawsuit are preserved in the Public Records Office in London&amp;mdash;documents that include testimony by [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]] that ''Keep the Widow Waking'' was actually written by Dekker, Ford, Webster, and [[William Rowley]].

This cluster of dramatists was known to have been working together in the early 1620s. Webster and Rowley would write ''[[A Cure for a Cuckold]]'' a year later ([[1625 in literature|1625]]); and ''[[The Spanish Gypsy]]'' ([[1623 in literature|1623]]) was perhaps written by Dekker, Ford, and Rowley. ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' dates from [[1621 in literature|1621]]; the first published text of that play ([[1658 in literature|1658]]) states that it was written by Dekker, Ford, Rowley, "&amp;c." Scholars have generally ignored the "et cetera" and treated the play as the work of Ford, Dekker, and Rowley; yet the example of ''Keep the Widow Waking'' suggests that the "&amp;c." should perhaps not be dismissed lightly.

It has been suggested that ''[[Wit Without Money]]'', written by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], is an antecedent of this play &lt;ref&gt;

'''Kurds in Turkey''' refers to people born in or residing in Turkey who are of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] origin.
The Kurds are the largest [[ethnic minority]] in [[Turkey]]. According to various estimates, they compose between 15% and 20% of the population of Turkey.&lt;ref name="Milliyet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackey"&gt;Sandra Mackey , “The reckoning: Iraq and the legacy of Saddam”, W.W.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
The [[Marwanid dynasty]], which was of Kurdish origin, ruled a territory from Diyarbakir that included parts of Syria and Iraq from 984 to 1083.{{sfn|Gunter|2018|p=226}} The [[Ayyubid dynasty]], also of Kurdish origin (but identifying first and foremost as Muslims), ruled [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|parts of Anatolia]] in the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Gunter|2018|p=51}}

According to the Kurdish historian [[Rohat Alakom]], the first Kurdish tribe to arrive in Central Anatolia was the Modanlı tribe (itself a sub-tribe of the Merdisi&lt;ref&gt;Cevdet Türkay, ''Başbakanlık Arşiv Belgelerine Göre Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'nda Oymak, Aşiret ve Cemaatler'', Tercüman Yayınları, 1979, p. 502. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that settled in Haymana in 1184.&lt;ref&gt;Rohat Alakom, ''ibid'', p. 33. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ahmet Nezihî Turan the first Kurdish settlement in Central Anatolia was named ''Kürtler'' ("Kurds"), founded in Yaban Âbâd (present-day [[Kızılcahamam]]-[[Çamlıdere, Ankara|Çamlıdere]] near Ankara) in 1463.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmet Nezili Turan, ''Yaninâbâd Tarihini Ararken'', Kızılcahamam Belediye Yayınları, 1999. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mark Sykes]], the earliest [[population transfer]] (or exile) of Kurds to Central Anatolia was carried out during the reign of [[Selim I]] (1512–20).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sykes, "The Kurdish Tribes of the Ottoman Empire", ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. XXXVIII, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 coup]], the State Planning Organization ({{lang-tr|Devlet Planlama Teşkilatı}}, DPT) was established under the Prime Ministry to solve the problem of Kurdish separatism and underdevelopment. In 1961, the DPT prepared a report titled "The principles of the state's development plan for the east and southeast" ({{lang-tr|Devletin Doğu ve Güneydoğu‘da uygulayacağı kalkınma programının esasları}}), shortened to "Eastern Report". It proposed to defuse separatism by encouraging ethnic mixing through migration (to and from the Southeast). This was not unlike the policies pursued by the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Minister of Labor of the time, [[Bülent Ecevit]] of partial Kurdish ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;Ercan Yavuz, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080822133939/http://www.aksam.com.tr/arsiv/aksam/2004/08/04/politika/politika1.html "Kürt kökenli olabilirim"], ''[[Akşam]]'', August 4, 2004. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahmut Çetin, ''Çinli Hoca'nın torunu Ecevit'', Emre Yayınları, 2006, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; was critical of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2008/01/22/guncel/agun.html|accessdate=2009-01-04|title=Kürtlerle Karadenizliler yer değiştirsinler!|department=Güncel|work=[[Milliyet]]|date=2008-01-22|language=Turkish|first=Can|last=Dündar|authorlink=Can Dündar|author2=Akar, Rıdvan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- you can expand on the other recommendations --&gt;

During the 1970s, the separatist movement coalesced into the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]]. From 1984 to 1999, the Turkish military was embroiled in a conflict with the PKK. The [[village guard system]] was set up and armed by the Turkish state around 1984 to combat the PKK. The militia comprises local Kurds and it has around 58,000 members. Some of the village guards are fiercely loyal to the Turkish state, leading to infighting among Kurdish militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Meriel |last=Beattie |title=Local guards divide Turkish Kurds |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5246068.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2007-09-12|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the clashes between Turkish Army and the PKK the countryside in the southeast was depopulated, with Kurdish civilians moving to local defensible centers such as [[Diyarbakır]], [[Van, Turkey|Van]], and [[Şırnak]], as well as to the cities of western Turkey and even to western Europe. The causes of the depopulation included the Turkish state's military operations against Kurdish population, some PKK atrocities against Kurdish clans they could not control and the poverty of the southeast.&lt;ref name=Radu2001&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0030-4387(00)00057-0 |author=Radu, Michael |journal=Orbis |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=47–63 |year=2001 |title=The Rise and Fall of the PKK|publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute|location=Philadelphia|oclc=93642482}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 3,000 Kurdish villages in Turkey were virtually wiped from the map by the Turkish government, representing the displacement of more than 378,000 people.&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/turkey0305/3.htm#_Toc97005223 |title=Still critical |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=2007-09-12|date=March 2005 |volume=17|issue=2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Evacuations were unlawful and violent. Security forces would surround a village using helicopters, armored vehicles, troops, and village guards, and burn stored produce, agricultural equipment, crops, orchards, forests, and livestock. They set fire to houses, often giving the inhabitants no opportunity to retrieve their possessions. During the course of such operations, security forces frequently abused and humiliated villagers, stole their property and cash, and ill-treated or tortured them before herding them onto the roads and away from their former homes. The operations were marked by scores of “disappearances” and extrajudicial executions. By the mid-1990s, more than 3,000 villages had been virtually wiped from the map, and, according to official figures, 378,335 Kurdish villagers had been displaced and left homeless."&lt;ref name="hrw" /&gt;

==Culture==
 [[File:Newroz_Istanbul(4).jpg|thumb|[[Newroz as celebrated by Kurds|Kurdish man jumping the fire during Newroz]].]]

===Music===
Between 1982 and 1991 the performance or recording of [[Kurdish music|songs in the Kurdish language]] was banned in Turkey, affecting singers such as [[Şivan Perwer]], [[Mahsun Kırmızıgül]] and [[İbrahim Tatlıses]]. However a black market has long existed in Turkey, and pirate radio stations and underground recordings have always been available. Although there was no ban on performing Kurdish language music, it was effectively prevented from being broadcast on radio or television through censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Yurdatapan, Şanar. 2004. "Turkey: Censorship past and present." In ''Shoot the Singer! Music Censorship Today'', edited by Marie Korpe. London: Zed Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84277-505-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Şivan Perwer]] is a composer, vocalist and tembûr player. He concentrates mainly on political and nationalistic music—of which he is considered the founder in Kurdish music—as well as classical and folk music.

Another important Kurdish musician from Turkey is [[Nizamettin Arıç]] (Feqiyê Teyra). He began with singing in Turkish, and made his directorial debut and also stars in ''[[Klamek ji bo Beko]]'' (''A Song for Beko''), one of the first films in Kurdish. Arıç rejected musical stardom at the cost of debasing his language and culture. As a result of singing in Kurdish, he was imprisoned, and then obliged to flee to Syria and eventually to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeworkfund.org/modern/bios/chingiz_sadikhov.html|accessdate=2008-08-23

===Literature===
Some sources consider [[Ali Hariri]] (1425–1495) as the first well-known poet who wrote in Kurdish. He was from the [[Hakkari]] region.&lt;ref name=paris&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutkurde.org/en/language/|title=Institut Kurde de Paris|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In 2011, Kanal D, Turkey's largest television station, began filming ''Ayrılık Olmasaydı: ben-u sen'' in majority-Kurdish Diyarbakir. The show, written by a Kurdish screenwriter, professed to be the first in the popular genre to portray the Kurds in a positive light. The show was set to debut in early 2012, but suffered numerous delays, some say because of the controversial subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krajeski|first=Jenna|title=Days of Their Lives|url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/Story/1346/Days-of-Their-Lives.html|publisher=The Caravan|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the Kurds of Central Anatolia is formed by ''Tuz Gölü Kürtleri'' (Kurds of [[Lake Tuz]]) who live in [[Ankara Province|Ankara]], [[Konya Province|Konya]] and [[Aksaray Province|Aksaray]] provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Müslüm Yücel, "Tuz Gölü Kürtleri", I-VIII, ''Yeni Gündem'' gazetesi, 2000, İstanbul. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] (Atatürk) mentioned them as "Konya çöllerindeki Kürtler" (Kurds in the Konya [[desert]]s) in the interview with [[Ahmet Emin Yalman|Ahmet Emin]] (Yalman) dated January 16/17, 1923.&lt;ref&gt;''Atatürk'ün bütün Eserleri'', Kaynak Yayınları, Cilt: 14, {{ISBN|975-343-400-6}}, pp. 273–274. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hermann Wenzel]], the original breeders of the [[Angora goat]] were the Kurds of Inner Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Wenzel, ''Sultan-Dagh und Akschehir-Ova'', Kiel, 1932. {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Wenzel, ''Forschungen in Inneranatolien II: Die Steppe als Lebensraum'', Schriften des Geographische institut Kiel, VII, 3, Kiel, 1937. {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest tribes of the Kurds of Central Anatolia are the Bazaini or Shaikh Bazaini, Judikan, Saifkan, Chelebi, Janbeki, Jehanbegli, Khallikan, Mutikan, Hajibani, Barakati, Badeli, Ukhchizhemi, Rashvan, Sherdi, Urukchi, Milan, Zirikan, Atmanikan, and Tirikan. Formerly, some of the Janbegli, Rashvan and Milan tribes were of [[Alevi]] origin and followed [[Alevism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohat Alkom, ''ibid'', p. 63. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two or the four primary dialects of Kurdish are used by the Central Anatolian Kurds. These are [[Kurmanji]] and [[Dimili]]/[[Zaza language|Zaza]]. Generally, their mother languages are [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] ([[Kurmanji]]) and Kurmanji-speaking people have difficulty to understand the language spoken in Haymana where Şeyhbızın (Şêxbizinî) tribe members live.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Alford Andrews, Türkiye'de Etnik Gruplar, ANT Yayınları, Aralık 1992, {{ISBN|975-7350-03-6}}, s. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the new generation of Kurdish people in some settlements no longer speak Kurdish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birnebun.com/hejmar/PDF/birnebunweb45.pdf Dr. Mikaili, "Devlet Kürtçe'ye Kapıları Açtı, Ya Biz Orta Anadolu Kürtleri ?"], ''Bîrnebûn'', Sayı: 45, Bahar 2010, {{ISSN|1402-7488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8026">The names for archaeological periods in the '''list of archaeological periods''' vary enormously from region to region. This is a list of the main divisions by continent and region. Dating also varies considerably and those given are broad approximations across wide areas.

The [[three-age system]] has been used in many areas, referring to the [[prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[history|historical]] periods identified by tool manufacture and use, of [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]]. Since these ages are distinguished by the development of technology, it is natural that the dates to which these refer vary in different parts of the world. In many regions, the term [[Stone Age]] is no longer used, as it has been replaced by more specific geological periods. For some regions, there is need for an intermediate [[Copper age|Chalcolithic]] period between the Stone Age and Bronze Age. For cultures where indigenous metal tools were in less widespread use, other classifications, such as the [[lithic stage]], [[archaic stage]] and [[formative stage]] refer to the development of other types of technology and social organisation.

[[List of Historical periods|Historical periods]] denotes periods of human development with the advantage of the development of writing. Written records tend to provide more socio-political insight into the dominant nations, and hence allow categorization according to the ruling empires and cultures, such as [[Hellenistic]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Viking]]. Inevitably these definitions of periods only relate to the region of that empire or culture.

The Industrial Age or [[Modern Times (history)|Modern era]] is generally taken to refer to post-1800. From this time, the [[industrial revolution]] which began in Western Europe resulted in global trade and greatly increased cultural exchange.

[[File:macassan prau.jpg|thumb|right|A type of Macassan [[proa|perahu]], the [[padewakang]].]]
[[Trepanger]]s from the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] region of [[Sulawesi]] (modern day [[Indonesia]]) began visiting the coast of northern Australia sometime around the middle of the 1700s, first in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley region]], and some decades later in [[Arnhem Land]],{{sfn|Macknight|2011|p=134}} to collect and process ''trepang'' (also known as [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]), a marine invertebrate [[sea cucumber]] [[Sea cucumber as food|prized for its culinary]] value generally and for its medicinal properties in [[China|Chinese]] markets. The term [[Makassar people|Makassan]] (or Macassan) is generally used to apply to all the trepangers who came to Australia, although some were from other islands in the [[Indonesian Archipelago]], including [[Timor]], [[Rote Island|Rote]] and [[Aru Islands|Aru]].

==Fishing and processing of Trepang==
[[File:Espardenya (animal).jpg|thumb|200px|right|A sea cucumber. This example is from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]]]{{main|Sea cucumber|Sea cucumber (food)}}
The creature and the food product are commonly known as '''sea cucumber''', '''bêche-de-mer''' in [[French language|French]], '''[[gamat]]''' in [[Malay language|Malaysian]], while [[Makassarese language|Makassarese]] has 12 terms covering 16 different species.{{sfn|Choo|2004|p=57}}{{sfn|Tuwo|2004|p=52}}. One of the Makassar terms, for trepang, ''taripaŋ'' entered the [[Aboriginal languages]] of the [[Cobourg Peninsula]],  as ''tharriba'' in [[Marrku language|Marrku]], as ''jarripang'' in [[Maung language|Mawng]] or otherwise as ''darriba.''{{sfn|Evans|2016|p=39}}

''Trepang'' live on the sea floor and are exposed at low tide. Fishing was traditionally done by hand, spearing, diving or dredging. The catch was placed in boiling water before being dried and smoked, to preserve the ''trepang'' for the journey back to Makassar and other South East Asian markets. ''Trepang'' is still valued by Chinese communities for its jelly-like texture, its flavour-enhancing properties, and as a stimulant and aphrodisiac.{{sfn|Máñez|Ferse|2010}} [[Matthew Flinders]] made a contemporary record of how trepang was processed when he met [[Pobasso]], a chief of a Makassan fleet in February 1803.{{sfn|Flinders|1814|pp=229–232}}

==The Voyage to ''Marege''' and ''Kayu Jawa''==
Fishing fleets began to visit the northern coasts of Australia from [[Makassar]] in southern [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]] from about 1720, but possibly earlier. While Campbell Macknight's classic study of the Makassan trepang industry accepts the start of the industry as about 1720, with the earliest recorded trepang voyage made in 1751,{{sfn|Macknight|1976b}} Regina Ganter of Griffith University notes a Sulawesi historian who suggests a commencement date for the industry of about 1640.{{sfn|Ganter|2008|pp=1–14}} Ganter also notes that for some anthropologists, the extensive impact of the trepang industry on the [[Yolngu]] people suggests a longer period of contact. Arnhem land rock art, recorded by archaeologists in 2008, appears to provide further evidence of Makassan contact in the mid-1600s.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Contact has even been proposed from as early as the 1500s, on the basis of radiocarbon dating for apparent prau designs in [[Aboriginal rock art]].{{sfn|Rogers|2014}}

At the height of the trepang industry, Makassans ranged thousands of kilometres along Australia's northern coasts, arriving with the north-west monsoon each December. Makassan [[proa|''perahu'' or ''praus'']] could carry a crew of thirty members, and Macknight estimated the total number of trepangers arriving each year as about one thousand.{{sfn|Macknight|1976b|p=29}} The Makassan crews established themselves at various semi-permanent locations on the coast, to boil and dry the trepang before the return voyage home, four months later, to sell their cargo to Chinese merchants.&lt;ref name=Stephenson&gt;Stephenson, P.(2010)''Islam Dreaming: Indigenous Muslims in Australia.'' P.22-6. University of New South Wales Press,Sydney.{{ISBN|978-1-74223-247-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Marege''' was the Makassan name for Arnhem land, (meaning literally "Wild Country") from the [[Cobourg Peninsula]] to [[Groote Eylandt]] in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. ''Kayu Jawa'' was the name for the fishing grounds in the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]], from Napier Broome Bay to [[Cape Leveque]]. Other important fishing areas included [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], [[Sumbawa]], [[Timor]] and [[Selayar Island|Selayar]]. {{sfn|Máñez|Ferse|2010}} [[Matthew Flinders]] in his circumnavigation of Australia in 1803, met a Makassan trepang fleet near present day [[Nhulunbuy, Northern Territory|Nhulunbuy]]. He communicated at length with a Makassan captain, [[Pobasso]], through his cook, who was also a Malay, and learned of the extent of the trade from this encounter. {{sfn|Flinders|1814|pp=229–232}}

Ganter adds: "1,000 Macassans...must have seen a veritable invasion against the fewer than 7,000 British nestled into Sydney Cove and Newcastle."&lt;ref name="Ganter2"&gt;Ganter, R. (2005) "Turn the Map upside down" in ''Griffith Review'' Edition 9, 2005. "Up North: Myths, Threats and Enchantment." Griffith University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Baudin]] also encountered 26 large ''perahu'' off the northern coast of Western Australia in the same year.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;Russell, D. ''Australian Aboriginal Studies'' 2004, Number 1. "Aboriginal-Makassan interactions in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in northern Australia and contemporary sea rights claims." P.6-7. Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. Retrieved on 6 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ganter states that the British settlements of [[Fort Dundas]] and [[Fort Wellington, Australia|Fort Wellington]] were established as a result of [[Phillip Parker King|Phillip Parker King's]] contact with Makassan trepangers in 1821.&lt;ref name="Ganter2" /&gt;

[[Using Daeng Rangka]], the last Makassan trepanger to visit Australia, lived well into the 20th century and the history of his voyages are therefore well documented. He first made the voyage to northern Australia as a young man. He suffered dismasting and several shipwrecks, generally positive but occasionally conflicting relationships with Indigenous Australians, and was the first trepanger to pay the South Australian government (which at the time administered the Northern Territory) for a trepanging licence in 1883, an impost that made the trade less viable.{{sfn|Macknight|1976a}} The trade continued to dwindle toward the end of the 19th century, due to the imposition of customs duties and licence fees and probably compounded by overfishing.{{sfn|Máñez|Ferse|2010}} Using Daeng Rangka commanded the last Makassar ''perahu,'' which left [[Arnhem Land]] in 1907.

==Physical evidence of Makassan contact==

Archeological remains of Makassar processing plants from the 18th and 19th centuries are still at [[Port Essington]], [[Anuru Bay]] and [[Groote Eylandt]], along with stands of the Makassan introduced [[tamarind]] trees. Macknight and others note these areas have produced pieces of metal, broken pottery and glass, coins, fishhooks and broken clay pipes.{{sfn|Macknight|1976b|pp=78–81}} Macknight notes that much of the ceramic material found suggests a nineteenth-century date.{{efn|At the same time he has warned against accepting radiocarbon dates from trepang processing fireplaces. These apparently give an anomalous date of 800 years before present.{{sfn|Macknight|1986|p=70}} }}

In 1916, two bronze [[cannon]]s were found on a small island in Napier Broome Bay, on the northern coast of [[Western Australia]]. Scientists at the [[Western Australian Museum]] in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] have made a detailed analysis and have determined that these weapons are swivel guns and almost certainly of late-18th-century [[Makassar|Makassan]], rather than European, origin.&lt;ref&gt;Green, J. N: ''The Carronade Island Guns and South East Asian Gun Founding.''[Fremantle, W.A.]: Dept. of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Maritime Museum, [2007]. Report No.215{{harvcol|Archived copy}} Retrieved on 6 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Flinders' account confirms that the Makassans he met were personally armed and their perahus carried small cannons.{{sfn|Flinders|1814|pp=229–232}}

In January 2012, a swivel gun found two years before at Dundee Beach near Darwin was widely reported by web news sources and the Australian press to be of Portuguese origin.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Australian Geographic'', 10 January 2012. "Darwin boy's find could rewrite history." {{cite web |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/darwin-boys-find-could-re-write-history-portuguese-gun.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112153402/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/darwin-boys-find-could-re-write-history-portuguese-gun.htm |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved on 6 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However initial analysis by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory indicates it is probably also of South East Asian origin.&lt;ref&gt;La Canna, X.

There is significant evidence of contact with Makassan fishers in rock art and bark painting of northern Australia, with the Makassan ''perahu'' a prominent feature.{{sfn|Taçon|May|Fallon|Travers|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Woodford, J. (2008)[[The Sydney Morning Herald]], 20 September 2008.

==Effect on Indigenous people of Australia==
[[File:Beeswax female over white Macassan perahu - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A female figure outlined in beeswax over painting of a white Macassan prau]]
The Makassar contact with [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] had a significant effect on their culture. Ganter writes "the cultural imprint on the [[Yolngu people]] of this contact is everywhere: in their language, in their art, in their stories, in their cuisine."&lt;ref name="Ganter2" /&gt; According to anthropologist John Bradley from [[Monash University]], the contact between the two groups was a success: "They traded together. It was fair - there was no racial judgement, no race policy." Even into the early 21st century, the shared history between the two peoples is still celebrated by Aboriginal communities in northern Australia as a period of mutual trust and respect.{{sfn|Rogers|2014}}

Others who have studied this period have come to a different conclusion regarding the relationship between the aboriginal people and the visiting trepangers.  [[Anthropologist]] Ian McIntosh has said that the initial effects of contact with the Macassan fishermen resulted in "turmoil"{{sfn|McIntosh|1996|pp=65–67}} with the extent of Islamic influence being noteworthy.{{sfn|McIntosh|1996|p=76}} In another paper McIntosh concludes, "strife, poverty and domination.. is a previously unrecorded legacy of contact between Aborigines and Indonesians."{{sfn|McIntosh|1996|p=138}} A report prepared by the History Department of the [[Australian National University]] says that the Macassans appear to have been welcomed initially, however relations deteriorated when, "aborigines began to feel they were being exploited.. leading to violence on both sides".{{sfn|Howie-Willis|1997|pp=81–82}}

===Trade===
Studies by anthropologists have found traditions that indicate Makassans negotiated for the right to fish certain waters. The exchange also involved the trade of cloth, tobacco, metal axes and knives, rice and gin. The Yolgnu of [[Arnhem Land]] also traded turtle-shell, pearls and cypress pine and some were employed as trepangers.&lt;ref&gt; May, S.K., McKinnon, J.F., Raupp, J.T.(2009) ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology.'' "Boats on Bark: an Analysis of Groote Eylandt Aboriginal Bark-Paintings featuring Macassan Praus from the 1948 Arnhem Land Expedition, Northern Territory, Australia." Retrieved on 6 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; While there is ample evidence of peaceful contact, some contact was hostile. Using Daeng Rangka described at least one violent confrontation with Aborigines,{{sfn|Macknight|1976a}} while Flinders heard advice from the Makassans to "beware of the natives".{{sfn|Flinders|1814|pp=229–232}} However, rock art and bark paintings appear to confirm that some Aboriginal workers willingly accompanied the Makassar back to their homeland of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]] across the [[Arafura Sea]]. Women were also occasional items of exchange according to Denise Russell, but their views and experiences have not been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D.(2004) p.15&lt;/ref&gt; After visiting [[Groote Eylandt]] in the early 1930s, anthropologist [[Donald Thomson]] speculated that the traditional seclusion of women from strange men and their use of a portable bark screens "may have been a result of contact with Macassans".&lt;ref&gt;Donald Thomson, Compiled` and edited by Nicolas Peterson (2003):''Donald Thomson in Arnhem Land.'' P.110. Miegunyah Press, Melbourne University Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0-522-85205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
It is possible that [[smallpox]] was introduced to northern Australia via Makassan contact in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="Macknight2"&gt;Macknight, C.C.(Apr 1986). "Macassans and the Aboriginal Past," ''Archaeology in Oceania'', Vol. 21, No. 1, Papers Presented to John Mulvaney, pp. 69-75 Published by: Oceania Publications, University of Sydney. Retrieved on 6 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This remains unproven as [[First Fleet#Smallpox|First Fleet smallpox]] was already spreading across Australia from Sydney Cove.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Australian Studies'' http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2013.849750#preview&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of the hereditary [[Machado-Joseph Disease]] in the [[Groote Eylandt]] community has been attributed to outside contact. Recent genetic studies showed that the Groote Eylandt families with MJD shared a haplogroup with some families from Taiwanese, Indian, and Japanese families.&lt;ref name="martinsetal2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Martins, Sandra |author2=Bing-Wen Soong |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012 |title=Mutational Origin of Machado-Joseph Disease in the Australian Aboriginal Communities of Groote Eylandt and Yirrkala | |journal=Archives of Neurology |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=746-751  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Some Yolngu communities of Arnhem Land appear to have re-figured their economies from being largely land-based to largely sea-based with the introduction of Makassar technologies such as dug-out canoes, which were highly prized. These seaworthy boats, unlike their traditional bark canoes, allowed Yolngu to fish the ocean for [[dugong]]s and [[sea turtle]]s.{{sfn|Ganter|2008}} Macknight notes that both the dug-out canoe and shovel-nosed spear found in Arnhem Land were based on Macassarese prototypes.&lt;ref name="Macknight2" /&gt;

===Language===
A Makassan [[pidgin]] became a [[lingua franca]] along the north coast, not just between Makassan and Aboriginal people, but also between different Aboriginal groups, who were brought into greater contact with each other by the seafaring Makassar culture. Words from the [[Makassarese language]] (related to [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]) can still be found in Aboriginal language varieties of the north coast; examples include ''rupiah'' (money), ''jama'' (work), and ''balanda'' (white person), which originally came to the Makassar language via the Malay 'orang belanda' (Dutch person).&lt;ref name="walkerzorc1981"&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Walker, Alan |author2=Zorc, R. David |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1981 |title=Austronesian Loanwords in Yolngu-Matha of Northeast Arnhem Land | |journal=Aboriginal History |volume=5 |pages=109-134  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Regina Ganter and Peta Stephenson, drawing on the work of Ian Mcintosh (2000), argue that aspects of [[Islam in Australia|Islam]] were creatively adapted by the Yolngu, and Muslim references survive in certain ceremonies and Dreaming stories today.{{sfn|Ganter|2008|p=2}}&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, P.(2010) p.31-34&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson speculates that the Makassans may have also been the first to bring [[Islam in Australia|Islam]] to [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, P (2004) "Islam in Indigenous Australia: Historic Relic or Contemporary Reality" in ''Politics and Culture'' 2004, Issue 4.[http://www.politicsandculture.org/2010/08/10/islam-in-indigenous-australia-historic-relic-or-c-3/] Retrieved on 6 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2013}}

According to anthropologist John Bradley from Monash University, "If you go to north-east Arnhem Land there is [a trace of Islam] in song, it is there in painting, it is there in dance, it is there in funeral rituals. It is patently obvious that there are borrowed items. With linguistic analysis as well, you're hearing hymns to Allah, or at least certain prayers to Allah."{{efn|'...a figure called Walitha'walitha, which is worshipped by a clan of the Yolngu people on [[Elcho Island]], off the northern coast of Arnhem Land. The name derives from the Arabic phrase "[[Subhanahu wa ta'ala|Allah ta'ala]]", meaning "God, the exalted". Walitha'walitha is closely associated with funeral rituals, which can include other Islamic elements like facing west during prayers - roughly the direction of [[Mecca]] - and ritual prostration reminiscent of the Muslim [[Sujud|sujood]]. "I think it would be hugely oversimplifying to suggest that this figure is Allah as the 'one true God', " says Howard Morphy, an anthropologist at Australian National University. It's more the case of the Yolngu people adopting an Allah-like figure into their cosmology, he suggests.'{{sfn|Rogers|2014}} }}

==Current situation==
Though prevented from fishing across Arnhem Land, other [[Indonesia]]n fishermen have continued to fish up and down the west coast, in what are now Australian waters, as they have done for hundreds of years before such territories were declared — some in traditional boats that their grandparents owned. Such fishing is considered illegal by the present-day Australian government, and since the 1970s, if caught by authorities, the boats are burned and the fishermen are returned to Indonesia. Most Indonesian fishing in Australian waters now occurs around what Australia coined "[[Ashmore Reef]]" (known in Indonesia as ''Pulau Pasir'') and the nearby islands.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, N.(2007) ''Boats to Burn, Bajo Fishing Activity in the Australian Fishing Zone.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9605">'''Mark Bourrie'''  is a Canadian lawyer, journalist, author, [[historian]], and lecturer at [[Carleton University]] and the [[University of Ottawa]].

==Education==
Bourrie earned his BA in History at the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1990. He holds a diploma in public policy and administration from the [[University of Guelph]], a master's degree in journalism from [[Carleton University]], a doctorate in Canadian media history at the [[University of Ottawa]] and [[Juris Doctor]] in Common Law from the [[University of Ottawa]].

== Journalism career ==
Before beginning a career in journalism, Bourrie worked in remote areas of Canada for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. He worked as a forest fire fighter in northern Ontario in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''The Winnipeg Free Press'', July 20, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bourrie was a summer student reporter at ''[[The Hamilton Spectator]]'' and ''[[The London Free Press]]'' and a student reporter at ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' before taking a job on ''[[The Toronto Sun]]'' in 1979 as assistant business editor and news reporter. He worked for two decades as a [[freelancing|freelance]] news and feature writer, primarily for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' from 1981 to 1989 and the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' from 1989 to 1999 and again in 2009-2010. He was Parliamentary correspondent for the ''[[Law Times]]'' from 1994 until 2006. He also wrote for the [[InterPress Service]], the United Nations-sponsored news and feature service. By the late 1990s, he had branched out from newspaper freelance work to book and magazine writing.

Bourrie won a National Magazine Award (NMA) in 1999 and honorable mentions in 2000 and 2003, in the Social Affairs category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazine-awards.com/index.cfm/ci_id/1217/la_id/1.htm National Magazine Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;
He was part of an Ottawa magazine team nominated for a National Magazine Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magazine-awards.com/multimedia/nmaf/NMA38_Nominations_List.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he was nominated for a [[Canadian Association of Journalists]] (CAJ) award for an article about the Depression-era execution in Ottawa of a man who was probably innocent. The  article was researched entirely in the [[National Archives of Canada]]. He won a Canadian Archaeological Association public writing award (1989) and several Ontario Newspaper Awards (formerly Western Ontario Newspaper Awards). He also won the Ontario Community Canadian Newspaper Award for columnist of the year in 2008. His 1979 eyewitness account of an [[Fujita scale|F4]] [[tornado]] in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]], [[Ontario]], helped earn his newspaper, ''The London Free Press'', a National Newspaper Award nomination. Most of his NMA-nominated work focused on issues related to people wrongly accused of criminal offences or [[terrorism]]. He has been a member of the [[Canadian Parliamentary Press Gallery]] since 1994.

In 2012 Bourrie stated that the Chinese government-owned  [[Xinhua News Agency]] asked him to collect information on the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] by exploiting his journalistic access to the [[Parliament of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/08/22/notes-going-to-china-not-public-canadian-speaks-out-about-split-with-xinhua-news-agency/ |title=China’s state-run news agency being used to monitor critics in Canada: reporter |publisher=''[[National Post]]'' |date=22 August 2012 |first=Kathryn Blaze |last=Carlson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/08/22/pol-cp-xinhua-spy-bourrie-allegation.html |title=Reporter says Chinese news agency asked him to spy |date=22 August 2012 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |author=[[The Canadian Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourrie stated that he was asked to write for Xinhua in 2009 and sought advice from the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS), but was ignored. Bourrie stated that at that point he refused to continue to write articles for Xinhua and gave the agency no information about the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ottawamagazine.com/society/2012/09/22/the-ex-files-journalist-mark-bourries-behind-the-scenes-account-of-his-two-years-in-the-employ-of-xinhua/ |title=THE EX FILES: Journalist Mark Bourrie’s behind-the-scenes account of his two years in the employ of Xinhua |publisher=''Ottawa Magazine'' |first=Mark |last=Bourrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2012, he and several other Parliament Hill journalists started the online publication [[Blacklock's Reporter]], a paywall-funded daily news report. The publication concentrates on news that is normally missed by media that focuses on partisan politics.

==Academic==
Bourrie lectures in History at [[Carleton University]] and [[Canadian Studies]] at the [[University of Ottawa]]. From 2007 to 2009, he was a lecturer at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]'s journalism school, teaching reporting, criticism and media history. He is also a lecturer at the Department of National Defence (Canada) School of Public Affairs, specializing in the history and practice of propaganda and censorship, and was a consultant to the Canadian War Museum for a show on war propaganda art. He has also written on the media relations strategy of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oalib.com/paper/2177363#.VU49aLB_ktg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
''Ninety Fathoms Down'' (1995) was Canada's first collection of [[Great Lakes]] ship stories. His book on [[David Michael Krueger]], a serial killer held in a psychiatric hospital in Ontario, was published in 1997 as ''By Reason of Insanity'' and was excerpted by several major Canadian newspapers.  Bourrie's master's thesis was published by Key Porter as ''Hemp'' in 2004.  His tenth book, adapted from his PhD thesis,''The Fog of War,'' was published in July, 2011 by Douglas &amp; McIntyre. It reached sixth on [[Maclean's]] magazine non-fiction bestseller list on September 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keyporter.com/BookListings.aspx?keyword=HISTORY&amp;type=bisac |title=Welcome to Key Porter Books |publisher=Keyporter.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/09/01/bestsellers-week-of-august-29th-2011/&lt;/ref&gt; His collection of Canada's best war correspondence, ''Fighting Words'', came out in the fall of 2012. [[HarperCollins]] published Bourrie's book on Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]'s  government's information control, called ''Kill the Messengers: Stephen Harper's Assault on Your Right to Know''. The book was released by HarperCollins Canada on January 27, 2015 and began appearing on best-seller lists ten days later.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/bestsellers/bestsellers-canadian-non-fiction-may-25-2013/article4226554/&lt;/ref&gt; This book was listed as one of the Globe and Mail's Top 100 Books of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/the-globe-100-the-best-books-of-2015/article27607992/&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 2015, HarperCollins announced it had acquired Canadian rights to ''The Killing Game'', Bourrie's study of ISIS propaganda and recruitment, for publication in the spring of 2016&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quillandquire.com/omni/patrick-crean-acquires-new-non-fiction-by-mark-bourrie/&lt;/ref&gt; and it began appearing on the Canadian independent bookstore bestseller list in late April, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.retailcouncil.org/sites/default/files/documents/BookNet%20Bestseller%20April272016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bourrie was born in [[Toronto]] and raised in the [[Georgian Bay]] area of Ontario but later moved to [[Ottawa]]. He is married to lawyer [[Marion Van de Wetering]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Friar|Fray]] '''Pedro de los Ríos''' (died 1563–1565&lt;ref&gt;Quiñones Keber 1995, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Dominican Order|Domician]] [[missionary]] in [[Mexico]] in the mid-16th century. Little is known about him, but he contributed to the creation of the manuscripts now known as the [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]] and [[Codex Vaticanus A]], which describe [[Aztec]] [[culture]] and [[history]]. The Codex Vaticanus A is also known as the Codex Ríos, after Pedro de los Ríos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">In [[archaeology]], '''phenomenology''' applies to the use of sensory experiences to view and interpret an archaeological site or [[cultural landscape]]. It first came to widespread attention among archaeologists with the publication of [[Christopher Tilley]]'s ''A Phenomenology of Landscape'' (1994), in which he suggested it to be a useful technique that can be used to discover more about historical peoples and how they interact with the landscapes in which they live. He argued that, simply by looking at two-dimensional depictions of a landscape, such as on a [[map]], archaeologists fail to understand how peoples living in hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies actually relate to those areas.  He believed, therefore, that investigators should enter the very landscape that they are studying, and use their senses of [[visual perception|sight]], [[Olfaction|smell]], and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] to learn more about how historical peoples would have interpreted it. 

Phenomenology "has provoked considerable discussion within the discipline",&lt;ref&gt;Brück (2005:45)&lt;/ref&gt; receiving considerable criticism from the archaeological community who deem it to be "unscientific" and "subjective".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton &amp; Whitehouse (2006:31-32)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to this, it has also been supported by a great number of archaeologists and nowadays is often used in fieldwork alongside other, more traditional methods. It has been used particularly in understanding [[prehistory|prehistoric sites]], such as the [[Neolithic]] [[Tavoliere Plain]] in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton &amp; Whitehouse (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bronze Age]] landscape on [[Bodmin Moor]], England.&lt;ref&gt;Tilley (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ponce Creole''' is an [[architectural style]] created in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]], in the late 19th and early 20th century.  This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of the French, the Spaniards, and the Caribbean to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico’s [[Caribbean Sea]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MjXG2vg5YFsC&amp;pg=PA225 Puerto Rico. By Randall Peffer. Page 225.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from [[Classical revival]] and [[Spanish Revival]] to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/traveler/articles/1056puerto_rico.html National Geographic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302194306/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/traveler/articles/1056puerto_rico.html |date=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The [[Ponce Historic Zone|central district of Ponce]] in particular is a blend of Ponce Creole and [[Art Deco]]: "The Historic District of Ponce: Second only to Old San Juan in terms of historical significance, the central district of Ponce is a blend of Ponce Creole and Art Deco building styles, dating mainly from the 1890s to the 1930s. One street, Calle Isabel, offers an array of Ponceño architectural styles, which often incorporate [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] details. The city underwent a massive restoration preceding the celebration of its 300th anniversary in 1996."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frommers.com/destinations/puertorico/0094023568.html ''Puerto Rico: The Best Attractions.'' Frommer’s.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Architectural structures of the Ponce Creole style are amongst the 1,046 buildings being restored in Ponce: "The commonwealth has allocated $440 million to restore a 66-block downtown area of 1,046 buildings ranging in style from old Spanish colonial to neoclassical, from "Ponce Créole" to Art Deco. Many of Ponce's central buildings were erected between the late 1890s and the 1930s, when the city was the hub of the island's rum, sugar cane and shipping industries and was known as La Perla del Sur, the 'Pearl of the South.' It was home to many artists, politicians, and poets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuertorico.org/culture/architec.shtml ''Architecture.'' Welcome to Puerto Rico.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, three styles dominate the architectural landscape in Ponce: [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], Ponce Creole, and [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rCsUml9xc3kC&amp;pg=PA496 Frommer's Caribbean 2008. By Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince. Page 496.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Ponce Creole is the name given to the architectural style that is unique to Ponce only: "San Juan, the capital, was planned and built by the Spanish conquerors, one writer points out, while Ponce is the work of its native sons, making it a truly authentic Puerto Rican city."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1991/7/1991_7_30.shtml  ''The Pearl of the South.'' American Heritage Magazine.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The Ponce Creole style is characterized by wood and stucco buildings with broad columned porches and balconies and painted in the tasty pinks, peaches, and limes common to hot countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1991/7/1991_7_30.shtml  ''The Pearl of the South.'' American Heritage Magazine.]&lt;/ref&gt; The style is a blend of Spanish Creole and neoclassical architecture: "In the late 19th century, Ponce developed its own blend of Spanish Creole and neoclassical architecture called Ponce Creole; it's characterized by the use of Corinthian columns, wrought-iron balconies, and gas lamps. It was dubbed Creole because it reminded some of New Orleans's French Quarter. Wealth from Ponce's sugarcane industry financed most of the elegantly ornamented buildings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-13540430/admiring-architecture-old-puerto.html ''Admiring architecture in old Puerto Rico''. Sunset. 1 February 1993. By Lora J. Finnegan.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other prominent characteristcis of this architectural style have been described by Pablo Ojeda O'Neill as "a long raised porch, stone rostrium-raised homes to achieve ventilation and to protect the wood foundation, a series of front doors with wooden windows to maximize ventilation."&lt;ref&gt;Neysa Rodriguez Deynes, et al. ''Breviario sobre la Historia de Ponce y sus Principales Lugares de Interes. San Juan, PR: Model Offset Printing. 1991. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their classic study about Ponce architecture, Reed and Torres identified the Ponce Creole style as "a one-storyed residential masonry dwelling with front [[lintel]] doors and side gate, garage with interior ceiling arches, interior walls with wall guards, porch and garage ironwork in wrought-iron, multiple front double doors with four sets of wooden blinds each, porch with simple wooden columns with crowns in the classical tradition, simple door frames, and porch roof of wood and zinc."&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Torres, et. al. ''Un Estudio de la Zona Histórica y el Area Central de la Ciudad de Ponce, para la Junta de Planificacion de Puerto Rico y el Municipio de Ponce.'' c. 1965. Pages 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Socorro Giron. ''Ponce, el teatro La Perla y La Campana de la Almudaina.'' 1992. p.481.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmelo Rosario Natal.

[[File:Blas C. Silva Boucher, ingeniero de Ponce, PR, cerca 1909 (32B).jpg|thumb|left|Blas Silva, the most prominent of Ponce Creole architects]]
While Ponce had many prominent architects during this period, such as [[Manuel V. Domenech]], [[Francisco Porrata-Doría]], and [[Alfredo Wiechers Pieretti|Alfredo B. Wiechers]], it was [[Blas Silva]] who distinguished himself in that he actually ''created'' a whole new architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Felix Juan del Campo, State Historian; and Hector F. Santiago, State Architectural Historian, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) August, 1987.  In ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form''. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.) Page 3. Listing Reference Number 87001826: Residencia Subira/Residencia Frau. 29 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapting the curves of the [[Art Nouveau]] to the persistent [[Neo-classicism]] of Puerto Rico, Silva succeeded in creating a movement in architecture which broke away from the traditional forms while remaining within them. The traditional continuous raised [[verandah]] along the front facade is broken up into two and twisted out of its usual linearity into the curved forms preserved today. Characteristic of the architecture to abound in Ponce contemporaneous to Castillo 34, for example, is a profusion of aplique, and [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] combination and juxtaposition of shapes, particularly [[curvilinear]], and a general ostentation of articulation. The structure at 34 Castillo Street is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Felix Juan del Campo, State Historian; and Hector F. Santiago, State Architectural Historian, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) August, 1987.  In ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form''. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.) Page 3. Listing Reference Number 87001825: Residencia Font-Ubides. 29 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blas Silva was probably the most established of the "wedding-cake architects" and was thus sought after mostly by the "nouveau riche" of the period. Silva's houses are among the richest in Ponce, among which the [[Font-Ubides House]] (a.k.a. Monsanto Residence) stands out for its circular porches. Other buildings by Blas Silva include the [[Frau Residence]] and the [[Museo de la Historia de Ponce|Salazar-Candal Residence]], both also listed in the [[NRHP]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Felix Juan del Campo, State Historian; and Hector F. Santiago, State Architectural Historian, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office.

Page 3. Listing Reference Number 87001825: Residencia Font-Ubides. 29 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Blas Silva, at least 10 other architects designed in the Ponce Creole style: Herminio Valls, Francisco Valls, Eduardo Salichs, [[Alfredo Wiechers]], Adolfo Nones, Francisco Grevi,{{efn|Francisco Grevi was a master builder who implemented Ponce Creole concepts in his buildings.

One example of the Ponce Creole style can be appreciated is Blas’ 1913 design of the [[Font-Ubides House]] at Calle Castillo number 34.  This residence stands out among the great houses of Ponce for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornament.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G.

Calle Cristina number 70, commissioned by [[Ermelindo Salazar]] and subsequently home to the [[Museum of Puerto Rican Music]] and currently headquarters of the [[Centro Cultural de Ponce Carmen Solá de Pereira]], is another example of Ponce Creole architecture. Today, Cristina 70 houses a museum and gallery depicting the various influences on Puerto Rican art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1216/is_n2_v190/ai_13540430/ ''Admiring architecture in old Puerto Rico - Ponce, Puerto Rico - Beyond the West.''

=== Reina 107===
[[File:IMG 2911 - Subira Residence in Barrio Segundo in Ponce, PR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Residencia Subirá|Frau Residence]] (by [[Blas Silva]]) at Reina 107]]
The [[Residencia Subirá|Frau Residence]] at Calle Reina number 107 is a magnificent example of the architecture of Ponce's [[aristocracy]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. "This structure is one of the remaining symbols of Ponce's "Golden Period" in which land-owning families lived in the urban core and great immigrations from Europe, Latin America and the other Antilles had turned the originally small settlement into the cultural capital of Puerto Rico. The "Criollo Ponceno" or Ponce Creole architecture to which this building belongs is extremely important in itself since it represents the birth of a high-style native architecture, a hybrid of influences rather than the purely Spanish, or spontaneous vernacular expressions of previous centuries. In particular, the Frau Residence is significant within this genre as it was designed by one of Ponce's most well-known architects, Blas Silva. Silva was particularly well known among the wealthy classes of the period. His buildings can usually be characterized by what is popularly referred to as ''wedding-cake architecture'' of the landed nouyeau riche, for the richness of ornament and detail. Other buildings by Silva include the Monsanto Residence and the Salazar-Candal Residence, both listed in the NRHP."&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Felix Juan del Campo, State Historian; and Hector F. Santiago, State Architectural Historian, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) August, 1987.  In ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form''. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.) Page 3. Listing Reference Number 87001826: Residencia Subira (a.k.a. Residencia Frau). 28 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isabel 53===
[[File:IMG 2901 - Salazar-Candal Residence in Barrio Tercero in Ponce, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Casa Salazar-Candal|Salazar-Candal Residence]] (by Blas Silva) at Calle Isabel 53]]
The [[Casa Salazar-Candal|Salazar-Candal Residence]] located at Calle Isabel 53, but today occupied by the [[Museo de la Historia de Ponce]] is one of a group of stylistically eclectic houses built in Ponce between 1900 and 1915. Designed by architect Blas C. Silva in 1911, the building reflects an emerging tendency to incorporate freely disparate and competing architectural motifs. The facade is distinctly rendered in [[rococo]] and [[Moorish]] detailing to emphasize its bi-functional character as a home and an office respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Felix Juan del Campo, State Historian; and Roberto Sackett, State Architectural Historian, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) 11 April 1988.  In ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form''. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.) Page 3. Listing Reference Number 88000663: Residencia Salazar-Candal. 9 June 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marina 27===
The "fin de siecle" detailing and wall paintings present a material document of the 19th-century European immigration to Puerto Rico and the way of life of the landed bourgeois Criollo (Creole) class. In the architecture of Ponce of the period, elements of the Puerto Rican folk dwelling are integrated to Spanish and French-influenced classical detailing, thus resulting in a Ponce-Creole Architecture, of which the [[Zaldo de Nebot Residence]] at Calle Marina #27 is a prime example.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Felix Juan del Campo, State Historian; and Hector F. Santiago, State Architectural Historian, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) 8 April 1988.  In ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form''. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.)

'''Predrag Dragić Kijuk''', ([[Serbian Cyrillic]] '''Предраг Р. Драгић Кијук''') (1945 in [[Kragujevac]] – 29 January 2012) was a humanist, writer, essayist, anthologist, playwright, literary and art critic, lexicographer, medievalist, historian, translator, liberal philosopher and researcher of Dostoevsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=З. Р.|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Kultura/Preminuo-Predrag-R-Dragic-Kijuk.sr.html|title=Култура : Преминуо Предраг Р. Драгић Кијук: ПОЛИТИКА|publisher=Politika.rs|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated at the [[Belgrade University]]: [[philology]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]], and took specializations in Italy, Greece, Russia, France and Norway.

Dragić Kijuk was editor of the prestigious publications of the Association of Writers of Serbia for years (operational editor of the ''Serbian Literary Magazine'' and the editor in chief of the ''Literary Newspaper''). He authored many books, studies, and essays, five of which have been translated into foreign languages. He specifically studied old [[Serbian literature]] (in 1987 he published the provocative and voluminous study ''Medieval and Renaissance Serbian Poetry 1200-1700''). His themes of interest are diverse and original, and his intellectual curiosity is a mixture of modern world poetry, philosophy of numbers, Christian esthetics, the works of [[Dostoevsky]], [[Gogol]] and [[Andreyev]], the history of [[Culture of Europe|European civilization]], European esoteric writers, [[protohistory]] of [[Serbs]] and [[Slavs]], the phenomenon of migrations and the Christian-Orthodox mysticism. Also, he has devoted his attention in his two latest books to the aberration of modern politics and the influence of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on the destiny of the Serbian people (''Bestiarium Humanum'', 2002; ''Atlantocracy As a Jesuit Ideal'', 2005).

His book ''Tempter and the Redeemer'' (1990) was the first to introduce the [[theism|theistic]] [[Scientific method|method]] into the genre of essay writing in [[Serbia]], equaling it to other methods in the interpretation of literature, while the book ''Going Out to Play'' (1990) has had cult influence on European [[personalism]]. In 2003, Sir [[John Tavener]], the most popular British composer reputed as a "classical artist" used texts from the book ''Medieval and Renaissance Serbian Poetry 1200-1700'' written by Predrag R. Dragić Kijuk, for his monumental work "The Veil of the Temple" (performed by four choirs, several orchestras and soloists, seven hours in duration).

[[File:Charlemagne-by-Durer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charlemagne]] holds a sword in his proper right hand, on the "viewer's left", and an [[Globus cruciger|orb]] in his proper left hand.]] 
[[File:Orestes (1848).jpg|thumb|Statue holding a sword in its proper right hand]]
'''Proper right''' and '''proper left''' are conceptual terms used to unambiguously convey [[relative direction]] when describing an image or other object. The "proper right" hand of a figure is the hand that would be regarded by that figure as its right hand.&lt;ref&gt;"For figurative works, use the abbreviations PR (proper right) and PL (proper left) to indicate the right or left side of the statue from the perspective of the statue (i.e., your right or left side if you were positioned on the base facing in the same direction as the statue)" - p. 34, [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/PDFS/SOSvolunteerHandboook.pdf Save Outdoor Sculpture! Volunteer Handbook]. ("Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!) is a joint project of the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, and the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Property").&lt;/ref&gt; In a frontal representation, that appears on the left as the viewer sees it, creating the potential for ambiguity if the hand is just described as the "right hand".

The terms are mainly used in discussing images of humans, whether in [[art history]], medical contexts such as [[x-ray]] images, or elsewhere, but they can be used in describing any object that has an unambiguous front and back (for example [[furniture]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gNN1vgkxzicC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22proper+right%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vw6iUuHRPKrm7Ab4moHYCA&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proper%20right%22&amp;f=false ''The Furniture of John Shearer, 1790-1820: 'A True North Britain' in the Southern Backcountry'']&lt;/ref&gt;) or,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RELAWM00539/ though see this somewhat puzzling example], which appears just to refer to the specific image, with the side shown the "front".&lt;/ref&gt; when describing things that move or change position, with reference to the original position. However a more restricted use may be preferred, and the internal instructions for cataloguing objects in the "Inventory of American Sculpture" at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] say that "The terms "proper right" and "proper left" should be used when describing figures only".&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/research/programs/inventory/report_form_guidelines.pdf Smithsonian American Art Museum], "Inventorying" section.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[heraldry]], right and left is always used in the meaning of proper right and proper left, as for the imaginary bearer of a coat of arms; to avoid confusion, the Latin terms [[dexter and sinister]] are often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bedingfeld|first1= Henry|author1-link= Henry Bedingfeld|last2= Gwynn-Jones|first2= Peter|author2-link= Peter Gwynn-Jones|page= 42|title= Heraldry|year= 1993|location= Leicester|publisher= Magna Books|isbn= 1-85422-433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative is to use language that makes it clear that the viewer's perspective is being used. The swords in the illustrations might be described as: "to the left as the viewer sees it", "at the view's left", "at the viewer's left", and so on.  However these formulations do not work for freestanding sculpture in the round, where the viewer might be at any position around the sculpture.  A British 19th-century manual for military drill contrasts "proper left" with "present left" when discussing the orientation of formations performing intricate movements on a parade ground, "proper" meaning the orientraion at the start of the drill.&lt;ref&gt;''Brigade drill, as established by order in the Field exercise and evolutions of infantry, as revised in 1859. With remarks and references, by W.N. Hutchinson'', 1860, War Office, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UU4BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22proper+right%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vw6iUuHRPKrm7Ab4moHYCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proper%20right%22&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms are analogous to the nautical [[port and starboard]], where "port" is to a watercraft as "proper left" is to a sculpture, and they are used for essentially the same reason. Their use obviates the need for potentially ambiguous language such as "my right," "your left," and so on, by expressing the direction in a manner that holds true regardless of the relative orientations of the object and observer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17900 The origins of 'port' and 'starboard'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025011852/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17900 |date=2007-10-25 }} at the UK [[National Maritime Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is [[stage right]] and left in the theatre, which uses the actor's orientation, "stage right" equating to the audience's "house left".

There was a certain amount of cultural contact between Europe in the [[Renaissance Europe|Renaissance]]  to [[Early Modern period]] and the [[Islamic world]] (at the time primarily represented by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and, geographically more remote, [[Safavid Persia]]), however decreasing in intensity  after [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|medieval cultural contact]] in the era of the [[crusades]] and the ''[[Reconquista]]''.

European contact with Islam has been mostly limited with the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|military effort]] opposing the [[expansion of the Ottoman Empire]].
There was limited direct interaction between the two cultures even though there was plenty of trade between Europe and the Middle East at this time.  Merchants would often deal through an intermediary,&lt;ref&gt;James Chamber, ''The Devil’s Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', (Edison: Castle Books, 2003), page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  a practice common since the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Historians have noted that even during the 12th and 14th centuries the two parties had little interest in learning about each other.&lt;ref&gt;Jane I. Smith. “Islam and Christendom,” in ''The Oxford History of Islam''. Edited by John L. Esposito. ''Oxford Islamic Studies Online''. http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article. (accessed January 29, 2008), page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the Ottoman Empire is intimately connected to the history of Renaissance and Early Modern Europe.
The European Renaissance was significantly triggered by the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 (resulting in a wave of Byzantine scholars fleeing to Italy). The Ottoman Empire reached its historical apogee in 1566, coinciding with the beginning of the [[scientific revolution]] in Europe, which would lead to the political dominance of  [[European miracle|emerging modern Europe]] over the course of the following century.

[[Granada]] was the last stronghold of the region of Spain known as [[Andalusia]], which was considered {{By whom|date=July 2010}} a pinnacle of culture in the western Muslim Empire.&lt;ref&gt;“Andalusia.” The Islamic World: Past and Present. Edited by John L.  Esposito. Oxford Islamic Studies Online, http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article (accessed February 2, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;   Trade from Granada included [[silk]], [[ceramic]], and [[porcelain]].  From 1230 until its fall to the Christians, the city was under the rule of the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] dynasty .&lt;ref&gt;“Granada.” The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. Edited by John L. Esposito. Oxford Islamic Studies Online, http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article (accessed February 2, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] had conquered all Andalusia by 1251.&lt;ref&gt;“Andalusia.”&lt;/ref&gt;   It was not until after the 1469 marriage between Prince [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] that [[Alhambra]], the Nasrid palace of Granada, fell to Spanish forces.&lt;ref&gt;David Nicole, El Cid and the Reconquista: 1050-1492, (Great Britain: Osprey Publishing Limited, 1988), page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alhambra fell to the combined forces of Isabella and Ferdinand on January 2, 1492.&lt;ref&gt;David Nicole, page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhambra was known {{By whom|date=July 2010}} as one of the greatest achievements of urban art in the Muslim world during the time of the Nasrids.&lt;ref&gt;“Granada.”&lt;/ref&gt;   The Court of the Myrtles and the Court of the Lions are the only two portions of the palace to survive to present time.&lt;ref&gt;“Alhambra.” The Oxford Dictionary of Islam.

The first English convert to Islam mentioned by name is [[John Nelson (convert)|John Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;[/religion/religions/islam/history/uk_1.shtml BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; 16th century writer [[Richard Hakluyt]] claimed he was forced to convert, though he mentions in the same story other Englishmen who had converted willingly.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

:This king had a son which was a ruler in an island called Gerbi, whereunto arrived an English ship called the Green Dragon, of the which was master one M. Blonket, who, having a very unhappy boy on that ship, and understanding that whosoever would turn Turk should be well entertained of the  a yeoman of our Queen's guard, whom the king's son had enforced to turn Turk; his name was John Nelson''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicaltextarchive.com/books.php?op=viewbook&amp;bookid=51&amp;cid=3 Voyager's Tales, 3, The voyage made to Tripolis in Barbary,1584], Richard Haklyut&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ward (pirate)|Captain John Ward]] of [[Kent]] was one of a number of British sailors who became pirates based in the [[Maghreb]] who also converted to Islam (see also [[Barbary pirates]]). Later, some [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] became interested in the faith, and [[Henry Stubbes]] wrote so favourably about Islam that it is thought he too had converted to the faith.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

From 1609 to 1616, [[England]] lost 466 ships to [[Barbary pirate]]s, who sold the passengers into [[Arab slave trade|slavery in North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Rees Davies, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml British Slaves on the Barbary Coast], [[BBC]], 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 1625, it was reported that [[Lundy]], an island in the [[Bristol Channel]] which had been a pirate lair for much of the previous half century, had been occupied by three [[Ottoman Navy#Admirals|Ottoman pirates]] who were threatening to burn [[Ilfracombe]]; Algerine rovers were using the island as a base in 1635, although the island had itself been attacked and plundered by a Spanish raid in 1633.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lundyisland.co.uk/history.htm History of Lundy]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1627, Barbary pirates under command of the Dutch renegade [[Jan Janszoon]] operating from the Moroccan port of [[Salé]] occupied Lundy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Piracy: the complete history | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USiyy1ZA-BsC&amp;pg=PA91 | accessdate=2011-04-15 | publisher=Osprey Publishing | isbn=978-1-84603-240-0 | last=Konstam |first=Angus | year=2008 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time there were reports of captured slaves being sent to [[Algiers]] and of the Islamic flag flying over Lundy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pirates who got away with it | work=Study of sails on pirate ships | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article1449736.ece | accessdate=2007-11-25 | location=London | first=Simon | last=de Bruxelles | date=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Europe: A History | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA561 | accessdate=2007-11-25 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-820171-7 | last=Davies |first=Norman | year=1996 |page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ottoman presence in the Balkans==
{{Main|Growth of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|Ottoman–Habsburg wars}}

The [[Ottoman Empire]] emerged in 1299 and lasted until 1919.  The Ottomans were strong proponents of [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Everett Jenkins, Jr., The Muslim Diaspora: a Comprehensive Reference to the Spread of Islam in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. (Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Company, Inc., 2000), 2:7.&lt;/ref&gt;    In the 13th century, the kingdom was only in a small portion of northwest [[Anatolia]] but by the 16th century, it expanded to the heartland of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and its capital, [[Constantinople]].  The height of the Ottoman Empire occurred under the sultans Selim the Grim, also known as [[Selim I]] (1512–1520) and [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] (1520–1566).  Under their reigns, the Turks conquered [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and the North coast of [[Africa]], the [[Red Sea]], the island of [[Rhodes]], and the [[Balkans]] all the way to the [[Great Hungarian Plain]].

Many members of Kosovo’s higher class, such as the [[Serbs]] and the [[Vlachs]], converted to Islam during the [[Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Dušan]] period (1331–1355).  A large part of the reason for the conversion was probably economic and social, as Muslims had considerably more rights and privileges than Christian subjects.  As a result, Kosovo’s three largest towns were majority Muslim by 1485, where Christians had once formed a dense population before the rise of the Ottoman Empire.  The movement was effective due to the wandering of [[Sufis]] who traveled around the region teaching religion as they went.  By the 16th century, towns like [[Prizren]], [[Skopje]], and [[Đakovica]] had established centers of learning that became crucial in inspiring and educating scholars who would then use their knowledge to benefit the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim world.  From this time onward, many books circulated in the region that had a [[Persian literature|Persian]] influence while written in the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] language and [[Arabic alphabet]]. The oldest genre in this style is known as ''[[Bejtexhinj]]i'' poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Isa Blumi. “Kosovo.” The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World. Edited by John L. Esposito. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article. (accessed January 29, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery==
{{further|Barbary pirates}}
Slavery at the time of the European Renaissance was a socio-economic factor especially around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] region.  It was accepted and approved for both Muslims and Christians.  Most slaves came from warfare, privateering, or the international slave trade.  Only some of the Arabian slaves in Europe were Muslims by origin.&lt;ref&gt;P.S.  Konningsveld, P.S., page15.&lt;/ref&gt;   
Many of the Muslim slaves were baptized before they were sold for the first time and then were given a new Christian name.  There were, however, some Muslims who were not baptized and who kept their original names, but if they had children the newborns were immediately baptized.  Most Muslim slaves converted to Christianity because there was hard social pressure at the time for them to convert.  They also improved their social position by converting to Christianity, such as they would rise from a slave to a serf.&lt;ref&gt;P.S. Konningsveld, page16.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a small percentage of learned Muslim captives who were among the intellectual elite in their original hometowns among the Muslim prisoners and slaves.  Captured Muslim scientists, physicians, and copyists were in high demand at slave markets.  Learned Muslim captives were held in high regard by the authorities and they were sold for very high prices.  They were wanted for the knowledge and advancements the Arabs had made over the Europeans.  Copyists of Arabic manuscripts were needed in Spain to translate Arabic texts for the practice of medicine, the study of Arabic philosophy, and because of the popular interest in Europe for the translations of Arabic scientific texts.  Learned Muslim captives played a very important role in the spread of Arabic science and philosophy over the Christian world.&lt;ref name="Konningsveldpage"&gt;P.S.  Konningsveld, page10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The liberation of Muslim slaves was a state affair and elevated the popular esteem of the sovereign government. Muslim slaves were either freed or exchanged through special legislation and international treaties.&lt;ref&gt;P.S. Konningsveld, page6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of learned Muslim captives===
[[Image:Sebastiano del Piombo Portrait of a Humanist.jpg|thumb|Portrait assumed to be of [[Leo Africanus]] (Sebastiano del Piombo, around 1520)]]
One account of a highly esteemed Muslim slave is of Moroccan geographer [[al-Hassan al-Wazzan al-Fasi]], who made important contributions to geography and Italian texts.  In 1519, al-Fasi was captured by a group of Sicilian pirates while he was on his way home from Egypt.  When he was picked up he had scholarly notes on him that he had made from his travels through Africa.  The pirates soon realized his value and they gave him to [[Pope Leo X]] in Rome. Al-Fasi was baptized on June 6, 1520, and renamed Joannis Leo, but he became known as Leo the African or Leo Africanus.  Leo Africanus learned Italian, taught in Barcelona, and made Arabic notes in a book called Description of Africa, which was used for many years as an important source of geographic information on Muslim Africa.&lt;ref name="Konningsveldpage" /&gt;

===Barbary pirates===
{{Main|Barbary pirate|Anglo-Turkish piracy}}

The [[Barbary coast|Barbary States]], who were allies of the Ottoman Empire, sent [[Barbary pirate]]s to raid parts of [[Western Europe]] in order to capture Christian [[slavery|slaves]] to sell at [[Arab slave trade|slave markets]] in the [[Arab World]] throughout the Renaissance period.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_02.shtml |title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_2_urbanities-thomas_jefferson.html |title=Jefferson Versus the Muslim Pirates by Christopher Hitchens, City Journal Spring 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaneous accounts suggest that a population of about 35,000 European slaves was maintained on the Barbary Coast. One writer estimates, on the basis that about 8,500 fresh slaves per annum would be required to maintain such a population, that as many as 1.25 million Europeans may have been taken in the 250 years to 1780, though there are no records to confirm such numbers.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; The slaves were captured mainly from seaside villages in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and from farther places like [[France]] or [[England]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Ireland]] and even [[Turkish Abductions|Iceland]] and [[North America]], ultimately provoking the [[First Barbary War]] of the newly-formed [[United States]].

==Early Modern Orientalism==
{{further|Orientalism in early modern France}}
Following the first wave of Arabic interest during the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], which saw numerous Arabic texts being [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]], there was a 'second wave' of interest in the study of [[Arabic literature]], [[Science in medieval Islam|Arabic science]] and [[Islamic philosophy]] in 16th-century France and 17th-century England.

[[File:Arabic astronomical manuscript of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi annotated by Guillaume Postel.jpg|thumb|left|Arabic [[astronomical]] manuscript of [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], annotated by [[Guillaume Postel]].]]
Together with the development of the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]], cultural and scientific exchanges between France and the Ottoman Empire flourished. French scholars such as [[Guillaume Postel]] or [[Pierre Belon]] were able to travel to [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Middle East]] to collect information.&lt;ref name="Ecouen Museum exhibit"&gt;Ecouen Museum exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottoman Empire Coran copied circa 1536 bounded circa 1549 with arms of Henri II according to regulations set under Francis I.jpg|thumb|Ottoman Empire [[Qur'an|Coran]], copied circa 1536, bound according to regulations set under Francis I circa 1549, with arms of [[Henri II of France|Henri II]]. [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]].]]
Scientific exchange is thought to have occurred, as numerous works in Arabic, especially pertaining to [[astronomy]] were brought back, annotated and studied by scolars such as Guillaume Postel. Transmission of scientific knowledge, such as the [[Tusi-couple]], may have occurred on such occasions, at the time when [[Copernicus]] was establishing his own astronomical theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~gas1/project/visions/case1/sci.4.html ''Whose Science is Arabic Science in Renaissance Europe?'' by George Saliba Columbia University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Books, such as the [[Qur'an|Coran]], were brought back to be integrated in Royal libraries, such as the ''Bibliothèque Royale de Fontainebleau'', to create a foundation for the ''Collège des lecteurs royaux'', future [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref name="Ecouen Museum exhibit"/&gt; French novels and tragedies were written with the Ottoman Empire as a theme or background.&lt;ref name="Ecouen Museum exhibit"/&gt; In 1561, [[Gabriel Bounin]] published ''La Soltane'', a [[tragedy]] highlighting the role of [[Roxelane]] in the 1553 execution of [[Şehzade Mustafa|Mustapha]], the elder son of [[Suleiman]].&lt;ref name="Ecouen Museum exhibit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;[[Arthur Augustus Tilley]], ''The Literature of the French Renaissance'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=UEzBBwwzjXkC&amp;pg=PA87 p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; This tragedy marks the first time the Ottomans were introduced on stage in France.&lt;ref&gt;''The Penny cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'' p.418 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7KsrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA418]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic manuscripts were considered the key to a 'treasure house' of ancient knowledge, which led to the founding of [[Laudian Professor of Arabic|Arabic Chairs]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge Universities]], where [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was taught. A large collection of Arabic manuscripts were acquired, collected in places such as the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford. These Arabic manuscripts were sought after by [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] for their research in subjects [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|such as mathematics]] and [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|observational astronomy]], and also encompassed subjects ranging from science, religion, [[Medicine in medieval Islam|and medicine]], to typography and [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|garden plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 'Arabick' interest of the natural philosophers in seventeenth-century England|author=G.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides scientific and philosophical literature, works of Arabic fiction were also translated into [[Latin]] and [[English language|English]] during the 17th and 18th centuries. The most famous one was the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), which was first translated into English in 1706 and has since then had a profound influence on [[English literature]]. Another famous work was [[Ibn Tufail]]'s [[philosophical novel]]&lt;ref name="Jon"&gt;Jon Mcginnis, ''Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources'', p. 284, [[Hackett Publishing Company]], {{ISBN|0-87220-871-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Attar"&gt;[[Samar Attar]], ''The Vital Roots of European Enlightenment: Ibn Tufayl's Influence on Modern Western Thought'', Lexington Books, {{ISBN|0-7391-1989-3}}.[http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/id/The_Vital_Roots_of_European_Enlightenment/9780739119891]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'', which was translated into Latin as ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671 and then into English by [[Simon Ockley]] in 1708.

The Muslim [[Moors]] had a noticeable influence on the works of [[George Peele]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. Some of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele's ''[[The Battle of Alcazar]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'', which featured a Moorish [[Othello (character)|Othello]] as its title character.

At the Bodleian Library of Oxford University, there were hundreds of Arabic manuscripts, as well as dozens of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ones, available during the 17th century. These included works on [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Arabic grammar]]; the [[lexicography]] of [[Al-Firuzabadi]] and [[Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari|Al-Jawhari]]; works on [[Arabic poetry]]; the [[Indian literature|Indian literary]] work ''[[Panchatantra|Kalila and Dimna]]''; the proverbs of [[Al-Maydani]] and ''[[Maqama]]'' of [[Al-Hariri of Basra]]; the medical works of [[Al-Razi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ibn al-Baitar]], [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]], [[Al-Majusi]], [[Ibn al-Jazzar]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]], [[Ibn Zuhr]], [[Maimonides]] and [[Ibn al-Nafis]]; the astronomical works of [[Ibn al-Banna al-Marrakushi|Ibn al-Banna]], [[Ibn al-Shatir]], [[Al-Farghani]] and [[Alhazen]]; the ''Masudic Canon'' by [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] and the ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]'' by [[Al-Sufi]]; several [[Science and technology in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman scientific]] works by [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf]]; occult and [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|alchemical works]]; the ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]''; Al-Safadi's [[biographical dictionary]] ''Al-Sihah''; the [[Muslim historians|historical works]] of [[Al-Tabari]], [[Al-Isfahani]], [[Al-Makin]], [[Ibn Khallikan]], [[Al-Dhahabi]], [[Al-Waqidi]], Ibn al-Shina, [[Al-Utbi]], [[Ibn al-Jawzi]], [[Ibn al-Athir]], [[Sibt ibn al-Jawzi]], [[Ibn Abi Usaibia]], [[Bar-Hebraeus]], Al-Tunaynai, Ibn Duqmaq, [[Ibn Taghribirdi]], [[Al-Suyuti]], [[Al-Jannabi]], [[Ibn Hayyan]], [[Ibn Miskawayh]], [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] and [[Al-Maqrizi]]; the ''History of Time'' by [[Al-Masudi]] and volume five of [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s [[Sociology in medieval Islam|historiographical work]] ''Kitab al-Ibar''; the historical and geographical works of [[Abu al-Fida]]; the ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' and [[Tafsir|Qur'anic commentaries]]; the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Algebra]]'' by [[Al-Khwarizmi]] and the mathematical works of [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]]; the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'' and Avienna's ''[[The Book of Healing]]''; the works of [[Ibn Bajjah]] and Ibn Tufail; [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|geographical works]] of [[Ibn Khordadbeh]] and [[Ibn Hawqal]]; .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 'Arabick' interest of the natural philosophers in seventeenth-century England|author=G.

===The turban in art and politics===
[[File:Suleiman in Veronese The Wedding at Cana 1563.jpg|thumb|[[Suleiman the Magnificent]] appears at the table in the 1563 ''[[The Wedding at Cana]]'' by [[Paolo Veronese]].]]
The [[turban]] often represented Muslims in the paintings of Italian and Flemish artists when they depicted scenes of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Biblical lore.  Famous figures such as [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] appear in these paintings.  The tradition of depicting Biblical characters in turbans has continued through to this century, as at least one of the wise men is always depicted with a turban.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil I. Matar, “Renaissance England and the Turban,” Images of the Other: Europe and the Muslim World Before 1700  Ed. David Blanks, (Cairo: Cairo Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Turban iconography was highly prominent, especially in Renaissance England.  While friendly relations were formed between England and the Islamic civilization of the Middle East in the early 16th century, Turkish fashions became popular for the higher classes.  During times of interaction with [[Istanbul]], Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] wore Turkish clothing styles. It was believed that she favored working with the Islamic sultans of Istanbul rather than the Roman Catholic leaders of Europe.  These suspicions were heightened when she asked Sultan [[Murad III]] and his son [[Mehmed III|Mohammad III]] for military assistance.  Although she never did receive any assistance from the sultans, her relations with the Sultan and his son did not waver.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil I. Matar, “Renaissance England and the Turban.”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Muslim women===
[[Alexander Ross (writer)|Alexander Ross]], a writer and controversialist living in the first half of the 17th century, praised the Turks for being “more modest in their conversation generally than we; Men and Women converse not together promiscuously, as among us.”&lt;ref name="Nabil Matar page 51"&gt;Nabil Matar, “The Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,” page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ross believed that England could learn a great deal from the Muslims.&lt;ref name="Nabil Matar page 51"/&gt;   
During the Renaissance, English women disrespected their husbands because they were free to do what they wanted, which society believed led to a moral deterioration.{{dubious|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Nabil Matar, “The Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,” page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;   European women also began leaving home to become male-like figures in society.  Other European women attacked male chauvinism and defended the status of women by handing out pamphlets.  Women rebelled against male religious hierarchy and began to replace men as preachers and pastors.&lt;ref name="Nabil Matar page 61"&gt;Nabil Matar, “The Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,” page 61.&lt;/ref&gt;   Christian writers highly admired Muslim women because they were frugal compared to English women, they were respected by their husbands because they did not play “false” with them, and because Muslim women went immediately back to work after giving birth and they still had time to raise their children themselves, unlike English women.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil  Matar, “The Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,”  page 53 and 54.&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=July 2017}}

The Muslim model became an example of the “exotic” and “[[Utopian]]” ideal because it was not possible in European society.&lt;ref name="Nabil Matar page 60"&gt;Nabil Matar, “The Representation of Muslim Women in Renaissance England,” page 60.{{unreliable source?|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--is this even about the Renaissance? The 17th century is NOT part of the Renaissance--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;   European men sought to reinforce the traditional role of women and wanted their women to adhere to the model of Muslim women as frugal, obedient, wearing modest apparel, and respectful towards their husbands. Muslims and Englishmen differed in various ways, especially in their religious beliefs and militarism, but they did agree with each other on the representation of Muslim women.&lt;ref name="Nabil Matar page 61"/&gt;

He is the founder of the Red McCombs Automotive Group in [[San Antonio, Texas]], a co-founder of [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]], chairman of [[Constellis Group]], a former owner of the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[San Antonio Force]], [[Denver Nuggets]], the [[Minnesota Vikings]], and the namesake of the [[McCombs School of Business]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. He is on the [[Forbes 400]] list of richest Americans. He is also known for his [[philanthropy]].

In 2012, the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' reported McCombs' net worth at $1.4 billion. He was ranked the 913th richest man in the world. Two other San Antonio men at the time, [[Charles Butt]] of the [[H-E-B]] supermarket chain and [[Rodney Lewis]], a [[natural gas]] driller, finished above McCombs on the list.&lt;ref&gt;"Six Antonio billionaires make Forbes list", ''San Antonio Express-News'', March 18, 2012, "Glance" section,  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Forbes magazine|Forbes]]'' placed the value of McCombs' fortune at $1.6 billion with a ranking of No. 1,290 on a list of the world's billionaires.&lt;ref name=pdanner/&gt;

==Biography==
McCombs was born in [[rural]] [[Spur, Texas|Spur]] in [[Dickens County, Texas|Dickens County]] in [[West Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/news/mccombs/about/bio.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204211308/http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/news/mccombs/about/bio.asp |date=December 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His nickname "Red" comes from his hair color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsidesa.com/business/index.php?id=83&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view NSIDE Business]. Nside Sa. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a mechanic who earned $25 per week but [[tithe]]d through the First [[Southern Baptist|Baptist Church]] of Spur each week. McCombs recalled having seen his parents "share with those who had less, and the joy of giving never ceased to amaze me."&lt;ref name=donations&gt;John Tedesco, "McCombs makes a lot and donates a lot", ''San Antonio Express-News'', November 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, McCombs and his fellow salesman, Austin Hemphill, moved to San Antonio to create Hemphill-McCombs Ford, which was the foundation for what ultimately became the [http://redmccombs.com/ Red McCombs Automotive Group]. McCombs has served as chairman of the trustees at Southwestern University and chairman of the University of Texas's [[M. D. Anderson Cancer Center]] in Houston. His particular interest in M. D. Anderson was accentuated in 1986, when he visited a dying friend undergoing treatment there. He expressed how he was overcome by the kindness of every employee he met at the hospital. The workers, he found, had been trained to offer compassion and solace to all who come through the doors. He joined the Anderson board and in 2005 donated $30 million to the hospital.&lt;ref name=donations/&gt; The business school at the University of Texas was renamed the [[Red McCombs School of Business]] in recognition of his $50 million donation to the institution. The $50 million actually yielded $100 million in matching funds for new faculty positions, fellowships, and scholarships.&lt;ref name=donations/&gt;

He is the board chairman of [[Academi]].&lt;ref name="boardofdirectors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academi.com/pages/about-us/board-of-directors|title=Academi - About Us - Board of Directors|publisher=|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCombs is a member of the Alamo Endowment Board, which raises funds for the preservation and management of the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo Mission]] in downtown San Antonio. With the state purchasing three historic buildings in Alamo Plaza, McCombs said in October 2015 that he envisions an expansion program consistent with the reality of the Alamo story to enhance the overall experience of future visitors to the historic site.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Huddleston and Benjamin Olivo, "Next chapter in Alamo history now is waiting to be written: What buildings' purchase by state means still is to be seen", ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', October 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

McCombs is a reformed [[alcoholic]], who could "handle his social drinking" until the age of forty-eight, when overcome with convulsions he went into a five-day [[coma]] at a medical facility in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. McCombs said in a [[Christmas]] 2016 interview, "[[God]] was good to me and for whatever reason wanted me to live, because I was really dead when I left in 1975 to go to Houston on that medical plane. They told Charline, 'Go ahead and start making arrangements because we are losing him.'"&lt;ref name=torsborn/&gt; McCombs said that he recovered and never again had a desire for alcohol.&lt;ref name=torsborn/&gt; The McCombs Foundation has donated more than $118 million to charity. It is operated by his daughters who work to keep overhead at a minimum. The foundation makes small donations too, such as $1,000 to [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]], which are rarely publicized. McCombs said that he is a large donor to charitable causes because "it makes me feel so good about doing it."&lt;ref name=donations/&gt;

In 2017, McCombs filed a $1 million [[civil suit]] against seven of his former executives whom he alleged took "trade secrets" from McCombs' company to begin a competing firm in Houston, F4 Resources. Defendants in the suit include William "Bill" Forney, Jr., who worked with McCombs for forty-four years, former chief financial officer Ricky Halkin, vice president of operations Larry Wyont, vice president of land Charles Forney, and the vice president of geology, Philip Forney. McCombs had established McCombs Energy in Houston in 1998 by merging his 50 percent interest in his partnership with William Forney with other assets purchased from Forney. McCombs claims that his former associates, however, lowered the proper payout that he was due from his investments. McCombs said that the former executives shattered personal relationships of some four decades.&lt;ref name=pdanner&gt;Patrick Danner, "McCombs sues ex-executives: Suit claims taking of trade secrets, greed", ''San Antonio Express-News'', April 1, 2017, pp. B5-B6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports ownership==
McCombs attributes construction of the [[HemisFair Arena]] as the essential development to the success of the Spurs. He contacted [[Lee Iacocca]], then president of the [[Ford Motor Company]], to seek funding for the arena to correspond with the [[1968 World's Fair]]. At first, Iacocca offered only $250,000 for the purchase of an art object, and he scolded McCombs and ridiculed San Antonio as "that little old dusty ass town of yours down there [with] no political or economic significance to the Ford Motor Company."&lt;ref name=torsborn&gt;Tom Orsborn, "There from Day One: McCombs recalls role as Spurs' founder", ''San Antonio Express-News'', December 25, 2016, pp. SP10-SP12&lt;/ref&gt; McCombs persisted and asked [[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to contact [[Henry Ford, II]], and in a continued heated exchange even told Iacocca that Ford needed to improve the quality of its 1968 vehicles. McCombs located other investors, and the Dallas Chaparrals came to San Antonio five years later in 1973. McCombs realized the importance of [[television]] to sports events and saw the opportunity to bring San Antonio to a national stage. Under the McCombs administration the Spurs had their first superstar in [[George Gervin]], called "The Iceman", who was recruited from the [[Virginia Squires]].&lt;ref name=torsborn/&gt;

Two years after taking the Spurs into the NBA, McCombs sold off his stake in the Spurs and bought another former ABA team, the [[Denver Nuggets]].  He held onto the team until 1985, when he sold it to [[Sidney Shlenker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/05/30/Houston-businessman-Sidney-Shlenker-who-purchased-the-Denver-Nuggets/1402486273600/|title=Houston businessman Sidney Shlenker, who purchased the Denver Nuggets...|publisher=|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, McCombs bought the [[Minnesota Vikings]] for US$250 million.  After an unsuccessful attempt to replace the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], McCombs sold the team to new (and current) owner [[Zygi Wilf]] before the [[2005 NFL season|2005 football season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/writers/michael_silver/10/27/vikings.mccombs/ | work=CNN | date=2004-10-27 | accessdate=2010-05-22 | title=L.A. story}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCombs was also actively involved in [[thoroughbred]] racing and breeding for many years as a major partner in Walmac Farm, a leading American breeding farm, in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/25/sports/horse-racing-risen-star-likely-to-retire-after-88.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=HORSE RACING; Risen Star Likely To Retire After '88 | date=1988-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
McCombs owns a piece of property surrounded by National Forest near [[Wolf Creek ski area]], a resort in southern [[Colorado]] owned by the Pitcher family.  McCombs has long wanted to develop a resort community on his property, a plan that has drawn opposition and lawsuits from environmentalists and surrounding communities. McCombs has been unsuccessful in his attempts to convince the court to remove a key roadblock preventing his proposed development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_8324523?source=rss | work=Denver Post | first=Judith | last=Kohler | title=Forest Service calls Wolf Creek deal a 'fresh start' | date=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McCombs then attempted to build a {{convert|50000|acre|km2|adj=on}} casino resort at Navajo Canyon on [[Lake Powell]]. The local [[Navajo Nation]] chapters, local government officials, all unanimously rejected the casino proposal and any projects by Red McCombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallupindependent.com/2009/01January/012909exoticlivestock.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203101423/http://www.gallupindependent.com/2009/01January/012909exoticlivestock.html |date=February 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, McCombs was found by the [[United States Supreme Court]] to have engaged in a sham tax avoidance transaction and was therefore liable for a valuation misstatement penalty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-562_k5fl.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tax-mccombs-idUSL2N0JI0ZP20131203|title=US Supreme Court rules Texas billionaire owes tax shelter penalty|date=December 3, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=January 14, 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCombs severely criticized the 2014 [[University of Texas]] hire of [[Charlie Strong]] as football coach.  He described Strong as "great position coach ... not on a par with other candidates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/24401499/texas-booster-calls-charlie-strong-hire-a-kick-in-the-face A kick in the face]  www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football, 2014-01-07&lt;/ref&gt;  Three days later he apologized, and pledged "total support" for Strong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/24404609/texas-booster-red-mccombs-apologizes-for-comments-on-strong-hire "Total Support"] www.cbssports.com/collegefootball, 2014-01-10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sentimentality''' originally indicated the reliance on feelings as a guide to truth, but current usage defines it as an appeal to shallow, uncomplicated emotions at the expense of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Serafin and Bendixen, p. 1014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moral sense theory|Sentimentalism in philosophy]] is a view in [[meta-ethics]] according to which morality is somehow grounded in moral sentiments or emotions. [[Sentimentalism (literature)|Sentimentalism in literature]] is both a device used to induce a tender emotional response disproportionate to the situation at hand,&lt;ref&gt;[[I. A. Richards]] gave just such a quantitative definition: "a response is sentimental if it is too great for the occasion." He added, "We cannot, obviously judge that any response is sentimental in this sense unless we take careful account of the situation" (Richards, p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt; (and thus to substitute heightened and generally uncritical feeling for normal ethical and intellectual judgments), and a heightened reader response willing to invest previously prepared emotions to respond disproportionately to a literary situation.&lt;ref&gt;This was essentially the defining criterion of "sentimental" discovered in a dozen basic handbooks by Wilkie (p. 564f); Wilkie appends some textbook definitions.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A sentimentalist", [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote, "is one who desires to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it."&lt;ref&gt;Wilde 1905&lt;/ref&gt; In James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Stephen Dedalus sends Buck Mulligan a telegram that reads "The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done." &lt;ref&gt;Jay Michael Dickson, "Defining the Sentamentalist in ''Ulysses''," ''James Joyce Quarterly'', Volume 44, Number 1, Fall 2006, pp. 19-37&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Baldwin]] considered that "Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion, is the mark of dishonesty, the inability to feel...the mask of cruelty".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Berlant, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[This Side of Paradise]] by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] contrasts sentimentalists and romantics with Amory Blaine telling Rosalind, “I'm not sentimental--I'm as romantic as you are. The idea, you know, is that the sentimental person thinks things will last--the romantic person has a desperate confidence that they won't.” &lt;ref&gt;F. Scott Fitzgerald, ''This Side of Paradise'', Book Two, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th-century origins==

In the mid-18th century, a querulous lady had complained to [[Samuel Richardson|Richardson]]: "What, in your opinion, is the meaning of the word ''sentimental'', so much in vogue among the polite...Everything clever and agreeable is comprehended in that word...such a one is a ''sentimental'' man; we were a ''sentimental'' party".&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; What she was observing was the way the term was becoming a European obsession&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; - part of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] drive to foster the individual's capacity to recognise virtue at a visceral level.&lt;ref&gt;Berlant, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Everywhere in the sentimental novel or the sentimental comedy, "lively and effusive emotion is celebrated as evidence of a good heart".&lt;ref name="Ousby, p. 845"&gt;Ousby, p. 845&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosophers saw sentimentality as a cure for social isolation;&lt;ref&gt;Wheen p. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adam Smith]] indeed considered that "the poets and romance writers, who best paint...domestic affections, [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Voltaire]]; Richardson, [[Marivaux|Maurivaux]] and [[Marie Jeanne Riccoboni|Riccoboni]]; are, in such cases, much better instructors than [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nicholas Phillipson, ''Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life'' (2011) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoics.

By the close of the century, however, a reaction had occurred against what had come to be considered sentimental excess, by then (and perhaps still now) seen{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} as false and self-indulgent - especially after [[Schiller]]'s 1795 division of poets into two classes, the "naive" and the "sentimental" - and regarded respectively as natural and as artificial.&lt;ref name="Ousby, p. 845"/&gt;

==Modern times==

In modern times&lt;ref&gt;''Sentimental'' began to accrue negative connotations in the 19th century. Before that it had been an adjective denoting "feeling", as in ''[[The Man of Feeling]]'' (1771), [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy'' and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]]'s ''[[Sentimental Education]]'' (1869).&lt;/ref&gt; "sentimental" is a [[pejorative]] term that has been casually applied to works of art and literature that exceed the viewer or reader's sense of [[decorum]]—the extent of permissible emotion—and standards of [[taste]]: "excessiveness" is the criterion;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie took the example of [[Henry Clay Work]]'s maudlin lyric of [[Temperance movement|Temperance propaganda]], "Come Home, Father".&lt;/ref&gt; "Meretricious" and "contrived" sham [[pathos]] are the hallmark of sentimentality, where the morality that underlies the work is both intrusive and pat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

'Sentimentality often involves situations which evoke very intense feelings: love affairs, childbirth, death', but where the feelings are expressed with 'reduced intensity and duration of emotional experience...diluted to a safe strength by [[idealisation]] and simplification'.&lt;ref&gt;G. Cupchik and Laszlo, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, as a social force sentimentality is a hardy perennial, appearing for example as 'Romantic sentimentality...in the 1960s slogans "flower power" and "make love not war"'.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Mullen, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s public outpouring of grief at the [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales#Funeral|death of Diana]], 'when they go on about fake sentimentality in relation to Princess Diana',&lt;ref&gt;Tony Blair, as quoted in Wheen, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; also raised issues about the 'powerful streak of sentimentality in the British character' - the extent to which 'sentimentality was a grand old national tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baudrillard]] has [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynically]] attacked the sentimentality of Western [[humanitarianism]], suggesting that 'in the New Sentimental Order, the affluent become consumers of the "ever more delightful spectacle of poverty and catastrophe, and of the moving spectacle of our own attempts to alleviate it"'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey and Wilkin, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the issue of what has been called 'indecent sentimentality...[in] [[pornographic]]al pseudo-classics', so that one might say for example that ' ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' is a ''very'' sentimental novel, a faked Eden'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Robinson, as quoted in Anderson and Mullen, p. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in [[sociology]] it is possible to see the "sentimental tradition" as extending into the present-day - to see, for example, '[[Talcott Parsons|Parsons]] as one of the great social philosophers in the sentimental tradition of [[Adam Smith]], [[Edmund Burke|Burke]], [[McLuhan]], and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]...concerned with the relation between the rational and sentimental bases of social order raised by the market reorientation of motivation'.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Fukuyama]] takes up the theme through the exploration of 'society's stock of shared values as ''[[social capital]]'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 'subjective confession' of 1932, 'Ulysses: a Monologue', the analytic psychologist Carl Jung anticipates Baudrillard when he writes: 'Think of the lamentable role of popular sentiment in wartime! Think of our so-called humanitarianism! The psychiatrist knows only too well how each of us becomes the helpless but not pitiable victim of his own sentiments. Sentimentality is the superstructure erected upon brutality. Unfeelingness is the counter-position and inevitably suffers from the same defects.' [Carl Jung: The Spirit in Man, Art and Literature, London: Routledge, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;143]

==Dissensions==

Complications enter into the ordinary view of sentimentality, however, when changes in fashion and setting— the "climate of thought"&lt;ref name="Wilkie 1967:569"&gt;Wilkie 1967:569.&lt;/ref&gt;—intrude between the work and the reader. The view that sentimentality is relative is inherent in [[John Ciardi]]'s "sympathetic contract", in which the reader agrees to join with the writer when approaching a poem.&lt;ref&gt;Ciardi, p. 846f.&lt;/ref&gt; The example of the death of Little Nell in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' (1840–41), "a scene that for many readers today might represent a defining instance of sentimentality",&lt;ref name="Wilkie 1967:569"/&gt; brought tears to the eye of many highly critical readers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, I, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The reader of Dickens, [[Richard Holt Hutton]] observed, "has the painful impression of pathos feasting upon itself."&lt;ref&gt;LeRoy, "Richard Holt Hutton" p. 831.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Recent [[feminist theory]] has clarified the use of the term as it applies to the genre' of the sentimental novel, stressing the way that 'different cultural assumptions arising from the oppression of women gave liberating significance to the works' piety and mythical power to the ideals of the heroines'.&lt;ref&gt;Serafin and Bendixen, p. 1014.&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Sentimental fallacy&lt;!--'Sentimental fallacy' redirects here--&gt;==

The '''sentimental fallacy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is an ancient [[rhetoric]]al device that attributes human emotions, such as grief or anger, to the forces of nature{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. This is also known as the [[pathetic fallacy]], 'a term coined by [[John Ruskin]]...for the practice of attributing human emotions to the inanimate or unintelligent world'&lt;ref&gt;Ousby, p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt; - as in 'the sentimental poetic trope of the "pathetic fallacy", beloved of [[Theocritus]], [[Virgil]] and their successors'&lt;ref&gt;Fitter, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[pastoral]] tradition.

The term is also used more indiscriminately to discredit any argument as being based on a misweighting of emotion: 'sentimental fallacies...that men, that we, are better - nobler - than we know ourselves to be';&lt;ref&gt;Stott, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; 'the "sentimental fallacy" of constructing novels or plays "out of purely emotional patterns"'.&lt;ref&gt;David Daiches, in Booth, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the People's Republic of China}}
The '''Sino-Vietnamese War''' ({{lang-vi|Chiến tranh biên giới Việt-Trung}}; {{zh|s=中越战争|t=中越戰爭|p=Zhōng-Yuè Zhànzhēng}}), also known as the '''[[Third Indochina War]]''', was a brief border war fought between the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] in early 1979. China launched an offensive in response to Vietnam's [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|invasion and occupation of Cambodia]] in 1978 (which ended the rule of the Chinese-backed [[Khmer Rouge]]).

Chinese forces entered northern Vietnam and captured several cities near the border. On March 6, 1979, China declared that the gate to [[Hanoi]] was open and that their punitive mission had been achieved. Chinese troops then withdrew from Vietnam. Both China and Vietnam claimed victory in the last of the [[Indochina Wars]]. As Vietnamese troops remained in Cambodia until 1989, one can say that China remained unsuccessful in its goal of dissuading Vietnam from involvement in Cambodia. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Sino-Vietnamese border was finalized.

Although unable to deter Vietnam from Cambodia, China succeeded in demonstrating that its [[Cold War]] communist adversary, the [[Soviet Union]], was unable to protect its Vietnamese ally.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;

Following worsening relations between the Soviet Union and China as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of 1956-1966, as many as 1.5 million Chinese troops were stationed along the Sino-Soviet border{{when?|date=May 2018}} in preparation for a full-scale war against the Soviets.

The Sino-Vietnamese War ({{lang-vi|Chiến tranh biên giới Việt-Trung}}) is also known as the Third Indochina War, in order to distinguish it from the [[First Indochina War]], and the [[Vietnam War]], also known as the Second Indochina War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Military Strategy in the Third Indochina War: The Last Maoist War|publisher=[[Routledge]]|first=Edward|last=O'dowd|page=4|isbn=9780415414272 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vietnam, the conflict is known as the ''War against Chinese expansionism''.

==Background==
Just as the First Indochina War&amp;mdash;which emerged from the complex situation following World War II&amp;mdash;and the Vietnam War both exploded from the unresolved aftermath of political relations, the Third Indochina War again followed the unresolved problems of the earlier wars.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, R.D. and Leitenberg, M. (1984). ''The Wars in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, 1945–1982:  A Bibliographic Guide''. Santa Barbara:  ABC-Clio Information Services, p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major [[Allies of World War II|allied victors of World War II]], the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, all agreed that the area belonged to the French.&lt;ref name = "Neale 2001 20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Neale|2001|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the French did not have the means to immediately retake Indochina, the major powers agreed that the British would take control and troops would occupy the south while [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Chinese]] forces would move in from the north.&lt;ref name = "Neale 2001 20"/&gt; Nationalist Chinese troops entered the country to disarm Japanese troops north of the 16th parallel on 14 September 1945. The parallel divided Indochina into Chinese and British controlled zones (See [[Timeline of World War II (1945)]].).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willbanks|2009|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British landed in the south rearming the small body of interned French forces as well as parts of the surrendered Japanese forces to aid in retaking southern Vietnam, as there were not enough British troops immediately available.&lt;ref name = "Neale 2001 20"/&gt;

On the urging of the Soviet Union, Ho Chi Minh initially attempted to negotiate with the French, who were slowly reestablishing their control across the area, although still under British control until hostilities had ceased. Once hostilities had ended the British handed over the territory to the French.&lt;ref name="Neale 2001 24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Neale|2001|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1946, the Viet Minh won elections across central and northern Vietnam.&lt;ref name = "Neale 2001 23_24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Neale|2001|pp=23–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 1946, Ho signed an agreement allowing French forces to replace Nationalist Chinese forces, in exchange for French recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a "free" republic within the [[French Union]], with the specifics of such recognition to be determined by future negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willbanks|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnamgear.com/March6agreement.aspx |title=Franco-Vietnam Agreement of March 6th, 1946 |publisher=Vietnamgear.com |date=6 March 1946 |accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent2.htm |title=Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Chapter !, Section 2 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |accessdate=29 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902001955/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent2.htm |archive-date=September 2, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; British forces departed on 26 March 1946, leaving Vietnam in the control of the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Dennis|title=Troubled days of peace: Mountbatten and South East Asia command, 1945–46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Inu7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA179|year=1987|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|isbn=978-0-7190-2205-0|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French landed in Hanoi by March 1946 and in November of that year they ousted the Viet Minh from the city.&lt;ref name="Neale 2001 24" /&gt; Soon thereafter, the Viet Minh began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the French Union forces, beginning the first Indochina War.

===French colonialism and the First Indochina War===
{{Main article|First Indochina War}}

Vietnam first became a French colony when France invaded in 1858. By the 1880s, the French had expanded their sphere of influence in Southeast Asia to include all of Vietnam, and by 1893 both [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] had become French colonies as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dunnigan, J.F. &amp; Nofi, A.A. (1999). ''Dirty Little Secrets of the Vietnam War''. New York:  St. Martins Press, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Rebellions against French colonial power were common up to [[World War I]]. The European war heightened revolutionary sentiment in Southeast Asia, and the independence-minded population rallied around revolutionaries such as [[Ho Chi Minh|Hồ Chí Minh]] and others, including royalists.

Prior to their attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], the Japanese occupied [[French Indochina]], but left civil administration to the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;Dunnigan, J.F. &amp; Nofi, A.A. (1999). ''Dirty Little Secrets of the Vietnam War''. New York:  St. Martins Press, pp. 27–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hood, S.J. 1992 p. 16"&gt;Hood, S.J. (1992). ''Dragons Entangled:  Indochina and the China-Vietnam War''. Armonk:  M.E. Sharpe, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 March 1945, fearing that the Vichy French were about to switch sides to support the Allies, the Japanese overthrew the Vichy administration and forces taking control of Indochina and establishing their own puppet administration, the [[Empire of Vietnam]]. The Japanese surrender in August 1945 created a power vacuum in Indochina, as the various political factions scrambled for control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Logevall|first=Fredrik|title=Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the making of America's Vietnam|publisher=Random House|year=2012|isbn=978-0-375-75647-4|pages=67–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events leading to the First Indochina War are subject to historical dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, R.D. and Leitenberg, M. (1984). ''The Wars in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, 1945–1982:  A Bibliographic Guide''. Santa Barbara:  ABC-Clio Information Services, p.xx.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Viet Minh]] hastily sought to establish the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], the remaining French acquiesced while waiting for the return of French forces to the region.&lt;ref name="Hood, S.J. 1992 p. 16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns, R.D. and Leitenberg, M. (1984). ''The Wars in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, 1945–1982:  A Bibliographic Guide''. Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio Information Services, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kuomintang]] supported French restoration, but Viet Minh efforts towards independence were helped by Chinese communists under the Soviet Union's power. The Soviet Union at first indirectly supported Vietnamese communists, but later directly supported Hồ Chí Minh.&lt;ref name="Hood, S.J. 1992 p. 13-19"&gt;Hood, S.J. (1992). ''Dragons Entangled:  Indochina and the China-Vietnam War''. Armonk:  M.E. Sharpe, p. 13-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Min. (1992). ''The Strategic Triangle and Regional Conflict: Lessons from the Indochina Wars''. Boulder:  Lnne Reinner Publications, p. 17-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets nonetheless remained less supportive than China until after the [[Sino-Soviet split]], during the time of [[Leonid Brezhnev]] when the Soviet Union became communist Vietnam's key ally.

The war itself involved numerous events that had major impacts throughout Indochina. Two major conferences were held to bring about a resolution. Finally, on July 20, 1954, the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] resulted in a political settlement to reunite the country, signed with support from China, Russia, and Western European powers.&lt;ref name="Hood, S.J. 1992 p. 13-19"/&gt; While the Soviet Union played a constructive role in the agreement, it again was not as involved as China.&lt;ref name="Hood, S.J. 1992 p. 13-19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Min. (1992). ''The Strategic Triangle and Regional Conflict:  Lessons from the Indochina Wars''. Boulder: Lnne Reinner Publications, p. 17-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. did not sign the agreement and swiftly moved to back [[South Vietnam]].

===Sino-Soviet split===
{{Main article|Sino-Soviet split}}

The [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] and the Viet Minh had a long history. During the initial stages of the [[First Indochina War]] with France, the recently founded communist People's Republic of China continued the Russian mission to expand communism. Therefore, they aided the Viet Minh and became the connector between Soviets and the Vietminh. In early 1950, The Viet Minh fought independently from the 'Chinese Military Advisory Group' under [[Wei Guoqing]]. This was one of the reasons for China to cut the arms support for the Viet Minh.

After the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in March 1953, relations between the Soviet Union and China began to deteriorate. [[Mao Zedong]] believed the new Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had made a serious error in his [[Secret Speech]] denouncing Stalin in February 1956, and criticized the Soviet Union's interpretation of [[Marxism–Leninism]], in particular Khrushchev's support for [[peaceful co-existence]] and its interpretation. This led to increasingly hostile relations, and eventually the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. From here, Chinese communists played a decreasing role in helping their former allies because the Viet Minh did not support China against the Soviets.

Following the death of Mao in September 1976, the overthrow of the [[Gang of Four]] and the ascent of [[Deng Xiaoping]], the Chinese leadership would revise its own positions to become compatible with market aspects, denounce the [[Cultural Revolution]], and collaborate with the US against the Soviet Union.

===Vietnam War===
{{Main article|Vietnam War}}

As France withdrew from a provisionally divided Vietnam in late 1954, the United States increasingly stepped in to support the South Vietnamese leaders due to the [[Domino theory]], which theorized that if one nation would turn to communism, the surrounding nations were likely to fall like dominoes and become communist as well. The Soviet Union and North Vietnam became important allies together due to the fact that if South Vietnam was successfully taken over by North Vietnam, then communism in the far east would find its strategic position bolstered. In the eyes of the People's Republic of China, the growing Soviet-Vietnamese relationship was a disturbing development; they feared an encirclement by the less-than-hospitable Soviet sphere of influence.

The United States and the Soviet Union could not agree on a plan for a proposed 1956 election meant to unify the partitioned Vietnam. Instead, the South held [[State of Vietnam referendum, 1955|a separate election]] that was widely considered fraudulent, leading to continued internal conflict with communist factions led by the [[Viet Cong]] that intensified through the late 1950s. With supplies and support from the Soviet Union, North Vietnamese forces became directly involved in the ongoing [[guerrilla war]] by 1959 and openly invaded the South in 1964.

The United States played an ever-increasing role in supporting South Vietnam through the period. The U.S. had supported French forces in the First Indochina War, sent supplies and military advisers to South Vietnam throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, and eventually took over most of the fighting against both North Vietnam and the Viet Cong by the mid-1960s. By 1968, over 500,000 American troops were involved in the Vietnam War. Due to a lack of clear military success and facing [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|increasingly strident opposition]] to the war in the U.S., American forces began a slow withdrawal in 1969 while attempting to [[Vietnamization|bolster South Vietnam's military]] so that they could take over the fighting. In accordance with the [[Paris Peace Accords]] by 29 March 1973 all U.S. combat forces had left South Vietnam, however North Vietnamese combat forces were allowed to remain in place. North Vietnam [[1975 Spring Offensive|attacked South Vietnam]] in early 1975 and [[Fall of Saigon|South Vietnam fell]] on 30 April 1975.

The People's Republic of China started talks with the United States in the early 1970s, culminating in high level meetings with [[Henry Kissinger]] and later [[Richard Nixon]]. These meetings contributed to a [[People's Republic of China-United States relations#Rapprochement|re-orientation of Chinese foreign policy toward the United States]]. Meanwhile, the People's Republic of China also supported the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]].

===Cambodia===
{{Main article|Cambodian–Vietnamese War}}

Although the Vietnamese Communists and the Khmer Rouge had previously cooperated, the relationship deteriorated when Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot came to power and established [[Democratic Kampuchea]] on 17 April 1975. [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], in the other hand, also supported the [[Maoist]] [[Khmer Rouge]] against [[Lon Nol|Lon Nol's]] regime during the [[Cambodian Civil War]] and its subsequent take-over of Cambodia. China provided extensive political, logistical and military support for the Khmer Rouge during its rule.&lt;ref name="CO"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storey |first=Ian |date=April 2006 |title=China's tightening relationship with Cambodia |journal=China Brief |volume=6 |issue=9 |url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=415&amp;issue_id=3704&amp;article_id=2371023 |accessdate=2008-06-17 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AStorey+intitle%3AChina%27s+tightening+relationship+with+Cambodia&amp;as_publication=China+Brief&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616041520/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=415&amp;issue_id=3704&amp;article_id=2371023 |archivedate=June 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War|numerous clashes along the border]] between Vietnam and Cambodia, and with encouragement from Khmer Rouge defectors fleeing a purge of the Eastern Zone, Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 25 December 1978. By 7 January 1979 Vietnamese forces had entered Phnom Penh and the Khmer Rouge leadership had fled to western Cambodia.

===China attacks Vietnam===
China, now under Deng Xiaoping, was starting the [[Chinese economic reform]] and opening trade with the West, in turn, growing increasingly defiant of the Soviet Union. On November 3, 1978, the Soviet Union and Vietnam signed a 25-year mutual defense treaty, which made Vietnam the "linchpin" in the Soviet Union's "drive to contain China."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Scalapino|Scalapino, Robert A.]] (1982) "The Political Influence of the Soviet Union in Asia" ''In'' Zagoria, Donald S. (editor) (1982) ''Soviet Policy in East Asia'' Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 1979, Chinese Vice-premier Deng Xiaoping visited the United States for the first time and told American president [[Jimmy Carter]]: "The little child is getting naughty, it's time he get spanked." (original Chinese words: 小朋友不听话，该打打屁股了。).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hkfront.org/wcvcw12.htm|script-title=zh:中共對侵越戰爭八股自辯|language=zh|accessdate=February 23, 2009|title={title}|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427020134/http://www.hkfront.org/wcvcw12.htm|archive-date=April 27, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, the first day that China could have officially announced the termination of the 1950 [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance]], Deng Xiaoping declared that China planned to conduct a limited attack on Vietnam.

The reason cited for the attack was to support China's ally, the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, in addition to the mistreatment of Vietnam's [[Hoa people|ethnic Chinese]] minority and the Vietnamese occupation of the [[Spratly Islands]] which were claimed by China. To prevent Soviet intervention on Vietnam's behalf, Deng warned Moscow the next day that China was prepared for a full-scale war against the Soviet Union; in preparation for this conflict, China put all of its troops along the Sino-Soviet border on an emergency war alert, set up a new military command in [[Xinjiang]], and even evacuated an estimated 300,000 civilians from the Sino-Soviet border.&lt;ref&gt;Chang Pao-min, Kampuchea Between China and Vietnam (Singapore, Singapore University Press, 1985), 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the bulk of China's active forces (as many as one-and-a-half million troops) were stationed along China's border with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Scalapino "Asia in a Global Context: Strategic Issue for the Soviet Union," in Richard H. Solomon and Masataka Kosaka, eds., The Soviet Far East Military Buildup (Dover, MA., Auburn House Publishing Company, 1986), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[People's Liberation Army]] vastly outnumbered the Vietnamese forces, the Soviet-Vietnamese alliance compelled the Chinese to deploy the majority of their forces along China's northern frontier with the Soviet Union (as well as, to a lesser extent, Soviet-allied [[Mongolia]]) as a deterrent to Soviet intervention. 

The Chinese force that engaged the Vietnamese consisted of units from the [[Kunming Military Region]], [[Chengdu Military Region]], [[Wuhan Military Region]] and [[Guangzhou Military Region]], but commanded by the headquarters of [[Kunming]] Military Region on the western front and [[Guangzhou Military Region]] in the eastern front.

Some troops engaged in this war, especially engineering units, railway corps, logistical units and antiaircraft units, had been assigned to assist [[North Vietnam]] in its war against [[South Vietnam]] just a few years earlier during the [[Vietnam War]]. Contrary to the belief that over 600,000 Chinese troops entered North Vietnam, the actual number was only 200,000, while 600,000 Chinese troops were mobilized, of which 400,000 were deployed away from their original bases during the one-month conflict.

The Chinese troop deployments were observed by U.S. spy satellites. In his state visit to the U.S. in 1979, the Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was presented with this information and asked to confirm the numbers. He replied that the information was completely accurate. After this public confirmation in the U.S., the domestic Chinese media were finally allowed to report on these deployments.

==Course of the war==
===Preparation of war===
According to Vietnam,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soha.vn/quan-su/bien-gioi-phia-bac-1979-30-ngay-khong-the-nao-quen-1-20150216095114962.htm|title=Biên giới phía Bắc 1979: 30 ngày không thể nào quên (1)|work=soha.vn|accessdate=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320232824/http://soha.vn/quan-su/bien-gioi-phia-bac-1979-30-ngay-khong-the-nao-quen-1-20150216095114962.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; since January 1979 Chinese forces performed numerous reconnaissance activities across the border and made 230 violations into Vietnamese land. To prepare for a possible Chinese invasion, the Central Military Committee of the Communist Party ordered all armed forces across the border to be on stand-by mode.

===Chinese engagement===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VietnamChina1979.png|400px|thumb|VietnamChina1979|right|Map depicting the Chinese routes of invasion of northern Vietnam in 1979]] --&gt;
On 17 February 1979, a [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) force of about 200,000 troops supported by 200 [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]], [[Type 62]], and [[Type 63 light tank|Type 63]] tanks entered northern Vietnam in the PLA's first major combat operation since the end of the [[Korean War]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china-defense.com/history/sino-vn_1/sino-vn_1-1.html ChinaDefense.com – The Political History of Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979, and the Chinese Concept of Active Defense] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205010002/http://www.china-defense.com/history/sino-vn_1/sino-vn_1-1.html |date=December 5, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PLA invasion was conducted in two directions: western and eastern
* Western direction, commanded by Xu Shiyou, aimed to attack [[Cao Bằng Province|Cao Bằng]], [[Lạng Sơn Province|Lạng Sơn]] and [[Quảng Ninh]] Provinces:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
* Eastern direction, commanded by Yang Dezhi, aimed to attack [[Ha Tuyen]], [[Hoang Lien Son]] and [[Lai Châu Province|Lai Châu]] Provinces

===Vietnamese counter-attacks===
Vietnam quickly mobilized all its main forces in Cambodia, southern Vietnam and central Vietnam to the northern border. From 18 February to 25 February, the 327th Infantry Division of Military District 3 and the 337th Infantry Division of Military District 4 were deployed to join Military District 1 for the defense of northwestern region. From 6 March to 11 March the Second Corp (Huong Giang Corp) stationed in Cambodia was deployed back to Hanoi.

The 372nd Air Division in central Vietnam as well as the 917th, 935th and 937th Air Regiments in southern Vietnam were quickly deployed to the north.&lt;ref name="soha.vn"/&gt;

===Soviet support to Vietnam===
The Soviet Union, although it did not take direct military action, provided intelligence and equipment support for Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dantri.com.vn/the-gioi/lien-xo-chia-lua-voi-viet-nam-trong-chien-tranh-bien-gioi-the-nao-727510.htm|title=Liên Xô "chia lửa" với Việt Nam trong chiến tranh biên giới thế nào?|work=dantri.com.vn|accessdate=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705210313/http://dantri.com.vn/the-gioi/lien-xo-chia-lua-voi-viet-nam-trong-chien-tranh-bien-gioi-the-nao-727510.htm|archive-date=July 5, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large airlift was established by the Soviet Union to move Vietnamese troops from Cambodia to Northern Vietnam. Moscow also provided a total of 400 tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs), 500 mortar artillery and air defense artillery, 50 BM-21 rocket launchers, 400 portable surface-to-air missiles, 800 anti-tank missiles and 20 jet fighters. About 5,000 to 8,000 Soviet military advisers were present in Vietnam from August 1979 to mid-1979{{clarify|date=July 2016}} to train Vietnamese soldiers.

During the Sino-Vietnamese War, the Soviet Union deployed troops at the Sino-Soviet border and Mongolian-Chinese border as an act of showing support to Vietnam, as well as tying up Chinese troops. However, the Soviets refused to take any direct action to defend their ally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/events/1996_Symposium/96papers/elleviet.php|title=Sino-Soviet Relations and the February 1979 Sino-Vietnamese Conflict|work=ttu.edu|accessdate=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428210200/http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/events/1996_Symposium/96papers/elleviet.php|archive-date=April 28, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Pacific Fleet]] also deployed 15 ships to the Vietnamese coast to relay Chinese battlefield communications to Vietnamese forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelemen|first=Paul|jstor=2644070 |title=Soviet Strategy in Southeast Asia: The Vietnam Factor|journal=[[Asian Survey]]|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|volume=24|issue=3|page=342|date=March 1984|issn=0004-4687|subscription=yes|doi=10.1525/as.1984.24.3.01p0146p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting===
{{more citations needed|date=April 2017}}
{{See also|Battle of Lạng Sơn (1979)|Battle of Dong Dang (1979)|Battle of Lao Cai|Battle of Cao Bang (1979)}}
[[File:Chinese tank destroyed in Cao Bang 1979.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Chinese tank destroyed in Cao Bang]]

The PLA quickly advanced about 15–20 kilometres into Vietnam, with fighting mainly occurring in the provinces of [[Cao Bằng Province|Cao Bằng]], [[Lào Cai Province|Lào Cai]] and [[Lạng Sơn Province|Lạng Sơn]]. The Vietnamese avoided mobilizing their regular divisions, and held back some 300,000 troops for the defence of Hanoi. The [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (VPA) tried to avoid direct combat and often used guerrilla tactics.

The initial PLA attack soon lost its momentum and a new attack wave was sent in with eight PLA divisions joining the battle. After [[Battle of Lạng Sơn (1979)|capturing the northern heights above Lạng Sơn]], the PLA surrounded and paused in front of the city in order to lure the VPA into reinforcing it with units from Cambodia. This was the main strategic ploy in the Chinese war plan as Deng did not want to risk escalating tensions with the Soviet Union.
Once this became clear to the PLA, the war was practically over. After three days of bloody [[urban warfare|house-to-house fighting]], Lạng Sơn fell on 6 March. The PLA then took the southern heights above Lạng Sơn&lt;ref&gt;[[Armchair General (magazine)|Armchair General]] magazine{{Issue missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occupied [[Sa Pa]]. The PLA claimed to have crushed several of the VPA regular units.&lt;ref name="mil.chinaiiss.org"&gt;《对越自卫反击作战工作总结》Work summary on counter strike (1979–1987) published by The rear services of Chinese Kunming Military Region&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese withdrawal===
On 6 March, China declared that the gate to Hanoi was open and that their punitive mission had been achieved. On the way back to the Chinese border, the PLA destroyed all local infrastructure and housing and looted all useful equipment and resources (including livestock), severely weakening the economy of Vietnam's northernmost provinces.&lt;ref name="mil.chinaiiss.org"/&gt; The PLA crossed the border back into China on 16 March. Both sides declared victory with China claiming to have crushed the Vietnamese resistance and Vietnam claiming to have repelled the invasion using mostly border militias. Henry J. Kenny, a research scientist for US [[Center for Naval Analyses]], notes that most Western writers agree that Vietnam outperformed the PLA on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Xiabing Li |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=HClVMlNksQMC |page=436 }} |title=A History of the Modern Chinese Army |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet inaction===
In response to China's attack, the Soviet Union sent several naval vessels and initiated an arms airlift to Vietnam. However, the Soviet Union felt that there was simply no way that they could directly support Vietnam against China; the distances were too great to be an effective ally, and any sort of reinforcements would have to cross territory controlled by China or U.S. allies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The only realistic option would be to restart the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|unresolved border conflict with China]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Vietnam was important to Soviet policy but not enough for the Soviets to go to war over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1996-09-01/soviet-union-and-vietnam-war|title=The Soviet Union and the Vietnam War|last=Legvold|first=Robert|date=2009-01-28|work=Foreign Affairs|access-date=2017-03-24|issue=September/October 1996|issn=0015-7120|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325040827/https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1996-09-01/soviet-union-and-vietnam-war|archive-date=March 25, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Moscow did not intervene, Beijing publicly proclaimed that the Soviet Union had broken its numerous promises to assist Vietnam.

Another reason why Moscow did not intervene was because Beijing had promised both Moscow and Washington that the invasion was only a limited war, and that Chinese forces would withdraw after a short incursion. After moderation by the U.S., Moscow decided to adopt a "wait and see" approach to see if Beijing would actually limit their offense. [[Deng Xiaoping]], because Vietnam's anti-air capabilities were among the best in the world at the time and in order to reassure Moscow it was conducting a limited war, ordered the Chinese navy and air force to remain out of the war; only limited support was provided by the air force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA624010&lt;/ref&gt; When Beijing kept its promise, Moscow did not retaliate.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Nam quan.JPG|thumb|Nam Quan Gate]]

China and Vietnam each lost thousands of troops, and China lost 3.45 billion yuan in overhead, which delayed completion of their 1979–80 economic plan.&lt;ref name="PRC-analysis"&gt;"China "Should Learn from its Losses" in the War against Vietnam" from "August 1" Radio, People's republic of China, 1400 GMT, February 17, 1980, as reported by BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, 22 February 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, the Vietnamese leadership took various repressive measures to deal with the problem of real or potential collaboration. In the spring of 1979, the authorities expelled approx. 8,000 [[Hoa people]] from Hanoi to the southern "New Economic Zones," and partially resettled the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] tribes and other ethnic minorities from the northernmost provinces. In response to the defection of [[Hoàng Văn Hoan]], a purge was launched to cleanse the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] of pro-Chinese elements and persons who had surrendered to the advancing Chinese troops during the war. In 1979, a total of 20,468 members were expelled from the party.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Szalontai, Hoàng Văn Hoan và vụ thanh trừng sau 1979.

China improved relations with [[ASEAN]] by promising protection to [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]] against "Vietnamese aggression". In contrast, Vietnam's decreasing prestige in the region led it to be more [[Russia–Vietnam relations|dependent on the Soviet Union]], to which it leased a naval base at [[Cam Ranh Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Republic, Part 2|first=Roderick|last=MacFarquhar|authorlink=Roderick MacFarquhar|series=[[The Cambridge History of China]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1991|pages=447–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2005, Howard W.

===Chinese casualties===
The number of casualties during the war is disputed.

The 238 Chinese soldiers surrendered after getting separated from their main unit during the withdrawal from Vietnam and became surrounded by Vietnamese.

===Sino-Vietnamese relations after the war===
{{Main article|China–Vietnam relations}}
{{See also|Battle of the Paracel Islands|Johnson South Reef Skirmish}}

Border skirmishes [[Sino-Vietnamese conflicts 1979-1990|continued throughout the 1980s]], including a significant skirmish in April 1984 and a naval battle over the Spratly Islands in 1988 known as the [[Johnson South Reef Skirmish]].

Armed conflict only ended in 1989 after the Vietnamese agreed to fully withdraw from Cambodia. Both nations planned the normalization of their relations in a secret summit in Chengdu in September 1990, and officially normalized ties in November 1991.

In 1999, after many years of negotiations, China and Vietnam signed a border pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1086867.stm|title=China-Vietnam pact signed|publisher=BBC News|date=2000-12-25|accessdate=2014-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222133048/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1086867.stm|archive-date=February 22, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an adjustment of the land border, resulting in Vietnam giving China part of its land which was lost during the battle, including the [[Friendship Pass|Ai Nam Quan Gate]] which served as the traditional border marker and entry point between Vietnam and China, which caused widespread frustration within Vietnam. Vietnam's official news service reported the implementation of the new border around August 2001. In January 2009 the border demarcation was officially completed, signed by Deputy Foreign Minister Vu Dung on the Vietnamese side and his Chinese counterpart, [[Wu Dawei]], on the Chinese side.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Both the [[Paracel Islands|Paracel]] (called Hoàng Sa in Vietnam, Xīshā in China) and Spratly (Trường Sa in Vietnam, Nansha in China) islands remain a point of contention.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[File:Hekou-Kim Thành border crossing - P1380333.JPG|thumb|A new bridge spanning the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] between Hekou and Kim Thành, on the main road between Kunming and Hanoi]]
The December 2007 announcement of a plan to build a Hanoi-Kunming highway was a landmark in Sino-Vietnamese relations. The road will traverse the border that once served as a battleground. It should contribute to demilitarizing the border region, as well as facilitating trade and industrial cooperation between the nations.&lt;ref&gt;Greenlees, Donald ''Approval near for Vietnam-China highway'' International Herald Tribune, December 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
===Chinese media===
There are a number of Chinese songs, movies and T.V. programs depicting and discussing this conflict from the Chinese viewpoint. These vary from the patriotic song "[[Bloodstained Glory]]" originally written to laud the sacrifice and service of the Chinese military, to the 1986 film ''[[The Big Parade (1986 film)|The Big Parade]]'' which carried veiled criticism of the war.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The male protagonist of the television series ''[[Candle in the Tomb (TV series)|Candle in the Tomb]]'' was a veteran of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLRiBYPmgLo |title={title} |access-date=February 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213122012/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLRiBYPmgLo |archive-date=February 13, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2017 Chinese movie [[Youth (2017 film)|Youth]] covers the period of the Sino-Vietnamese conflict from the perspective of the larger cultural changes taking place in China during that period of time.

===Vietnamese media===
The war was mentioned in the film ''Đất mẹ'' (''Motherland'') directed by [[Hải Ninh]] in 1980 and ''Thị xã trong tầm tay'' (''Town at the Fingertips'') directed by [[Đặng Nhật Minh]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;12/24/2005, [http://www.tiasang.com.vn/DesktopModules/VietTotal.Articles/PrintView.aspx?ItemID=1501 Cha - con và chiến tranh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114052001/http://www.tiasang.com.vn/DesktopModules/VietTotal.Articles/PrintView.aspx?ItemID=1501 |date=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides in 1982, a documentary film called ''Hoa đưa hương nơi đất anh nằm'' (''Flowers over Your Grave'') was directed by Truong Thanh, the film told a story of a Japanese journalist who died during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nguyễn Duy Chiến + theo dõi (1225) |url=http://www.tienphong.vn/Van-Hoa/127182/Tham-mot-nha-van-vua-man-han-tu-treo.html |title=Thăm một nhà văn vừa... mãn hạn tù treo |publisher=Tienphong.vn |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221154410/http://www.tienphong.vn/Van-Hoa/127182/Tham-mot-nha-van-vua-man-han-tu-treo.html |archive-date=February 21, 2014 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the war, there were numerous patriotic songs produced to boost the nationalism of Vietnamese people, including "Chiến đấu vì độc lập tự do" ("Fight for Independence and Freedom") composed by [[Phạm Tuyên]], "Lời tạm biệt lúc lên đường" ("Farewell When Leaving") by Vu Trong Hoi, "40 thế kỷ cùng ra trận" ("40 Centuries We Fought Side By Side") by Hong Dang, "Những đôi mắt mang hình viên đạn" ("The Angry Gaze") by [[Tran Tien]] and "Hát về anh" (Sing for you) by The Hien.
The Sino-Vietnamese War also appeared in some novels such as: ''Đêm tháng Hai'' (''Night of February'') written by Chu Lai in 1979 and ''Chân dung người hàng xóm'' (''Portrait of My Neighbors''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Viet Nam: A History from Earliest Times to the Present|last=Kiernan|first=Ben|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|page=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;) written by Duong Thu Huong in 1979.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4164">'''Sumbat Davitis Dze''' ({{lang-ka|სუმბატ დავითის ძე}}), or '''Sumbat, son of David''', in modern English transliteration, was the 11th-century [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] chronicler who described in his ''The Life and Tale of the Bagratids''  the history of the [[Bagrationi dynasty]] of Georgia from the beginnings until c. 1030. The Georgian scholar [[Ekvtime Takaishvili]] has demonstrated that Sumbat belonged to that dynasty. The author is notable for his articulation of the Bagratid [[Claim of the biblical descent of the Bagrationi dynasty|claim to be descended]] from the biblical King-Prophet [[David]].

'''Tachhalā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: तछला) is the eighth month in the [[Nepal Era]] calendar, the national [[lunar calendar]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Sambat gets national status|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=24 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020104054/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The month coincides with [[Jyeshtha (month)|Jyeshtha]] (ज्येष्ठ) in the [[Hindu lunar calendar]] and [[June]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

Tachhalā begins with the [[new moon]] and the [[full moon]] falls on the 15th of the [[lunar month]]. The month is divided into the bright and dark fortnights which are known as Tachhalā Thwa (तछला थ्व) and Tachhalā Gā (तछला गा) respectively.

Among the major festivals observed during the month, the 6th day of the bright fortnight is Sithi Nakha which is dedicated to [[Murugan|Kumar Kartikeya]], one of the two sons of [[Hindu]] deity [[Shiva]]. The special food of the festival is "wo", a lentil cake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bajracharya |first= Munindra Ratna |date= 30 May 2014 |title= Sithinakha Parva |url= http://epaper.gorkhapatraonline.com/friday-supplement/book/1039-friday-supplement-may-30-2014/7-friday-supplement.html |newspaper= The Rising Nepal |location= Kathmandu |accessdate= 30 May 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105756/http://epaper.gorkhapatraonline.com/friday-supplement/book/1039-friday-supplement-may-30-2014/7-friday-supplement.html |archivedate= 31 May 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday has an environmental aspect apart from its religious significance. On this day, water sources like wells, ponds and fountains are cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adhikari |first=Sharada |date=16 June 2011 |title=Sithi Nakha: Festival with a green touch |url= http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullTodays.php?headline=Sithi+Nakha%3A+Festival+with+a+green+touch&amp;NewsID=292059 |newspaper=The Himalayan Times |location=Kathmandu |accessdate= 16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full moon day of Gaidu Purnimā, known as Jyā Punhi in Nepal Bhasa, is a widely celebrated holiday. For [[Buddhist]]s, Jya Punhi is sacred as the day when Prince Siddhartha, the Buddha-to-be, left his home in search of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2003 |title= Promotion of Buddhist Tourism Circuits in Selected Asian Countries; Issue 24 of ESCAP tourism review; SERIES ESCAP TOURISM REVIEW NO. 24|publisher= United Nations Publications|page=46 |isbn=9789211203868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full moon day is also known as Panauti Punhi for the festival that takes place in [[Panauti]], a town to the east of [[Kathmandu]]. During Panauti Jātrā, chariot processions of the deities [[Bhairava]] and Bhadrakali are held in the most important celebration here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levy |first= Robert Isaac |date=1990 |title= Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal|chapter=A Catalogue of Annual Events and Their Distribution throughout the Lunar Year |publisher= University of California Press |page=651 |isbn=9780520069114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 8th day of the dark fortnight, the festival of Machā Tiyā Jātrā or Trishul Jātrā ("The Procession with the Trident") is held in Deopatan in Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Michaels |first= Axel |date=2008 |title= Siva in Trouble: Festivals and Rituals at the Pasupatinatha Temple of Deopatan |chapter= The Procession with the Trident (Trisuljatra) |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=107 |isbn=9780195343021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lemberg Mosaic''''', subtitled the "Memoirs of Two who Survived the Destruction of Jewish Galicia," is a book on the [[Holocaust]] by Jakob Weiss.&lt;ref&gt;Published in paperback and hardcover format February, 2011 by Alderbrook Press (New York). The copyright page indicates a first printing on November 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This work brings to light the relatively obscure history of the systematic and total destruction of Jewish [[Lemberg]] (Lwów, now [[Lviv]] in [[Ukraine]]). It is presented in the format of a biography,&lt;ref name="WorldCat"&gt;{{worldcat|oclc=711128993}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the struggle for survival of four families in the backdrop of two back-to-back invasions of the city and surrounding region by both the Soviets (1939) and the Germans (1941).

==Overview==
Before the Second World War Lviv was known as [[Lwów]]. After the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the rebirth of modern Poland (the [[Second Polish Republic]]), Lwów (formerly, Lemberg) became the third largest city in Poland with the third largest Jewish population (after [[Warsaw]] and [[Lódz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/book/the-lemberg-mosaic-the-memoirs-of-two-who-survived-the-destruction-of-jewish-galicia |title=The Lemberg Mosaic: The Memoirs of Two Who Survived the Destruction of Jewish Galicia |publisher=Jewishbookcouncil.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources call the destruction of this once vibrant Jewish community the "Holocaust by Bullets,"&lt;ref&gt;Desbois, Father Patrick, ''The Holocaust by Bullets: A Priest's Journey to Uncover the Truth Behind the Murder of 1.5 Million Jews'' MacMillan (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; or the "[[Shoah]] of Jewish Galicia" or the "Ukrainian Holocaust." Recent forensic evidence as uncovered and analyzed by researchers like the French priest, Father Patrick Desbois, has coroborated the testimony of both survivors and eyewitnesses that well over one million and perhaps as many as 1.5 million Jews were brutally murdered in World War II during the Nazi invasion of the eastern-most region of Poland, also known as [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], today's [[West Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;Desbois, Father Patrick, ''The Holocaust by Bullets&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afterward by Dr. Berthold Zarwyn==
[[File:Lemberg_mosaic,_back_cover_image.jpg|thumb|upright|Back cover art: ''Collage'']]
The book's Afterword was penned by [http://bios.marquiswhoswho.com/berthold_zarwyn/physicist_consultant/6463768 Dr. Berthold Zarwyn] himself a native of the city and survivor of the [[Lwow ghetto|Lemberg ghetto]]. In it, he details his own eyewitness account of what transpired during the Nazi invasion, including participation of the [[Ukrainian People's Militia|Ukrainian militia]], the [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police]] and the local populace in the atrocities - primarily targeting the Jews in the city and the surrounding region of eastern Galicia ([[District of Galicia]]). In his comments, a cross reference is made by Dr. Zarwyn to a specific Ukrainian auxiliary police officer, [[John Kalymon]] who was stripped of his United States citizenship for falsifying his role as a guard in the Lemberg Ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-09-20/us/us_michigan-ukrainian-nazi_1_eli-rosenbaum-ukrainian-auxiliary-police-labor-camps?_s=PM:US |title=Former Ukrainian Nazi, 90, loses deportation appeal in Michigan - CNN |publisher=Articles.cnn.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228204637/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-09-20/us/us_michigan-ukrainian-nazi_1_eli-rosenbaum-ukrainian-auxiliary-police-labor-camps?_s=PM:US |archivedate=2011-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Zarwyn has made a significant contribution to the continuing efforts to bring former Nazi collaborators to justice such as Kalymon who is currently the subject of a criminal prosection by a Munich tribunal as [[Operation Last Chance]] continues. The Munich prosecution of Kalymon is now before same court (led by the same prosecutor) that tried and convicted the infamous [[John Demjanjuk]] as an accessory to the murder of 27,900 Jews.

Another international force of up to 30,000 troops then would help the Lebanese government regain control over the region, the sources said. Rice presented the plan to Lebanese officials, the sources said, and will show it to European foreign ministers 26 July in Rome, Italy. U.S. and diplomatic sources said Lebanese officials are leaking details of the proposal because they are opposed to many of them.

* The Israeli military suffered its largest loss of life in its 15-day offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas as nine Israeli soldiers were killed while fighting in southern Lebanese towns. Eight soldiers were killed and 22 more were wounded in Bint Jbeil,&lt;ref name="Lubotzky"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubotzky|first=Asael|title=[[From the Wilderness and Lebanon]]|year=2016|publisher=[[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]]|isbn=978-1592644179|pages=55–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the Israeli border, while battling militiamen in what the Israel Defense Forces has called Hezbollah's "terror capital." More troops were being sent to [[Bint Jbeil]]. In nearby [[Maroun al-Ras]], an Israeli army officer was killed and five soldiers were wounded in fighting, according to the IDF. On the Mediterranean coast, 10 people were injured in the Lebanese port city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] when Israeli airstrikes destroyed a 10-story building, city officials said. Smoke rose over the city after two large explosions, and people near the building were covered in dust and blood as they fled through the rubble. The blast came just hours after a ship with hundreds of foreigners aboard departed the seaport in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Residents in Tyre said they were concerned that Israeli airstrikes would intensify after the Westerners left. The ship, chartered by Canada, was bound for Cyprus filled with Americans, Australians, [[British people|Briton]]s, Canadians and other nationalities. Israeli Maj. Gen. [[Udi Adam]] said the building was targeted because "there are launchers [there] that fire missiles at [[Haifa]]." Haifa, the third-largest city in Israel, has been the target of numerous air attacks. Adam also told reporters that an end to the fighting may be near. "I assume that it will go on for a few more weeks", he said. "And in a few more weeks, I believe we will be able to put an end to this operation – a successful end."&lt;ref name="CNN-07-26"/&gt;
* Israeli troops have been involved in fierce ground fighting in Lebanese border towns since entering [[Maroun al-Ras]] last week. The goal, according to the IDF, is to push Hezbollah guerrillas away from the border and reduce the Islamic militia's capability to launch Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-26"/&gt;

* Talks in Rome, Italy, floundered after the United States disagreed with European and Arab nations over how to defuse the situation, according to sources in Washington, D.C. and [[Jerusalem]]. The United States has resisted demands for an immediate cease-fire, insisting that a cessation of hostilities must be part of a wider plan to permanently disarm Hezbollah. Arab and European leaders say the violence must stop first. Meanwhile, Israel, which was not invited to participate in the talks, said it hoped "the international community will act immediately to strengthen the Lebanese army" so the army can take charge of southern Lebanon after the talks.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-26"/&gt;

* The city of Haifa has become a "battleground", as Hezbollah continued its rocket assaults on northern Israel and the Israel Defense Forces responded with heavy shelling and aerial attacks, according to a statement from the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. The Israeli campaign is aimed at "changing the reality on the northern border", Israeli Defense Minister [[Amir Peretz]] said. "Hezbollah must not in the future be what it has been in the past", Peretz said. "This may take time and it may take more force. We have both in plenty." "We will not agree for Hezbollah flags again to fly in our faces on the northern border", he said. On the evening, at least five rockets struck various targets in the northern Israeli town of [[Qiryat Shemona]], causing several fires.

* The [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] released a statement saying it was "deeply shocked and distressed" by the Israeli airstrikes that struck a U.N. bunker earlier this week, killing four peacekeepers. Troops from Finland, Canada, China and Austria died after the strike in [[Khiam]], U.N. officials said. All four were members of the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon]], a French-led observer mission on the Israeli-Lebanese border. Security Council members met for hours, but were initially unable to come to a consensus on the statement's wording. Diplomatic sources said the main holdout was the U.S., which had problems with the statement's harshness toward Israel. After the 15 member countries agreed to the resolution, Chinese Ambassador [[Wang Guangya]] called the statement "watered-down" and "the minimum the Security Council can do under the circumstances."&lt;ref name="CNN-07-27"/&gt;

It was not clear what the rocket's full capabilities are. In all, at least five Hezbollah rockets landed near Afula, police said. It was unclear if the other two were [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]]s. During the conflict, Hezbollah has relied mostly on Russian-designed, highly mobile Katyusha rockets. They pack 22 kilograms (49 pounds) of explosives and have hit Afula in the past.

Despite the intense fighting, the Israeli government said it was not planning to send thousands of troops into Lebanon to fall into a possible militant trap. "Israel is going to do it at our own pace, at our own time, to make sure that when we go in, we go in carefully, and that we don't walk into their booby traps", Israeli government spokeswoman [[Miri Eisin]] said.

The IDF said it is willing to allow safe passage for aid and evacuation convoys with 48 hours notice, Egeland said. Also in southern Lebanon, the United Nations removed unarmed observers from two outposts along the Israeli-Lebanese border as a protective measure, U.N. officials said.

|'''United Nations'''
* Diplomatic efforts to halt the violence in Lebanon continued in [[Jerusalem]]. U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] dined with Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] at night, according to the U.S. Embassy in [[Tel Aviv]]. Hours earlier, Israel rejected a U.N. call for a three-day cease-fire. It has not been announced if Rice would travel to Beirut to meet with Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, and Rice has said she doesn't plan on taking a comprehensive proposal to the region. "I don't expect to present somebody with a 'here are the five points you must accept,' " she said. "This has got to be some give and take. This is difficult." U.S. officials and diplomatic sources involved in the negotiations said Rice's goal is to merge various proposals for ending the fighting into a comprehensive package agreed to by Israel and Lebanon and enshrined in a United Nations resolution. The U.S.-endorsed plan would require Lebanon to deploy its army with the help of an international peacekeeping force and agree to call for Hezbollah to disarm, with its military wing ultimately integrating into the Lebanese army. This would all need to happen before an official cease-fire could be declared. In return, Israel would resolve the issue of the disputed [[Shebaa Farms]] territory with Lebanon.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-29"/&gt;
* The U.N. Security Council will begin debating a resolution this week spelling out the way ahead. Later in the week, 3 August, Rice will attend a ministerial meeting of council members to finalize language on the text. Rice said she has only read news reports about the Lebanese government proposal—to which Hezbollah had agreed in principle with some reservations—but it appeared to have "some very good elements." She called it a "positive step." France circulated a draft [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in the Mideast and laying the foundation for the deployment of a multi-national force aimed at supporting the Lebanese army in disarming Hezbollah, according to diplomatic sources.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-29"/&gt;
* The United Nations' appeal for the cease-fire came from its emergency relief coordinator [[Jan Egeland]] "so that we can evacuate wounded, evacuate children, evacuate the elderly and the disabled from the crossfire in Lebanon." A third of the people killed in Lebanon have been children, he said.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-29"/&gt;
* Two U.N. peacekeepers from the Indian battalion were wounded at afternoon when an aerial bomb detonated near them in south Lebanon, said a spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. Their observation tower was damaged, UNIFIL added. UNIFIL had earlier reported Israeli and Hezbollah fire near its positions on both sides of the border and said it "strongly protested all these incidents to the Israeli and Lebanese authorities." An Israeli attack on another U.N. observation post killed four U.N. observers 25 July.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-29"/&gt;
|-
|'''Hezbollah'''
* Hezbollah has said it will not disarm until Israeli troops leave the disputed region near the Syrian border, which the U.N. recognizes as Syrian territory. Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] said, in a speech aired on his group's Al-Manar TV station, that Israel had been counting on a victory to secure a political solution but has failed. "It's clear ... that the Zionist enemy has not been able to reach a military victory. I'm not saying that. They said that. The whole world is saying that", he said. Nasrallah also said Rice's return to the region was to impose the will of the United States on the Middle East. "Rice comes back to the region to try to impose its conditions again on Lebanon – serving in its new Middle East and serving Israel", he said.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-29"/&gt;
*[[Hezbollah]] head [[Hassan Nasrallah]] vows rocket strikes on towns in central Israel, calling it a "temporary country" and asking "When in any Arab-Israeli conflict were two million Israelis forced to flee or enter bomb shelters?"

* As of 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. (8:30&amp;nbsp;am. ET), 39 rockets had landed in northern Israel, six inside the cities of Acre, [[Tiberias]], [[Nahariya]] and [[Safed]], wounding five people.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-29"/&gt;

"There is no need for a 72-hour temporary cease-fire because Israel has opened a humanitarian corridor to and from Lebanon", Pazner told reporters.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-29"/&gt;
|-
|'''United States'''
* The U.S. plan is similar to one proposed this week by Siniora and endorsed 28 July by his Cabinet, including the Hezbollah ministers. Siniora's proposal includes strengthening the existing [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] in south Lebanon and deploying the Lebanese army to the area. Both plans call for Israel to agree on a prisoner exchange for the release of the Israelis soldiers kidnapped by Hezbollah and to resolve the issue of the disputed Shebaa Farms territory. But two major sticking points remain. Lebanon, as well as Arab and European states say a cease-fire must take place before the rest of the deal can be implemented, while the U.S. and Israel insist the force must be in place, the Lebanese army must be deployed and efforts must be under way to disarm Hezbollah before an official cease-fire can be declared. The composition and mandate of the international force is also a thorny issue. The U.S. and Israel would prefer a European force, while Lebanon wants to expand the existing UNIFIL force. And it remains unclear whether the force would have the authority to fight against Hezbollah.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-29"/&gt;

Also, Israeli Defense Forces said its ground troops were operating in the border village of [[Taiba]] in southeastern Lebanon, an area Israel said Hezbollah uses to launch rockets. Troops have killed at least three Hezbollah militants and found stockpiles of rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank missiles, a cannon with shells and a machine gun, the IDF said. Four Israeli soldiers were injured when an anti-tank rocket hit their tank in southern Lebanon, an Israeli military spokesman said.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-30" /&gt; Under cover of artillery strikes IDF ground troops pushed towards the village of [[Adisa]].

|'''IDF'''
* Israel Air Force continues airstrikes in support of ground forces in southern Lebanon, but refrains from attacks elsewhere in accordance with its stated 48-hour period of restraint.
*The Israeli military and Hezbollah forces started engagement in the town of Ayta al-Sha'b in southern Lebanon. {{see also|Battle of Ayta al-Sha`b}}
* Reuters, quoting Israel Radio, reported 15,000 reservists would be called up, but it is not clear whether those troops are the ones already authorized or extra troops. Clashes with Hezbollah have left 33 Israeli troops dead, IDF said. Hezbollah's casualties were not known.&lt;ref name=CNN-07-31&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel OKs expansion of Lebanon campaign|date=31 July 2006|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/31/mideast.main/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Israeli army said strikes near the Lebanese village of [[Tayibe (Lebanon)|Tayba]] were meant to protect ground forces operating in the border area and were not aimed at specific targets. The Israeli military expressed regret that one of the strikes hit a Lebanese military vehicle outside [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], Lebanon. The Israel Defense Forces said it was unclear how many people were killed. Earlier, a senior Lebanese Interior Ministry official said the airstrike killed an aide to a Lebanese general and wounded three soldiers. The general survived the attack, the official said. The IDF said it thought the car was carrying a senior Hezbollah militant involved in directing rocket fire on Israel. Earlier, the IDF said its aircraft fired on open fields surrounding its ground forces in the Tayba area. Three Israeli soldiers in the area suffered minor injuries after Hezbollah fighters hit their tank with a missile, an Israeli army spokesman said.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31" /&gt; The towns of Al-Awayda area, Kafr Shuba' and Kafr Hamam were also hit with IDF artillery strikes.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news | title = Israeli strikes resume after brief lull|date=31 July 2006| publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|url= http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/world/4083393.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|'''Hezbollah'''
* Hezbollah also holds its fire, with "the Israeli Army counting only three mortar shells landing in Israel ... and no rockets."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/world/middleeast/01mideast.html "Israel Pushes On Despite Agreeing to Airstrike Lull"], ''[[New York Times]]'', 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; at least three in [[Haifa]], wounding six people.
* Hezbollah's [[Al-Manar]] television station claimed Hezbollah missiles hit an Israeli warship. An Israeli security source said no Israeli vessel had been hit, according to Reuters news service. Reuters also reported that Hezbollah said the attack was retaliation for 30 August bombing of [[Qana]], Lebanon, that killed at least 54 civilians. The airstrike—which killed many children and sparked international outrage—threatened to derail work toward a resolution in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31" /&gt;
* Two Hezbollah rockets hit in an open area of the northern Israeli town of [[Kiryat Shmona]], but no casualties were reported, Israeli police officials said. The firings marked the first Hezbollah rocket attacks into northern Israel from southern Lebanon in a day. Hezbollah has responded by firing scores of rockets a day into northern Israel, killing at least 18 Israeli civilians, according to IDF.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31"/&gt;
|-
|'''United Nations'''
* At the United Nations, a Security Council meeting on planning for a new peacekeeping force had been delayed "until there is more political clarity" on the path ahead in the Middle East conflict, Reuters news agency reported. U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] had called the meeting 28 July, but the world's major powers have said no force can be put in place until fighting stops and Israel, Lebanon and Hezbollah agree to its deployment, Reuters reported.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31"/&gt;
* Teams from the [[Red Cross]] and United Nations arrived in the southern Lebanese town of [[Bint Jbeil]] to survey the damage and evacuate residents, a day after heavy fighting reduced much of the area to rubble.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31"/&gt;
* The [[UN Security Council]] has expressed its "shock and distress" at the previous day's Israeli attack in which 54 Lebanese [[civilians]], many of them children, were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5229058.stm (BBC NEWS)]&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|'''United States'''
* President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] said there could be no cease-fire until Hezbollah was reined in and international borders respected, reiterating the U.S. stance on the conflict. Bush, speaking in Florida, said Israel had the right to defend itself and called on Iran and Syria to stop aiding Hezbollah. "Iran must end its financial support and supply of weapons to terrorist groups like Hezbollah", Bush said. "Syria must end its support for terror and respect the sovereignty of Lebanon." U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], speaking earlier, said she believed a resolution to the crisis could be reached this week.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31"/&gt;
|-
|'''Israel'''
* Israel has called the Qana airstrike a tragic mistake, and [[Ehud Olmert]] apologized for the pain the Lebanese people have endured. But he added, "We are fighting terrorists who know no bounds." In his speech today, he said Hezbollah has suffered a "heavy blow" in the fighting. Israeli troops and airstrikes have inflicted serious damage to Hezbollah's capacity to launch rockets into Israel, and its supply routes from Syria have been hampered, he said. "We will stop the war when the [rocket] threat is removed ..., our captive soldiers return home in peace, and you are able to live in safety and security." "We are paying a very precious and almost unbearable price in terms of loss of life, major damage to public and private property and tranquility – and we're not prepared to give up our right to live perfectly ordinary lives, which are not subject to terrorism and hate and fanaticism", Olmert said.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31"/&gt;
* [[Dan Gillerman]], the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, said he was "not really worried" by today's Syrian declaration.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31"/&gt;
* Israeli Defence MinisterAmir Peretz]] has said that, despite a 48-hour halt to air strikes on [[south Lebanon]], Israel cannot agree to an immediate [[ceasefire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5230192.stm (BBC NEWS)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In New York, Olmert's deputy, [[Shimon Peres]], said Israel's problem is with Hezbollah's Syrian and Iranian backers, not Lebanon. "Though Hezbollah is a Lebanese body, they don't serve any Lebanese purpose", he said. Their purpose, he said, is to "make Lebanon part of the sphere of influence of Iran."&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31"/&gt;
|-
|'''Syria'''
* Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] directed his country's military to heighten its readiness, vowing to back Lebanese resistance against Israel, the state news agency SANA reported.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31"/&gt;
|-
|'''Lebanon'''
* Israeli airstrikes and artillery have pounded Lebanon since then, leaving nearly 500 people dead, Lebanese Internal Security Forces said.&lt;ref name="CNN-07-31"/&gt;

'''Timeline of Notable Events [[University of Wisconsin–Parkside]]''''s first half century include:

*1965 On Sept. 2, the state Legislature approves Senate Bill 48, which mandates creation of new collegiate institutions in northeastern Wisconsin and the Kenosha-Racine area "as soon as is practicable." Gov. Warren Knowles signed the bill into law. Although designated a Senate bill, much of the political force behind the legislation came from Democratic Rep. [[George Molinaro]] of Kenosha
*1966 April: A site-selection committee chooses a {{convert|690|acre|km2|sing=on}} parcel of rolling farmland and woods near Petrifying Springs Park in Kenosha County as the home for the new southeastern UW campus, rejecting more than a half-dozen other sites.
*1966 April 21: Even before officially being named chancellor, Irvin Wyllie chooses the name University of Wisconsin–Parkside for the campus. "No place can go anywhere tagged the Petrifying Springs Campus, or snide variations thereof: Putrifying Springs, Stupefying Springs," he wrote.
*1966 May: UW–Madison history professor Irvin G. Wyllie, author of "The Self-Made Man in America," is named the first chancellor by UW President Fred Harvey Harrington.
*1967 October: Author [[Irving Wallace]] donates a collection of his books, manuscripts, correspondence, awards and other items to UW–Parkside to establish the Irving Wallace Collection. A Kenosha native, the author of "The Man," "The Prize," "The Chapman Report" and 30 other books donates plays, screenplays, photographs and other materials.
*1967 November: Ground is broken for the first two buildings of the new campus. Thirty-one parcels of land are acquired for the $6.5 million first phase of the construction project, mostly through condemnation. The first building would be finished in time to hold classes in the fall of 1969. The rest of the campus was finished in 1976 with opening of the Union.
*1967 The historic and pristine Chiwaukee Prairie in southern Kenosha County is named a state natural area as The Nature Conservancy Inc. begins donating the land to UW–Parkside. One of the largest parcels of truly native prairie of its kind anywhere, Chiwaukee Prairie was saved from destruction in the 1960s by local members of the Conservancy.
*1968 June: The University's library opens with 70,000 volumes. Part of the library's collection is stored in a barn on one of the former farms purchased for the University.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[image:Logoprogress.jpg|thumb|230px|The UW–Parkside logo combines the U and W with forms 
representing the trees on campus.]] --&gt;
*   1968 July: The University of Wisconsin–Parkside is officially founded, taking administrative control of the two-year UW centers in Racine and Kenosha. Classes are held on the two-year centers, which are later disbanded. December: The Board of Regents names the administration building on Wood Road for Bernard Tallent, dean of the UW–Kenosha center from 1948 until his death in 1965.
*1969 February: A bill introduced in the state Assembly would limit UW–Parkside enrollment to 30,000. The University's master plan envisions eventual enrollment at 25,000. (Legislators need not have worried. The record enrollment was 6,008, set in 1983.)
*1969 September: The university opens doors to its first students, holding classes in Greenquist Hall. Enrollment hits 2,911 at the three campus locations, including the two former two-year UW Centers in Kenosha and Racine.
*1969 November: Students choose the name "Rangers" for the University's athletics teams, spurning such suggested monikers as Apollos, Marauders, Cohos, Juggernauts, Polecats, Fightin' Farmers, Parkies and Woodchucks.
* 1970 May: A host of dignitaries turns out to officially dedicate the new university at the close of its first year. June: The University graduates its first 36 students at a modest ceremony that attracts 500 people to Greenquist Hall. George Becker of Kenosha is the first to receive his diploma.
*1971 April: The first UW–Parkside student government is elected. October: The Legislature approves a bill to merge the four-campus University of Wisconsin with the Wisconsin State Universities, creating the University of Wisconsin System. The move would have a profound effect on growth of the fledgling UW–Parkside campus.
*1971 December: Three UW–Parkside researchers land a U.S. Navy grant to study the effects of a proposed Navy communications system, "Project Sanguine," on the cells of slime mold. Over the years, Eugene Goodman, Ben Greenebaum, Michael Marron and others will land hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to study effects of the communication system on living organisms.
*1972 May: The 250 students awarded degrees at commencement are the first to complete all their studies at the new campus.

He is the former head men's cross country and track coach at UW–Parkside.
*1972 September: The Library/Learning Center and the Physical Education Building open to the public. The library's collection includes 200,000 books and 1,700 periodicals. The Library would eventually grow to more than 365,000 volumes, 1,680 periodicals, 4,720 maps and 11,600 audio/visual titles.
*1973 March: A tiny parasitic worm gives the new university a measure of immortality. Assistant life sciences professor Omar Amin discovers the new species in the Pike River and names it Acanthocephalus parksidei after UW–Parkside.

Cole, now known as [[Abdul Jeelani]], goes on to play for the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and Dallas Mavericks. Spring: Jim Heiring is the first UW–Parkside race walker to compete in the U.S. Olympic trials in the 20-kilometer walk. He just misses the team. A six-time national champion, Heiring later becomes a member of the 1980, 1984 and 1988 teams. October: The $3.7 million student union (at right) opens.
*1980 January: Six star athletes become charter members of the UW–Parkside Hall of Fame: Race walker Jim Heiring; basketball player Abdul Jeelani; four-time All-American wrestler Ken Martin; [[Kim Merritt]], the first UW–Parkside woman All-American distance runner; marathoner [[Lucien Rosa]] and wrestler Bill West. October: Chancellor Guskin is the featured speaker at the Peace Corps 20th anniversary observance at the University of Michigan. Guskin and his wife were student activists behind the 1960 movement believed to have persuaded President John F. Kennedy to propose the Peace Corps. Kennedy personally thanked the Guskins for their work to organize the Peace Corps at a meeting in Ohio in 1960.
*1981 February: The University establishes the Biomedical Research Institute to foster medical-related research. Over the next decade, institute members attract nearly $4 million in research grants. September: Responding to a shortage of nurses, UW–Parkside and UW–Milwaukee enroll the first students in a cooperative program that allows students to earn a UW–Milwaukee nursing degree by taking courses at UW–Parkside. The program becomes a model for the UW System and beyond.
*1983 June: Researcher Ross Gundersen demonstrates for the first time that a substance released by developing muscle tissue exerts an attraction on growing spinal nerves illustrating that growing nerves communicate with the muscles to which they eventually attach. Fall: The University enrolls a record 6,008 students.
*1985 March: Chancellor Alan Guskin accepts appointment as the 17th president of Antioch University in Yellow Springs, Ohio. He leaves UW–Parkside Sept. 1, ten years to the day of assuming the chancellorship.
*1986 July: Sheila I. Kaplan, vice chancellor for academic affairs in the Minnesota State University System, becomes UW–Parkside's third chancellor.
*1987 December: Biological sciences Professor Chong-maw Chen is named one of six Wisconsin Distinguished Professors by the Board of Regents. An internationally recognized researcher on plant hormones and genetic engineering, Chen is reappointed a Distinguished Professor in 1993.
*1988 September: The Biological Sciences Department is designated a Center of Excellence by the Board of Regents. October: Approval is granted for the University to offer a unique master's degree in applied molecular biology, including study of advanced techniques in cloning, gene splicing and isolating traits on genetic material. December: Professor of engineering science George Perdikaris is named a Wisconsin Distinguished Professor of Applied Science.
*1989 February: The UW–Parkside basketball team sets four NCAA records with the new three-point shot during a 121-95 win over Lakeland College: most three-point shots completed by one player (14), most attempts by one team (70), most completions by one team (25) and most three-point attempts by both teams (77).
*1991 February: U.S. Marine Maj. Joseph Small III, a 1975 business graduate, is shot down while patrolling the skies over Kuwait during the Gulf War. Small was captured by Iraqi soldiers, beaten savagely and held for nine days before being released.
*1991 March: University officials travel to Tbilisi, Soviet Georgia to initiate an exchange agreement between UW–Parkside and Georgian Technical University. Later in the year, Chancellor Kaplan and Vice Chancellor John Stockwell travel to Ile-Ife, Nigeria to pen final details of an exchange agreement with Obafemi Awolowo University
*1991 April: A human-protein experiment coordinated by Associate Chemistry Professor Z. Richard Korszun launches into orbit aboard space shuttle Atlantis. Korszun invented a specialized device to "grow" crystallized human protein samples in the weightlessness of space. It is hoped the crystals will provide "road maps" to the structure of proteins.
*1991 September: Ken "Red" Oberbruner, who compiled a 332-229 record as UW–Parkside's baseball coach from 1970 to 1991, dies. He was the seventh winningest coach in NCAA Division II baseball. His son, Jamey, was inducted into the UW–Parkside Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995 for his stellar baseball career from 1978-81.
*1992 July: Two race walkers with UW–Parkside ties compete in the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Michelle Marter-Rohl, '89, English, finishes 20th. Debi Spino-Lawrence, a member of the University's race walking team, finishes 26th. Marter-Rohl went on to compete in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, finishing 14th in the 10k race. She had the best time of the U.S. race walkers.
*1992 August: Coach Gary Barnett brings his Northwestern Wildcats football team north for a new preseason tradition: Camp Kenosha. The team continues to hold its fall drills at UW–Parkside.

*1994 April: Eleanor J. Smith, vice president for academic affairs and provost at the William Paterson College of New Jersey, is named UW–Parkside's fourth chancellor at a Board of Regents meeting held on the UW–Parkside campus. Smith assumes her new post in mid-May 1994.
*1994 A project that grew from the 25th anniversary celebration, the UW–Parkside Nature Trail includes 10 geologic and historic markers around the nearly {{convert|700|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus. Eventually, the project will include a printed guide and signs marking more than 140 species of trees.
*1996 May: The University of Wisconsin–Parkside is granted professional accreditation of its School of Business by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]]. The AACSB, headquartered in St. Louis, Mo., is generally regarded as being the world's most prestigious accreditor of business school programs. Only approximately 25 percent of all business schools in the country are accredited by the AACSB.
*1996 Fall: International Business Machines (IBM) donates an AS/400 computer worth $353,000 to UW–Parkside as part of a program to increase the number of employees with experience on the popular server. The computer is to be integrated into the management information systems curriculum in the Department of Business. It is the same computer that helped run the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.
*1997 May: After three years as chancellor, Eleanor Smith resigns her post. Gordon Lamb, president emeritus of Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago, is named interim chancellor by UW System President Katharine Lyall.
*1998 March: The UW System Board of Regents names John Keating, provost of the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, UW–Parkside's fifth chancellor. Keating's extensive credentials include establishing two branch campuses at the University of Washington. Keating begins as chancellor July 1.

* 2011 February 1–3: The school is shut down for two and a half days because of a massive snowstorm, which dumps nearly two feet of snow on the area the night of February 1. Many professors cancel classes on an individual basis even before the closing at 3:00 PM on the 1st, in anticipation of the difficulties ahead. Nearly 1000 students who live on campus are stranded, though the Brickstone Grill and Eatery remains open with limited service to provide for their needs.
