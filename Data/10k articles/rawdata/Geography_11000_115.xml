The '''A17 road''' is a road linking [[Newark-on-Trent]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]], to [[King's Lynn]] in [[Norfolk]]. It stretches for a distance of 62 miles travelling across the flat Fen landscapes of southern Lincolnshire and western Norfolk.

== Usage ==

The A17 is a major route for HGVs accessing Norfolk from Northern England and the Midlands and also a major holiday route in the summer months for cars and caravans making their way to the seaside resorts of [[Hunstanton]], [[Wells-next-the-Sea]], [[Sheringham]], [[Cromer]] and [[Great Yarmouth]] and is one of only two direct routes that links [[Norfolk]] with the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], the other being the [[A47 road|A47]]. The A17 has very few stretches of dual-carriageway (four in total) with the longest being the Sleaford bypass which is {{convert|3|mi|km}} long with the second longest at Beckingham which is just {{convert|1/2|mi}} long and the other two stretches are located at roundabouts in [[Long Sutton, Lincolnshire|Long Sutton]] and [[Sutton Bridge]] both of which are under {{convert|1/4|mi}} long, although in addition there are several stretches of dual carriageway at junctions. It is one of two main routes for residents of East Anglia to get to the [[North England|North of England]] (and vice versa) - the other is the [[A47 road|A47]] via Peterborough, which is a longer route but has more dual carriageway, particularly around Peterborough, though it too remains mostly single carriageway.

The A17 was formerly a trunk road, but was reclassified as a principal road (maintained by the local authority) in 2002. The A47 retains trunk road status as far as its junction with the A1.

=== Hazards ===

The road carries more traffic than it was designed to carry. It also carries many goods vehicles that must travel at or below {{convert|50|mph}} on the stretches of single carriageway. Impatient drivers take risks when gaps in the oncoming traffic allow. In the summer there are many caravans off to [[Great Yarmouth]] and the north Norfolk coast. The main meeting points at roundabouts of the A52, A15 and A16 routinely cause long queues. The section through [[South Holland, Lincolnshire|South Holland]] is also heavily used by tractors.

== History ==

The western end of the road used to begin at the former A46 junction in [[Newark-on-Trent]] where ''Queens Road'' met ''North Gate'' (former A46). It then followed ''Sleaford Road'' and ''Beacon Hill Road'', meeting the A1 and passing through [[Coddington, Nottinghamshire|Coddington]] as ''Beckingham Road'' then ''Sleaford Lane''. On the former section in Newark, when the Beacon Hill Bridge over the [[East Coast Main Line]] was replaced, the explosion to demolish the old bridge on 12 November 1961 put four construction workers in hospital.

== Route ==

[[File:A17 ,A46 Roundabout - geograph.org.uk - 1327434.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Western terminus of the A17 at the heavily congested Winthorpe roundabout]]
The western end begins in [[Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire]], on the eastern side of the Newark bypass, where it meets the [[A46 road|A46]] at a busy roundabout next to the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] ''Winthorpe Service Station'', with access to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]. This section passes over the former [[RAF Winthorpe]] (now [[Newark Air Museum]] and the Newark &amp; Nottinghamshire Agricultural Society Showground), and there is a roundabout for Newlink Business Park and the national distribution centre of Dixons and Currys. It meets the former route from Coddington at the Coddington Moor roundabout]. There is a right turn for Newark Golf Club and a right turn for [[Barnby in the Willows]]. From College Plantation to Beckingham Bridge over the [[River Witham]], the road follows the boundary between Lincolnshire (to the north) and Nottinghamshire (to the south), slightly to the north. The road also enters [[North Kesteven]]. It crosses the [[River Witham]] as part of the dual-carriageway [[Beckingham, Lincolnshire|Beckingham]] Bypass which was built in 1972 at a cost of £600,000, where there is a left turn for Beckingham Training Camp, and [[Carlton-le-Moorland]]. It returns to its former route and passes through [[Brant Broughton and Stragglethorpe]], and there is a dangerous crossroads for [[Stragglethorpe]] to the right and [[Brant Broughton]], to the left. This is one of the most accident-prone junctions in Lincolnshire. It passes across Leadenham Low Fields, with the [[Lincoln Cliff]] seen in the distance.

[[File:A17 eastbound crossing Leadenham low fields - geograph.org.uk - 1404337.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Approaching Leadenham from the west with the [[Lincoln Cliff]] in the distance]]
Leadenham is built on the side of the Lincoln Cliff, and the road used to pass through, where it met the [[A607 road|A607]] at traffic lights. In March 1995, the £3.3&amp;nbsp;million bypass was opened and the route passes through Leadenham Park to the south of the village. It ascends the Lincoln Cliff as a three laned road ([[2+1 road]]), and passes under the A607 where there is no junction. The Leadenham Bypass had been planned for over thirty years, and had started out as a dual carriageway which would have been the safest option (but more expensive) for the amount of traffic that the road carries. At the point where it crosses the former Grantham to Lincoln Line, it enters [[South Kesteven]], at [[Fulbeck]]. There is an embankment as it ascends the rest of the Lincoln Cliff at Fulbeck Hilltop Plantation, and follows a former country lane the east of Fulbeck. It meets the former route (with access for ''Pottergate Road'' to [[Wellingore]], and the A607) and passes across Fulbeck Heath.

[[File:Byard's Leap Cafe and Byard's Leap Lodge - geograph.org.uk - 1001828.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Byard's Leap cafe]]
At [[Cranwell and Byard's Leap]], it re-enters [[North Kesteven]] at the line of the north-south [[Ermine Street]] (now the [[Viking Way]]). The road used to briefly follow Ermine Street southwards to [[Byards Leap|Byard's Leap]] with its cafe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1001828|title=Geograph:: Byard's Leap Cafe and Byard's Leap Lodge (C) Jeff Tomlinson|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then eastwards to the current route at the B1429 junction. The road now passes slightly further to the north, with a right turn  for the [[High Dyke, Lincolnshire|B6403]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1339518|title=Geograph:: A17 junction with the B6403 at Byard's... (C) Glyn Drury|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a left turn for the B1429 for [[RAF Cranwell]]. In [[North Rauceby]], it passes along the southern edge of the airfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2110357|title=Geograph:: A17 near Cranwell (C) Richard Croft|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a crossroads for [[Cranwell]], to the left, and North Rauceby, to the south. At Windmill plantation, the road has been straightened, entering the parish of [[Sleaford]]. There is a service station and transport cafe on the left hand side.

[[File:The A17 - Kirkby la Thorpe - geograph.org.uk - 1548378.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Kirkby la Thorpe]] end of the Sleaford bypass]]
It meets the north-south [[A15 road (England)|A15]] at the ''Holdingham Roundabout'', near the ''Jolly Scotchman'' (on the B1518 - the former route). There is the Sleaford [[Little Chef]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littlechef.co.uk/findalittlechef/restaurant/id/172|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820040633/http://littlechef.co.uk/findalittlechef/restaurant/id/172|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 August 2011|title=Restaurant Details : Little Chef|date=20 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the  Sleaford [[Travelodge UK|Travelodge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/info?hotelId=177|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928180442/http://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/info?hotelId=177|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 September 2011|title=Travelodge - Sleaford hotel - Sleaford hotels|date=28 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Total S.A.|TOTAL]] ''Holdingham Service Station''. On the former route to Sleaford there is a [[McDonald's]] and the [[Texaco]] ''Hockmeyer Motors''. Sleaford was bypassed by the A17 on 27 March 1975, when opened by [[Joseph Godber]]. The section from the A15 to the A153 had earlier been opened on 14 November 1973. It is the only substantial section of dual-carriageway on the route, and the main opportunity to overtake caravans and lorries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/952672|title=Geograph:: Approach to A15 and A17 roundabout at... (C) Mick Lobb|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is the [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] ''Bone Mill Junction'' with the [[A153 road|A153]], which shares the route from Holdingham, and the B1517 for Sleaford. It crosses the [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line]],  then the [[River Slea]] and the [[Spires and Steeples Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/627458|title=Geograph:: A17 bridge over the river Slea (C) Jim Thornton|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; East of here to the road's eastern terminus, the landscape is flat. At [[Kirkby la Thorpe]] it [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/359299 meets] the former route from Sleaford, near the ''[http://thequeensheadinn.com Queens Head]''. The former route has a 13&amp;nbsp;ft 9in [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/359304 low] (railway) ''Boston Road Bridge'', another important reason for building the bypass. From here to [[Swineshead, Lincolnshire|Swineshead]], the road follows the [[Poacher Line|railway]] from Sleaford to Boston. There is a left turn for [[Asgarby, Sleaford|Asgarby]], and a right turn for [[Burton Pedwardine]].

[[File:Abbey Parks farm shop - geograph.org.uk - 849596.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Abbey Parks farm shop in East Heckington]]
At [[Heckington]], the £2.5&amp;nbsp;million {{convert|2.8|mi|adj=on}} bypass was opened on 14 December 1982 by [[Lynda Chalker, Baroness Chalker of Wallasey]]. The former route is the B1394, and meets the A17 east of the village at the point where it is crossed by a 400 kV pylon line. A mile east of Heckington, it crosses the [[Car Dyke]]. There is a left turn for the B1395, for [[South Kyme]], and the road forms the parish boundary between Heckington and [[Great Hale]] until the district boundary. At [[East Heckington]]. On the right is the Abbey Parks farm shop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/849596|title=Geograph:: Abbey Parks farm shop (C) Katy Walters|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; next to the [[Jet (brand)|JET]] (former [[BP]]) ''Four Winds Service Station'', then two hundred yards later there is the [[Jet (brand)|JET]] (former [[BP]]) ''De Rhodes Service Station'' on the left. At the Holland Dike, it enters the borough of [[Boston (borough)|Boston]] (the former [[Kesteven]]/[[Holland, Lincolnshire|Holland]] boundary).

[[File:Farmland near Bicker Bar, Lincs - geograph.org.uk - 84502.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Bicker Bar]]
At Swineshead Bridge there is a left turn for the A1121, for [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], and the road is crossed by the [[Poacher Line]] at a level crossing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2020547|title=Geograph:: Swineshead Bridge Crossing (C) Glyn Drury|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; next to the Barge Inn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/142272|title=Geograph:: The Barge Hotel, Swineshead Bridge,... (C) Rodney Burton|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swineshead railway station]]. [[Swineshead, Lincolnshire|Swineshead]] was bypassed in 1985, and the former route leaves at the  High Bridge Junction],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2020542|title=Geograph:: A17 Highbridge Junction, Swineshead (C) Glyn Drury|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; passing The Ivy farm shop, which is sister to the popular Manor Farm Shop. At [[Bicker, Lincolnshire|Bicker]], it meets the [[A52 road|A52]] at the ''Bicker Bar Roundabout'', next to the [[Texaco]] ''Bicker Bar Service Station'' and Supreme Inns. The road meets its former route. At Bank House at [[Wigtoft]], there is a right turn for the B1181, for Bicker. Wigtoft itself is bypassed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/358826|title=Geograph:: Burtoft Lane (South) © Donnylad cc-by-sa/2.0|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the south, by the £4.4&amp;nbsp;million {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} Wigtoft-Sutterton Bypass, which opened in July 1995. At [[Sutterton]], on the bypass, it meets the B1397 ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2155690 Spalding Road]'' at staggered crossroads, for [[Gosberton]], and Sutterton, which is the former A16 (Spalding to Boston). At Sutterton Roundabout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2392038|title=Geograph:: Sutterton Roundabout  A16, A17 (C) Alex McGregor|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Algarkirk]], it meets the [[A16 road (England)|A16]], which is built on the former [[Lincolnshire Loop Line]], and there is the [[BP]]  Service Station and  Sutterton [[Little Chef]] on the left hand side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlechef.co.uk/findalittlechef/restaurant/id/186|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006065413/http://www.littlechef.co.uk/findalittlechef/restaurant/id/186|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 October 2011|title=Restaurant Details : Little Chef|date=6 October 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/416361|title=Geograph:: Choice of Route (C) Donnylad|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fosdyke Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 432354.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Fosdyke Bridge]]
It passes [[Fosdyke]] to the west, where it crosses the [[River Welland]] at Fosdyke Bridge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/237732|title=Geograph:: Fosdyke Bridge (C) Tim Heaton|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; entering the district of [[South Holland, Lincolnshire|South Holland]] a few hundred yards south of the bridge near the Ship Inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shipinnfosdyke.com/contactus.html|title=Contact Us|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ship Inn Public House|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was built as a swing bridge in 1911&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/27045884@N05/4813322348|title=Fosdyke Bridge and River Welland, Lincolnshire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but replaced in 1989 with the current fixed span. The loss of swing stranded the coaster, JonSue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/27045884@N05/4813321652|title='Jonsue' - Fosdyke, Lincolnshire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the landward side. In March 1991 the ship was holed and sank when, on a falling tide, she settled on a dis-lodged limestone boulder used to reinforce the Welland channel and was cut up on site later the same year. The Macmillan Way crosses the river via this bridge also. At [[Moulton, Lincolnshire|Moulton]], there is a right turn for the B1357 for [[Moulton Seas End]]. At [[Whaplode]] as ''Washway Road'', it passes Saracen's Head. At this point the former road passed through Saracen's Head, [[Holbeach]] and [[Fleet Hargate]]. The bypass, New Washway Road from Saracen's Head to Laurel Lodge Farm, opened in 1989. It meets the [[A151 road|A151]] on a newly built £5.4 million roundabout which opened in December 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lincolnshirereporter.co.uk/2017/12/holbeach-peppermint-junction-completed-months-ahead-schedule/|title=Holbeach Peppermint Junction completed months ahead of schedule|website=lincolnshirereporter.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; , and there is also a roundabout for the B1168 (the former route through Holbeach). It passes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/37981|title=Geograph:: Holbeach Technology Park (C) Peter Latham|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Holbeach Technology Park]] and the [[George Farmer Technology and Language College]]. At [[Fleet, Lincolnshire|Fleet]] it passes farm shops and cafes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1486596|title=Geograph:: Farm Cafe &amp; Bar on A17 - Holbeach (C) Betty Longbottom|website=www.geograph.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; on both sides of the road with vintage military equipment including a [[Hawker Hunter]], and meets the B1515, the former route from Holbeach, west of [[Fleet Hargate]]. At [[Gedney, Lincolnshire|Gedney]] it meets the former route, with [[St Mary Magdalene Church, Gedney]] seen to the south.

[[File:Sutton Bridge power station - geograph.org.uk - 1525773.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Sutton Bridge Power Station]] ]]
It meets the B1359 (for Gedney Drove End) at a roundabout. The Long Sutton-Sutton Bridge bypass was opened in 1989. It bypasses [[Long Sutton, Lincolnshire|Long Sutton]], [[Little Sutton, Lincolnshire|Little Sutton]] and [[Sutton Bridge]]. It meets the B1390, for [[Sutton St James]], at a roundabout. It meets the B1359 (for Long Sutton), and the A1101, for [[Wisbech]], at a roundabout, and the [[BP]] ''Long Sutton Filling Station'', the Kings Lynn Long Sutton [[Travelodge UK|Travelodge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/info?hotelId=139|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928163032/http://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/info?hotelId=139|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 September 2011|title=Travelodge - Kings Lynn Long Sutton hotel - Kings hotels|date=28 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two roundabouts where it changes direction abruptly and crosses the Cross Keys swing bridge over the [[River Nene]] at [[Sutton Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1XPJ_Cross_Keys_Bridge_Sutton_Bridge_UK|title=Cross Keys Bridge Sutton Bridge UK - Wikipedia Entries on Waymarking.com|website=www.waymarking.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bridge retains its swing function necessary for access to Wisbech port for pleasure craft and small coasters. It was constructed as a shared road/rail bridge with the single line rail crossing on the west side. With the closure of the line the A17 was increased to two lanes but this bridge remains a congestion point to this day. To the south is the [[Sutton Bridge Power Station]] and following the river North for half a mile is the port of Sutton Bridge. Just east of the bridge the turning to the left provides access to the "Sir Peter Scott Walk" coastal path and "Snowgoose Trust" bird sanctuary.

The road follows an embankment close to the edge of [[The Wash]], and at [[Walpole Cross Keys]] it enters [[Norfolk]] and the district of [[King's Lynn and West Norfolk]]. The £3.14&amp;nbsp;million {{convert|6.8|mi|adj=on}} West of Kings Lynn - County Boundary section was opened on 14 December 1982 by [[Lynda Chalker, Baroness Chalker of Wallasey]]. In [[Terrington St Clement]], there is a crossroads at Balsam Field, for Tilney High End to the right, at which there is the African Violet Centre with a cafe. From this point all the way to the A47 junction, the road is the parish boundary between [[Clenchwarton]] to the north, and [[Tilney All Saints]] to the south. The former route passed through Terrington St Clement, Clenchwarton and [[West Lynn, Norfolk|West Lynn]]. The improved follows the former [[Spalding railway station|Spalding]] to [[South Lynn railway station|South Lynn]], part of the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]] (M&amp;GN), which closed on 2 March 1959. Whilst the A17 has a chequered accident record, not a single passenger was killed on this former railway. It meets the A47 at the start of the [[King's Lynn]] bypass at what’s known as the “Pullover Roundabout”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisbechstandard.co.uk/news/road-crash-at-the-pullover-roundabout-king-s-lynn-1-3959864&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/pullover-roundabout-at-kings-lynn-closed-1-5423556&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''A73''' is a former trunk route in [[Scotland]], that connects the [[M74 motorway|M74]] at [[Abington, South Lanarkshire|Abington]], Jct. 13 to the [[M80 motorway]] at [[Cumbernauld]]. Running for approximately {{convert|37|mi|km}}, it passes through the towns of [[Lanark]], [[Carluke]], [[Newmains]], [[Chapelhall]] and [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]]. Formerly a main route connecting the north of Scotland to [[England]] it has less importance these days, and is now merely a local feeder to the two motorways with which it connects.

The sections between Abington &amp; Carluke and Cumbernauld &amp; Newhouse were the first sections to be downgraded from a trunk route to a secondary route, following the construction of the shorter [[M73 motorway|M73]] further west, which connected the M74 at Jct. 4. This motorway removed the need for vehicles from the north to use the A73 to reach England.

Following this downgrading, the remaining section of A73 between Carluke and [[Newhouse, North Lanarkshire|Newhouse]] remained a trunk route for vehicles travelling between [[Glasgow]] and [[Peebles]]. For this reason, two new sections of dual carriageway were built between [[Bellside]] &amp; Newmains and Bogside &amp; [[Law]], as well as a new bypass for the town centre of Carluke, where the trunk route continues as the [[A721 road|A721]].

Eventually though, the M74 was completed and it became easier for vehicles travelling from Peebles to Glasgow, to use the [[A702 road|A702]] trunk route instead, which also joins the M74 at Abington.

For this reason, the entire length of the A73 was downgraded to a secondary route, although it is still heavily trafficked, especially between Lanark and the M8 at Newhouse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">[[Image:Bioretention cell rain garden US winter.jpg|thumb|A bioretention cell, also called a [[rain garden]], in the [[United States]]. It is designed to treat polluted [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from an adjacent parking lot. Plants are in winter dormancy.]]

'''Bioretention''' is the process in which contaminants and [[sedimentation]] are removed from [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Stormwater is collected into the treatment area which consists of a grass buffer strip, sand bed, ponding area, [[organic matter|organic]] layer or [[mulch]] layer, planting [[soil]], and plants. Runoff passes first over or through a sand bed, which slows the runoff's velocity, distributes it evenly along the length of the ponding area, which consists of a surface [[organic matter|organic]] layer and/or [[groundcover]] and the underlying planting soil. The ponding area is graded, its center depressed. Water is ponded to a depth of {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} and gradually infiltrates the bioretention area or is [[Evapotranspiration|evapotranspired]]. The bioretention area is graded to divert excess runoff away from itself. Stored water in the bioretention area planting soil exfiltrates over a period of days into the underlying soils.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact"&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Bioretention |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=200044BE.txt |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-832-F-99-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filtration==
Each of the components of the bioretention area is designed to perform a specific function. The grass buffer strip reduces incoming runoff velocity and filters [[particulate]]s from the runoff. The sand bed also reduces the velocity, filters particulates, and spreads flow over the length of the bioretention area. [[Aeration]] and drainage of the planting soil are provided by the {{convert|0.5|m|in|abbr=on}} deep sand bed. The ponding area provides a temporary storage location for runoff prior to its [[evaporation]] or [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]. Some particulates not filtered out by the grass filter strip or the sand bed settle within the ponding area.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact" /&gt;

The [[organic matter|organic]] or [[mulch]] layer also filters [[Water pollution|pollutants]] and provides an environment conducive to the growth of [[microorganism]]s, which degrade [[petroleum]]-based products and other [[organic matter|organic]] material. This layer acts in a similar way to the [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] in a forest and prevents the [[erosion]] and drying of underlying soils. Planted [[groundcover]] reduces the potential for erosion as well, slightly more effectively than mulch. The maximum sheet flow velocity prior to erosive conditions is 0.3 meters per second (1 foot per second) for planted groundcover and 0.9 meters per second (3 feet per second) for mulch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Clar |first1=M.L. |last2=Barfield |first2=B.J. |last3=O’Connor |first3=T.P. |date=2004 |title=Stormwater Best Management Practice Design Guide, Volume 2: Vegetative Biofilters |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=901X0B00.txt |publisher=EPA |location=Cincinnati, OH |id=EPA-600/R-04/121A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[clay]] in the planting soil provides [[adsorption]] sites for [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[nutrient]]s and other pollutants. Stormwater storage is also provided by the voids in the planting soil. The stored water and nutrients in the water and soil are then available to the plants for uptake. The layout of the bioretention area is determined after site constraints such as location of utilities, underlying soils, existing vegetation, and drainage are considered. Sites with [[loam]]y sand soils are especially appropriate for bioretention because the excavated soil can be backfilled and used as the planting soil, thus eliminating the cost of importing planting soil. An unstable surrounding soil stratum and soils with a clay content greater than 25 percent may preclude the use of bioretention, as would a site with slopes greater than 20 percent or a site with mature trees that would be removed during construction of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2009 |title=Bioretention Manual |url=http://www.co.pg.md.us/Government/AgencyIndex/DER/ESG/Bioretention/pdf/Bioretention%20Manual_2009%20Version.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108182559/http://www.co.pg.md.us/Government/AgencyIndex/DER/ESG/Bioretention/pdf/Bioretention%20Manual_2009%20Version.pdf |archive-date=2011-01-08 |publisher=Prince George's County Department of Environmental Resources |location=Largo, MD |pages=6, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy metal remediation==
Contaminant trace metals such as [[zinc]], [[lead]], and [[copper]] are found in [[stormwater runoff]] from impervious surfaces (e.g. roadways and sidewalks). Treatment systems such as rain gardens and stormwater planters utilize a bioretention layer to remove heavy metals in stormwater runoff. Dissolved forms of heavy metals may bind to sediment particles in the roadway that are then captured by the bioretention system. Additionally, heavy metals may adsorb to soil particles in the bioretention media as the runoff filters through.&lt;ref&gt;Li, H., &amp; Davis, A. P. (2008). {{doi|10.1021/es702681j}} "Heavy metal capture and accumulation in bioretention media." Environmental science &amp; technology, 42(14), 5247-5253.&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory experiments, bioretention cells removed 94%, 88%, 95%, and &gt;95% of zinc, copper, lead, and [[cadmium]], respectively from water with metal concentrations typical of stormwater runoff. While this is a great benefit for water quality improvement, bioretention systems have a finite capacity for heavy metal removal. This will ultimately control the lifetime of bioretention systems, especially in areas with high heavy metal loads.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, X., &amp; Davis, A. P. (2007).[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0045653506010927/1-s2.0-S0045653506010927-main.pdf?_tid=325fb1ca-8149-11e4-9703-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1418311390_040bf304a2459b6fcaaeff49731195a6 "Heavy metal fates in laboratory bioretention systems."] Chemosphere, 66(9), 1601-1609.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Metal removal by bioretention cells in cold climates was similar or slightly lower than that in warmer environments. Plants are less active in colder seasons, suggesting that most of the heavy metals remain in the bioretention media rather than being taken up by plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;Muthanna, T. M., Viklander, M., Gjesdahl, N., &amp; Thorolfsson, S. T. (2007).[http://search.proquest.com/docview/746872016/ "Heavy metal removal in cold climate bioretention."] Water, air, and soil pollution, 183(1-4), 391-402.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, removal and replacement of the bioretention layer will become necessary in areas with heavy metal pollutants in stormwater runoff to extend the life of the treatment system.

==Economy==
''For statistics relating to economy, please see [[Economy of the European Union]]''.

===EU budget===
The primary resource for funding the European Union is the contributions sought from member states. Each member state contributes to the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]], and receives funding back from the EU, depending on the relative wealth of the states, i.e. their ability to pay.

The table below shows the contributions as a percentage of the total budget. This takes into account the special considerations given to the United Kingdom to reduce its contribution through a [[UK rebate|rebate]]. Expenditure in Luxembourg, Belgium and France include items for the EU administrative centres in each of those countries.

The [[Human Development Index]] is a measure produced by the United Nations which covers three aspects of human development:
* poverty (GDP per capita)
* education ([[mean years of schooling]] and [[expected years of schooling]])
* health ([[life expectancy]])
The rankings of the table refer to the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|UNDP Human Development Report 2014]] (2013 data). The UN lists all EU member states except Romania and Bulgaria as countries with '''&lt;span style="color:#090"&gt;very high&lt;/span&gt;''' human development.

[[Income inequality metrics|Income inequality]], measured by the [[gini coefficient]] is how evenly incomes are distributed through the population. [[Denmark]] has the least income inequality with a gini coefficient score of 24.4, whilst [[Portugal]] has the most income inequality with a score of 38.5. [[Malta]], Luxembourg, and [[Cyprus]] have no statistics available, and so are not included in this table. These statistics have been compiled by the United Nations (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20061113192636/http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/])

'''Felipe González de Ahedo''', also spelled '''Phelipe González y Haedo''' (13 May 1714 in [[Santoña]], [[Cantabria]] &amp;ndash; 26 October 1802), was a Spanish [[navigator]] and [[cartographer]] known for annexing [[Easter Island]] in 1770.

González de Ahedo commanded two Spanish ships, the ''San Lorenzo'' and the ''Santa Rosalia,'' sent by the [[Viceroy of Peru]], [[Manuel de Amat y Juniet]]. They landed on 1770 November 15, only the second time European had seen Easter Island, and stayed five days, thoroughly surveyed the coast, and named it ''Isla de San Carlos,'' taking possession on behalf of King [[Charles III of Spain]]. They ceremoniously signed a treaty of annexation with the inhabitants and erected three wooden crosses on top of three small hills on [[Poike]] volcano.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Anne Van Tilburg.

'''Futa Toro''' ([[Wolof language|Wolof]] and {{lang-ff|Fuuta Tooro}}; {{lang-fr|Fouta-Toro}}), often simply the '''Futa''', is a semidesert region around the middle run of the [[Senegal River]]. This region is along the border of [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]]. It is well watered and fertile close to the river, but the interior parts of the region away from the river is porous, dry and infertile.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Fouta Fouta, Senegal], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; This region is historically significant for the Islamic theocracies, Fulani states, jihad armies and migrants for [[Fouta Djallon]] that emerged from here.&lt;ref name=gates496&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sohail H.

==Geography==
The Futa Toro stretches for about 400 kilometers, but of a narrow width of up to 20 kilometers on either side of the Senegal River.&lt;ref name=barry12/&gt; The western part is called Toro, the central and eastern parts called Futa. The central portion include Bosea, Yirlabe Hebbyabe, Law and Hailabe provinces. The eastern Futa includes Ngenar and Damga provinces. The region north and east to Futa Toro is barren Sahara. Historically, each of the Futa Toro geographical provinces were fertile pockets of land due to the ''waalo'' flood plains present, and the control of this resource was driven by kin-based families. The long stretch meant the whole region was divided among many families, and the succession property rights from one generation to next led to many family disputes, political crises and conflicts.&lt;ref name=barry12&gt;{{cite book|author=Boubacar Barry|title=Senegambia and the Atlantic Slave Trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rC7TYWPT--8C&amp;pg=PA12|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59226-0|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word Futa was a general name the Fulbe gave to any area they lived in, while Toro was the actual identity of the region for its inhabitants. The people of the kingdom spoke [[Pulaar]], a dialect of the greater [[Fula language|Fula]] languages spanning West Africa from [[Senegal]] to [[Cameroon]]. They identified themselves by the language giving rise to the name Haalpulaar'en meaning those who speak Pulaar. The Haalpulaar'en are also known as [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleurs]] (var. ''Tukolor''), a name derived from the ancient state of [[Tekrur]].

[[Islam]] arrived in the region in its early stages. The [[Toucouleur people]] of this region converted by the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Appiah; Henry Louis Gates (2010). Encyclopedia of Africa. Oxford University Press. pp. 500–501. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533770-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region saw many Islamic powers thereafter. The state of [[Denanke]] (1495/1514-1776) saw the origin of the modern Tukolor people.  Migrations of the Fulbe left states in Futa Toro and [[Futa Jallon]] to the south.

[[Image:FoutaToro1818.jpg|thumb|left|The army of Futa Toro in march (1820).]]
The rise of the [[Imamate of Futa Toro]] in 1776 sparked a series of Islamic reform movements and jihads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nehemia Levtzion|author2=Randall Pouwels|title=The History of Islam in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1Ipt5A9mLMC&amp;pg=PA77|year=2000|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-4461-0|pages=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gates496/&gt; Small clans of educated Fula [[Sufi]] Muslims (the ''[[Torodbe]]'') seized power in states across West Africa.

In the 1780s Abdul Kader became almaami (religious leader or imam) but his forces were unable to spread revolution to the surrounding states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e688?_hi=3&amp;_pos=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imamate of Futa Toro later became the inspiration and the prime recruiting ground for the [[jihad]]s of [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] conqueror al-Hajj [[Umar Tall]] and anti-colonial rebel al-Hajj [[Mahmadu Lamine]]. Despite resistance, the Futa Toro was firmly in the hands of [[French West Africa|French Colonial forces]] moving from modern [[Senegal]] by 1900.  Upon independence, the region's heart, the southern bank of the Senegal River was retained by Senegal.  The north bank became part of [[Mauritania]].

The great modern [[Senegal]]ese musician and [[worldbeat]] star [[Baaba Maal]] comes from the town of [[Podor]] in the Futa Toro.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2921">'''GNSS reflectometry''' involves making measurements from the reflections from the Earth of navigation signals from [[GNSS|Global Navigation Satellite Systems]] such as [[GPS]]. It is also known as ''GPS reflectometry''.

Deliberately bouncing signals off something to learn about it (e.g. [[radar]], [[acoustic location|echolocation]]) is ''active sensing''; sensing what is already available in the surrounding environment without changing the environment to do so (e.g. eyesight, hearing) is ''passive sensing''. GNSS reflectometry is [[Passive radar|passive sensing]] that takes advantage of and relies on separate active sources - the satellites generating the navigation signals.

The [[UK-DMC|UK-DMC satellite]], part of the [[Disaster Monitoring Constellation]] built by [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]], carries a secondary reflectometry payload that has demonstrated the feasibility of receiving and measuring GPS signals reflected from the surface of the Earth's oceans from its track in [[low Earth orbit]] to determine wave motion and windspeed.&lt;ref name="reflect"&gt;S. Gleason ''et al.'', Processing of bistatically reflected GPS signals from low Earth orbit for the purpose of ocean remote

GPS signal reflections have also been used to measure soil moisture and snow depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/929/2 GPS: Got plenty of snow?], Phil Berardelli, ScienceNOW Daily News, 29 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{MapLibrary|EquatorialGuinea_sat.png|Equatorial Guinea}}

The Republic of '''[[Equatorial Guinea]]''' is located in west central [[Africa]]. [[Bioko|Bioko Island]] lies about {{convert|40|km|mi|1|sp=us}} from [[Cameroon]]. [[Annobón]] Island lies about {{convert|595|km|mi|0}} southwest of Bioko Island. The larger continental region of [[Rio Muni]] lies between Cameroon and [[Gabon]] on the mainland; it includes the islands of [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], [[Elobey Chico]], and adjacent islets.

Bioko Island, called Fernando Po until the 1970s, is the largest island in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] - {{convert|2017|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}. It is shaped like a boot, with two large volcanic formations separated by a valley that bisects the island at its narrowest point. The {{convert|195|km|mi|0|adj=on|sp=us}} coastline is steep and rugged in the south but lower and more accessible in the north, with excellent harbors at [[Malabo]] and [[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]], and several scenic beaches between those towns.

On the continent, Rio Muni covers {{convert|26003|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}. The coastal plain gives way to a succession of valleys separated by low hills and spurs of the [[Crystal Mountains (Africa)|Crystal Mountains]]. The [[Rio Benito]] (Mbini) which divides Rio Muni in half, is unnavigable except for a 20-kilometer stretch at its estuary. Temperatures and humidity in Rio Muni are generally lower than on Bioko Island.

Annobon Island, named for its discovery on New Year's Day 1472, is a small volcanic island covering {{convert|18|km2|sqmi|1|sp=us}}. The coastline is abrupt except in the north; the principal volcanic cone contains a small lake. Most of the estimated 1,900 inhabitants are fisherman specializing in traditional, smallscale tuna fishing and whaling. The climate is tropical—heavy rainfall, high humidity, and frequent seasonal changes with violent windstorms.

'''Location:'''
Western [[Africa]], bordering the [[Bight of Biafra]], between [[Cameroon]] and [[Gabon]].

== Boundaries ==
Equatorial Guinea's land boundaries total 528&amp;nbsp;km. It borders [[Cameroon]] (183&amp;nbsp;km) in the north and [[Gabon]] (345&amp;nbsp;km) in the east and south.

'''Maritime claims:'''
territorial sea:
{{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}

exclusive economic zone:
{{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}}

== Climate ==
The climate of both the continental region and the islands is typically equatorial, with high temperatures, heavy rainfall, and much cloud cover most of the year. Local variations are due to differences in altitude and proximity to the sea. The wet seasons in the continental region are from February to June and from September to December. Rainfall is higher on the coast than inland. In Bata the rainiest months are September, October, and November, with rainfall averaging more than {{convert|94|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} a year. At Calatrava, farther south on the coast, it sometimes reaches {{convert|180|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Inland, however, rainfall diminishes; [[Micomeseng|Mikomeseng]], for example, receives only about {{convert|58|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The average annual temperature is about {{convert|79|F|C|1}} and is fairly constant throughout the year. The temperature maxima are somewhat lower than in Bioko. The relative humidity, however, is higher than in Bioko. Bioko has a rather debilitating climate. The so-called dry season lasts from November to March, and the rest of the year is rainy. The average annual temperature of about {{convert|77|F|C}} varies little throughout the year. Afternoon temperatures reach the high 80s °F (low 30s °C) and drop to only about {{convert|70|F|C|1}} at night. Most of the time the sky is cloudy and overcast. Extreme rainfall occurs in the south, with rain brought by monsoon winds amounting to about {{convert|450|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} a year around San Antonio de Ureca.

The '''geology of Madagascar''' comprises a variety of rocks of [[Precambrian]] age which make up the larger part of the east and centre of the island. They are intruded by [[basalt]]s and [[rhyolite]]s of [[Mesozoic]] to [[Cenozoic]] age. In contrast, the western part of the island is formed from [[sedimentary]] rocks of [[Carboniferous]] to [[Quaternary]] age. [[Archean]] rocks occur from the northeast portion of the island down to the south in the Ranotsara shear zone. Rocks in the northern portion of Madagascar are greenstone belts, from the Archean or Paleoproterozoic age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisourcebook.org/1235_Madagascar.html|title=Madagascar, geology Extractive Industries Source Book|access-date=October 23, 2016|website=Extractive Industries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tectonics ==
A NW-SE trending sinistral shear belt separates northern and southern crustal terranes. The Ampanihy ductile shear zone was created by flattening events associated with granulite metamorphism, isoclinal folding, flattened sheaths, steep to vertical foliations and sheath-like geometry of massif-type anorthosite bodies.&lt;ref name="geoatlas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlüter|first=Thomas|title=Geological Atlas of Africa: With Notes on Stratigraphy, Tectonics, Economic Geology, Geohazards, Geosites and Geoscientific Education of Each Country|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|url={{Google books|IfvKWpsISTQC|page=144|plainurl=yes}}|access-date=October 23, 2016|date=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}}

== Paleontology ==
{{see also|List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Madagascar}}
The [[Maevarano Formation]], dated to late [[Maastrichtian]] age, has provided a diverse faunal assemblage, including the giant frog ''[[Beelzebufo]]'', [[gondwanathere]] mammals, [[dinosaur]]s, crocodylians and other groups. The [[Middle Jurassic]] [[Isalo III Formation]] contains fossil dinosaurs. Typical [[Gondwana]]n flora of ''[[Glossopteris]]'' is found in the [[Permian]] formations in Madagascar.

== Economic geology ==
Madagascar is the world's leading producer many colored [[gemstone]]s, including [[sapphire]]s, [[ruby (gemstone)|rubies]], multi-coloured [[tourmaline]]s, [[emerald]]s, [[amethyst]]s, [[cordierite]]s, [[aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]]s and [[garnet]]s. Madagascar is also a major source of [[graphite]], making it the second-largest producer in Africa. Additionally, Madagascar is Africa's third leading producer of [[chromite]].&lt;ref name="EI1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisourcebook.org/1478_ExtractiveIndustries.html|title=Extractive Industries: Mining|website=Extractive Industries|access-date=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titanium oxide is found in significant quantities in beach sands located near Toalagnaro, however, 75% of the coastal forest zone in that area would have to be destroyed in order to exploit it, which has not been done.&lt;ref name="geoatlas" /&gt;

Huge oil fields lie to the west of Madagascar, however they would require steam injection to extract, which is both technologically difficult and expensive. The oil fields of [[Tsimiroro Field|Tsimiroro]] and [[Bemolanga Field|Bemolanga]] are estimated to hold combined reserves of 11.5 billion barrels.&lt;ref name="EI1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15140">The '''FAO geopolitical ontology''' is an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] developed by the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)]] to describe, manage and exchange data related to geopolitical entities such as countries, territories, regions and other similar areas.

==Definitions and examples==
An [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] is a kind of dictionary that describes information  in a certain domain using concepts and relationships. It is often implemented using [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] (Web Ontology Language), an [[XML]]-based standard language  that can be interpreted by computers.

* A ''Concept'' is defined as abstract knowledge. For example, in the geopolitical ontology a [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self-governing territory]] or a [[geographical region|geographical group]] are concepts. Concepts are explicitly implemented in the ontology with individuals and classes:
** An ''individual'' is defined as an object perceived from the real world. In the geopolitical domain   [[Ethiopia]] or the [[least developed countries]] group are individuals.
** A ''class'' is defined as a set of individuals sharing common properties. In the geopolitical domain, [[Ethiopia]], [[Republic of Korea]] or [[Italy]] are individuals of the class ''self-governing'' territory; and [[least developed countries]] is an individual of the class ''special group''.
* Relationships between concepts are explicitly implemented by:
** ''[[Object (computer science)|Object]] properties'' between individuals of two classes. For example, ''has member'' and ''is in group'' properties, as shown in Figure 1.
** ''[[Datatype]] properties'' between individuals and literals or [[XML]] datatypes. For example, the individual [[Afghanistan]] has the datatype property ''CodeISO3'' with the value "AFG".
** ''Restrictions'' in classes and/or properties. For example, the property ''official English name'' of the class ''self-governing'' territory has been restricted to have only ''one'' value, this means that a self-governing territory (or country) can only have one internationally recognized official English name.&lt;ref&gt;Official names of countries from [http://www.fao.org/faoterm/nocs/pages/homeNocs.jsp?members=allC&amp;lang=en&amp;lang2=en FAO terminology database]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Concepts November 19 2008 v 2.png|thumb|600px|center|Figure 1. An example of concepts and relationship in the geopolitical ontology.]]

The advantage of describing information in an ontology is that it enables to acquire [[domain knowledge]] by defining hierarchical structures of classes, adding individuals, setting object properties and datatype properties, and assigning restrictions.

==FAO ontology==
The geopolitical ontology provides names in seven languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, English, Spanish, Russian and Italian) and identifiers in various international coding systems ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO2]], [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3|ISO3]], [[AGROVOC]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090219154825/http://www.fao.org/faoterm/index.asp?lang=en FAOTERM], [[Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)|GAUL]], [[UN]], [[List of UNDP country codes|UNDP]] and [[DBPedia]]ID codes) for territories and groups. Moreover, the [[FAO]] geopolitical ontology tracks historical changes from 1985 up until today;&lt;ref&gt;Country or area code changes since 1982:  [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49chang.htm United Nations Statistics Division - country or area codes added or changed]&lt;/ref&gt; provides [[geolocation]] (geographical coordinates); implements relationships among [[countries]] and countries, or countries and groups, including properties such as ''has border with'', ''is predecessor of'', ''is successor of'', ''is administered by'', ''has members'', and ''is in group''; and disseminates country statistics including country area, land area, agricultural area, [[GDP]] or [[population]].

The FAO geopolitical ontology provides a structured description of data sources. This includes: source name, source identifier, source creator and source's update date. Concepts are described using the [[Dublin Core]] vocabulary (http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description).

In summary, the main objectives of the FAO geopolitical ontology are:

* To provide the most updated geopolitical information (names, codes, relationships, statistics)
* To track historical changes in geopolitical information
* To improve information management and facilitate standardized data sharing of geopolitical information
* To demonstrate the benefits of the geopolitical ontology to improve [[interoperability]] of [[corporate]] [[information systems]]

It is possible to '''download''' the FAO geopolitical ontology in [http://aims.fao.org/geopolitical.owl OWL] and [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/ RDF] formats. Documentation is available in the [[FAO Country Profiles]] [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo.asp?lang=en Geopolitical information] web page.

==Features of the FAO ontology==
The geopolitical ontology contains :

*Area types:&lt;ref&gt;When an area (territory or group) changed but kept the same name, the ontology differentiates the two areas by sub-fixing the name of the obsolete one with the year (e.g. “FAO 2006”). The year indicates the beginning of validity of that particular area.&lt;/ref&gt;
**Territories: [[List of sovereign states|self-governing]], [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self-governing]], [[Disputed area|disputed]], other.&lt;ref&gt;The area type ''Other'' is used for [[Antarctica]] which has no government and belongs to no country. See also [[Antarctica#Politics|Politics in Antarctica]].&lt;/ref&gt;
**Groups: [[organizations]], [[subregion|geographic]], [[economic union|economic]] and special groups.&lt;ref&gt;Special groups term is used for non-economical or greographical territory groups like the [[Small Island Developing States]], [[Landlocked countries|Land Locked Countries]], Low Income Food Deficit Countries, [[Least Developed Countries]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Names &lt;ref&gt;UN official names: [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/uncsgnreports.htm Reports of the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130040044/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/uncsgnreports.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (official, short and names for lists) in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Russian and Italian.
*International codes: UN code – M49, [[ISO 3166]] Alpha-2 and Alpha-3, [[List of UNDP country codes|UNDP code]], [[Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)|GAUL]] code, FAOSTAT, [[AGROVOC]] FAOTERM and [[DBPedia]]ID.
*Coordinates: maximum [[latitude]], minimum [[latitude]], maximum [[longitude]], minimum [[longitude]].
*Basic country statistics: country area, land area, agricultural area, GDP, population.
*Currency names and codes.
*Adjectives of nationality.
*Relations:
**Groups membership.
**Neighbours (land [[border]]), administration of [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self-governing]].
**Historic changes: predecessor, successor, valid since,&lt;ref&gt;The value of the datatype property "validSince" is the first year of validity  of a territory or group. The geopolitical ontology traces back historic changes only until 1985. Therefore if an area has a validSince = 1985, this indicates that the area is valid at least since 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; valid until.&lt;ref&gt;The value of the datatype property "validUntil" is the last year of validity of the territory or group. In case the area is currently valid, this value is set by default to 9999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation into  OWL==
The [[FAO]] geopolitical ontology is implemented in [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]. It consists of classes, properties, individuals and restrictions. Table 1 shows all classes, gives a brief description and lists some individuals that belong to each class. Note that the current version of the geopolitical ontology does not provide individuals of the class "disputed" territories. Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate datatype properties and object properties.

== Geopolitical ontology in Linked Open Data ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Geopol LOD.png|thumb|200px|left|Figure 2. RDF version of FAO geopolitical ontology]]  --&gt;

The FAO Geopolitical ontology is embracing the W3C [[Linked Open Data]] (LOD) initiative&lt;ref&gt;http://linkeddata.org&lt;/ref&gt; and released its [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] version of the geopolitical ontology in March 2011. 
The term 'Linked Open Data' refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web. The key technologies that support Linked Data are URIs, HTTP and RDF.

The RDF version of the geopolitical ontology is compliant with all [http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html Linked data principles] to be included in the [http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod/ Linked Open Data cloud], as explained in the following.

==Resolvable http:// URIs ==
Every resource in the OWL format of the FAO Geopolitical Ontology has a unique URI. Dereferenciation was implemented to allow for three different URIs to be assigned to each resource as follows:  
* URI identifying the non-information  resource
* Information resource with an RDF/XML representation
* Information resource with an HTML representation
In addition the current URIs used for OWL format needed to be kept to allow for backwards compatibility for other systems that are using them. Therefore, the new URIs for the FAO Geopolitical Ontology in LOD were carefully created, using  “Cool URIs for Semantic Web”  and considering other good practices for URIs, such as DBpedia URIs.

==New URIs==
The URIs of the geopolitical ontology need to be permanent, consequently all transient information, such as year, version, or format was avoided in the definition of the URIs. 
The new URIs can be accessed at
http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/ 
For example, for the resource “Italy” the URIs are the following: 
;http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/Italy
: identifies the non-information resource. 
;http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/data/Italy
: identifies the resource with an RDF/XML representation. 
;http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/page/Italy
:identifies the information resource with an HTML representation.
In addition, “owl:sameAs” is used to map the new URIs to the OWL representation.

==Dereferencing URIs==
When a non-information resource is looked up without any specific representation format, then the server needs to redirect the request to information resource with an HTML representation. 
For example, to retrieve the resource “Italy” (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/Italy), which is a non-information resource, the server redirects to the html page of “Italy” (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/page/Italy).

==At least 1000 triples in the datasets==
The total number of triple statements in FAO Geopolitical Ontology is 22,495. 
At least 50 links to a dataset already in the current LOD Cloud:  
FAO Geopolitical Ontology has 195 links to [http://www.dbpedia.org DBpedia], which is already part of the LOD Cloud.

==Access to the entire dataset==
FAO Geopolitical Ontology provides the entire dataset as a RDF dump. It is available at http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/data

The RDF version of the FAO Geopolitical Ontology has been already registered in CKAN (http://ckan.net/package/fao-geopolitical-ontology) and it was requested to add it into the LOD Cloud.

==Example of use==
[[Image:Geopolitical Ontology in Country Profiles August 12 2009 v 1.png|thumb|200px|right|Figure 3. a website of introducing the geopolitical ontology in FAO Country Profiles.]]

The [[FAO Country Profiles]] is an information retrieval tool which groups the FAO's vast archive of information on its global activities in [[agriculture]] and [[rural development]] in one single area and catalogues it exclusively by country.

The [[FAO Country Profiles]] system provides access to country-based heterogeneous data sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/resources.asp Inventory of data sources used in the FAO country profiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925011534/http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/resources.asp |date=2009-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By using the  geopolitical ontology in the system, the following benefits are expected:&lt;ref&gt;[http://semanticweb.com/integrating-country-based-heterogeneous-data-at-the-united-nations-fao-s-geopolitical-ontology-and-services_b10681 Integrating country-based heterogeneous data at the United Nations: FAO's geopolitical ontology and services.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Enhanced system functionality for content aggregation and synchronization from the multiple source repositories.
* Improved information access and browsing through comparison of data in neighbor countries and groups.

Figure 3 shows a page in the [[FAO Country Profiles]] where the geopolitical ontology is described.

The '''Giardino Bardini''' is an [[Italian Renaissance garden]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. Opened only recently to the public, it is relatively little-known. 

==Features==
The garden boasts many statues and panoramic views over the city. Wildlife in the garden includes [[rock pigeon]]s, [[common blackbird|blackbird]]s and [[woodpigeon]]s.

==Visiting==
Access is gained via the Via de' Bardi, just over the road from the [http://www.bardinipeyron.it/bardini/ Museo Bardini] in the [[Oltrarno]] district of the city, although the gardens exit onto the Costa di San Giorgio, onto which the [[Forte di Belevedere]] and the [[Giardino di Boboli]] connect in turn.

A '''''Haufendorf''''' is an enclosed village with irregular plots of land and farms of greatly differing scale, usually surrounded by a [[stockade]] fence (German: ''Ortsetter''). They are typically found in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, whence the name. ''Haufendörfer'' (pl.) differ from most other types of village in that they are irregularly laid out. A large number of ''Haufendörfer'' emerged in connexion with the medieval [[open field system]] (''Gewanneflur''), where each farmer farmed strips of different fields and the location of these field strips continually changed. The district (''Gemarkung'') was divided into the village core (''Dorfkern''), field system (''Ackerflur'') and common pasture (''Allmende'').

A ''Haufendorf'' is sometimes also referred to as a "clustered village" or "irregularly nucleated village".&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, Robert E (1964). ''Germany: A regional and economic geography'' (2nd ed.). London: Methuen, p. 134. {{ASIN|B000IOFSEQ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heathen Maiden''' ({{lang-sl|Ajdovska deklica}}) is a rock formation that resembles a female human face. It can be seen in the northern face of Mount [[Prisojnik]] near [[Kranjska Gora]], in the [[Julian Alps]] in northwestern [[Slovenia]]. It is associated with a legend about a [[chamois]] known as [[Goldenhorn]] and a [[nymph]] (''[[Slavic fairies|vila]]'') dwelling in the mountain.

==Legend==
[[File:Ajdovska deklica in the center of the photo.JPG|thumb|400px|The Heathen Maiden in the center]]
A nymph once foretold that a newborn would kill the chamois known as Goldenhorn. Upon hearing her prophecy, the other nymphs punished her by turning her into a rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kranjska-gora.si/Natural-beauty-spots/Ajdovska-deklica Ajdovska deklica], [[Municipality of Kranjska Gora]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Curaçao]]
*[[Saba]]
*[[Sint Eustatius]]
*[[Sint Maarten]]

'''Jacques Cartier''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒak kaʁtje}}; {{lang-br|Jakez Karter}}; December 31, 1491{{spaced ndash}}September 1, 1557) was a [[Breton people|Breton]] [[explorer]] who claimed what is now Canada for France. Jacques Cartier was the first European to describe and map&lt;ref&gt;His maps are lost but referenced in a letter by his nephew Jacques Noël, dated 1587 and printed by [[Richard Hakluyt]] with the ''Relation'' of Cartier's third voyage, in ''The Principall Navigations'' [...], London, G. Bishop, 1600.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the shores of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], which he [[Name of Canada|named "The Country of Canadas]]", after the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]] for the two big settlements he saw at [[Stadacona|Stadacona (Quebec City)]] and at [[Hochelaga (village)|Hochelaga (Montreal Island)]].&lt;ref name="CanEn-Cartier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001439|title=Cartier, Jacques|last=Trudel|first=Marcel|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=November 9, 2009}}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB-Cartier"&gt;{{Britannica|97444}}.{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Histori.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10123|title=Exploration&amp;nbsp;— Jacques Cartier|publisher=The Historica Dominion Institute|accessdate=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catholic-Cartier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03392b.htm|title=Jacques Cartier|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=November 9, 2009}}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jacques Cartier was born in 1491&lt;ref&gt;No baptismal certificate has been found, but Cartier stated his age in at least three letters. See Marcel Trudel, ''Histoire de la Nouvelle-France'', Fides, vol. 1, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Saint-Malo]], the port on the north-west coast of [[Brittany]]. Cartier, who was a respectable mariner, improved his social status in 1520 by marrying Mary Catherine des Granches, member of a leading family.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Axelrod. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cdu0uWIe9rMC&amp;pg=PA30 A Savage Empire: Trappers, Traders, Tribes, and the Wars That Made America]. Macmillan, 2011; p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; His good name in Saint-Malo is recognized by its frequent appearance in baptismal registers as godfather or witness.&lt;ref&gt;Biggar, H.P. (1930) ''A Collection of Documents relating to Jacques Cartier and the Sieur de Roberval'', Ottawa, Public Archives of Canada. Over 20 baptisms cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First voyage, 1534==
In 1534, two years after the [[Duchy of Brittany]] was formally united with France in the [[Union between Brittany and France|Edict of Union]], Cartier was introduced to King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] by [[Jean Le Veneur]], [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] of Saint-Malo and [[abbot]] of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], at the [[Manoir de Brion]]. The king had previously invited (although not formally commissioned) the [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] to explore the eastern coast of North America on behalf of France in 1524.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave Lanctôt]] observed that Cartier was absent from Saint-Malo's registers at the time and that his first voyage in 1534 arrived at the very place in Newfoundland where Verrazzano's explorations had ended ten years prior; Lanctôt surmised that Cartier had accompanied Verrazzano on that voyage. This was dismissed as conjecture by [[Marcel Trudel]], who noted that Cartier's ''Relations'' are devoid of any reference to such an experience. See Trudel, ''Histoire de la Nouvelle-France'', vol. 1, 1966, p. 58-60.&lt;/ref&gt;
Le Veneur cited voyages to Newfoundland and Brazil as proof of Cartier's ability to "lead ships to the discovery of new lands in the New World".&lt;ref&gt;Baron de La Chapelle, « Jean Le Veneur et le Canada », Nova Francia, vol. 6, 1931, pp. 341–343, quoting a genealogical work made in 1723 for the Le Veneur family. After his final trip, he said he would never search again.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cartier First Voyage Map 1.png|thumb|left|upright=2|Route of Cartier's first voyage]]

On April 20, 1534,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tracy, Frank Basil|date=1908|url=https://archive.org/stream/tercentenaryhis01trac#page/24/mode/2up|title=The Tercentenary History of Canada|publisher=P.F. Collier &amp; Sons|location=New York, Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartier set sail under a commission from the king, hoping to discover a [[Northwest Passage|western passage]] to the wealthy markets of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mocavo.com/A-History-of-Vermont/103618/15|website=Mocavo.com|title=A History of Vermont|page=1|date=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the commission, he was to "discover certain islands and lands where it is said that a great quantity of gold and other precious things are to be found".

It took him twenty days to sail across the ocean. Starting on May 10 of that year, he explored parts of Newfoundland, areas that now comprise the Canadian [[Atlantic provinces]] and the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]]. During one stop at Îles aux Oiseaux (Islands of the Birds, now the Rochers-aux-Oiseaux federal [[bird sanctuary]], northeast of [[Brion Island]] in the [[Magdalen Islands]]), his crew slaughtered around 1000 birds, most of them [[great auk]]s (extinct since 1852). Cartier's first two encounters with [[aboriginal peoples in Canada]] on the north side of [[Chaleur Bay]], most likely the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], were brief; some trading occurred.

His third encounter took place on the shores of [[Gaspé Bay]] with a party of [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]], where on July 24, he planted a cross to claim the land for France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seed|first1=Patricia|title=Ceremonies of Possession in Europe's Conquest of the New World: 1492-1640|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 10-meter cross bearing the words "Long Live the King of France" took possession of the territory in the name of the king. The change in mood was a clear indication that the Iroquoians understood Cartier's actions. Here he kidnapped the two sons of their captain.&lt;ref&gt;Some accounts make this captain to be Donnacona himself, the ruler at Stadacona, e.g. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0002354 the ''Canadian Encyclopedia''], but this does not seem possible from Cartier's firsthand accounts. Other sources show that Donnacona let his sons go willingly, along with some corn. [http://www.worldbookonline.com/advanced/article?id=ar097600&amp;st=jacques+cartier the ''World Book Online Encyclopedia'']{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartier wrote that they later told him this region where they were captured (Gaspé) was called by them ''Honguedo''. The natives' captain at last agreed that they could be taken, under the condition that they return with European goods to trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Cartier, Jacques |first=Marcel |last=Trudel |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cartier_jacques_1491_1557_1E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartier returned to France in September 1534, sure that he had reached an Asian land.

==Second voyage, 1535–1536==
[[File:Cartier Second Voyage Map 1.png|thumb|Route of Cartier's second voyage.]]
[[File:Carte espagnole fleuve Saint Laurent.jpg|thumb|This Spanish chart of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], from ca. 1541, contains a legend in front of the "isla de Orliens" that says: "Here many French died of hunger"; possibly alluding to Cartier's second settlement in 1535–1536.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliotecadigital.rah.es/dgbrah/i18n/consulta/registro.cmd?id=12987 Carta del curso del río de San Lorenzo desde su desembocadura hasta el lago de Golesme]. Bibliotecadigital.rah.es&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Jacques Cartier set sail for a second voyage on May 19 of the following year with three ships, 110 men, and his two Iroquoian captives. Reaching the St. Lawrence, he sailed up-river for the first time, and reached the Iroquoian capital of [[Stadacona]], where Chief [[Donnacona]] ruled.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Cartier left his main ships in a harbour close to Stadacona, and used his smallest ship to continue on to [[Hochelaga (village)|Hochelaga]] (now Montreal), arriving on October 2, 1535. Hochelaga was far more impressive than the small and squalid village of Stadacona, and a crowd of over a thousand came to the river edge to greet the Frenchmen. The site of their arrival has been confidently identified as the beginning of the Sainte-Marie Sault – where the [[Jacques Cartier Bridge|bridge named after him]] now stands. The expedition could proceed no further, as the river was blocked by rapids. So certain was Cartier that the river was the [[Northwest Passage]] and that the rapids were all that was preventing him from sailing to China, that the rapids and the town that eventually grew up near them came to be named after the French word for China, ''La Chine'': the [[Lachine Rapids]] and the town of [[Lachine, Quebec]].&lt;ref name="Chronicals of America"/&gt;

After spending two days among the people of Hochelaga, Cartier returned to Stadacona on October 11. It is not known exactly when he decided to spend the winter of 1535–1536 in Stadacona, and it was by then too late to return to France. Cartier and his men prepared for the winter by strengthening their fort, stacking firewood, and [[salting (food)|salting down]] [[Salt-cured meat|game]] [[saltfish|and fish]].

From mid-November 1535 to mid-April 1536, the French fleet lay frozen solid at the mouth of the [[Saint-Charles River|St. Charles River]], under the Rock of Quebec. Ice was over a [[fathom]] (1.8 m) thick on the river, with snow four feet (1.2 m) deep ashore. To add to the misery, [[scurvy]] broke out – first among the Iroquoians, and then among the French. Cartier estimated the number of dead Iroquoians at 50. On a visit by Domagaya to the French fort, Cartier inquired and learned from him that a concoction made from a tree known as [[aneda|annedda]], probably [[Spruce beer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/54/beerincanada.shtml |title=To Brew or Not to Brew: A Brief History of Beer in Canada |last=Ebberts |first=Derek |date=9 March 2015 |website=Manitoba Historical Society |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |access-date=28 January 2017 |quote=Jacques Cartier and his crew could well have died from scurvy had they not been shown how to make this brew}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Thuja occidentalis|arbor vitae,]]'' would cure scurvy. This remedy likely saved the expedition from destruction, allowing 85 Frenchmen to survive the winter. In his journal, Cartier states that by mid-February, "out of 110 that we were, not ten were well enough to help the others, a pitiful thing to see". The Frenchmen used up the bark of an entire tree in a week on the cure, and the dramatic results prompted Cartier to proclaim it a Godsend, and a miracle.&lt;ref name="Chronicals of America"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofamerica.com/french/jacques_cartier_voyages.htm |title=Jacques Cartier's Voyages |publisher=Chronicles of America |year=2010 |accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.win.tue.nl/c. |title=Jacques Cartier |publisher=Eindhoven University |year=2010 |accessdate=October 2, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Biggar&gt;Biggar, H.P. (1924) ''The Voyages of Jacques Cartier''. Ottawa: Publications of the Public Archives of Canada. No. 11. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Ready to return to France in early May 1536, Cartier decided to kidnap Chief Donnacona and take him to France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard|last1=Hildreth|author-link=Richard Hildreth|title= The History of the United States of America|volume=1|url=https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst25hildgoog|year=1871|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that he might personally tell the tale of a country further north, called the "[[Kingdom of Saguenay]]", said to be full of gold, rubies and other treasures. After an arduous trip down the St. Lawrence and a three-week Atlantic crossing, Cartier and his men arrived in Saint-Malo on July 15, 1536, concluding the second, 14-month voyage, which was to be Cartier's most profitable.&lt;ref name=Biggar/&gt;

==Third voyage, 1541–1542==
[[File:Dauphin Map of Canada - circa 1543 - Project Gutenberg etext 20110.jpg|thumb|320px|right|The ''Dauphin Map'' of Canada, c. 1543, showing Cartier's discoveries]]
On October 17, 1540, Francis ordered the navigator Jacques Cartier to return to Canada to lend weight to a colonization project of which he would be "captain general". However, January 15, 1541, saw Cartier supplanted by [[Jean-François de La Rocque de Roberval]], a [[Huguenot]] courtier and friend of the king named as the first [[Lieutenant General of New France|lieutenant general of French Canada]]. Roberval was to lead the expedition, with Cartier as his chief navigator. While Roberval waited for artillery and supplies, he gave permission to Cartier to sail on ahead with his ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/jacques-cartier.htm |title=Jacques Cartier, Short Biography (w/timeline) |publisher=Elizabethan Era |year=2010 |accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 1541, Cartier departed Saint-Malo on his third voyage with five ships. This time, any thought of finding a passage to the Orient was forgotten. The goals were now to find the "Kingdom of Saguenay" and its riches, and to establish a permanent settlement along the St. Lawrence River.&lt;ref name="American Journeys"/&gt;

Anchoring at Stadacona, Cartier again met the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|Iroquoians]], but found their "show of joy" and their numbers worrisome, and decided not to build his settlement there. Sailing a few kilometres up-river to a spot he had previously observed, he decided to settle on the site of present-day [[Cap-Rouge]], Quebec. The convicts and other colonists were landed, the cattle that had survived three months aboard ship were turned loose, earth was broken for a kitchen garden, and seeds of cabbage, turnip, and lettuce were planted. A fortified settlement was thus created and was named [[Charlesbourg-Royal]]. Another fort was also built on the cliff overlooking the settlement, for added protection.

The men also began collecting what they believed to be diamonds and gold, but which upon return to France were discovered to be merely quartz crystals and [[iron pyrites]], respectively&amp;nbsp;— which gave rise to a French expression: "''faux comme les diamants du Canada''" ("As false as Canadian diamonds"). Two of the ships were sent on their journey home with some of these minerals on September 2.&lt;ref name="American Journeys"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanjourneys.org/aj-028/summary/index.asp |title=Cartier’s Third Voyage to Canada, 1541–1542 |publisher=American Journeys |year=2010 |accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having set tasks for everyone, Cartier left with the longboats for a reconnaissance in search of "Saguenay" on September 7. Having reached Hochelaga, he was prevented by bad weather and the numerous rapids from continuing up to the [[Ottawa River]].

Returning to Charlesbourg-Royal, Cartier found the situation ominous. The Iroquoians no longer made friendly visits or peddled fish and game, but prowled about in a sinister manner. No records exist about the winter of 1541–1542 and the information must be gleaned from the few details provided by returning sailors. It seems the natives attacked and killed about 35 settlers before the Frenchmen could retreat behind their fortifications. Even though scurvy was cured through the native remedy ([[Thuja occidentalis]] infusion), the impression left is of a general misery, and of Cartier's growing conviction that he had insufficient manpower either to protect his base or to go in search of the Saguenay Kingdom.

Cartier left for France in early June 1542, encountering Roberval and his ships along the Newfoundland coast, at about the time Roberval marooned [[Marguerite de La Rocque]]. Despite Roberval's insistence that he accompany him back to Saguenay, Cartier slipped off under the cover of darkness and continued on to France, still convinced his vessels contained a wealth of gold and diamonds. He arrived there in October, in what proved to be his last voyage. Meanwhile, Roberval took command at Charlesbourg-Royal, but it was abandoned in 1543 after disease, foul weather and hostile natives drove the would-be settlers to despair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/goweezer/canada/z00cartier4.htm |title=Jacques Cartier's Third Voyage – 1541, Settlement of Charlesbourg-Royal |publisher=Simpson Shack |year=2010 |accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Cartier spent the rest of his life in Saint-Malo and his nearby estate, where he often was useful as an interpreter in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. He died at age 65 on September 1, 1557, during an epidemic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/qc/cartierbrebeuf/natcul/natcul2_e.asp |title=Parks Canada&amp;nbsp;— Cartier-Brébeuf National Historic Site of Canada&amp;nbsp;— Natural Wonders &amp; Cultural Treasures&amp;nbsp;— Jacques Cartier, Explorer and Navigator |publisher=Pc.gc.ca |date=July 15, 2009 |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302174732/http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/qc/cartierbrebeuf/natcul/natcul2_e.asp |archivedate=March 2, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No permanent European settlements were made in Canada before 1605, when [[Samuel Champlain]] founded [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] in present-day Victoria Beach just outside Annapolis Royal.

[[File:Canada Cartier 1908 issue-20c.jpg|thumb|The Fleet of Cartier was commemorated on a 1908 Canadian postage stamp.]]
Having already located the entrance to the St. Lawrence on his first voyage, he now opened up the greatest waterway for the European penetration of North America. He produced an intelligent estimate of the resources of Canada, both natural and human, albeit with a considerable exaggeration of its mineral wealth. While some of his actions toward the St. Lawrence Iroquoians were dishonourable, he did try at times to establish friendship with them and other native peoples living along the St. Lawrence River—an indispensable preliminary to French settlement in their lands.

Cartier was the first to document the name [[Canada's name|Canada]] to designate the territory on the shores of the St-Lawrence River. The name is derived from the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]-[[Iroquois]] word "kanata", or village, which was incorrectly interpreted as the native term for the newly discovered land.&lt;ref&gt;McMullen, J.M. (1855) [https://archive.org/details/historycanadafr01mcmugoog ''The History of Canada: From Its First Discovery to the Present Time'']. C. W., J. M'Mullen (no copyright in the United States), p. 7. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; Cartier used the name to describe Stadacona, the surrounding land and the river itself. And Cartier named "''Canadiens''" the inhabitants ([[Iroquoian]]s) he had seen there. Thereafter the name Canada was used to designate the small French colony on these shores, and the French colonists were called ''Canadiens'', until the mid-nineteenth century, when the name started to be applied to the loyalist colonies on [[Great Lakes|the Great Lakes]] and later to all of [[British North America]]. In this way Cartier is not strictly the European discoverer of Canada as this country is understood today, a vast federation stretching [[Coat of Arms of Canada|''a mari usque ad mare'']] (from sea to sea). Eastern parts had previously been visited by the Norse, as well as Basque, Galician and Breton fishermen, and perhaps the [[Corte-Real (disambiguation)|Corte-Real]] brothers and [[John Cabot]] (in addition of course to the Natives who first inhabited the territory). Cartier's particular contribution to the discovery of Canada is as the first European to penetrate the continent, and more precisely the interior eastern region along the St. Lawrence River. His explorations consolidated France's claim of the territory that would later be colonized as [[New France]], and his third voyage produced the first documented European attempt at settling North America since that of [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]] in 1526–27.

Cartier's professional abilities can be easily ascertained. Considering that Cartier made three voyages of exploration in dangerous and hitherto unknown waters without losing a ship, and that he entered and departed some 50 undiscovered harbors without serious mishap, he may be considered one of the most conscientious explorers of the period.

Cartier was also one of the first to formally acknowledge that the New World was a separate land mass from Europe/Asia.

==Rediscovery of Cartier's first colony==
[[File:Québec, Jacques Cartier4.jpg|thumb|Plaque on the statue of Jacques Cartier in front of the Gabrielle-Roy public library, in the Saint-Roch neighbourhood of Quebec City.]]
On August 18, 2006, Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]] announced that Canadian archaeologists had discovered the precise location of Cartier's lost first colony of [[Charlesbourg-Royal]].&lt;ref name=rediscovery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=edd7eac6-f566-4011-87d7-82becfc883a2&amp;k=48975 |title=Pottery shard unearths North America's first French settlement |publisher=canada.com |date=August 22, 2006 |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130061926/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=edd7eac6-f566-4011-87d7-82becfc883a2&amp;k=48975 |archivedate=January 30, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The colony was built at the confluence of the [[Rivière du Cap Rouge]] with the St. Lawrence River and is based on the discovery of burnt wooden timber remains that have been dated to the mid-16th century, and a fragment of a decorative Istoriato plate manufactured in [[Faenza]], Italy, between 1540 and 1550, that could only have belonged to a member of the French aristocracy in the colony. Most probably this was the [[Jean-François de la Roque de Roberval|Sieur de Roberval]], who replaced Cartier as the leader of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4978e603-f67e-4784-807d-7f3911c60829&amp;k=27303 |title=Long-lost Jacques Cartier settlement rediscovered at Quebec City |publisher=canada.com |date=August 19, 2006 |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825043455/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4978e603-f67e-4784-807d-7f3911c60829&amp;k=27303 |archivedate=August 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This colony was the first known European settlement in modern-day Canada since the c.1000 AD [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] Viking village in northern [[Newfoundland]].

'''Lillsjön''' ({{lang-sv|Small Lake}}) is a small, former [[lake]] in [[Norra Djurgården]], a semi-rural area in north-eastern central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], forming part of the [[Royal National City Park]]. Today transformed into a [[wetland]], it is often mentioned as one of the six lakes in the area, the other being: [[Laduviken]], [[Uggleviken]], [[Isbladskärret]], [[Lappkärret]], and [[Spegeldammen]].

Lillsjön used to be connected to other lakes in the area through narrow straits.  Through a project sponsored by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], water was pumped into the small basin reinforced by new embankments.  [[Phragmites|Reed]] was also burnt away, and the former lake thus transformed into a shore meadow attracting many birds, starting with [[northern lapwing]]s in March, followed by [[common snipe]]s later in spring.  In autumn, many birds rest here on their way south, such as [[wood sandpiper]]s, [[common redshank]]s, [[greenshank]]s, and [[ruff (bird)|ruffs]].
&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;Upptäck&lt;/ref&gt;

A striking feature at Lillsjön are the [[Highland cattle]] residing there from May to October. Not only do they attract many Stockholmers of all ages, they also affect the local fauna as they eat reed and [[tufted hair-grass]], thus preventing these species from taking over the area &amp;ndash; and thereby allowing space to flowers such as [[Primula veris|cowslips]] and [[bitter vetch]], as well as birds and insects attracted by water.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

[[Image:GuamRail02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guam rail]]]]
This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in Guam'''. The [[avifauna]] of [[Guam]] include a total of 124 species, of which three are [[Endemism in birds|endemic]], nine have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] by humans and one is rare or accidental. Four species listed are [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in Guam and are not included in the species count. Six species are globally threatened.

This list's [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ''[[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World]]'', 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Guam.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.

*(A) '''[[Vagrancy (biology)|Accidental]]''' - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Guam
*(*) '''[[Endemic]]''' - a species either entirely confined to Guam in its natural distribution, or a species whose breeding range is entirely confined to Guam
*(E) '''[[Extinction|Extinct]]''' - a recent bird that no longer exists

{{GeoGroup}}
In [[political geography]], an '''enclave''' is a piece of land which is totally surrounded by a foreign territory. An '''exclave''' is a piece of land which is politically attached to a larger piece but not physically coterminous (having the same borders) with it because of surrounding '''foreign''' territory.  Many entities are both enclaves and exclaves.

* In [[China]]:
** [[Chaoyang District, Beijing#Developments|Chaoyang District]] has one exclave which comprises Terminals 1 and 2 of [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] and the immediately surrounding service area. It is an enclave of [[Shunyi District|Shunyi]] which used to be Shunyi Subdistrict of Chaoyang District. The main reason for the existence of this exclave is because the financing for the building of these Terminals was largely carried by Chaoyang District and this political organization ensures that they continue to pay taxes to Chaoyang District. Note: Terminal 3 is not a part of this exclave as it was built for the 2008 Olympics and was built after the formation of Shunyi District. See a map of the exclave, not including Terminal 3, on Google Maps.&lt;ref&gt;Google Maps, showing Beijing International airport. https://goo.gl/maps/bWh86. The red-line highlights the exclave including Terminals 1 and 2. Terminal 3 is to the southeast of the exclave at the north end of the road loop seen there.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each enjoys a 3-nautical mile [[littoral zone]] of sovereignty along its shores and islands in the gulf.  The remaining water area in the gulf comprises a [[Condominium (international law)|tridominium]] that is shared in common among all three nations.  The littoral zones abut each other in a way that forms two separate areas of tridominium waters in the gulf.  The eastern area is bordered by the zones of all three countries.  The larger western area is bordered only by the waters of El Salvador and Nicaragua and the closing line of the gulf, such that one cannot travel within the gulf from Honduras to the enclosed western area except by passing through El Salvadoran and Nicaraguan waters.

*** In [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], [[South Abington Township, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|South Abington Township]] has an isolated section along Glenburn Road surrounded by [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] borough and [[Waverly Township, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Waverly Township]]. The township also has several virtual exclaves as it is oddly shaped and surrounds Clarks Summit, [[Clarks Green, Pennsylvania|Clarks Green]], and Waverly Township collectively on three sides.
*** There are four sets of exclaves in [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill County]]. [[Norwegian Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Norwegian Township]] has a small exclave separated by the city of [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania|Pottsville]], and [[West Mahanoy Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|West Mahanoy Township]] is split into two sections, separated by the borough of [[Gilberton, Pennsylvania|Gilberton]]. In addition, the borough of [[Auburn, Pennsylvania|Auburn]] creates exclaves of both [[South Manheim Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|South Manheim Township]] and [[West Brunswick Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|West Brunswick Township]].
*** In [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]], [[Spring Garden Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Spring Garden Township]] has an exclave separated from the rest of the township by the city of [[York, Pennsylvania|York]].
** The lands within numerous [[Indian reservations]] have been fragmented, with privately owned real estate intermixed with tribal, city, county, state, and federal authorities in a bewildering array of jurisdictional geographies.
*** [[Red Lake Indian Reservation]] has one large exclave bordering Canada (itself containing enclaves of non-reservation land) and numerous other small exclaves.
*** [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]] also has numerous small exclaves.

==Semi-enclaves and semi-exclaves==

'''Semi-enclaves''' and '''semi-exclaves''' are areas that, except for possessing an unsurrounded sea border, would otherwise be enclaves or exclaves.&lt;ref name="EV"&gt;{{cite book|first=Evgeny| last=Vinokurov| title = The Theory of Enclaves | year = 2007| publisher = Lexington Books, Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12–14}}&lt;ref name="YRY"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The concepts of enclave and exclave and their use in the political and geographical characteristic of the Kaliningrad region|journal=Baltic Region|year=2013|first=Yuri| last= Rozhkov-Yuryevsky|doi= 10.5922/2079-8555-2013-2-11 |number= 2|pages=113–123|url= https://dx.doi.org/10.5922/2079-8555-2013-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}}  Semi-enclaves can exist as [[List of countries that border only one other country|independent states that border only one other state]].  ''Vinokurov (2007)'' declares, "Technically, Portugal, Denmark, and Canada also border only one foreign state, but they are not enclosed in the geographical, political, or economic sense. They have vast access to international waters. At the same time, there are states that, although in possession of sea access, are still enclosed by the territories of a foreign state."&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|14}}  Therefore, Vinokurov applies a quantitative principle: ''the land boundary must be longer than the coastline.'' Thus he classifies a state as a ''sovereign semi-enclave'' if it borders on just one state, and its land boundary is longer than its sea coastline.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|14, 20–22}}  Vinokurov affirms that "no similar quantitative criterion is needed to define the scope of non-sovereign semi-enclaves/exclaves."&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|14, 26}}&lt;ref&gt;''Vinokurov (2007)'', p. 29, also refers to semi-exclaves as a type of "mere exclave with sea connection to the mainland."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sovereign semi-enclaves===
* {{Flag|Brunei}}

* {{Flag|Monaco}}

===Non-sovereign semi-enclaves===
* [[Brunei]]: '''[[Temburong District]]''' is bounded by [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei Bay]].  
* [[Cyprus]] (''de facto''):  The ''de facto'' independent [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), which is unrecognized internationally, has a semi-enclave in the island's Northwest, '''[[Kokkina exclave|Kokkina/Erenköy]]''', which is bounded by the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|U.N. buffer zone]] and the Mediterranean Sea.

* [[Spain]]: '''[[Ceuta]]''', '''[[Melilla]]''', and '''[[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera]]''' are bounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and by either a neutral zone or [[Morocco]] itself.
* [[United Kingdom]]: 
** The overseas territory of '''[[Gibraltar]]''' is on the south coast of [[Spain]]. A neutral zone had existed at one time but appears no longer to be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibnet.com/library/neutral.htm| title=The Status of the Neutral Territory|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''[[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]''' &amp;ndash; [[British Overseas Territory]] on the island of [[Cyprus]], administered as two Sovereign Base Areas, an Eastern Sovereign Base Area (ESBA) and a Western Sovereign Base Area (WSBA). The bases were retained by the UK following the independence of Cyprus in 1960. The Western Sovereign Base Area includes Akrotiri and [[Episkopi Cantonment]], while the Eastern Sovereign Base Area includes [[Dhekelia Cantonment]] and [[Ayios Nikolaos, SBA|Ayios Nikolaos]].
* [[United States of America]]: '''[[Alaska]]''' is bounded by [[Canada]], the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Bering Sea]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Alaska is the world's largest semi-enclave.

===Non-sovereign semi-exclaves===
* [[Angola]]: '''[[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]]''' is bounded by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
* [[Equatorial Guinea]]: continental '''[[Rio Muni]]''' is surrounded by [[Gabon]], [[Cameroon]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and can only be accessed from the capital by boat or plane.

* [[Russia]]: '''[[Kaliningrad Oblast]]''' is bounded by [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] and the Baltic Sea.

== Pene-enclaves/exclaves (inaccessible districts)==

A '''pene-exclave''' is a part of the territory of one country that can be approached conveniently — in particular by wheeled traffic — only through the territory of another country.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=G. W. S.|title=Exclaves|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=49|issue=3, [Part 1]|date=September 1959|pages=283–295|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1959.tb01614.x|jstor=2561461}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|283}}  Such areas are enclaves or exclaves ''for practical purposes,'' without meeting the strict definition; hence they are also called functional enclaves or practical enclaves.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|31}}  Many pene-exclaves partially border their own territorial waters (i.e., they are not surrounded by other nations' territorial waters). A pene-enclave can also exist entirely on land, such as when intervening mountains render a territory inaccessible from other parts of a country except through alien territory. Thus, a ''pene-exclave'' has land borders with other territory but is not completely surrounded by the other's land or territorial waters. They can exhibit continuity of state territory across territorial waters but, nevertheless, a discontinuity on land, such as in the case of [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]].&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|47}}  Along rivers that change course, pene-enclaves can be observed as complexes comprising many small pene-enclaves.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|50}}  Attribution of a pene-enclave status to a territory can sometimes be disputed, depending on whether the territory is considered to be practically inaccessible from the mainland or not.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

===National level===
* [[Austria]]:
** The municipality of [[Jungholz]] is connected to the rest of Austria at a [[quadripoint]] at the summit of the mountain ''[[Sorgschrofen]]'' (1636 m). Road access is only via German land. However, ''Vinokurov (2007)'' states, "For all purposes, a connection in a single point does not mean anything. It is just like being completely separated. One cannot pass through a single point, nor is it possible to transport goods. It is not even possible to lay a telephone line."&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt; (See above: ''Enclaves which are also exclaves''.)
** The [[Kleinwalsertal]], a valley part of [[Vorarlberg]], can only be reached by road from [[Oberstdorf]], [[Germany]].
** [[Hinterriß]] and [[Eng, Tyrol|Eng]] (parts of the communes of [[Vomp]] and [[Eben am Achensee]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], Austria) are functional exclaves accessible by road only from Germany.
* [[Belgium]]/[[France]]: Along the river [[Leie]] (Lys in French) between [[Halluin]] and [[Armentières]], where the river forms the border, there are 7 small pene-exclaves of Belgium (province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]]) on the southern side of the river and 7 small pene-exclaves of France (department of [[Nord (French department)|Nord]]) on the northern side of the river. This is due to minor changes in the course of the river since the border was fixed in 1830.
* [[Belgium]]/[[Netherlands]]: On the Dutch side of the [[Meuse River]], between the Belgian municipality of [[Visé]] and its neighboring Dutch municipalities of [[Maastricht]] and [[Eijsden-Margraten]], Belgium has two pene-exclaves, Presqu'ile de L'Ilal and Presqu'ile d'Eijsden. A Dutch pene-exclave, Presqu'ile Petit-Gravier, lies on the Belgian side. The states signed a treaty in 2016 to swap these plots of land, which are the result of river straightening prior to 1980.
* [[Belize]]: [[Ambergris Caye]] is an island in Belize located south of the Mexican state of [[Quintana Roo]]. It is separated from the rest of the country and can only be reached on land by a bridge from [[Mexico]].
* [[Bolivia]]: [[Copacabana, Bolivia|Copacabana]] and the surrounding promontory are separated from the rest of Bolivia by [[Lake Titicaca]], only joining by land to [[Peru]]vian territory.  Access to Bolivia is only available via ferry. 
* [[Cambodia]]: [[Preah Vihear Temple|Prasat Preah Vihear]] can only be reached by traveling through Thailand.
* [[Canada]]:
** [[St. Regis Mohawk Reservation|St. Regis]], [[Quebec]]: Part of the [[Akwesasne]] [[Mohawk Nation]] on the south shore of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], it has a land border with [[St. Regis Mohawk Reservation]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] State; road access to the rest of Canada is only available through New York State.
** [[Campobello Island]], [[New Brunswick]] can be reached by road only by driving through the United States, across the border bridge to Maine. Connection with the rest of Canada is by ferry.
** The entrance to [[Aroostook Valley Country Club]] near [[Fort Fairfield, Maine]], is in the U.S., but most of the club's golf course and its clubhouse are in Canada. Members and their guests, as long as they remain on the club's property, are not required to clear Canadian customs.
** The [[Haskell Free Library and Opera House]] straddles the border. The Canadian part of the building is a practical exclave of Canada, as most of the building is physically in [[Stanstead, Quebec]], but the only public access to the building is via the front door on Caswell Avenue in [[Derby Line, Vermont]], in the United States. (Emergency exits from the second floor open to Canada.) People in Canada may not enter or exit the building except by travelling into the U.S. A special exception allows library and opera house patrons to cross the border to enter and move about in the building, but they must return to their home country (or see the Customs office) to avoid being charged with illegally entering the other country.
* [[Chile]]:  [[Magallanes Region]] of [[Chile]], the southernmost portion of the Chilean mainland, is a practical exclave. The southernmost location that can be reached by road from the core of Chile is [[Villa O'Higgins]] in [[Aysén Region]]. Before the construction of the [[Carretera Austral]], and its side-routes, the practical exclave included the Aysén Region and other locations such as [[Futaleufú, Chile|Futaleufú]].
* [[Croatia]]:  The southern portion of [[Dubrovnik-Neretva County]], including the historic city of [[Dubrovnik]], is bounded by [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], and the [[Adriatic Sea]]. [[Neum]], Bosnia and Herzegovina's only sea access, is sandwiched between the two portions of this county. This pene-exclave relies on national territorial waters as its only alternative connection to the rest of the country. It is accessible to Croatia's much larger region to the north by an 8&amp;nbsp;km road a short distance from and parallel to the Adriatic coastline, crossing Bosnia via Neum. A 2.3&amp;nbsp;km bridge under construction (2017) to a Croatian peninsula will bypass the Bosnian transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Dubrovnik is a lonely outpost|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/07/croatia| date=1 July 2013|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Denmark]]/[[Germany]]:  Several farms on the border, e.g. Vilmkærgård (similar situation as Canada's Haskell Free Library, immediately above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan S. Krogh's Geosite: Germany (DE) – Denmark (DK) Wilmkjer (DE) – Vilmkær (DK) border|url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/borders/denmark.htm| date=|publisher=|accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1920-1927, the popular German tourist island [[Sylt]] was accessible only by boat from [[Højer]], ceded to Denmark in 1920. A direct German route was built in 1927.
* [[Finland]]/[[Sweden]]: The city centre of the Finnish city of [[Tornio]] is a pene-enclave unreachable directly by land from Finnish territory, although connected to the rest of Finland by a pair of bridges. The neighboring Swedish municipality of [[Haparanda]] has two similar pene-enclaves unreachable directly from Swedish territory.  One is an islet crossed by the international border at a golf course on the line between Tornio and Haparanda.
* [[France]]: The territorial water of [[Canada]] completely surrounds that of the French territorial collectivity of [[St Pierre and Miquelon]] except for a corridor 10.5 NM (19.4&amp;nbsp;km) wide stretching 200 NM (370&amp;nbsp;km) south to open sea.
* [[Germany]]/[[Switzerland]]:
** The smaller part of the German city of [[Konstanz]], which includes the Aldstadt (old town), lies to the south of the [[Rhine]] and has no land border with Germany, being otherwise surrounded by Switzerland; it is linked to the rest of [[Konstanz]], and by extension to the rest of Germany, by a bridge.
** The Swiss town of [[Stein am Rhein]] has only a bridge over the Rhine connecting it to the rest of Switzerland, which it does not border on land, and is otherwise surrounded by Germany.
* [[Guatemala]]/[[Mexico]]: The changing course of the Río Suchiate has created pene-exclaves on both banks of the river.
* [[Indonesia]]:
** On the island of [[New Guinea]], [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] is surrounded by [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Arafura Sea]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]];
** [[Borneo]]'s subdivisions include a part of Malaysia (the states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]) and a part of Indonesia that are conterminous; thus, each part is a pene-exclave of its home country.
** [[West Timor]] is surrounded by [[East Timor]], the [[Timor Sea]] and the [[Savu Sea]].
* [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]/[[United Kingdom]]:  The western-most region of [[County Monaghan]] in Ireland contains a pene-enclave jutting into [[County Fermanagh]], [[United Kingdom]], known as the Drummully Polyp or Salient (also locally as Coleman Island after the name of its northernmost [[townland]], Coleman). There are two inaccessible districts: [[Drumard]] in the 'polyp' itself, belongs to Ireland and is inaccessible directly by road from any other part of Ireland; the village of [[Summerhill, County Fermanagh]] in the United Kingdom is similarly inaccessible from the rest of the United Kingdom. The A3 (UK) and N54 (Ireland) road, known as the Concession Road, crosses the border here 4 times in a short distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/si/187/made/en/print |title=Statutory Instruments, S.I. No. 187 Of 2006, Roads Act 1993 (Classification Of National Roads), Order 2006 |publisher=[[Irish Statute Book]]|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Italy]]:
** The [[Livigno]] valley near the Swiss border was at one time accessible only from Switzerland and was exempt from Italian customs, an exemption that continues today even though road access to the rest of Italy has been established.  It is therefore excluded from EU VAT area.
** The village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Bagni di Craveggia|it}} can only be reached by travelling through the Canton of [[Ticino]] in [[Switzerland]]. The village never became part of Switzerland, as the pastures surrounding it were owned by the people of Vigezzo Valley, rather than the people of the Swiss Onsernone Valley, at the end of which the village is situated. Consequently, the [[Swiss franc]] is commonly used.
** On the [[San Marino]]/Italy border, there is Italian land east of the River San Marino that does not join to any other part of 'dry' Italian territory. This area is only a few metres wide, and follows the river's course for around 500 metres, and is close to the Strada del Lavoro.
* [[Laos]]: Many places, usually restaurants or markets, can only be accessed from [[Thailand]] by boat and do not require passports to enter.
* [[Lithuania]]: [[Curonian Spit]]'s northern part in the [[Klaipėda District]] is bounded by [[Russia]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], but has the common territorial waters of Lithuania.
* [[Mexico]]/[[United States of America]]:  Shifts in the meandering course of the lower Rio Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande) have created numerous pene-exclaves.  Under the [[Boundary Treaty of 1970]] and earlier treaties, the two nations have maintained the actual course of the river as the [[United States territorial acquisitions#Mexican boundary|international boundary]], but both must approve proposed changes. From 1989 to 2009, there were 128 locations where the river changed course, causing land that had been on one side of the river to then occupy the opposite bank. Until the boundary is officially changed, there are 60 small pene-exclaves of the state of [[Texas]] now lying on the southern side of the river, as well as 68 such pene-exclaves of Mexico on the northern side of the river. The last such exchange (of pre-1989 river cuts) occurred in 2009, after languishing as a proposal for 20 years. 
* [[Malaysia]]:  In the state of [[Sarawak]] on the island of [[Borneo]], the [[Limbang Division]] is completely cut off from the rest of the state's road network. The [[Limbang]] District in the division is only accessible by road through [[Brunei]], as it is located between Brunei's main portion and the [[Temburong District]]. The [[Lawas]] District, on the other hand, lies between Temburong and the state of [[Sabah]]. As Sabah and Sarawak have autonomy in immigration affairs, immigration checks are required when traveling into or out of the Limbang Division by road.
* [[Myanmar]]: The town of [[Payathonsu|Payathonzu]] can be accessed from [[Kanchanaburi]], [[Thailand]] by road. It cannot be reached by road from other locations in the country.
* [[Namibia]]: [[Mpalila Island]] can only be reached from the rest of the country by travelling through [[Botswana]].
* [[Netherlands]]: Part of the province of Zeeland, namely [[Zeelandic Flanders|Zeeuws Vlaanderen]] is accessible by land only through the country of [[Belgium]], although it is accessible by sea from the rest of the province of Zeeland. There is a tunnel, the [[Westerscheldetunnel]], which also links Zeeuws Vlaanderen to the rest of the province.
* [[Nicaragua]]: There are two small pieces of Nicaragua completely surrounded by Costa Rica in the area where their border meets on the Caribbean Sea. The exclaves are a small stretch of beach and a lagoon.
* [[North Korea]]:
** A small pene-exclave is located on a lake island that is divided between North Korea and Songsan-ri, [[Paju-si]], [[Gyeonggi Province|Gyeonggi-do]] in [[South Korea]]. It can be accessed by boat only.
** Another pene-exclave is located on the south side of a river adjacent to Gadal-ri, [[Cheorwon-gun]], [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon-do]] in South Korea. It can be accessed by boat only.
* [[Norway]]/[[Sweden]]: Properties 79/3 and 79/4 ({{coord|59|39|17|N|11|51|50|E}}) at Trosterud in the Norwegian municipality of [[Rømskog]] are only accessible by a road that follows the Norwegian&amp;ndash;[[Sweden|Swedish]] [[border|boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/borders/trosterud.htm|title=Trosterud|website=geosite.jankrogh.com|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nearby houses in Sweden are only accessible from that road which is connected to a larger road only in Norway.
* [[Portugal]]:  An area north of [[Tourém]] is cut off from the rest of Portuguese territory by the lake [[Encoro de Salas]], being surrounded by [[Spain|Spanish]] territory. It is accessible by a road bridge, but otherwise does not border the rest of [[Portugal]].
* [[Russia]]:
** [[Dubki, Pechorsky District, Pskov Oblast|Dubki]] area is bounded by [[Estonia]] and [[Lake Peipsi-Pihkva]].
** The settlement of [[Maloje Kulisko]] is separated from the rest of the country by the [[Kuuleski River]]; the village is otherwise surrounded by [[Estonia]]n territory, although as it is a bog island, it is not accessible from Estonia either.
** [[Vistula Spit]]'s eastern part in the Kaliningrad Area is bounded by Poland and the Baltic Sea, but has the common territorial waters of Russia.
* [[Senegal]]:  An area of marshy land, approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} south of [[Tiong]], [[Mauritania]] is owned by Senegal, but is inaccessible from any other part of Senegal. Coastal waters, however, are contiguous.
* [[Spain]]: [[Os de Civís]] is inaccessible via any other part of Spanish territory, as one has to travel via [[Andorra]].
* [[Togo]]: A territory in the northwestern end of Togo is only accessible through [[Burkina Faso]].&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;{{rp|33}}
* [[Turkey]]:
** The [[Europe]]an section of Turkey is bounded by [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Despite that the [[Europe]]an section and the [[Asia]]n sections of Turkey are not geographically conterminous and are separated by [[international waters]], there are two connecting bridges in [[Istanbul]].
** The valley of [[Macahel]], which includes five villages in northeastern Turkey, can only be reached by vehicle via [[Batumi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].  In winter, as the snow shuts the paths that are completely within the borders of Turkey, the road via Batumi is the only way to travel there.
** Turkey has a pene-exclave west of the Maritsa River opposite [[Edirne]] (Adrianople), with a land boundary of 10.8&amp;nbsp;km with [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="ibs41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.vlasenko.net/smtm100/k-35-090.jpg |title=Soviet military topographic maps 1:100000 (in Russian) |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Uganda]]:  The extreme tip of [[Tanzania]]'s [[Kanyiragwa]] peninsula is a very small pene-exclave of [[Uganda]] on the shore of [[Lake Victoria]], created by the parallel of latitude that defines most of the border between Uganda and Tanzania.
* [[United Kingdom]]: [[Northern Ireland]] is bounded by [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Irish Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
* [[United States of America]]/[[Canada]]:
** Although Alaska is itself a pene-exclave (road access is primarily via the [[Alaska Highway]]), the town of [[Hyder, Alaska]], can only be reached by road from [[Stewart, British Columbia]]. There is no road from Hyder to any other point in Alaska. Additionally, much of the [[Alaska Panhandle]] consists of mountainous peninsulas; many communities along the coast lack road connection to other parts of Alaska directly, such as the state capital, [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]].
** [[Point Roberts, Washington]], is bounded by [[British Columbia]], Canada, the [[Strait of Georgia]], and [[Boundary Bay]]. It can be reached from the rest of Washington State only via road through two border crossings. 
** A slice of land on the edge of [[Lake Metigoshe State Park|Lake Metigoshe]] lies in North Dakota's [[Roland Township]] bordering [[Municipality of Deloraine – Winchester|Winchester, Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manitoba boaters stunned by new cross-border rule|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lake-metigoshe-boaters-cbsa-1.3677988|first=Riley |last=Laychuk| date=13 July 2016|publisher=CBC News|quote=In fact, some of the boat docks for Canadian cabins sit on the U.S. side of the border.|accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** The [[Northwest Angle]] – the northernmost part of [[Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota]], and the northernmost part of the contiguous 48 states – is bounded by Manitoba, Canada and [[Lake of the Woods]]. Access to the rest of Minnesota is only via boat or by a pair of vehicular border crossings. 
** [[Elm Point, Minnesota]] and two small pieces of uninhabited land just to its west ([[Buffalo Bay Point]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/516-northwest-angles-one-exclave-may-hide-another|title=516 – Northwest Angles: One Exclave May Hide Another|first=Frank|last=Jacobs|work=Big Think|publisher=The Big Think, Inc.|accessdate=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also bounded by Manitoba and Lake of the Woods.
** The [[Alburgh, Vermont|Alburgh Tongue]] in [[Lake Champlain]], location of the town of Alburgh, [[Vermont]], is bounded by [[Quebec]], Canada to the north. The community can be reached via road bridges from Vermont or New York. 
** [[Lake Champlain#Province Point, Vermont|Province Point]], the small end of a peninsula east of Alburgh, Vermont, is bounded by Quebec and Lake Champlain.
** [[Estcourt Station, Maine]], does not have public road access to the rest of Maine. Instead, Estcourt Station's houses, store and gas station access Rue Frontiere, a street on the Canadian side of the border in [[Pohenegamook, Quebec]].

====Divided islands====
* [[Argentina]]/[[Chile]]: [[Tierra del Fuego|Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]] is a shared island; the eastern section is part of Argentina's [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]] province and the western is part of [[Chile]]. The island is surrounded by the [[Beagle Channel]], the [[Strait of Magellan]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s.
* [[Bahrain]]/[[Saudi Arabia]]: ''Middle East Causeway Embankment No. 4'' is an island situated on the [[King Fahd Causeway]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. On this small hourglass-shaped island is the border between the two nations, each connected to the island by a bridge. The border station was designed as two connected islands, with the west side designated as Saudi Arabian and the east as Bahraini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kfca.com.sa/en/#/borderstation/ |title=King Fahd Causeway: Border Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Belarus]] and [[Latvia]]'s international border divides an island in [[Lake Rychy]]; hence, each has a pene-exclave there.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* [[Belarus]]/[[Lithuania]]: Sosnovec Island and another nameless island in [[Lake Drūkšiai]] are each divided by the two nations; hence, they are pene-exclaves.
* [[Djibouti]] and [[Ethiopia]] each have a pene-exclave on an island off Cape Aleilou in [[Lake Abbe]]. Only the eastern tip of the island belongs to Djibouti.
* [[Finland]] and [[Norway]] each have pene-exclaves on two [[List of divided islands|divided lake islands]] and one divided river islet on their international border.
* [[Finland]]/[[Sweden]]:  
** The Finnish municipality of [[Tornio]] and the neighboring Swedish municipality of [[Haparanda]] share an islet crossed by the international border at a golf course on the line between the two.
** [[Märket]] is a small 3.3-hectare (8.2-acre) uninhabited island in the Baltic Sea, which has been divided between the two nations since the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] of 1809.  The unusual border consists of eight line segments and takes the form of an inverted 'S', with the island's lighthouse connected to the rest of Finland only by a short stretch of land. 
** [[Kataja|Kataja Island]] (Inakari in Finnish) is divided into two pene-exclaves, one of each nation.  It was formed by the merger of two smaller islands due to post-glacial rebound.
* [[Finland]]/[[Russia]]:
** [[Koiluoto|Koiluoto Island]], located in the [[Gulf of Finland]] in the [[Baltic Sea]], is divided by the two nations; hence, it consists of a pene-exclave of each.

* [[United States of America]]/[[Canada]]:  The two nations share extremely long borders defined by two meridians of longitude and the [[49th parallel north#The Canada – United States border|49th parallel]] of north latitude, crossing many lakes and rivers and, in at least 44 locations, dividing many islands.  Each [[List of divided islands|divided island]] contains a pene-exclave of each nation:
** Canada and the U.S. divide an [http://binged.it/19epoJA island] in the [[Columbia River]] at {{coord|49|0.04|N|117|38.01|W}} near the [[List of Canada–United States border crossings|Waneta border crossing]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[British Columbia]].

The small southern tip is on the U.S. side; the remaining 90% of the island is Canadian.
** In addition to the above, the two nations share a border on approximately 16 other [[List of divided islands#Lake islands|lake islands]] (5 of which are in [[Alaska]]/[[Yukon]]) and approximately 50 other [[List of divided islands#River islands|river islands]] (37 in Alaska/Yukon, including at least 18 among greatly bifurcated flows). The 14 river islands outside of Alaska and Yukon border the states of Washington, Montana, North Dakota and [[Maine]] (1, 7, 1 and 5, respectively) and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, [[Alberta]], Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec and [[New Brunswick]] (1, 5, 2, 1, 1 and 4, respectively). The 15 lake islands at lower latitudes are shared by the states of Washington, Montana, North Dakota, Vermont and Maine (2, 2, 9, 1 and 1, respectively), and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec and New Brunswick (2, 1, 2, 8, 1 and 1, respectively).

=== Subnational pene-enclaves/exclaves (inaccessible districts) ===
* In [[Australia]]:
**The sparsely-inhabited [[Jervis Bay Territory]] occupies a coastal peninsula. It is not part of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), but the laws of the ACT do apply to it. The Jervis Bay Territory is administered by the government of the ACT and thus it is a pene-exclave, accessible only by travel through [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration| url= http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx|work=Although the Jervis Bay Territory is not legally part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply, in so far as they are applicable and, providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in the Territory by virtue of the Jervis Bay Acceptance Act 1915.|publisher=The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The border between [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and New South Wales runs along the top of the south bank of the [[Murray River]] as far east as the source, thus the entire bank between the source and [[South Australia|South Australian]] border technically constitutes a pene-enclave of New South Wales, accessible by crossing the river by road only through Victoria.
* In [[Canada]]:
** The village of [[Atlin, British Columbia]], is only accessible by road through the [[Yukon Territory]].
** The village of [[Tungsten, Northwest Territories]] is only accessible by road through the [[Yukon]].
** Similarly, to reach the towns of [[Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories|Fort McPherson]], [[Tsiigehtchic]] and [[Inuvik]] in the [[Inuvik Region]] by road from elsewhere in the [[Northwest Territories]], it is necessary to drive into Yukon and take the [[Dempster Highway]].
** [[Cold Lake (Canada)|Cold Lake]], a large C-shaped lake, straddles the border between [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in such a way that a peninsula in Albertan territory can only be reached overland by passing through Saskatchewan's [[Meadow Lake Provincial Park]].
* In [[China]]:
**Most of [[Chongming Island]] at the mouth of the [[Yangtze]] is administered as [[Chongming County]] of [[Shanghai]] municipality. However, a long swath of the northern side of the island was added to the island in the 1970s from the formerly separate island of [[Yonglongsha]]. It is divided between [[Haiyong Township|Haiyong]] and [[Qilong Township|Qilong]] [[township (PRC)|townships]], which are administered as pene-exclaves of [[Nantong]]'s [[county (PRC)|county]]-level [[county-level city|cities]] of [[Haimen]] and [[Qidong City|Qidong]], respectively. Formerly connected only by ferry, they joined the mainland's road network with the completion of the [[Chongqi Bridge]], although all routes now pass through Shanghai's territory.
** The northern part of [[Hong Kong]]'s [[Sai Kung Peninsula]] is a part of [[Tai Po District]], not [[Sai Kung District]]. There is no direct road link between two areas.

**[[Kõinastu]] islet village of [[Saaremaa Parish]] is accessible both by sea from [[Saaremaa]] island and on land and shallow water from the insular [[Muhu Parish]];
* In [[Finland]], the [[South Karelia]]n municipality of [[Taipalsaari]] is spread across several islands and peninsulas in [[Lake Saimaa]], many of which are only accessible by road from its neighbouring municipalities. For example, the village of Merenlahti is located on a small peninsula and the only way to get there by road is through [[Lappeenranta]]. Similarly, Taipalsaari has got five small exclaves that border [[Lemi]] and which can only be accessed from there. 
* In [[Germany]], the North Sea [[tidal island]] of [[Neuwerk]] off the [[Lower Saxony|Lower Saxon]] coast is a pene-exclave of the federal state of [[Hamburg]] during low tide, when one can reach it on foot or by horse carriages.
* In [[Iceland]]:
** [[Hafnarfjörður]] municipality is divided into two sections, on opposite sides of a peninsula.
** Skagabyggð municipality has two noncontiguous pieces with sea access.
** The municipality of [[Grímsnes- og Grafningshreppur]] has three sections. Two sections are connected at a [[quadripoint]], and the third is effectively separate, although administrative boundaries are undetermined.  If this section is in fact connected, then the municipality of [[Bláskógabyggð]] would be divided in two (although still connected at the aforementioned quadripoint).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thingvellir.is/media/14035/Manplan_web200406011330.pdf | title=Thingvellir National Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[India]]:
** The [[Union Territory]] of [[Daman and Diu]] consists of two coastal exclaves in the state of [[Gujarat]]. Of these, [[Diu Island]] is far away from Daman, which is much closer to another former Portuguese colony, [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. However, for historical reasons these territories are separately administered.
** In [[Tamil Nadu]] State, the [[Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve]] contains 27 exclaves of the two districts of [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]] and [[Tirunelveli district|Tirunelveli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.academia.edu/2255524/Enclaves_in_Kalakad-Mundanthurai_Tiger_Reserve| title= Enclaves In Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve| first= Rauf| last= Ali| date= 29 January 2001| page= 3| accessdate= 2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the [[Netherlands]], the province of [[Overijssel]] has two pene-exclaves on the [[Gelderland]] bank of the [[IJssel]] river opposite the towns of [[Olst]] and [[Wijhe]], in which the villages of Marle (northerly), Welsum and Welsumerveld (southerly) are situated. There are cable ferries between Olst and Welsum and between Wijhe and Vorchten in the municipality of [[Heerde]] (there is no direct connection between Marle and the rest of Overijssel).
* In [[Norway]], the municipalities [[Asker]] and [[Bærum]] are separated from the rest of the county of [[Akershus]] by land that belongs to the counties of [[Oslo]], [[Oppland]] and [[Buskerud]], and [[Oslofjorden]].  However, these municipalities border on the bay of [[Oslofjord]].
* In the [[Philippines]]:
** [[Cotabato City]] is an exclave of Region XII [[SOCCSKSARGEN]] found within the boundaries of [[Maguindanao]] province of [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|ARMM]] (Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao). It is however the regional center of ARMM. 
** In [[SoCCSKSarGen]], [[Sarangani]] province is divided by [[General Santos City]] and [[Sarangani Bay]].
** In [[Zamboanga Peninsula]]:
*** [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela City]] is part of this region (although it is the capital of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|ARMM]] province of [[Basilan]]), but it is separated from it by Basilan Strait.
*** [[Zamboanga del Sur]] – [[Zamboanga City]], a chartered city, is unofficially part of this province but is separated from it by [[Zamboanga Sibugay]].
** In [[Romblon|Romblon Province]], the exclave of the municipality of [[Looc, Romblon|Looc]] is separated by the Looc Bay forming a peninsula with neighboring municipality of [[Santa Fe, Romblon|Santa Fe]].
* In [[Portugal]], [[Vila Real de Santo António Municipality|Vila Real de Santo António]] is divided into 3 ''freguesias'', one of which is a few kilometers west of the other two. The "main," eastern part of its territory (where the municipal seat stands and where most of its inhabitants live) is more than three times smaller than the "secondary" part. To go from the eastern part to the western, one must pass through territory belonging to the municipality of [[Castro Marim]], or go by sea, as all 3 ''freguesias'' face the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the South.
* In the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]), [[Keelung City]] (part of [[Taiwan Province]]) faces [[East China Sea]] on one side and borders [[New Taipei City]] (a [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] not a part of Taiwan Province) on all other sides.
* In [[Romania]], the village of [[Nămoloasa]] ([[Galaţi county]]) can be accessed only through [[Vrancea County]] (where there is a bridge over the [[Siret River]]) because it is separated by the Siret River from the rest of Galaţi county.
* In [[Russia]]:
** [[St. Petersburg]], the administrative center of [[Leningrad Oblast]], is a pene-enclave of it, as it has a shoreline on the [[Baltic Sea]].
** Adjacent to the northwestern boundary of [[Moscow]], there is a small exclave of the [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogorsk]] administrative district located at the 65-km mark outside of the 137-km [[Moscow Ring Road]] (''Moskovskaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga'' or MKAD), within which the administrative center and regional court are located. This area lacks access to the nearby [[Moscow River]].
* In [[Samoa]], [[A'ana]], [[Palauli]], [[Satupa'itea]], and [[Va'a-o-Fonoti]] districts each have one exclave, and [[Gaga'emauga]] district has two.  All parts of each district have sea access.
* In [[South Korea]]:
** [[Incheon]] Metropolitan City: [[Ganghwa Island]] is administered by Incheon, but is connected by bridges to [[Gyeonggi]] Province.
** [[Yeongjong Island]], where [[Incheon International Airport]] is located, is administered by Jung-gu, but is connected by bridges to Seo-gu and Yeonsu-gu. (A "gu" is a geo-political subdivision of S. Korea's metropolitan cities).
* In [[Switzerland]]:
** [[canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] has two pieces separated from the main territory by [[Lake Lucerne]]; one borders [[Schwyz]], the other Nidwalden.
** [[Nidwalden]]'s district of [[Hergiswil]] is separated by an arm of [[Lake Lucerne]].
** One of the pieces of [[canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]] is a large exclave bounded by Vaud and [[Lake Neuchâtel]].
** [[Vaud]] has one exclave, Avenches, bordered by [[Lake Neuchâtel]], Fribourg and the tiny Bernese exclave of Clavaleyres.  The coast of Lake Neuchâtel is thus in seven pieces belonging to four cantons: clockwise from the north they are [[canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], Bern (main), Vaud (Avenches exclave), Fribourg (main), Vaud (main), Fribourg (exclave), Vaud (main).
** Within [[Vaud]], [[Geneva]] has a pene-exclave on the shoreline on [[Lake Geneva]]. It is one of the two separate parts of the commune of [[Céligny]]. 
* In [[Ukraine]], [[Kinburn peninsula]] is administratively a part of [[Mykolaiv Oblast]] but can be reached by land only from [[Kherson Oblast]], as it is surrounded by sea from the main part of Mykolaiv Oblast. 
* In the [[United Arab Emirates]]: 
** The emirate of [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] has three pene-exclaves on the [[Gulf of Oman]]: [[Dibba Al-Hisn]], [[Khor Fakkan]] and [[Kalba|Kalbā]].  Kalbā has two separate parts (east and west) connected by a middle zone that is administered jointly with [[Fujairah]].  Al ‘Ayn al Ghumūr, Samāḩ and Waḩlah are located in this middle zone.  Western Kalbā contains Zārūb, Maskūnah, Falaj, Ḩarrah, Mazārī’, Fayyāᶁ, Wādī La’ili, Wādī Muᶁayq, Minazif and Dhabābiḩah.
** The emirate of [[Fujairah]] comprises two noncontiguous sections on the Gulf of Oman. The southerly of these two sections itself has two separate parts (north and south) connected by the aforementioned middle zone that is administered jointly with Sharjah. Wādī Umm al Ghāt, Wādī al Qūr and Wādī ‘Abd al ‘Aram are in the southernmost part. 
* In the [[United Kingdom]]:
** [[England]]:
*** The village of [[Pentreheyling]] in [[Shropshire]], near the [[Wales|Welsh]] border and south-east of [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]], is disconnected from the rest of [[England]] by road. (see [http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&amp;GridE=-3.11670&amp;GridN=52.53020&amp;lon=-3.11670&amp;lat=52.53020&amp;search_result=Pentreheyling%2CShropshire&amp;db=freegaz&amp;cidr_client=none&amp;lang=&amp;keepicon=true&amp;place=Pentreheyling,Shropshire&amp;pc=&amp;advanced=&amp;client=public&amp;addr2=&amp;quicksearch=Pentreheyling&amp;addr3=&amp;scale=100000&amp;addr1= map]).
*** On the English side of the English/Scottish border, the hamlet of [[High Cocklaw]] is not accessible directly from any other part of England except via footpath.
*** [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] is part of the County of Suffolk, but has only a small strip of land connecting it to the rest of the county and is otherwise entirely surrounded by Cambridgeshire.
** [[Scotland]]:  There are two parts inaccessible from anywhere else other than by traveling through [[England]]; these are [[Edrington Castle]] and the village of [[Cawderstanes]], which is accessible to the rest of Scotland by footbridge only. There is also a small area of land adjacent to a weir on the [[River Tweed]], north of the [[B6350 road]], due south of [[Coldstream]] and due south west of [[Cornhill on Tweed]], from which one can reach the rest of Scotland directly only by crossing the weir.
** [[Wales]]:
*** In [[Flintshire]], on the [[River Dee (United Kingdom)|Dee]] estuary, there are several bits of marshland that are separated from other bits of Wales.
*** There is also a small area of land south of [[Wyastone Leys]] that is inaccessible from any other area of [[Wales]] directly by road, being separated by land and the [[River Wye]].
*** Several small uninhabited areas near the hamlet of Part-Y-Seal or Pant-Y-Seal near [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire]] are inaccessible from Wales directly; these include one farm, two river banks and a small island in the [[River Monnow]]. These appear to be due to shifts in the course of the river.
* In the [[United States of America]]:
** Shifts in the [[meander]]ing course of the [[lower Mississippi River]] have created numerous pene-exclaves.
***Arkansas has territory at {{coord|35.65|N|89.87|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}} across the Mississippi River on the northwest edge of Tennessee's [[Fort Pillow State Park]], north of the Corona/Reverie, Tennessee irregularity (see below).
***Illinois' [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], Missouri's [[Grand Tower Island]] and other Illinois and Missouri territory on each other's side of the Mississippi River.
***The state of [[Mississippi]] controls at least 11 exclaves on the west bank of the Mississippi River in [[Louisiana]], while Louisiana owns 8 exclaves on Mississippi's side.
***Mississippi state also owns 14 exclaves on the bank in [[Arkansas]], while Arkansas has 15 of its own on Mississippi's side.
** In [[California]]:
*** [[Coast Guard Island]] in the Oakland estuary is part of the city of [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] but it is accessible only via a bridge from [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].
*** The [[seaport]] of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]] is part of the [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]] but is connected to the rest of the city only by a narrow strip of land known as the [[Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, California|Harbor Gateway]], four [[city block]]s wide and several miles long.
*** [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] borders the [[Pacific Ocean]] on one side but it is otherwise completely surrounded by the City of Los Angeles.
*** The City of [[San Diego]] has a significantly large exclave. It includes the communities of [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]], [[Otay Mesa]], Palm, and other neighborhoods considered as parts of San Diego. This piece of San Diego is separated from the main portion of San Diego by 7 miles, divided by the cities of [[National City, California|National City]] and [[Chula Vista]]. Technically, it is connected to the rest of San Diego by a seven-mile-long, two-inch-wide strip of land on the bottom of [[San Diego Bay]]. Hence, it is essentially an exclave, and it is commonly referred to as "South San Diego". 
*** The city of [[Coronado, California|Coronado]], nearly encircled by San Diego Bay, can be reached by land only via a narrow isthmus connected to [[Imperial Beach, CA|Imperial Beach]].  A bridge also connects it to San Diego. Four other small pene-exclaves occupy the same peninsula. Coastal lands that are north of Wright Ave., at the northern end of First St., part of Coronado Ferry Landing Park, and that surround most of [[Naval Air Station North Island]] (island before 1945) are part of the city of [[San Diego]] and are accessible on land only through the city of Coronado. A large portion of the famous Coronado beach is in the City of San Diego.
*** [[Redwood Shores]] on the San Francisco Peninsula is part of [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], but is only connected with the rest of the city by an area of wetland in [[San Francisco Bay]]. It is accessible only via the cities of [[San Carlos, California|San Carlos]] and [[Belmont, California|Belmont]].
*** [[Devils Postpile National Monument]] in eastern [[Madera County]], California, is inaccessible from the remainder of the county due to wilderness areas of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range. It can be reached only via [[Mono County]] near [[Mammoth Lakes]].
*** The [[General Grant Grove]] is an isolated, noncontiguous section of [[Kings Canyon National Park]].
*** Some privately owned land within [[Mariposa County]] is surrounded by [[Yosemite National Park]] in the area of [[Wawona Hotel|Wawona]], since it was grandfathered at the park's formation to remain private.
** [[Delaware]] – At least two parcels of land on the eastern (New Jersey) side of the [[Delaware River]] belong to the state of Delaware (the bulk of which is west of the river) and not to New Jersey. This is because within the "[[Twelve Mile Circle]]", the entire Delaware River, to the low water mark, is the territory of Delaware and not New Jersey (unlike many other river borders where the border is at some intermediate point in the river itself). As a result, certain areas (including the [[Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge]] and a portion of the [[Salem Nuclear Power Plant]]) on the New Jersey side of the river that have been expanded by adding fill into areas that were historically below the low water mark are considered part of [[New Castle County, Delaware]], and not [[Salem County, New Jersey]]. Both of these areas are accessible by land only by traveling through New Jersey.
** [[Kentucky]] – [[Ellis Park Race Course]], a [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] track in [[Henderson, Kentucky]], actually lies to the north of the [[Ohio River]] that forms the border between Kentucky and [[Indiana]]. The border is based on the river's course when Kentucky achieved statehood in 1792; a change in course to the south left the land that would later house Ellis Park cut off from the rest of Kentucky by the river. [[Bi-State Vietnam Gold Star Bridges|A pair of bridges]] across the Ohio connect the track to the rest of Kentucky.
** [[Iowa]] – The town of [[Carter Lake, Iowa]], occupied a [[meander]] on the left bank of the [[Missouri River]], until 1877 when flooding caused the river to jump its banks, shortening the main stream. The meander became an [[oxbow lake]] and Carter Lake now found itself on the right bank, attached to [[Nebraska]]. A lengthy court case ensued; the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] finally held that the sudden change in the river's course did not change the original boundary, and Carter Lake was still part of Iowa. (''Nebraska v. Iowa'', 143 U.S. 359 (1892)). The Court delayed a final decree to allow Nebraska and Iowa to reach an agreement consistent with its holding, which the states did. (145 U.S. 519 (1892)). All of the roads into Carter Lake run through [[Omaha, Nebraska]].   
**For similar geographic reasons several portions of [[Nebraska]] lie east of the [[Missouri River]], mainly due to flooding and changes in the river's path:
***[[DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge]] near Blair, which borders Iowa. A portion of Iowa is also on the Nebraska side in the same area.
***[[McKissick Island]] near Peru, which borders Missouri.
***A section of land that borders Iowa, [[Sloan, Iowa|Sloan]].
***Onawa Materials Yard Wildlife Area and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Management Area near [[Onawa, Iowa]].
** [[Louisiana]] – The island of [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]] is part of [[Jefferson Parish]] but can be reached on land only via a bridge from [[Lafourche Parish]].
** In [[Massachusetts]]:
*** [[Humarock]], legally part of [[Scituate, Massachusetts|Scituate]], was separated from the rest of the town in the [[Blizzard of 1898]], in which the mouth of the [[North River (Massachusetts Bay)|North River]] shifted. The village is only accessible via a bridge which connects it to [[Marshfield, Massachusetts|Marshfield]], but has a peninsular connection to the mainland to the south at the old mouth of the North River, now [http://toposm.ahlzen.com/?zoom=13&amp;layers=B000&amp;lat=42.13254&amp;lon=-70.68382 Rexhame Beach].
*** [[Long Island (Massachusetts)|Long Island]], situated in [[Boston Harbor]], is part of the City of [[Boston]] ([[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) yet remains accessible by road only from [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] ([[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]]).
*** The town of [[Sandwich, Massachusetts|Sandwich]] is partially separated in its northern portion by the [[Cape Cod Canal]] and is only accessible by road through the neighboring town of [[Bourne, Massachusetts|Bourne]].
** [[Michigan]] –
*** The "[[Lost Peninsula]]" in Monroe County, Michigan, can only be reached via [[Toledo, Ohio]]. It is otherwise surrounded by [[Maumee Bay]] in [[Lake Erie]]. ([https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=monroe,+mi&amp;ll=41.736223,-83.456655&amp;spn=0.009111,0.02429 Map])
*** The [[Upper Peninsula]] is attached by land to [[Wisconsin]]. It is connected to the rest of Michigan via the {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} [[Mackinac Bridge]] on [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]].
** [[Missouri]] – St. Joseph Rosecrans Memorial Airport is separated from St. Joseph and Buchanan County by the [[Missouri River]]; the airport lies on the west bank of the river, with the remainder of the city and county on the east bank.  The only land access to the airport from Missouri is via [[Kansas]] Route 238 through Elwood.
** In [[New Jersey]]:  In [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]], [[Long Beach Township, New Jersey|Long Beach Township]] is split into four parts, each with sea access.
*** Elsewhere in Ocean County, [[Dover Beaches South, New Jersey|Ortley Beach]] and [[Dover Beaches North, New Jersey|some other small sections]] of [[Toms River Township, New Jersey|Toms River]], otherwise inland, are located on Barnegat Peninsula.
** In [[New York (state)|New York]]:
*** The construction in 1895 of the [[Harlem River Ship Canal]] isolated [[Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York|Marble Hill]], a small portion of the northern tip of Manhattan ([[New York County]]). Initially an island, it was later physically connected to the Bronx by the filling of [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]]. It remains politically part of Manhattan, to which it is connected by the Broadway Bridge. Thus, it is part of the Borough of Manhattan and New York County, but not the island of Manhattan.
*** [[Rockaway, Queens|Rockaway Peninsula]], part of [[Queens]], is connected to the rest of New York City only by two causeways across Jamaica Bay, or through [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]].
*** [[Riker's Island]], the [[County jail|jail]] complex of the [[City of New York]], is considered to be in the borough of [[The Bronx]], but is only accessible via the Riker's Island Bridge, which terminates in the Borough of [[Queens]].
*** Manhattan's borders often extend to the shorelines of the other boroughs so that, for example, certain piers extending from the [[Brooklyn]] waterfront are part of Manhattan but accessible only from Brooklyn. Manhattan (New York County) claims the entire [[East River]] bed.
*** A {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} strip of the [[Bronx]] is separated from the rest of the borough by [[Pelham Bay Park]] as a result of a past error in drawing the border. The only residential street in this pene-exclave, Park Drive, is accessible by car only via the town of [[Pelham (town), Westchester County, New York|Pelham]], in [[Westchester County]].
*** A small part of the city of [[Mount Vernon]] is cut off from the rest of the city by the [[Cross County Parkway]]. The three streets of Alta Drive, Alta Parkway and Labelle Road can only be accessed by car via the town of [[Eastchester (town), New York|Eastchester]].
*** The geography of the [[Catskill Mountains]] in [[upstate New York]] creates pene-exclaves in two counties. [[Halcott, New York|Halcott]], at the southwestern corner of [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]], and [[Hardenburgh, New York|Hardenburgh]], at the western corner of [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], have extensive borders with neighboring towns in their respective counties. But those are along mountain ridgelines directly crossed only by hiking trails, or (in Halcott's case) poor-quality unpaved roads, and vehicles traveling to those towns from the rest of the county must take roads through neighboring counties to do so.
*** The town of Hardenbergh is also an exclave of itself. The only road directly connecting its southern half, along the upper [[Beaver Kill]], and the northern half along [[Dry Brook (East branch Delaware River)|Dry Brook]], now runs through state-owned [[Forest Preserve (New York)|Forest Preserve]] lands and is closed to vehicle traffic. To get between those two halves, cars must travel through neighboring Delaware County. 
*** [[Fishers Island]] is part of the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[Southold (town), New York|Southold]] in [[Suffolk County, New York]] but is accessible only by ferry from Connecticut.
** In [[North Carolina]]: 
***[[Knotts Island, North Carolina|Knotts Island]] in [[Currituck County]] is only accessible by road through Virginia Beach, Virginia via a narrow strip of land from the west. A 45-minute ferry connects the island to the rest of Currituck.
***On the north shore of [[Lake Gaston]] lie several small areas connected only by land to Virginia.  Most of these have road and bridge connections to North Carolina, but one small area south of [[Joyceville, Virginia]] has road connections only to Virginia.
** In [[Pennsylvania]], the westernmost section of the city of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] is a pene-en(ex)clave connected at a quadripoint with the rest of the city; it is surrounded by [[South Whitehall Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|South Whitehall Township]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USGS National Map Viewer| accessdate=2013-08-19 |url= http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/?p=default&amp;b=base1&amp;q=Allentown%2C%20Pa&amp;x=-8407964.101952802&amp;y=4952901.870368204&amp;l=15&amp;v=Boundaries%3A4%3B14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Also in Pennsylvania, [[Pond Eddy, Pennsylvania|Pond Eddy]], an unincorporated area along the [[Delaware River]] in [[Pike County, Pennsylvania|Pike County]]'s [[Shohola Township, Pike County, Pennsylvania|Shohola Township]], is not connected by road to anywhere else in the town, county, or state. It can only be reached by driving to the [[Pond Eddy Bridge]] via roads in New York.
** In [[Rhode Island]], the city of [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] has an exclave called [[Potowomut, Rhode Island|Potowomut]] separated from the main body of the city by [[Greenwich Bay (Rhode Island)|Greenwich Bay]] on the north and the town of [[East Greenwich, Rhode Island|East Greenwich]] on the west.
*** Elsewhere in Rhode Island, [[Newport County, Rhode Island|Newport County]] consists of three islands and one mainland portion, connected to [[Aquidneck Island|Aquidneck]], by a bridge.
** In [[Tennessee]], over a period of about 24 hours on 7 March 1876, the Mississippi River abandoned its former channel that defined the Tennessee-Arkansas border, and established a new channel east of the town of [[Reverie, Tennessee]]. This places Reverie on the Arkansas side, while most of the area of [[Tipton County, Tennessee|Tipton County]] is located east of the Mississippi River, the Tennessee side. The direct distance between Reverie and the county seat, [[Covington, Tennessee]], is only 18 miles (29&amp;nbsp;km), but the road trip to Covington requires the driver to cross the Mississippi River at [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and it is longer than 83 miles (134&amp;nbsp;km).
** In [[South Carolina]], small parts of [[Horry County, SC|Horry County]] lie on the north shore of the [[Little River (Horry County, South Carolina)|Little River]] or the nearby [[Intracoastal Waterway]] and can only be reached by land connection from neighboring North Carolina. The land is unpopulated and no roads exist in the area.  
** [[Grand Isle County, Vermont]], in that state's northwest corner, consists of the Alburgh Tongue (see above) and several islands in [[Lake Champlain]]. It is only connected to the rest of the state via bridges.
** In [[Virginia]]:
***The [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]], comprising [[Accomack County, VA|Accomack County]] and [[Northampton County, VA|Northampton County]], is located at the southern tip of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], conterminous only with [[Maryland]] on its north. It is connected to the rest of Virginia by the {{convert|23|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]].
***Several pieces of land along the shores of [[Kerr Lake]] and [[Lake Gaston]] can only be accessed by land from North Carolina. Some areas are undeveloped, but others, especially along the south shore of Kerr Lake, have state highways and settlement.
** The resort of [[Mont Du Lac, Wisconsin|Mont Du Lac]], Wisconsin, and the area to its north are accessible only by a {{convert|0.8|mi|km|adj=on}} section of [[Minnesota State Highway 23]] that runs through [[Douglas County, Wisconsin|Douglas County]], in Wisconsin's northwest corner. Several local dead-end roads run off it; there is no way to reach this part of the county or state by vehicle from anywhere else in Wisconsin.
** [[Washington, D.C.]] – [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]] in the Potomac River is part of Washington, D.C., but only accessible by a footbridge from Virginia. Although the [[Theodore Roosevelt Bridge]] from Washington to Virginia passes over the island, one cannot exit from the bridge onto the island.

====Divided islands====
* In [[Australia]]: [[Boundary Islet]], historically known as North East Islet, is a [[Hogan Group]] islet of less than {{convert|2|ha|acre|spell=in}} that straddles the border of the Australian states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]]. The islet is Tasmania's only land boundary, and at {{convert|85|m|ft}} long, it is the shortest land border between any Australian state or territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/one-island-two-countries/ |title=One Island, Two Countries |date=April 24, 2012 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |first=Frank |last= Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Canada]]:
** [[Killiniq Island]] is shared between [[Nunavut]] and the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].
** [[Nunavut]] and the [[Northwest Territories]] (NWT) share four islands that are split by the [[110th meridian west|110° W meridian]]: [[Borden Island]], [[Mackenzie King Island]], [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]] and [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]]. Excluding lake crossings, Melville Island contains three separate land boundaries between Nunavut and NWT due to coastal undulation, while Victoria Island contains six such land boundaries (one of which is on a small island).
* In the [[China|People's Republic of China]]:
** [[Zhongshan Dao]] is divided between [[Guangdong Province]] and the [[Special Administrative Region]]  and former Portuguese overseas province of  [[Macau]].
** Part of [[Hengqin Island]] in [[Zhuhai]], Guangdong Province is leased to Macau until 2049 to house the new campus of the [[University of Macau]]. The university campus is sealed off from the rest of the island by a fence, and access to the area is provided by an underwater tunnel to Macau.
* In the [[United States]], the [[City and County of San Francisco]] has four pene-enclaves on three islands in [[San Francisco Bay]], which it shares with neighboring counties: 
** On [[Alameda Island]] adjoining [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], artificial fill on the border between the two counties to build the [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (now decommissioned) created the pene-enclave. This small piece of open space can be reached on land only by passing through [[Oakland, CA|Oakland]] and [[Alameda, CA|Alameda]].
** There are two small (5.37 [[acre]]s) pieces of land on the eastern end of [[Angel Island, California|Angel Island]] (Quarry Point and the tip of Point Blunt) that belong to San Francisco. The rest (99.3%) of Angel Island lies in the town of [[Tiburon, California|Tiburon]], which is in [[Marin County, CA|Marin County]].  
** San Francisco and [[Contra Costa County]] share [[Red Rock Island]]. A [[tripoint]] with Marin County may sometimes be exposed at low tide.
*Also in the [[United States]], 
** Rhode Island and Connecticut share [[Sandy Point Island]] in [[Little Narragansett Bay]].
** New Jersey and New York share [[Shooter's Island]], a bird sanctuary located in the south end of [[Newark Bay]] off the north shore of [[Staten Island]]. (The small portion in New Jersey is further divided between two counties.)
** Delaware and Maryland share [[Fenwick Island (Delaware–Maryland)|Fenwick Island]].
** Maryland and Virginia share [[Smith Island, Maryland|Smith Island]] in [[Chesapeake Bay]], as well as [[Assateague Island]] on the Atlantic coast.
** Virginia and North Carolina share [[Knotts Island, North Carolina|Knotts Island]], [[Mon Island, North Carolina|Mon Island]] and [[Simon Island, Virginia|Simon Island]], separated from the Atlantic by an intracoastal waterway.
** North Carolina and South Carolina share [[Bird Island, North Carolina|Bird Island]] on the Atlantic coast.
** Florida and Alabama share [[Perdido Key]] in the Gulf of Mexico.
** Alabama and Mississippi share [[South Rigolets Island]] in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as an unnamed coastal island at the mouth of [[Bayou Heron]].
** Minnesota and Wisconsin share [[Interstate Island]] State Wildlife Management Area in [[Saint Louis River|Saint Louis Bay]] between Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin.
** Michigan and Ohio share [[Turtle Island (Lake Erie)|Turtle Island]] in Lake Erie.
** At the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], Oregon and Washington share [[Sand Island (Oregon)|Sand Island Dike]] and [[Rice Island (Oregon)|Rice Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=2–27|url=http://www.fws.gov/pacific/planning/main/docs/WA/jbh-lc/Draft%20CCP%20EIS/2%20Chapter%202%20Alternatives%20Goals%20Objectives%20and%20Strategies.pdf| title= Lewis and Clark and Julia Butler Hansen National Wildlife Refuges Draft CCP/EIS Chapter 2.

* [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] was a [[Denmark|Danish]] exclave within [[Germany]] from 1640 to 1864.
* [[Bhutan]] – [[Darchen|Tarchen]], Cherkip Gompa, Dho, Dungmar, Gesur, Gezon, Itse Gompa, Khochar, Nyanri, Ringung, Sanmar and Zuthulphuk were exclaves of [[Bhutan]] within [[Tibet]] from the 1640s until 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bray |first=J.|title= Ladakhi and Bhutanese enclaves in Tibet | work= Recent Research on Ladakh | volume=Proceedings of the 7th Colloquium of the International Association for Ladakh Studies.

* [[Bophuthatswana]] was a [[bantustan]] or "black homeland" that was granted nominal independence by [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] from 1977 until being re-absorbed in April 1994, but it remained unrecognized internationally. It consisted of a scattered patchwork of individual enclaves, six that were true enclaves within South Africa and two that bordered Botswana and South Africa.
* [[Cheikh Saïd]] is a rocky peninsula in present-day [[Yemen]] between the [[Gulf of Aden]] and the [[Red Sea]]. Although as late as 1970, the [[Petit Larousse]] described it as having been a "French colony from 1868 to 1936," France never claimed formal jurisdiction or sovereignty over it.
* within [[China]] –
:* [[Forbidden City]] – The [[Xinhai Revolution]] led to the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] (ROC) in 1912. In exchange for the abdication of the last Qing emperor [[Puyi]], the Qing court and the ROC government signed an agreement for the favourable treatment of the abdicated emperor. Puyi was allowed to retain his title as emperor and was accorded the courtesies as a foreign monarch by the ROC government, and the imperial court remained at the Forbidden City. The [[Flag of the Qing Dynasty|Dragon Flag]] of the Qing Dynasty remained hoisted inside the Forbidden City, certain government organs such as the [[Imperial Household Department]], [[Imperial Clan Court]] and Ministry of Justice continued to exist within the palace walls, and the emperor continued to hold court, appoint officials and grant titles of nobility. Following the [[Beijing coup]] in 1924, the [[warlord]] [[Feng Yuxiang]] unilaterally revised the agreement, abolishing Puyi's title of emperor, his right to live in the Forbidden City and other related arrangements.
:* Unlike [[Hong Kong Island]], the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and the [[New Territories]] that were added later constituted a pene-exclave of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] from 1860/1898 until 1997. Kowloon south of Boundary Street was ceded in perpetuity, whereas the New Territories was turned over under a 99-year lease.
:* [[Kowloon Walled City]] was a counter-enclave belonging to China on the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] of Hong Kong from 1898 to 1993. The question of jurisdiction led to a hands-off approach by Chinese and British authorities over the years until the quality of life became intolerable. A mutual decision to demolish the 2.6 hectares of structures was announced in 1987 and completed in 1994.
:* [[Guangzhouwan|Kwang-Chou-Wan]] was a pene-exclave of [[France]] on the south coast of China from 1898, upon its lease to France by Qing China, until its return by France in 1946; its territory included the islands in the bay and land on both banks of the Maxie River, covering 1300 km² of land.
:* Kwantung was a pene-exclave of [[Russian Dalian|Russia]] and later [[Kwantung Leased Territory|Japan]] in the southern part of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] in [[Manchuria]] that existed from 1898 to 1945 and included the ports of [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]] (or Ryojun) and [[Dalian|Dal'niy]] (or Dairen), the latter founded in 1899. It was leased to Russia from 1898 until 1905, when Japan replaced Russia as leaseholder. After World War II, the [[Soviet Union]] occupied the territory in 1945, jointly administering it with the Chinese before turning it over to the People's Republic of China in 1955.
:* Jinzhou walled central city remained an enclave of Chinese territory within Kwantung under the lease with Russia. This provision was substantially ignored by Japan after it replaced Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2013-10-04 |title=Enclave of Chinese territory in the Guandong: Jinzhou Castle Walled City (English translation) |url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.geocities.co.jp/SilkRoad-Lake/2917/china/kantosyu.html&amp;usg=ALkJrhhcBe5mLZUksOTYeImTu8LcGt5qNA#kin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Macao]] was a pene-exclave of [[Portugal]] on the coast of the [[South China Sea]] from 1557 until 1999.
:* [[Zhongshan Dao]] island in the [[Pearl River Delta]] was divided between [[China]] and [[Macao]] as a pair of pene-exclaves dating from ratification of the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] in 1862 through the 1999 return of Macao to China.
:* [[Qingdao]], with an area of 552 km², was a pene-exclave of [[Germany]] (also known as the [[Kiautschou Bay concession]]), and later [[Japan]], from 1898 to 1922, adjacent to [[Jiaozhou Bay]] on the southern coast of the [[Shandong Peninsula]] in East China. The village of Qingdao became the German colony of Tsingtau. In 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, the Republic of China canceled the lease with Germany. Japan then occupied the city and province until December 1922, when it reverted to Chinese rule.
:* [[Shanghai]] was the location of British (from 1846) and American (from 1848) Concessions (later [[Shanghai International Settlement]] from 1863–1943) and the [[Shanghai French Concession]] from 1849–1946. Unlike the British sovereign colonies of [[Hong Kong Island]] and Wei-hai-wei, these [[Concession (territory)|foreign concessions]] always remained Chinese sovereign territory.
:* [[Weihai|Wei-hai-wei]] was a pene-exclave of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] that bordered the [[Yellow Sea]] in eastern [[Shandong]] province of China. The city was a British colony, known also as the Weihai Garrison and sometimes as Port Edward, from 1898 to 1 October 1930, when it was returned to China.  Its current name is Weihai.
:* Wei-hai-wei walled central city was excluded from the leased territory and remained an enclave of Chinese territory within Wei-hai-wei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=2013-10-04 | url = http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.geocities.co.jp/SilkRoad-Lake/2917/china/weihaiwei.html&amp;usg=ALkJrhi7d4qSkyuc4AssH8DnzsIoYXXttA#01 |title= Enclave of Chinese territory in the Weihaiwei: Weihaiwei Castle Walled City  (English translation) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{see also|List of former foreign enclaves in China}}
* [[Comtat Venaissin]] was an exclave of [[Papal States|Papal]] territory within [[France]] from 1348–1791.  It contained an enclave of another Papal territory, the city of [[Avignon]] and had a small exclave around the nearby town of [[Valréas]].
* [[Despotate of the Morea]] on the [[Peloponnesos]] peninsula of present-day [[Greece]] was a geographically detached province of the [[Byzantine Empire]] from 1349–1460; during much of that time, in addition to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], it was surrounded by "states under Latin rule."
* [[East Pakistan]] (1947–1971), now [[Bangladesh]], was a pene-exclave of [[Pakistan]] (if one considers [[West Pakistan]], site of the capital, Islamabad, as the main land) that bordered the [[Bay of Bengal]], [[India]] and [[Burma]]. East Pakistan, with a distance of 1,600&amp;nbsp;km separating it from West Pakistan, accounted for 70% of the country's exports and was more populous than West Pakistan.
* [[Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá#São João Baptista de Ajudá|Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá]] was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] exclave (initially around 1&amp;nbsp;km² in area and reduced to only 2 ha by 1961) within Dahomey/[[Benin]] from 1680 until 1961 (''de facto'' annexation by Dahomey) or 1975 (Portuguese recognition).
* [[France]] – The island of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]] at the mouth of the [[Couesnon]] River prior to 1879 was a pene-exclave of [[Normandy]], but only during low tide, when it was connected by a tidal [[causeway]] to the neighbouring coast. The raised causeway that was then built was replaced with a light bridge opened in 2014, thus making Mont-Saint-Michel an island again.
* [[Germany]] –
:* [[East Prussia]] (1919–1939), a [[Germany|German]] pene-exclave during the [[Weimar Republic]], was separated from Germany after [[World War I]], when [[Poland]] regained access to the [[Baltic Sea]] ([[Polish corridor]]). The territory of East Prussia (essentially the old [[Duchy of Prussia]]) is now divided into [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] in [[Russia]], the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodship]] in [[Poland]], and [[Klaipėda County]] in [[Lithuania]].
:* {{ill|Hemmeres|de}}, (1922–1949), surrounded by [[Belgium|Belgian]] territory, was the sixth and southernmost of the Vennbahn enclaves created in 1922; it contained five households.&lt;ref name="EV" /&gt; The railway suffered severe damage during World War II and was not rebuilt. It ceased being an enclave when [[Belgian annexation plans after the Second World War|Belgium annexed]] the entirety in 1949. Hemmeres was reintegrated into West Germany on 28 August 1958, by an agreement with Belgium.
:* [[Jestetten]] is a [[Germany|German]] town in the district of [[Waldshut (district)|Waldshut]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]] that was inaccessible except by traveling through [[Switzerland]], until a connecting road was constructed.
:* {{ill|Roetgener Wald|de|Lammersdorf}} was two enclaves from 1949 to 1958. Unlike its present configuration, the German enclave in 1922 was smaller in area because the central portion (between Grenzweg and a boundary with three turning points west of the Schleebach stream) was Belgian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~225664~5506127:Belgium--The-Geographical-Institute?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No |accessdate=2013-05-04|title=The Times Atlas of the World. Belgium, Plate 61, V. III |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. Boston London |first=John|last=Bartholomew |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the road connecting the two outer German portions (Highways 258/399) was German territory until 1949, the German land formed one enclave. The intersecting north-south road from Fringshaus to Konzen (now Highway B258, which has no connection to the Belgian road network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://borderhunting.blogspot.com/2007/07/vennbahn-bahnhof-konzenfringshaus.html |title=Vennbahn: Bahnhof Konzen/Fringshaus |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was also part of the oddly shaped enclave. In 1949 [[Belgian annexation plans after the Second World War|Belgium annexed]] these roads, thus separating the enclave into two enclaves for the next nine years. In 1958 Belgium ceded the center section of territory to West Germany, in addition to returning the adjacent east-west connecting road.&lt;ref name="IBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS007.pdf|title=International Boundary Study, Belgium-Germany Boundary|date=30 June 1961|author=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created one larger enclave in its present form. Highway B258 is the only portion of land that, once having been a part of the Roetgener Wald enclave, is now not within the enclave.
:* [[Belgium]] had a counter-enclave located near [[Fringshaus]] from 6 November 1922 until 23 April 1949, while Germany owned the connecting roads that were part of the Roetgener Wald enclave. These roads met at a traffic island north of Fringshaus, with the 2279 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; island itself being a part of Belgium. This counter-enclave was extinguished in 1949 when Belgium annexed the German roads that intersected at the traffic island. In 1958, when Belgium returned the east-west road to Germany, this traffic island also became part of the Roetgener Wald enclave.
:* [[Verenahof]] was a [[Germany|German]] exclave within [[Switzerland]] until 1967, at which time its border became attached to Germany through a treaty implementing a land swap of a total of just under 1.06 km² in equal shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/i1/0.132.136.3.de.pdf|title=Contract between the Swiss Confederation and the Federal Republic of Germany|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[West Berlin]], upon the division of Berlin after World War II and before the reunification of [[Germany]] in 1990, was ''de facto'' a [[West Germany|West German]] exclave within [[East Germany]]. Twelve small West Berlin land areas, such as [[Steinstücken]], were in turn separated from the main body of West Berlin, some by only a few meters. In addition, there were several small areas of East Berlin that were surrounded by West Berlin. All of Berlin was ruled "de jure" by the four Allied powers; this meant that West Berlin could not send voting members to the German Parliament and that its citizens were exempt from conscription.

::* [[Staaken|West-Staaken]] – ''de jure'' part of Soviet sector but ''de facto'' administered by [[Spandau| Spandau Borough]] in the British sector; seized by East Germany in 1951 and made an exclave of East Berlin's [[Mitte (locality)|Borough of Mitte]], which it remained officially until being incorporated in 1961 by the neighboring town of [[Falkensee]] in non-Berlin East Germany.
* [[Gwadar]] was an [[Oman]]i pene-exclave on the Arabian Sea coast of present-day [[Pakistan]] from 1784 until 1958.
* [[Ifni]] was a pene-exclave of [[Spain]] on the Atlantic coast of [[Morocco]] from 1859 to 1969.
* within [[India]] –
:* [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] were enclaves inland from the Arabian Sea coast covering an area of 487 km². After invasion by pro-Indian Union forces in 1954, they achieved ''de facto'' independence from [[Portugal]]. They and three Portuguese pene-exclaves, the city of [[Goa]] and the two small coastal exclaves of [[Daman and Diu]], were the last remnants of [[Portuguese India]], which existed from 1505 until [[1961 Indian annexation of Goa|military conquest]] by India on 19 December 1961. (A 1956 map also shows a counter-enclave within Nagar Haveli belonging to [[Mumbai|Bombay]], approximately corresponding to the village of [[Maghval]] – this village was not ceded to Portugal because of its inhabitants' caste's sacrosanctity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.co.jp/SilkRoad-Lake/2917/india/meghval.html|title=メグバル|last=yoshida|website=www.geocities.co.jp|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[French India]] – Pondicherry and the other exclaves of Karaikal, Mahé and Yanaon were absorbed into India ''de facto'' in 1954 and ''de jure'' in 1962 after the Algerian War.  In 1761 the British captured all of them from the French (and also [[Chandannagar]]), but the Treaty of Paris (1763) returned them to France.  Those possessions passed again to British control before finally being handed over to the French in 1816/1817 under the 1814 Treaty of Paris.  Pondicherry, Karaikal, Mahé and Yanaon came to be administered as the [[Union Territory]] of [[Puducherry]] in 1963.  All four are now sub-national ex(en)claves within India.
::* [[Pondicherry]], was the site of a trading center set up by the [[French East India Company]] in 1674, which eventually became the chief French settlement in India, after passing several times between Dutch, British and French control.  It comprised 12 non-contiguous parts: three pene-exclaves on the [[Bay of Bengal]] and nine nearby true enclaves.  Inside the main Pondicherry exclave was a small counter-enclave belonging to India straddling the [[Sankaraparani River|Chunnambar River]].
::* [[Mahé, India|Mahé]] (or Mayyazhi), a small (9 km²) town, was a pene-exclave on the [[Malabar Coast]] of the [[Arabian Sea]] from 1721.  Mahé was composed of three non-contiguous parts, including Mahé town and two true enclaves: [[Cherukallayi]] and one consisting of [[Palloor]], [[Chalakkara]] and [[Pandakkal]].
::* [[Yanaon]] (or Yanam), a 30 km² pene-exclave in the delta of [[Godavari River]], nine kilometers from the [[Coromandel Coast]] and Bay of Bengal.  It was a Dutch colony before France overtook it in 1723 and made it a French colony.
::* [[Karaikal]] was a small coastal pene-exclave on the Bay of Bengal acquired by France in 1739 from the regime of [[Raja Pratap Singh]] of [[Tanjore]].  By 1760 it included 81 villages around Karaikal town.
::* [[Chandannagar]] was a small true enclave established as a French colony in 1673, located on the right bank of the [[Hooghly River]] 30 kilometers north of [[Kolkata]].  Bengal was then a province of the [[Mughal Empire]].  The British returned the city to France in 1816, along with a 7.8 km² nearby enclave.  In May 1950, with French approval, India assumed ''de facto'' control, with the ''de jure'' transfer in June 1952. In 1955 it was integrated into West Bengal state.
::* [[Trincomalee]] was in present-day [[Sri Lanka]] (then a part of India) located on the Indian Ocean east coast of the island.  By September 1782 it was occupied by the French after the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] with the British, only to be ceded back to the British in 1783.  
[[File:Italian_States_in_1789.png|thumb|225px|right|Italy in 1789 before the French Revolutionary Wars]]
*[[Italy]]/[[Switzerland]] – In Italy in 1789 before the French Revolutionary Wars, the following states possessed or were true enclaves:
:* [[Tarasp|Lordship of Tarasp]] was surrounded by the [[Three Leagues|Free States of the Three Leagues]].
:* An exclave of the [[Republic of Geneva]] (1541–1798) was surounded by the [[Duchy of Savoy]].
:* [[Torriglia|Prinicpality of Torriglia]] (1760–1797) was surrounded by the [[Republic of Genoa]].
:* [[Republic of Senarica]] (1343–1797) was surrounded by the [[Kingdom of Naples]].

* The [[Lado Enclave]] was a 39,000&amp;nbsp;km² exclave of the [[Congo Free State]] and later of [[Belgian Congo]] that existed from 1894 until 1910, situated on the west bank of the [[Nile River|Upper Nile]] in present-day [[South Sudan]] and northwest [[Uganda]].
* [[Mount Scopus]] (in [[Jerusalem]]) was an [[Israel]]i exclave in [[Jordan]] between 1948 and 1967, before being reunited with West Jerusalem following the [[Six-Day War]]. Similarly, [[Ein Gev]], located on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, was a pene-exclave in Syria until Israel took over the Golan Heights territory, again during the Six-Day War.

* [[Panama]] – 
:* [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], an exclave of [[Panama]] from 1903 to July 27, 1939, was surrounded by the U.S. [[Panama Canal Zone]], until a treaty provision connected it to the main part of Panama via a corridor.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;
:* [[Panama City]] and the tip of [[Paitilla Point]] from 1903 to February 11, 1915, were pene-enclaves surrounded by the U.S. [[Panama Canal Zone]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]].

:* When Madden Road was ceded to the U.S. by treaty on July 27, 1939, a [[Vennbahn]]-type Panamanian enclave was created that was bounded by Madden Road, the main Canal Zone boundary, and a contour line above [[Rio Chagres]] and [[Rio Chilibre]]. Another treaty that took effect on April 11, 1955, de-enclaved it.
:* Panama had a water enclave in Limon Bay from 1979 to December 31, 1999. It also had jurisdiction over one building within the U.S. Summit Naval Station from October 1991 until the transfer of the station to Panama on December 31, 1999.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;
* Pogiriai (Pogiry) was a [[Lithuania]]n exclave of 1.7&amp;nbsp;km² that was ceded to [[Belarus]] in 1996.
* The southern section of the Emirate of [[Ras al-Khaimah]] was a national-level exclave surrounded by other emirates of the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and [[Oman]] for three months after UAE independence in 1971 until it joined the UAE in 1972.
* Between 1991 and 2003, [[Russia]] had three tiny pene-exclaves on tips of the lakeshore that bordered the [[Lithuania]]n side of [[Lake Vištytis]]. Before a new border treaty went into force on 12 August 2003, the border ran along most of the waterline of the beaches on the Lithuanian side, so anyone paddling in the water was technically crossing into Russia.
* [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], a [[France|French]] territorial collectivity, was completely surrounded by the territorial waters of [[Canada]] from 1763 until 1992, when an [[EEZ]] corridor 10.5 NM (19.4&amp;nbsp;km) wide was created, stretching 200 NM (370&amp;nbsp;km) south to open sea.
* [[Schirgiswalde]] – In accordance with terms of the 1635 [[Peace Treaty of Prague]], [[Austria]] transferred land (Ober- and Niederlausitz) to [[Saxony]]. However, because of religious affiliation with Austria, Schirgiswalde and five other towns (Güntersdorf, Gerlachsheim, Winkel, Taubentränke and Neuleutersdorf) within the transferred land remained with Austria, becoming Austrian enclaves within Saxony. 174 years later, to address problems as states began to consolidate, the 1809 [[Peace Treaty of Vienna]] mandated the transfer of these six enclaves from Austria to Saxony. However, the transfer did not occur until 1845 because of the need to correct mistakes in the names of the villages stated in the treaty and subsequent neglect.  During that time, Schirgiswalde was ''de facto'' independent until economic reasons compelled the final transfer of the enclaves, thus extinguishing them.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt;
* [[Sikkim]] – Dopta and Chumbi were exclaves of [[Sikkim]] within [[Tibet]] until China occupied them in 1958.
* [[Sweden]] – The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 granted certain possessions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to the [[Swedish Empire]] (extant 1611–1721) to be held as [[Dominions of Sweden|fief]]s of the Holy Roman Empire:
:* [[Bremen-Verden]] – [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|states]] of the Holy Roman Empire bordering the North Sea; in "personal union with Sweden" until 1712, when they fell under Danish occupation in wartime.
:* [[Swedish Pomerania]] – a state on the Baltic coast in present-day Germany and Poland; a small part was ceded to Prussia following war in 1720 and the entirety in 1815 during the [[Congress of Vienna]].
:* town of [[Wismar]] – town in northern Germany on the Baltic Sea; transferred to Germany in 1903 when Sweden renounced its claim.
[[File:Bantustans in South Africa.svg|thumb|225px|right|Map of the heavily partitioned black homelands in South Africa at the end of apartheid in 1994]]
* [[Syria]] was a pene-exclave of the [[United Arab Republic]] from 1958 to 1961 (if one considers [[Egypt]] as the UAR main land), bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan.
* [[Transkei]] was a [[bantustan]] or "black homeland" that was granted nominal independence by [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] from 1976 until being re-absorbed in April 1994, but it remained unrecognized internationally. It had two exclaves within South Africa that were true enclaves.
* [[Taebong]] and [[Goryeo]] – The southwest coast of [[South Jeolla Province]] in Korea was an exclave of [[Taebong]] or [[Goryeo]], between 903 and 936.
* [[Turkey]] – 
:* The tomb of [[Tomb of Suleyman Shah|Suleyman Shah]] (''b''. ca. 1178–''d''. 1236) was located in or near [[Qal'at Ja'bar]] in modern-day [[Syria]]; in accordance with the 1921 [[Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Ankara]], the tomb "shall remain, with its appurtenances, the property of Turkey, who may appoint guardians for it and may hoist the Turkish flag there." The treaty is silent regarding sovereignty of the 6.3 hectares of land on which the tomb rests. The tomb was relocated in 1973 prior to the creation of [[Lake Assad]].
:* [[Ada Kaleh]] – Prior to the creation of modern Turkey, the [[Ottoman Empire]] held a small island in the Danube River surrounded by the waters of Romania, from at least the Berlin Treaty of 1878 until 1923 when, under the Treaty of Lausanne, Romania obtained sovereignty over it. It was submerged in 1970 by the construction of a hydroelectric plant, displacing up to 1000 residents.
* [[United Kingdom]] –
:* Following the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]], three deep water '''Treaty Ports''' at [[Castletownbere|Berehaven]], Queenstown (modern [[Cobh]]) and [[Lough Swilly]] were retained by the [[United Kingdom]] in accordance with the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 6 December 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/anglo_irish/dfaexhib2.html|title=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy Series: Anglo-Irish Treaty: Text of.|website=www.nationalarchives.ie|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the settlement of the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]] in the 1930s, the ports were transferred to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (the Free State's successor) in 1938 following agreements reached between the British and Irish Governments.
:* In 1625, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] instituted the [[List of extant baronetcies#Baronetage of Nova Scotia (1625–1706)|Order of the Baronets of Nova Scotia]] in an effort to colonize New Scotland, by offering the hereditary title, land ownership and power over new baronetcies in exchange for financing and materially supporting new settlements. Under Scots Law, Baronets "[[seisin|took seisin]]" by receiving symbolic "earth and stone" on the actual land, which was the feudal legal form of taking possession.  However, to avoid a trans-Atlantic trip (and thus encourage applicants), the royal charter stated that "the realm of Nova Scotia, and original infeftment thereof, is holden of the kingdom of Scotland, and forms part of the County of Edinburgh." By royal decree, land in the courtyard at [[Edinburgh Castle]] was declared to be an integral part of Nova Scotia; thus, seisin at the castle was equivalent to seisin on the lands themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earl of Stirling's Register of Royal Letters, Relative to the Affairs of Scotland and Nova Scotia from 1615 to 1635, Volume 1|page=xxi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beA7AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR26&amp;lpg=PR26&amp;dq=royal+letters+creating+a+baronet+of+Nova+Scotia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7ZUpI4qhzH&amp;sig=uvV4zrIY73Qi59NFV2O6F8TFeRo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirqa3t9sXLAhUUTmMKHW2aA_sQ6AEIKDAC#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Edinburgh%20castle%22&amp;f=false|author1=Scotland.

:* [[Panama Canal Zone]], surrounded by [[Panama]], the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]], was an American pene-exclave from 1903 to 1 October 1979, when the entity was extinguished by treaty with Panama. After that date, the former Canal Zone land remaining under U.S. sovereignty, greatly reduced in area, was a pene-exclave until 31 December 1999, when total transfer to Panama was complete.

:* On 1 October 1979, the day the [[Panama Canal Treaty]] of 1977 took effect, most of the land within the former Canal Zone transferred to Panama.  However, the treaty set aside many Canal Zone areas and facilities for transfer during the following 20 years.  The treaty specifically categorized areas and facilities by name as "Military Areas of Coordination", "Defense Sites" and "Areas Subject to Separate Bilateral Agreement".  These were to be transferred by the U.S. to Panama during certain time windows or simply by the end of the 243-month treaty period. On 1 October 1979, among the many such parcels so designated in the treaty, 35 emerged as true enclaves (surrounded entirely by land solely under Panamanian jurisdiction). In later years as other areas were turned over to Panama, nine more true enclaves emerged.

At least 13 other parcels each were enclosed partly by land under the absolute jurisdiction of Panama and partly by an "Area of Civil Coordination" (housing), which under the treaty was subject to elements of both U.S. and Panamanian public law. In addition, the 1977 treaty designated numerous areas and individual facilities as "Canal Operating Areas" for joint U.S.-Panama ongoing operations by a commission. On the effective date of the treaty, many of these Canal Operating Areas, including [[Madden Dam]], became newly surrounded by the territory of Panama.

* The [[Val d'Aran]] is a valley in the [[Pyrenees]] mountains and a comarca in northwestern [[Catalonia]], northern [[Spain]]. Most of it comprises the only part of Catalonia that is on the northern side of the Pyrenees. The Val d'Aran had been without direct access to the south side of the mountains, until the Vielha tunnel was opened in 1948.
* [[Venda]] was a [[bantustan]] or "black homeland" that was granted nominal independence by [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] from 1979 until being re-absorbed in April 1994, but it remained unrecognized internationally.  It was an enclave that was not an exclave, bordering only South Africa and separated narrowly from Zimbabwe by the Madimbo corridor to the north. Venda itself also had a small exclave that was a true enclave in South Africa.
* [[Walvis Bay]] was a [[South Africa]]n pene-exclave bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and [[Namibia]], before being incorporated with Namibia in 1994, four years after that country's independence.
* [[Zadar]] (Zara) was a 104&amp;nbsp;km² pene-exclave of [[Italy]], bordering the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Croatia]], from 1920 to 1944 (''de facto'' due to abandonment by the Italian civilian administration) or 1947 (''de jure'' under treaty).

===Subnational historic enclaves/exclaves===
* [[Azerbaijan]] – The former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] was an enclave in [[Azerbaijan]], but the internationally unrecognised [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] is not, as it occupies territories bordering [[Armenia]] and [[Iran]].
* [[United Kingdom]] –
:* [[Cumbernauld]] and [[Kirkintilloch]] formed an exclave at county level, as a part of the Scottish county of [[Dunbartonshire]] sandwiched between [[Stirlingshire]] and [[Lanarkshire]].  The exclave was dissolved after the municipal reforms of 1975.
:* [[Ardnamurchan]], [[Morvern]] and the surrounding area also formed an exclave at county level, as a part of the Scottish county of [[Argyll]]shire bordered by [[Inverness-shire]], separated from the rest of Argyllshire by [[Loch Linnhe]].  The exclave was dissolved in 1975 following the municipal reforms of that year.
:* [[Dudley]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England, was an exclave at municipal level, being in a part of the county of [[Worcestershire]] surrounded by [[Staffordshire]].  Upon the local government reforms of 1974, the exclave was dissolved.
:* [[Furness]] in England was an exclave of the county of [[Lancashire]], known as "Lancashire-beyond-the-Sands" until 1974, when it became part of [[Cumbria]].
:* The district of [[Wrexham Maelor]] existed from 1974 to 1996, being formed from parts of two administrative counties, including [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]. From Flintshire came the exclave of [[Maelor Rural District]] (bounded on three sides by England and on the west by the Welsh county of [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]]) and the enclave of the parish of [[Marford#History|Marford and Hoseley]], surrounded and separated from Flintshire also by Denbighshire.  They are now part of [[Wrexham (county borough)|Wrexham]].
:* [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] [[Hundreds of Cheshire]] map in 1086 displays an enclave of Hamestan surrounded entirely by Middlewich. 
:* The [[Shires of Scotland#Counties until 1890|counties of Scotland]] before reorganisation in 1889 included dozens of exclaves. This was especially notable in the case of [[Cromartyshire]], which was split into at least nine parts spread across [[Ross-shire]].
:* Before 1974, and especially before 1844, there were many [[List of county exclaves in England and Wales 1844–1974|exclaves of counties in England and Wales]].
* In [[Canada]], [[East York]] became an exclave of [[York, Toronto|York]] in 1922, when the township of [[North York]] was established, causing East York to be sandwiched between North York, [[Leaside]], and [[Old Toronto]]. East York became its own township in 1924, ending its status as an exclave. All of these municipalities are part of [[Toronto]] since the [[Amalgamation of Toronto|1998 amalgamation]].
* In [[Central Finland]], the former municipality of [[Säynätsalo]] was an exclave of [[Jyväskylä]] municipality from 1993 to 2009.
* [[Germany]] –
:* The former municipality of {{ill|Hinterhermsdorf|de}} in [[Saxony]] was an exclave of the town of [[Sebnitz]], being separated from it by the municipality of [[Kirnitzschtal]], until Kirnitzschtal also became a part of Sebnitz.
:* [[Königsberg, Bavaria|Königsberg]], located in the [[Lower Franconia]] region of present-day [[Bavaria]], Germany,  was an enclave within Bavaria, along with two small nearby enclaves, belonging to the [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine Duchy]] of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (which after 1825 also had five exclaves in Thuringia). In 1918 the post-monarchy duchy was split into two states, making Königsberg an exclave of the Free State of Saxe-Coburg.  In 1920, the residents of that state voted to merge with the Free State of Bavaria, thus eliminating the three Bavarian enclaves. 
:* [[Schmalkalden-Meiningen|Schmalkalden]]/[[Suhl]] – Just after World War I, this [[Prussia]]n enclave within [[Thuringia]] was divided between the two Prussian provinces of [[Saxony]] and [[Hesse-Nassau]] (thus it was a composite enclave). The two entities of Schmalkalden and Suhl separately were exclaves of their respective Prussian provinces.&lt;ref name="Krogh"/&gt;
:* Innumerable medieval enclaves 
* In [[India]], until 1952, France maintained [[Chandannagar]], which reported to the Governor of [[Puducherry|Pondichéry]], and which was an enclave in Bengal, just upriver from [[Calcutta]].
* In [[Ireland]], until 1842, [[Durrow, County Laois|Durrow]] was an exclave of [[County Kilkenny]] surrounded by [[Queen's County, Ireland|Queen's County]].
* [[Korea]] –
:* [[Siheung|Siheung County]], South Korea, was an enclave within [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi Province]].  In 1986, the incorporated cities of [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]], [[Gwacheon]], and [[Ansan]] were formed from [[Hwaseong, Gyeonggi|Hwaseong County]].  In 1989, the old county of Siheung was divided into the cities of [[Gunpo]], [[Uiwang]], and [[Siheung]], thereby dissolving the enclave.
:* [[Seoul]] was an enclave of [[Gyeonggi Province]] until neighbouring [[Incheon]] was declared a special city in 1981.
* In [[Norway]], three farmsteads, Øvre Jøsås, Store Jøsås and Lille Jøsås, that belonged to Sør-Trøndelag county ([[Malvik]]) comprised two separate enclaves that were surrounded by Nord-Trøndelag county ([[Stjørdal]]).&lt;ref name="no"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/borders/no_exclaves.htm| title= Domestic enclaves/exclaves of Norway |accessdate=2013-10-19 |first = Jan S.|last=Krogh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern enclave at {{coord|63|20|52|N|10|52|37|E}} consisted of Øvre Jøsås and Store Jøsås, while Lille Jøsås was the western enclave at {{coord|63|20|48|N|10|51|44|E}}. The closest distance between the two enclaves was only about 8 meters. Sør-Trøndelag and Nord-Trøndelag merged into a single county on 1 January 2017, thus eliminating the Jøsås enclaves.
* In [[Russia]] – 
** [[Sheremetyevo]] is the location of the primary airport for [[Moscow]].  From 1995 to 2011 it was officially an enclave of the city of Moscow, but there was ambiguity regarding its association with [[Moscow Oblast]].  In 2011, the enclave was returned to Moscow Oblast, thus extinguishing it.
** [[Vnukovo]] consisted of two enclaves of the city of Moscow to its southwest.  On 1 July 2012, "New Moscow" was created by annexing additional land to the city, including the land that surrounded Vnukovo.  The two are now exclaves of a Moscow city subdivision, and one is also an enclave. 
** [[Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug|Ust-Orda Buryat Autonomous Okrug]] was an enclave (not exclave) within [[Irkutsk Oblast]] and was merged into it on 1 January 2008.
** [[Agin-Buryat Okrug|Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug]] was an enclave (not exclave) within [[Zabaykalsky Krai]] and was merged into it on 3 January 2008.
* In [[South Africa]], the [[Eastern Cape Province]] had an exclave that was surrounded by [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]], containing the town of [[Umzimkulu]].  KwaZulu-Natal had an exclave, [[Mount Currie (South Africa)|Mount Currie]], that was surrounded by the Eastern Cape.  Both were extinguished in 2006.
* [[Switzerland]] – 
** The village of [[Samnaun]] could initially only be reached by road from [[Austria]]. Thus, in 1892 the village was excluded from the Swiss customs territory. The exemption was maintained even when a road was built to the [[Engadin]] valley in 1907-1912.
** Before 1597, the two present-day cantons of [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]] and [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] were one canton, [[Appenzell]], which was an enclave completely surrounded by the [[Canton of St. Gallen]].
* [[Turkey]] –
:* [[Yalova]] was an exclave of [[İstanbul]] until it gained provincial status in 1995.
* [[United States]] – 
:* [[Maine]] was a pene-exclave of [[Massachusetts]] between 1652 and 1820.
:* The [[Western Reserve]] in present-day Ohio was a pene-exclave of [[Connecticut]] from 13 September 1786 to 1800, when it reverted to the [[Northwest Territory]].
:* The following from pre-merger [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Kentucky, no longer exist as enclaves: [[Audubon Park, Kentucky|Audubon Park]], [[Meadowview Estates, Kentucky|Meadowview Estates]], [[Parkway Village, Kentucky|Parkway Village]], [[Seneca Gardens, Kentucky|Seneca Gardens]], [[Wellington, Kentucky|Wellington]], and the combination of [[Kingsley, Kentucky|Kingsley]], [[Strathmoor Manor, Kentucky|Strathmoor Manor]], and [[Strathmoor Village, Kentucky|Strathmoor Village]].
:* [[District of Columbia]] – [[Reagan National Airport|Washington National Airport]] was built on reclaimed land on the south side of the [[Potomac River]], at which the river's high-water line marked the District's boundary with [[Virginia]].  Therefore, until 1945, the site was a pene-exclave of the District.  Since then, the airport has been officially deemed a part of [[Arlington County, Virginia]], but it is under exclusive federal jurisdiction and is administered as if still part of the District.
:* [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]] surrounded the [[Borough of Princeton, New Jersey|Borough of Princeton]], home of [[Princeton University]], until the two municipalities merged in 2013 to form [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey.
:* [[Town Line, New York]] voted 85 to 40 to secede from the United States in 1861, with no legal effect and no well-defined borders, to become an exclave of the [[Confederate States of America]], unrecognized by either side (there are no written records); ceremonially voted to "rejoin" the Union in 1946.

=== Temporary enclaves or exclaves ===
Sometimes land is ceded temporarily to another country as a form of [[legal fiction]].

* To establish jurisdiction, [[Camp Zeist]], a former United States Air Force base in the [[Netherlands]], was, in 2000, temporarily declared [[sovereign territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]], in order to allow the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial]] to take place.
* In 1943, the maternity ward at the [[The Ottawa Hospital|Ottawa Civic Hospital]] in Canada was temporarily extraterritorial so that [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands|Princess Juliana]]'s daughter [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands|Princess Margriet]] would only have Dutch (by parents' nationality) and not dual nationality, because of her potential birth on Canadian soil. Dual nationality would have excluded her from the royal succession.
* In 1979, at [[Sender Zehlendorf]], East Germany, an area of 300 metres in radius around a radio tower construction site was made an exclave of the Soviet Union.  After a Soviet fighter plane had earlier collided with a radio transmission mast at the facility, causing it to collapse, the Soviet Union agreed to rebuild the mast. So that the stricter German safety regulations would not slow the construction progress, the area was declared a Soviet exclave for the duration of the work.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://forum.politik.de/forum/archive/index.php/t-72855.html Warum die Baustelle eines Sendemasten exterritoriales Gebiet wurde]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photo lg kuwait.jpg|thumb|left|An oil refinery in Mina-Al-Ahmadi, [[Kuwait]]]]
This '''list of [[oil field]]s''' includes some [[Giant oil and gas fields|major oil fields]] of the past and present.

The list is incomplete; there are more than 65,000 [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] fields of all sizes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Li Guoyu (2011), World Atlas of Oil and Gas Basins (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, 94% of known oil is concentrated in fewer than 1500 giant and major fields.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanhoe, L. F, and G G. Leckie, -"Global oil, gas fields, sizes tallied, analyzed," Oil and Gas Journal. Feb. 15, 1993, pp. 87-91&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the world's largest oilfields are located in the [[Middle East]], but there are also supergiant (&gt;10 billion bbls) oilfields in Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Kazakhstan, and Russia.

Amounts listed below, in billions of barrels, are the estimated ultimate recoverable petroleum resources (proved reserves plus cumulative production), given historical production and current extraction technology. [[Oil shale reserves]] (perhaps {{convert|3|Toilbbl|m3}}) and [[coal]] reserves, both of which can be converted to liquid petroleum, are not included in this chart. Other non-conventional liquid fuel sources are similarly excluded from this list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5739">This '''list of tourist attractions in Denmark''' presents the 50 most visited [[tourist attraction]]s in [[Denmark]] according to the annual survey published by [[VisitDenmark]], the Danish national tourist organisation.  Visitor numbers are from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.dk/sites/default/files/vdk_images/PDF-and-other-files/Analyser/2014/visitdenmarks_attraktionsliste_2013.pdf|title=Attraktionslisten 2013|language=Danish|publisher=Visit Denmark|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Not every attraction qualify for the survey and there are strict guidelines. Only commercial attractions aimed primarily at tourists and with a somewhat restricted access will be considered. Attractions not covered are for instance:
* Concert halls such as [[Copenhagen Concert Hall]] and [[Copenhagen Opera House]]
* Theatres such as the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Playhouse]]
* Exhibition centres such as [[Bella Centre]]
* Natural sites. This includes places like [[Møns Klint]], [[Grenen]] at [[Skagen Odde]], [[Jægersborg Dyrehave]] and the four [[List of national parks of Denmark|national parks]].
* Freely accessible attractions such as [[Freetown Christiania]] and [[The Little Mermaid]], both in Copenhagen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="647">'''Mount Taipingot''' lies at the southern end of [[Songsong]] Village on the [[Rota (island)|Rota]] in the [[Mariana Islands]]. It is connected to the main part of Rota by a [[tombolo]], on which is the southern part of Songsong village.  It is more commonly known as "Wedding Cake Mountain" because of its resemblance to a layered wedding cake. The areas in and around the mountain are conservation areas established to protect the native flora and fauna that thrive there.

'''Nassau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|æ|s|ɔː}}) is the [[Capital city|capital]] and commercial centre of the [[The Bahamas|Commonwealth of the Bahamas]]. The city has an estimated population of 274,400 as of 2016, just over 70% of the population of the country (≈391,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/wcm/connect/c17e5637-1f39-484b-8107-a7be2176c51b/NEW+PROVIDENCE+2010+CENSUS+REPORT.pdf?MOD=AJPERES |title=2010 Census of Population and Housing: New Providence |page=3 |date=August 2012 |publisher=Department of Statistics of the Bahamas |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynden Pindling International Airport]], the major airport for the Bahamas, is located about {{convert|16|km|mi}} west of Nassau city centre, and has daily flights to major cities in Canada, the [[Caribbean]], the United Kingdom and the United States. The city is located on the island of [[New Providence]], which functions much like a [[business district]]. Nassau is the site of the House of Assembly and various judicial departments and was considered historically to be a stronghold of pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klausmann |first1=Ulrike |last2=Meinzerin |first2=Marion |last3=Kuhn |first3=Gabriel |authorlink3=Gabriel_Kuhn |title=Women Pirates and the Politics of the Jolly Roger |edition=1st |year=1997 |publisher=Black Rose Books Ltd. |location=C.P. 1258 Succ. Place du Parc Montreal, Quebec, Canada H2W2R3 |isbn=1-55164-058-9 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was named in honour of [[William III of England|William III of England, Prince of Orange-Nassau]], deriving its name from [[Nassau, Germany]].

Nassau's modern growth began in the late eighteenth century, with the influx of thousands of American [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] and their slaves to the Bahamas following the [[American War of Independence]]. Many of them settled in Nassau (then and still the commerce capital of the Bahamas) and eventually came to outnumber the original inhabitants.

As the population of Nassau grew, so did its populated areas. Today the city dominates the entire island and its satellite, [[Paradise Island]]. However, until the post-Second World War era, the outer suburbs scarcely existed. Most of New Providence was uncultivated bush until Loyalists were resettled there following the American Revolutionary War; they established several plantations, such as Clifton and Tusculum. Slaves were imported as labour.

After the British abolished the international slave trade in 1807, they resettled thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships by the [[Royal Navy]] on New Providence (at Adelaide Village and Gambier Village), along with other islands such as Grand Bahama, Exuma, Abaco and Inagua. In addition, slaves freed from American ships, such as the [[Creole case]] in 1841, were allowed to settle there. The largest concentration of Africans historically lived in the "Over-the-Hill" suburbs of Grants Town and Bain Town to the south of the city of Nassau, while most of the inhabitants of European descent lived on the island's northern coastal ridges.

==History==
{{See also|Piracy in the Caribbean}}
Nassau was formerly known as Charles Town; founded in 1670 by British Noblemen who brought British settlers with them to New Providence where they built a fort that was named Charles Town in honour of England’s King Charles II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebahamasguide.com/islands/new-providence/history-of-new-providence/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610051823/http://thebahamasguide.com/islands/new-providence/history-of-new-providence/ |archivedate=2017-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Raid on Charles Town]] the town was burned to the ground by the [[Spain|Spanish]] in 1684 during one of their frequent wars with the English. It was rebuilt and renamed to Nassau in 1695 under Governor Nicholas Trott in honour of the Dutch [[Stadtholder]] (''stadhouder'' in Dutch) and later also King of England, Scotland and Ireland, [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] who belonged to a branch of the [[House of Nassau]], from which the city takes its name. The name Nassau ultimately derives from the town of [[Nassau, Rhineland-Palatinate|Nassau]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marley, David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q1a4j2HNmjUC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Nassau+1695#v=onepage&amp;q=Nassau%201695&amp;f=false|title=Historic Cities of the Americas: An Illustrated Encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|page=6|isbn=1-57607-027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a lack of effective governors (after Trott), Nassau fell on hard times. In 1703 Spanish and French allied forces [[Raid on Nassau|briefly occupied]] Nassau.  From 1703 to 1718 there was no governor in the colony and by 1713, the sparsely settled Bahamas had become a [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirate]] haven. The Governor of Bermuda stated that there were over 1,000 pirates in Nassau and that they outnumbered the mere hundred inhabitants of the town. They proclaimed Nassau a [[Pirates' republic|pirate republic]], establishing themselves as "governors". Examples of pirates that used Nassau as their base are [[Charles Vane]], [[Thomas Barrow (pirate)|Thomas Barrow]] (who declared himself "Governor of New Providence")&lt;ref name="CSP-VOL29"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Headlam|first1=Cecil|title=America and West Indies: July 1716 {{!}} British History Online|date=1930|publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office|location=London|pages=139-159|edition=Vol 29|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/colonial/america-west-indies/vol29/pp139-159|accessdate=15 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Benjamin Hornigold]], [[Calico Jack Rackham]], [[Anne Bonny]], [[Mary Read]], and the infamous Edward Teach, better known as "[[Blackbeard]]".

In 1718, the British sought to regain control of the islands and appointed Captain [[Woodes Rogers]] as Royal governor. He successfully clamped down on the pirates, reformed the civil administration, and restored commerce. Rogers cleaned up Nassau and rebuilt the fort, using his own wealth to try to overcome problems. In 1720 the Spanish made an [[Battle of Nassau (1720)|unsuccessful attempt to capture Nassau]].

During the wars in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], Nassau experienced an economic boom. With funds from privateering, a new fort, street lights and over 2300 sumptuous houses were built and Nassau was extended. In addition to this, mosquito breeding swamps were filled.

In 1776, the [[Battle of Nassau]] resulted in a brief occupation by American [[Continental Marines]] during the [[American War of Independence]], where the Marines staged their first amphibious raid on Fort Montague after attempting to sneak up on Fort Nassau. In 1778 after an overnight invasion, American raiders led by Captain Rathburn, left with ships, gunpowder and military stores after stopping in Nassau for only two weeks. In 1782 [[Capture of the Bahamas (1782)|Spain captured Nassau]] for the last time when Don Juan de Cagigal, governor-general of Cuba, attacked New Providence with 5000 men. [[Andrew Deveaux]], an American Loyalist who resettled on the island, set forth [[Capture of the Bahamas (1783)|to recapture Nassau]]  for the British Crown and with 220 men and 150 muskets to face a force of 600 trained soldiers.

[[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]] governed the colony from 1787 to 1796. He oversaw the construction of [[Fort Charlotte (Nassau)|Fort Charlotte]] and Fort Fincastle in Nassau.

During the [[American Civil War]], Nassau served as a port for [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] making their way to and from ports along the southern Atlantic Coast for continued trade with the Confederacy.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Nassau profited from [[Prohibition in the United States]].

==Geography==
[[File:Prince George Wharf in Nassau Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|Prince George Wharf in Nassau Harbour]]
[[File:Nassau, The Bahamas.jpg|thumb|Satellite view of Nassau and Paradise Island]]
Located on [[New Providence Island]], Nassau has an attractive harbour,{{or-inline|date=October 2018}} a blend of old world and colonial architecture, and a busy port. The tropical [[climate]] and natural environment of the Bahamas have made Nassau a [[tourism|tourist]] destination.

Nassau developed directly behind the port area. New Providence provides 200&amp;nbsp;km² of relatively flat and low-lying land intersected by low ridges (none of which restricted settlement). In the centre of the island there are several shallow lakes that are tidally connected.

The city's proximity to the United States (290&amp;nbsp;km east-southeast of [[Miami, Florida]]) has contributed to its popularity as a holiday resort, especially after the United States imposed a ban on travel to [[Cuba]] in 1963. The [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Atlantis]] resort on nearby [[Paradise Island]] accounts for more tourist arrivals to the city than any other hotel property of Nassau. The [[mega-resort]] employs over 6,000 Bahamians, and is the largest employer outside government.

===Climate===
Nassau has a [[tropical savanna climate]], with hot and wet summers, and a warm and drier winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=37087&amp;cityname=Nassau,+New+Providence,+The+Bahamas&amp;units=|title=Nassau, The Bahamas Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year. During the wet season from June through September, average daytime high temperatures are between 30 - 32 C (88-90 F), while during the drier season from November through March daytime temperatures are between {{convert|25|and|27|C|F}}, rarely falling below {{convert|15|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

===Urban development===
[[File:IMRAY(1884) p0210 BAHAMAS, NASSAU.jpg|thumbnail|Nassau in the 1880s]]
During the 19th century, Nassau became urbanized, attracting rural residents. Growth since the 1950s has been outwards from the town. The 1788 heart of Nassau was just a few blocks of buildings between Government House and the harbour, but the town gradually expanded east to Malcolm's Park, south to Wulff Road, and west to Nassau Street. Grants Town and Bain Town south of the city became the main residential areas for those of African descent, and until about 30 years ago was the most populous part of the city.

Those of European descent built houses along the shore, east as far as Fort Montagu, west as far as Saunders Beach, and along the ridge edging the city. During the 20th century, the city spread east to Village Road and west to Fort Charlotte and Oakes Field. This semicircle of residential development was the main area of settlement until after the Second World War, and marks a distinct phase in the city's expansion, the outer boundary to this zone being the effective limit of the continuous built-up area. The wealthier residents continued to spread east (to East End Point) and West (to [[Lyford Cay]]).

In the last 40 years, residential development has been quite different. It has consisted mainly of planned middle-income sub-divisions. Since the 1960s, government has sponsored low-cost housing developments at Yellow Elder, Elizabeth Estates, and Pinewood Gardens, in the outer ring.

====City centre====
[[File:BahamianParliamentPanorama.jpg|thumb|A view of the Bahamian Parliament]]
The city centre is the hub for all activities in Nassau. Thousands of people visit daily, to shop, dine, sightsee and to enjoy the tropical climate of the city. While the busiest part of central city is the Bay Street thoroughfare and the Woodes Rogers Walk, located across the street from the port and parallel to Bay, the area extends for several blocks in each direction. It starts at West Bay, around the Junkanoo Beach area. A few hotels and restaurants are located on West Bay.

The next landmark is the British Colonial Hotel, which marks the beginning of Bay Street proper. Pirates of Nassau Museum is just across from the [[British Colonial Hilton Nassau|British Colonial Hilton]]. The next few blocks of Bay Street are wall-to-wall boutiques, with a few restaurants and clubs interspersed throughout the retailers.
[[File:Queen's staircase, Nassau, Bahamas.jpg|thumb|[[Queen’s Staircase - Nassau|Queen's staircase]]]]
Historical landmarks are also in the vicinity, including Vendue House, Christ Church Cathedral, and the [[Nassau Public Library]]. Although the tourist part of the city centre peters out after about seven blocks, smaller, more local shops are located down Bay Street. At this point, Bay Street becomes East Bay.

The Straw Market is a tourist destination in the city centre. A new market was opened in 2011 after a fire in 2001 destroyed the original Fish, Vegetable and Straw Market. The market is open on all sides, and contains a number of Bahamian craft stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ingraham|first1=Hubert|title=Remarks: A Celebration of Bahamian Imagination &amp; Ingenuity|url=http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/portal/public/gov/government/news/Nassau%20Straw%20Market%20Opening%20Remarks%20by%20Hubert%20Ingraham/!ut/p/b1/vZTJkqM4FEW_JT_AiRgkYCnbzJPNYAMbAkgmY2zZGAP--iKrozuyO7qrNl0lrRQ6uve9q4hHxVRIxZf02VTpo7le0vPnOUYJCxQLY06wBBlhoAWszEIDs8qepo5UqEbMtL1qoywdEugxFlkH-dzW1gkv8L49CkxTkv3tIOrBPqEhGMoy7-mX2wQ871gf64fW9d2wE4Vd6pbS3DIvwjG3KndRTeKskqJrjLVZ9rXu0U7VYbAKbMhRFLrHuhN6mA22ATZRtsKoOJNpW_MKi7FXTGEOr7OLeZSIpjPv0tBpVb5GUdsQMJyLiBzrVRsMH503PrdKO92OJVzvaaWVuLel8WhpHPzHwuBnufzx_i9AgQAtwM7EO15lHA78PNf478i_KHwHflTiDxUM5k9AcThLWgAHCjLQaB-aOyTSwhpQ0QLwXxT8A1gAgF2P3gOB5ymfCgGXeKeZaK_25Z5eHuNJ0LSlyaQlhu6l19HOZM22ddvHkjtVme42Z2UiEbnlFzREyGgqLECGZ_5p5jC-uJhtaGQEEHgK-yvNFOgISza8v8OQWcJDv9MM_gozxbH2m88Y_fVnjKyqYmSyjkT_TrP_9890Km6y7n3Mu3fwDjkaQpFmRLRc8TRPHS4R4rNKm6RlDsXuLRxT3tc8L_AcpSby-Xp9SnPksQLox76-r3ZyyGGSEZXwJ5bppUJ_hCgl03TPDrKwzINz5-dmHvTTORj0le3cjBPr9amte4_zI8-TwWg_Tvazpx-re_3KB9FxrUscTSNJ01GH-lqvmmvpGWZ0r7ZyYjDKZltuFDlMg1yo25URBjXnJKN9eTR1-SHEZByZoijsp-7pK2MVjP19Iuh1YpR-1k-S2jxv4tqcfV7d7rhEQkI5y6DT-GPwRtnqtSso0j0NE7lSaX_d3Ns3yeS8Vw!!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403151337/http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/portal/public/gov/government/news/Nassau%20Straw%20Market%20Opening%20Remarks%20by%20Hubert%20Ingraham/!ut/p/b1/vZTJkqM4FEW_JT_AiRgkYCnbzJPNYAMbAkgmY2zZGAP--iKrozuyO7qrNl0lrRQ6uve9q4hHxVRIxZf02VTpo7le0vPnOUYJCxQLY06wBBlhoAWszEIDs8qepo5UqEbMtL1qoywdEugxFlkH-dzW1gkv8L49CkxTkv3tIOrBPqEhGMoy7-mX2wQ871gf64fW9d2wE4Vd6pbS3DIvwjG3KndRTeKskqJrjLVZ9rXu0U7VYbAKbMhRFLrHuhN6mA22ATZRtsKoOJNpW_MKi7FXTGEOr7OLeZSIpjPv0tBpVb5GUdsQMJyLiBzrVRsMH503PrdKO92OJVzvaaWVuLel8WhpHPzHwuBnufzx_i9AgQAtwM7EO15lHA78PNf478i_KHwHflTiDxUM5k9AcThLWgAHCjLQaB-aOyTSwhpQ0QLwXxT8A1gAgF2P3gOB5ymfCgGXeKeZaK_25Z5eHuNJ0LSlyaQlhu6l19HOZM22ddvHkjtVme42Z2UiEbnlFzREyGgqLECGZ_5p5jC-uJhtaGQEEHgK-yvNFOgISza8v8OQWcJDv9MM_gozxbH2m88Y_fVnjKyqYmSyjkT_TrP_9890Km6y7n3Mu3fwDjkaQpFmRLRc8TRPHS4R4rNKm6RlDsXuLRxT3tc8L_AcpSby-Xp9SnPksQLox76-r3ZyyGGSEZXwJ5bppUJ_hCgl03TPDrKwzINz5-dmHvTTORj0le3cjBPr9amte4_zI8-TwWg_Tvazpx-re_3KB9FxrUscTSNJ01GH-lqvmmvpGWZ0r7ZyYjDKZltuFDlMg1yo25URBjXnJKN9eTR1-SHEZByZoijsp-7pK2MVjP19Iuh1YpR-1k-S2jxv4tqcfV7d7rhEQkI5y6DT-GPwRtnqtSso0j0NE7lSaX_d3Ns3yeS8Vw!!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 April 2018|website=The Government of The Bahamas|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cable Beach====
Cable Beach is recognised as the hotel district of Nassau. Five hotels—two of which are all-inclusive—are located on this strip. The area is also known for its dining, the Crystal Palace Casino, and the golden sands of Cable Beach. Most of the area's restaurants are located either in the hotels or across the street. There is little to no nightlife. There is a bit of shopping, most of it located in the Wyndham. The commercial future of Cable Beach is being re-imagined with the development of Baha Mar, a resort and casino project that will bring more than 2,000 hotel rooms and the largest gaming and convention facility in the Caribbean to this section of New Providence Island. As of April 2017, it is officially open, but not yet complete.

Nassau had a [[Demographics of the Bahamas|population]] of 128,420 females and 117,909 males and was home to 70,222 [[households]] with an average family size of 3.5 according to the 2010 [[census]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/wcm/connect/c17e5637-1f39-484b-8107-a7be2176c51b/NEW+PROVIDENCE+2010+CENSUS+REPORT.pdf?MOD=AJPERES |title=2010 Census of Population and Housing: New Providence |page=v |date=August 2012 |publisher=Department of Statistics of the Bahamas |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nassau's large population in relation to the remainder of [[the Bahamas]] is the result of waves of [[immigration]] from the [[Out Islands|Family Islands]] to the [[Capital city|capital]].

===Water===
Ferries (boats) provide water travel around Nassau to the surrounding islands, namely [[Paradise Island]]. [[Prince George Wharf]] is the main port in the city that serves cruise ships with ports of call in Nassau. Transportation and shipping around the Family Islands is primarily through mailboats based at Potters Cay. International shipping is done through the Arawak Port Department on Arawak Cay. High speed excursions to Exuma, Spanish Wells and Harbour Island are available daily.

===Junkanoo===
[[File:JunkanooDancerPixelizedFace2006.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Junkanoo participant in costume during the 2006 Parade]]

The city's chief festival is [[Junkanoo]], an energetic, colourful street parade of brightly costumed people dancing to the rhythmic accompaniment of cowbells, drums and whistles. The word 'Junkanoo' is named after the founder 'John Kanoo'. The celebration occurs on December 26, July 10 and January 1, beginning in the early hours of the morning (1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.) and ending around 10 a.m.  At the end of the Junkanoo procession, judges award cash prizes for the best music, costumes, and overall group presentation.  These Bahamians spend all year preparing their handmade costumes by using colored crepe paper and cardboard. 

==In popular culture==
Nassau was the main location (however, the filming locations were based around South Africa) for the [[Starz|Starz Network]] show [[Black Sails (TV series)|''Black Sails'']] (2014-2017).

De Fer was the youngest of three sons of Antoine de Fer, who was also a cartographer.&lt;ref name="kanas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanas|first=Nick|title=Star Maps: History, Artistry, and Cartography|year=2012|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|isbn=978-1-4614-0916-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bae3LP4tfP4C&amp;pg=PA214|pages=214–215|edition=2nd|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-0917-5|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 12, he became the [[apprentice]] of Parisian engraver Louis Spirinx, and made his first map, of the [[Canal du Midi]], at the age of 23.&lt;ref name="missouri1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolas de Fer|url=http://library.missouri.edu/exhibits/russian/defer.htm|work=Mapping the past: Rare Russian maps from special collections|publisher=[[University of Missouri]]|date=June 30, 2011|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his father in June 1673, his mother Geneviève initially took over the map making company, which had begun to decline.&lt;ref name="barron"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barron|first=Roderick M.|title=Fer, Nicolas de [1646-1720&amp;#93;|url=http://www.barron.co.uk/Portrait+Reference+Library/Surnames+F+to+J/Fer+Nicolas+de+1646-1720|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She passed it and the [[atelier]], called Quai de L'Horloge, on to Nicolas in 1687 because of her old age.&lt;ref name="barron"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Fer - La Sphere Royale.png|thumb|upright|left|''La Sphère Royale'']]
De Fer was so successful at improving the firm that, in 1690, he became the official geographer to [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Louis]], [[Dauphin of France]].&lt;ref name="artfact"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolas de Fer|url=http://www.artfact.com/subcollection/nicolas-de-fer-ytgl3mtym7|publisher=Artfact|accessdate=5 January 2013}}{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With support from the Spanish and French royal families, de Fer also became official geographer for [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] and [[Louis XIV]], the kings of Spain and France, respectively.&lt;ref name="kanas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barron"/&gt; Because of this, his maps became [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[propaganda]], endorsing French King [[Louis XIV]].&lt;ref name="barron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artfact"/&gt;

In 1698, de Fer published a map of North America, which included a depiction of [[beaver]]s building [[beaver dam|dams]] near [[Niagara Falls]]. Seventeen years later, [[Herman Moll]] published a map which plagiarized elements of de Fer's work, particularly the beaver scene. It became known as the "Beaver map".&lt;ref name="lac"&gt;{{cite web|title=Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="missouri2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Herman Moll|url=http://library.missouri.edu/exhibits/russian/moll.htm|work=Mapping the past: Rare Russian maps from special collections|publisher=[[University of Missouri]]|date=June 30, 2011|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Fer became the official geographer for [[Pope|His Catholic Majesty]] in 1720.&lt;ref name="artfact"/&gt; Two of his sons-in-law, Guillaume Danet and Jaques-François Bénard, continued the company after de Fer's death on 25 October of that year until around 1760.&lt;ref name="geographicus"/&gt;

'''Ordnance Survey''' ('''OS''') is a [[national mapping agency]] in the United Kingdom which covers the island of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ordnance-survey |title=Ordnance Survey |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 April 2015 it has operated as Ordnance Survey Ltd, a [[state-owned enterprise|government-owned company]], 100% in public ownership. The Ordnance Survey Board remains accountable to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. It is also a member of the [[Public Data Group]].

The agency's name indicates its original military purpose (see [[Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] and [[surveying]]), which was to map [[Scotland]] in the wake of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. There was also a more general and nationwide need in light of the potential threat of invasion during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Ordnance Survey mapping is usually classified as either "large-scale" (in other words, more detailed) or "small-scale". The Survey's large-scale mapping comprises 1:2,500 maps for urban areas and 1:10,000 more generally. (The latter superseded the 1:10,560 "six [[inch]]es to the [[mile]]" scale in the 1950s.) These large scale maps are typically used in professional [[Land use|land-use]] contexts and were available as sheets until the 1980s, when they were [[Digitizing|digitised]]. Small-scale mapping for leisure use includes the 1:25,000 "Explorer" series, the 1:50,000 "Landranger" series and the 1:250,000 road maps. These are still available in traditional sheet form.

Ordnance Survey maps remain in [[copyright]] for fifty years after their &lt;!-- [first?] --&gt; publication. Some of the [[Copyright library|Copyright Libraries]] hold complete or near-complete collections of pre-digital OS mapping.

==Origins==
The origins of the Ordnance Survey lie in the aftermath of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] which was finally defeated by forces loyal to the government at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]] realised that the British Army did not have a good map of the [[Scottish Highlands]] to locate [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] dissenters such as [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]] so that they could be put on trial.{{sfn|Hewitt|2010|p=xix}} In 1747, Lieutenant-Colonel David Watson proposed the compilation of a map of the Highlands to help to subjugate the clans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Porter |first=Whitworth |authorlink=Whitworth Porter |year=1889 |title=History of the Corps of Royal Engineers |volume=I |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co |publication-place=London |pages=167–68 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=lqlBAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=14 August 2008 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] charged Watson with making a military survey of the Highlands under the command of the Duke of Cumberland. Among Watson's assistants were [[William Roy]], [[Paul Sandby]] and John Manson. The survey was produced at a scale of 1&amp;nbsp;inch to 1000 yards (1:36,000){{sfn|Hindle|1998|pp=114-115}} and included "the Duke of Cumberland's Map" (primarily by Watson and Roy), now held in the [[British Library]].

Roy later had an illustrious career in the [[Royal Engineers]] (RE), rising to the rank of General, and he was largely responsible for the British share of the work in determining the relative positions of the French and British royal observatories. This work was the starting point of the [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain]] (1783–1853), and led to the creation of the Ordnance Survey itself. Roy's technical skills and leadership set the high standard for which Ordnance Survey became known. Work was begun in earnest in 1790 under Roy's supervision, when the [[Board of Ordnance]] (a predecessor of part of the modern [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) began a national military survey starting with the south coast of England. Roy's birthplace near [[Carluke]] in [[South Lanarkshire]] is today marked by a memorial in the form of a large OS trig point.&lt;ref&gt;OSGR NS 826497&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1791 the Board received the newer [[Ramsden theodolite]] (an improved successor to the one that Roy had used in 1784), and work began on mapping southern Great Britain using a five-mile baseline on [[Hounslow Heath]] that Roy himself had previously measured; it crosses the present [[Heathrow Airport]]. In 1991 [[Royal Mail]] marked the bicentenary by issuing a set of postage stamps featuring maps of the Kentish village of [[Hamstreet]].

In 1801 the first one-inch-to-the-mile (1:63,360 scale) map was published, detailing the county of [[Kent]], with [[Essex]] following shortly afterwards. The Kent map was published privately and stopped at the county border, while the Essex maps were published by Ordnance Survey and ignore the county border, setting the trend for future Ordnance Survey maps.{{sfn|Hindle|1998|p=117}}

In the next 20 years about a third of England and Wales was mapped at the same scale (see [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain]]) under the direction of [[William Mudge]], as other military matters took precedence. It took until 1823 to re-establish a relationship with the French survey made by Roy in 1787. By 1810 one inch to the mile maps of most of the south of England were completed, but they were withdrawn from sale between 1811 and 1816 because of security fears.&lt;ref&gt;

It was hard work: Major [[Thomas Frederick Colby|Thomas Colby]], the longest-serving Director General of Ordnance Survey, walked {{convert|586|mi}} in 22 days on a reconnaissance in 1819. In 1824, Colby and most of his staff moved to Ireland to work on a six-inches-to-the-mile (1:10,560) valuation survey. The survey of Ireland, county by county, was completed in 1846.{{sfn|Hindle|1998|p=114}} The suspicions and tensions it caused in rural Ireland are the subject of [[Brian Friel]]'s play ''[[Translations]]''.

Colby was not only involved in the design of specialist measuring equipment. He also established a systematic collection of place names, and reorganised the map-making process to produce clear, accurate plans. Place names were recorded in "Name Books",&lt;ref name=owenpilbeam&gt;{{cite book |last1=Owen |first1=Tim |last2=Pilbeam |first2=Elaine |year=1992 |title=Ordnance Survey – Map Makers to Britain Since 1791 |place=Southampton |publisher=Ordnance Survey |isbn=0-31-900249-7 |page=}}{{page needed |date=November 2017}} Freely available online at the [http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/ebooks/map-makers-to-britain-since-1791/index.html Ordnance Survew, Owen and Pilbeam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.nls.uk/os/6inch/os_info3.html Ordnance Survey Maps Six-inch, 1st edition, Scotland, 1843-1882 - National Library of Scotland]. maps.nls.uk. Retrieved on 12 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; a system first used in Ireland. The instructions for their use were:

{{quote|The persons employed on the survey are to endeavour to obtain the correct orthography of the names of places by diligently consulting the best authorities within their reach. The name of each place is to be inserted as it is commonly spelt, in the first column of the name book and the various modes of spelling it used in books, writings &amp;c. are to be inserted in the second column, with the authority placed in the third column opposite to each.}}

Whilst these procedures generally produced excellent results, mistakes were made: for instance, the Pilgrims Way in the [[North Downs]] labelled the wrong route, but the name stuck. Similarly, the spelling of [[Scafell]] and [[Scafell Pike]] copied an error on an earlier map,&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile reprint, ''Thomas Donald Historic Map of Cumberland 1774'', {{ISBN|9781873124369}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was retained as this was the name of a corner of one of the Principal Triangles, despite "Scawfell" being the almost universal form at the time.

Colby believed in leading from the front, travelling with his men, helping to build camps and, as each survey session drew to a close, arranging mountain-top parties with enormous [[plum pudding]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/overview/history.html Our history | About].

The [[British Geological Survey]] was founded in 1835 as the Ordnance Geological Survey under [[Henry De la Beche]], and remained a branch of the Ordnance Survey until 1965. At the same time the uneven quality of the English and Scottish maps was being improved by engravers under [[Benjamin Baker (engraver)|Benjamin Baker]]. By the time Colby retired in 1846, the production of six-inch maps of Ireland was complete. This had led to a demand for similar treatment in England, and work was proceeding on extending the six-inch map to northern England, but only a three-inch scale for most of Scotland.

When Colby retired he recommended [[William Yolland]] as his successor, but he was considered too young and the less experienced Lewis Alexander Hall was appointed.&lt;ref name=owenpilbeam/&gt; After a fire in the [[Tower of London]], the headquarters of the survey was moved to [[Ordnance Survey buildings, Southampton|Southampton]], and Yolland was put in charge, but Hall sent him off to Ireland so that when Hall left in 1854 Yolland was again passed over in favour of Major [[Henry James (British Army officer)|Henry James]]. Hall was enthusiastic about extending the survey of the north of England to a scale of 1:2,500. In 1855, the Board of Ordnance was abolished and the Ordnance Survey was placed under the [[War Office]] together with the Topographical Survey and the Depot of Military Knowledge. Eventually in 1870 it was transferred to the [[Office of Works]].

The primary triangulation of the United Kingdom of Roy, Mudge and Yolland was completed by 1841, but was greatly improved by [[Alexander Ross Clarke]] who completed a new survey based on [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]]'s spheroid in 1858, completing the [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain|Principal Triangulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Seymour |1980 |p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he completed an initial [[levelling]] of the country.

After the Ordnance Survey published its [[Ordnance Survey Ireland#History|first large-scale maps of Ireland]] in the mid-1830s, the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1836]] led to calls for a similar six-inch to the mile survey in England and [[Wales]]. Official procrastination followed, but the development of the railways added to pressure that resulted in the [[Ordnance Survey Act 1841]]. This granted a right to enter property for the purpose of the survey. Following a fire at its headquarters at the [[Tower of London]] in 1841&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_history/key_dates.asp |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080618055617/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_history/key_dates.asp |archivedate=18 June 2008 |title=Key dates |publisher=London Fire Brigade}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ordnance Survey relocated to a site in [[Southampton]] and was in disarray for several years, with arguments about which scales to use. Major-General Sir [[Henry James (Ordnance Survey)|Henry James]] was by then Director General, and he saw how photography could be used to make maps of various scales cheaply and easily. He developed and exploited [[photozincography]], not only to reduce the costs of map production but also to publish [[facsimile]]s of nationally important manuscripts. Between 1861 and 1864, a facsimile of the [[Domesday Book]] was issued, [[Ancient counties of England|county]] by county; and a facsimile of the [[Gough Map]] was issued in 1870.

From the 1840s, the Ordnance Survey concentrated on the Great Britain "[[Ordnance Survey Great Britain County Series|County Series]]", modelled on the earlier Ireland survey. A start was made on mapping the whole country, county by county, at six inches to the mile (1:10,560). In 1854, "twenty-five inch" maps were introduced with a scale of 1:2500 (25.344&amp;nbsp;inches to the mile) and the six inch maps were then based on these twenty-five inch maps. The first edition of the two scales was completed by the 1890s, with a second edition completed in the 1890s and 1900s. From 1907 till the early 1940s, a third edition (or "second revision") was begun but never completed: only areas with significant changes on the ground were revised, many two or three times.&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;{{harvnb|Oliver|2005|p=}}{{page needed |date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Richard |last2=Hellyer |first2=Roger |year=2002 |title=Ordnance Survey of Great Britain: Indexes to the 1:2500 and six-inch scales |place=Newtown, Montgomeryshire |publisher=David Archer |isbn= |page=}}{{page needed |date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, publication of the one-inch to the mile series for Great Britain was completed in 1891.

From the late 19th century to the early 1940s, the OS produced many "restricted" versions of the County Series maps and other War Department sheets for [[War Office]] purposes, in a variety of large scales that included details of military significance such as dockyards, naval installations, fortifications and military camps. Apart from a brief period during the disarmament talks of the 1930s, these areas were left blank or incomplete on standard maps. The War Department 1:2500s, unlike the standard issue, were [[Contour line|contoured]]. The de-classified sheets have now been deposited in some of the Copyright Libraries, helping to complete the map-picture of pre-Second World War Britain.

==City and town mapping, 19th and early 20th century ==
From 1824, the OS began a 6 inch (1:10,560) survey of Ireland for taxation purposes but found this to be inadequate for urban areas and adopted the five-foot scale (1:1056) for Irish cities and towns.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=201}} From 1840, the six-inch standard was adopted in Great Britain for the un-surveyed northern counties and the 1:1056 scale also began to be adopted for urban surveys.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=201}} Between 1842 and 1895, [[Ordnance Survey Great Britain County Series#Ordnance Survey Town Plans|some 400 towns]] were mapped at 1:500 (126 inches), 1:528 (120 inches, "10 foot scale") or 1:1056 (60 inches), with the remaining towns mapped at 1:2500 (~25 inches).{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=14}}  In 1855, the Treasury authorised funding for 1:2500 for rural areas and 1:500 for urban areas.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=217}} The 1:500 scale was considered more 'rational' than 1:528 and became known as the "sanitary scale" since its primary purpose was to support establishment of mains sewerage and water supply.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=217}} However, a review of the Ordnance Survey in 1892 found that sales of the 1:500 series maps were very poor and the Treasury declined to fund their continuing maintenance, declaring that any revision or new mapping at this scale must be self-financing.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=221}}  Very few towns and cities saw a second edition of the town plans:{{sfn|Hindle|1998|pp=131-132}} by 1909 only fourteen places had paid for updates.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=220,221}} The review determined that revision of 1:2500 mapping should proceed apace.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=220}} 

The most detailed mapping of London was the OS's 1:1056 survey between 1862 and 1872, which took 326 sheets to cover the capital;{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=42}} a second edition (that needed 759 sheets due to urban expansion) was completed and brought out between 1891 and 1895.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=42}} London was unusual in that [[land registration]] on transfer of title was made compulsory there in 1900.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=222}} The 1:1056 sheets were partially revised to provide a basis for [[HM Land Registry]] index maps and the OS mapped the whole London County Council area (at 1:1056) at national expense.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=222}}

From 1911 onwards{{spaced ndash}}and mainly between 1911 and 1913{{spaced ndash}}the Ordnance Survey [[Enlarger|photo-enlarged]] many 1:2500 sheets covering built-up areas to 1:1250 (50.688&amp;nbsp;inches to the mile) for Land Valuation and Inland Revenue purposes: the increased scale was to provide space for annotations.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=222}} About a quarter of these 1:1250s were marked "Partially revised 1912/13". In areas where there were no further 1:2500s, these partially revised "fifty inch" sheets represent the last large-scale revision (larger than six-inch) of the County Series. The County Series mapping was superseded by the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] 1:1250s, 1:2500s and 1:10,560s after the Second World War.&lt;ref name=Oliver/&gt;

During World War I, the Ordnance Survey was involved in preparing maps of [[Geography of France|France]] and [[Geography of Belgium|Belgium]]. During World War II, many more maps were created, including:
* 1:40,000 map of [[Antwerp]], Belgium
* 1:100,000 map of [[Brussels]], Belgium
* 1:5,000,000 map of [[Geography of South Africa|South Africa]]
* 1:250,000 map of [[Geography of Italy|Italy]]
* 1:50,000 map of north-east France
* 1:30,000 map of the Netherlands with manuscript outline of districts occupied by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]].

After the war, Colonel [[Charles Close]], then Director General, developed a strategy using covers designed by Ellis Martin to increase sales in the leisure market. In 1920 [[O. G. S. Crawford]] was appointed Archaeology Officer and played a prominent role in developing the use of aerial photography to deepen understanding of archaeology.

In 1935, the [[J. C. C. Davidson|Davidson]] Committee was established to review the Ordnance Survey's future. The new Director General, Major-General [[Malcolm MacLeod (scientist)|Malcolm MacLeod]], started the [[retriangulation of Great Britain]], an immense task involving the erection of concrete [[Triangulation station|triangulation pillars ("trig points")]] on prominent hilltops as infallible positions for theodolites. Each measurement made by theodolite during the retriangulation was repeated no fewer than 32 times.

The Davidson Committee's final report set the Ordnance Survey on course for the 20th century. The metric [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|national grid reference system]] was launched and a 1:25000-scale series of maps was introduced. The one-inch maps continued to be produced until the 1970s, when they were superseded by the 1:50000-scale series{{spaced ndash}}as proposed by William Roy more than two centuries earlier.

Ordnance Survey had outgrown its site in the centre of Southampton (made worse by the bomb damage of the Second World War). The bombing during the [[Southampton Blitz|Blitz]] devastated Southampton in November 1940 and destroyed most of [[Ordnance Survey buildings, Southampton|Ordnance Survey's city centre offices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mapping the Southampton Blitz 70 years on |url= http://blog.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/2010/11/mapping-the-southampton-blitz-70-years-on/ |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=19 June 2012 |date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Southampton Blitz: Ordnance Survey map of bomb sites |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/hampshire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9232000/9232001.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 June 2012 |date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff were dispersed to other buildings and to temporary accommodation at Chessington and Esher, Surrey, where they produced 1:25000 scale maps of France, Italy, Germany and most of the rest of Europe in preparation for [[Invasion of Normandy|its invasion]]. Until 1969, Ordnance Survey largely remained at its Southampton city centre HQ and at temporary buildings in the suburb of [[Maybush]] nearby, when a new purpose-built headquarters was opened in Maybush adjacent to the wartime temporary buildings there. Some of the remaining buildings of the original Southampton city-centre site are now used as part of the city's court complex.

The new head office building was designed by the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Public Buildings and Works]] for 4000 staff, including many new recruits who were taken on in the late 1960s and early 70s as draughtsmen and surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The buildings originally contained factory-floor space for photographic processes such as [[heliozincography]] and map printing, as well as large buildings for storing flat maps. Above the industrial areas are extensive office areas. The complex is notable for its concrete mural by sculptor Keith McCarter and the concrete elliptical paraboloid shell roof over the staff restaurant building.

In 1995, Ordnance Survey digitised the last of about 230,000 maps, making the United Kingdom the first country in the world to complete a programme of large-scale electronic mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/overview/history.html |title=Our history |website=www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk |language=en-gb |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the agency was designated a [[Trading Fund]], required to cover its costs by charging for its products and to remit a proportion of its profits to the Treasury. Officially, it is now a civilian organisation with [[executive agency]] status.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

By the late 1990s technological developments had eliminated the need for vast areas for storing maps and for making printing plates by hand. Although there was a small computer section at Ordnance Survey in the 1960s, the digitising programme had replaced the need for printing large-scale maps, while [[computer-to-plate]] technology (in the form of a single machine) had also rendered the photographic platemaking areas obsolete. Part of the latter was converted into a new conference centre in 2000, which was used for internal events and also made available for external organisations to hire.

In 2010, OS announced that printing and warehouse operations were to be outsourced,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/overview/history.html |title=Our history |website=www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk |language=en-gb |accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ending over 200 years of in-house printing.&lt;ref name="PrintWeek 6 September 2010"&gt;{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Helen |title=BT&amp;D awarded map contract as Ordnance Survey bows out of print |url= http://www.printweek.com/print-week/news/1128411/bt-awarded-map-contract-ordnance-survey-bows-print |date=6 September 2010 |work=[[PrintWeek]] |accessdate= 9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Frome-based firm Butler, Tanner and Dennis (BT&amp;D) secured its printing contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-11183624 |title=Frome company secures OS map contract |date=6 September 2010 |newspaper=BBC News |language=en-GB |accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As already stated, large-scale maps had not been printed at Ordnance Survey since the common availability of [[Geographic information system|geographical information system]]s (GISs), but, until late 2010, the ''OS Explorer'' and ''OS Landranger'' series were printed in Maybush.

In April 2009 building began of a new head office in Adanac Park on the outskirts of Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ordnance Survey breaks ground at Adanac Park |publisher=Ordnance Survey |date=3 April 2009 |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2009/groundbreaking.html |accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 10 February 2011 virtually all staff had relocated to the new "Explorer House" building and the old site had been sold off and redeveloped. [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] officially opened the new headquarters building on 4 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Duke opens new Ordnance Survey head office |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/news/2011/10/duke-opens-new-ordnance-survey-building.html |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=21 June 2012 |date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2015 plans were announced for the organisation to move from a Trading Fund model to a government-owned [[limited company]], with the move completed in April 2015. The organisation remains fully owned by the UK government and retains many of the features of a public organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ordnance Survey set to become a Government owned company |publisher=Ordnance Survey |date=22 January 2015 |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2015/os-set-to-become-government-owned-company.html |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ordnance Survey Change in Operating Model |publisher=UK Parliament |date=22 January 2015 |url= http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2015-01-22/HCWS215/ |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2015 a new [[CEO]] was announced to replace [[Vanessa Lawrence]], who had left in 2014. [[Nigel Clifford]], CEO of [[Procserve Holdings]] Ltd, was appointed by Business Minister [[Matthew Hancock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Minister Matthe Hancock announces the appointment of Nigel Clifford as the new Chief Executive of Ordnance Survey |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2015/business-minister-announces-new-os-ceo.html |website=ordnancesurvey.co.uk |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015 the history of the Ordnance Survey was the subject of a [[BBC Four]] TV documentary entitled ''A Very British Map: The Ordnance Survey Story''.&lt;ref name="BBC Timeshift Series 15 Episode 2"&gt;{{cite episode |title= A Very British Map: The Ordnance Survey Story |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06b36q3 |series=Timeshift |station=[[BBC Four]] |airdate= 9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordnance Survey produces a large range of paper maps and [[digital mapping]] products.

===Business mapping===
Ordnance Survey produces a wide variety of different products aimed at business users, such as utility companies and local authorities. The data is supplied by Ordnance Survey on optical media or increasingly, via the Internet. Products can be downloaded via FTP or accessed 'on demand' via a web browser. Organisations using Ordnance Survey data have to purchase a licence to do so. Some of the main products are:

; ''OS MasterMap'' : (see [[#OS MasterMap|below]]) Ordnance Survey's most detailed mapping showing individual buildings and other features in a [[Vector graphics|vector format]]. Every real-world object is assigned a unique reference number (TOID) that allows customers to add this reference to their own databases. ''OS MasterMap'' consists of several so-called "layers" (see [[#OS MasterMap layers|below]]) such as the aerial imagery, transport and postcode. The principal layer is the topographic layer.
; ''OS VectorMap Local'' : A customisable vector product at 1:10,000 scale.
; ''OS Landplan'' : a [[Raster graphics|raster]] map at 1:10 000 scale.
; ''Meridian 2'', ''Strategi'' : Mid-scale mapping in vector format.
; ''ADDRESS-POINT'', ''Code-Point'' : A joint venture with [[Royal Mail]] producing [[dataset]]s with address information to allow postcode searches, etc.
; ''Boundary-Line'' : Mapping showing administrative boundaries such as counties, parishes and [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]].
; 1:10,000, 1:25,000, 1:50,000, 1:250,000 scale raster : Raster versions of leisure maps.
; ''OS Street View'' : A highly simplified mapping focusing on streets and their names at the expense of other features.
; ''Land-Form PROFILE'', ''PROFILE Plus'', ''Panorama'' : [[Digital elevation model|Digital terrain model]]s.

===Leisure maps===
[[File:Ordnance Survey National Grid.svg|thumb|300px|Illustration of the Ordnance Survey National Grid coordinate system, with Trafalgar Square as an example]]
OS's range of leisure maps are published in a variety of scales:

; ''Tour'' {{nobold|{{smaller|([[Circa|c.]] 1:100,000, except Scotland)}}}} : One-sheet maps covering a generally county-sized area, showing major and most minor roads and containing tourist information and selected footpaths. ''Tour'' maps are generally produced from enlargements of 1:250,000 mapping. Several larger scale town maps are provided on each sheet for major settlement centres. The maps have sky-blue covers and there are eight sheets in the series.
; ''OS Landranger'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:50,000)}}}} : The "general purpose" map. They have pink covers; 204 sheets cover the whole of Great Britain and the [[Isle of Man]]. The map shows all footpaths and the format is similar to the ''Explorer'' maps, but with less detail.
; ''OS Landranger Active'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:50,000)}}}} : Select ''OS Landranger'' maps available in a plastic-[[Lamination|laminated]] waterproof version, similar to the ''OS Explorer Active'' range. {{As of|2009|10}}, 25 of the 204 ''Landranger'' maps were available as ''OS Landranger Active'' maps.
; ''OS Explorer'', {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:25,000)}}}} : Specifically designed for walkers and cyclists. They have orange covers, and contain 403 sheets covering the whole of Great Britain (the Isle of Man is excluded from this series). These are the most detailed leisure maps that Ordnance Survey publish and cover all types of footpaths and most details of the countryside for easy navigation. The ''OL'' branded sheets within the Explorer series show areas of greater interest in England and Wales (such as the [[Lake District]], the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]], etc.) with an enlarged area coverage. They appear identical to the ordinary ''Explorer'' maps, except for the numbering and a little yellow mark on the corner (a relic of the old ''Outdoor Leisure'' series). The ''OS Explorer'' maps, together with the former ''Outdoor Leisure'' series, superseded the numerous green-covered ''Pathfinder'' maps. In May 2015 Ordnance Survey announced that the new release of OL series maps would come with a mobile download version, available through a dedicated app on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordnance Survey maps undergo their greatest innovation for over 200 years |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2015/os-maps-undergo-greatest-innovation-in-200-years.html |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that this will be rolled out to all the Explorer and Landranger series over time. 
; ''OS Explorer Active'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:25,000 scale)}}}} : ''OS Explorer'' and ''Outdoor Leisure'' maps in a plastic-laminated waterproof version.
; ''Activity Maps'' : An experimental range of maps designed to support specific activities. The four map packs currently published are ''Off-Road Cycling Hampshire'' North, South, East and West. Each map pack contains 12 cycle routes printed on individual map sheets on waterproof paper. While they are based on the 1:25,000 scale maps, the scales have been adjusted so each route fits on a single A4 sheet.

Until 2010, OS also produced the following:
; ''Route'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:625,000)}}}} : A double-sided map designed for long-distance road users, covering the whole of Great Britain.
; ''Road'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:250,000)}}}} : A series of eight sheets covering Great Britain, designed for road users.
These, along with fifteen ''Tour'' maps, were discontinued during January 2010 as part of a drive for cost-efficiency.

The ''Road'' series was reintroduced in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/maps.html?cat%5B0%5D=20&amp;cat%5B1%5D=138 |title=Maps |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===App development===
In 2013, Ordnance Survey released its first official app, OS MapFinder, and has since added three more apps.

; ''OS Maps'' : Available on iOS and Android, the free to download app allows users to access maps direct to their devices, plan and record routes and share routes with others. Users can subscribe and download OS Landranger and OS Explorer high-resolution maps in 660dpi quality and use them without incurring roaming charges as maps are stored on the device and can be used offline – without WiFi or mobile signal.
; ''OS Maps Web'': Available as a web page – it allows users to access maps from the web using modern web browsers, planning of custom routes and printing of maps is possible similarly to what the mobile applications can do
; ''OS Locate'' : Launched in February 2014 and available on iOS and Android, the free app is a fast and highly accurate means of pinpointing a users exact location and displays grid reference,  latitude, longitude and altitude. OS Locate does not need a mobile signal to function, so the inbuilt GPS system in a device can be relied upon.
; ''OS Ride'' : Launched in 2014 on iOS, the free app uses Ordnance Survey's detailed outdoor mapping including OS Landranger Maps (1:50 000 scale) enabling cyclists to successfully navigate and track their progress as they ride the pre-loaded routes and follow in the tracks of the 2014 Grand Depart professional cyclists.

===Custom products===
Ordnance Survey also offers ''OS Custom Made'', a [[print-on-demand]] service based on digital raster data that allows a customer to specify the area of the map or maps desired. Two scales are offered{{spaced ndash}}1:50,000 (equivalent to 40&amp;nbsp;km by 40&amp;nbsp;km) or 1:25,000 (20&amp;nbsp;km by 20&amp;nbsp;km){{spaced ndash}}and the maps may be produced either folded or flat for framing or wall mounting. Customers may provide their own titles and cover images for folded maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Custom Made |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/custom-made-maps.html |work=Ordnance Survey |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordnance Survey also produces more detailed custom mapping to order, at 1:10,000 (''Landplan'') and at 1:1,250 or 1:500 (''Siteplan''), from its large-scale digital data. Custom scales may also be produced from the enlargement or reduction of the existing scales.

===Educational mapping===
Ordnance Survey supplies reproductions of its maps from the early 1970s to the 1990s for educational use. These are widely seen in schools both in Britain and in [[Changes in British sovereignty|former British colonies]], either as stand-alone geographic aids or as part of geography textbooks or workbooks.

During the 2000s, in an attempt to increase schoolchildren's awareness of maps, Ordnance Survey offered a free ''OS Explorer Map'' to every 11-year-old in [[Primary education#United Kingdom|UK primary education]]. By the end of 2010, when the scheme closed, over 6 million maps had been given away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2010/freemaps.html Schools urged to order free maps now! | About]. Ordnance Survey. Retrieved on 12 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was replaced by free access to the [http://digimapforschools.edina.ac.uk/ Digimap for Schools] service provided by [[EDINA]] for eligible schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/2010/09/large-scale-maps-become-child%E2%80%99s-play-with-digimap-for-schools/ ] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101001012153/http://blog.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/2010/09/large-scale-maps-become-child%E2%80%99s-play-with-digimap-for-schools/ |date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the trend away from paper products towards geographical information systems (GISs), Ordnance Survey has been looking into ways of ensuring schoolchildren are made aware of the benefits of GISs and has launched "MapZone", an interactive child-orientated website featuring learning resources and map-related games.

Ordnance Survey publishes a quarterly journal, principally for geography teachers, called ''Mapping News''.

===Derivative and licensed products===
One series of historic maps, published by [[Cassini Publishing Ltd]], is a reprint of the Ordnance Survey first series from the mid-19th century but using the ''OS Landranger'' [[Map projection|projection]] at 1:50,000 and given 1&amp;nbsp;km gridlines. This means that features from over 150 years ago fit almost exactly over their modern equivalents and modern grid references can be given to old features.

The digitisation of the data has allowed Ordnance Survey to sell maps electronically. Several companies are now licensed to produce the popular scales (1:50,000 and 1:25,000) and their own derived datasets of the map on CD/DVD or to make them available online for download. The buyer typically has the right to view the maps on a PC, a laptop, and a pocket PC/smartphone, and to print off any number of copies. The accompanying software is GPS-aware, and the maps are ready-calibrated. Thus, the user can quickly transfer the desired area from their PC to their laptop or smartphone, and go for a drive or walk with their position continually pinpointed on the screen. The individual map is more expensive than the equivalent paper version, but the price per square km falls rapidly with the size of coverage bought.

==Cartography==
[[File:National Grid for Great Britain.png|thumb|The Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain use the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]]]]
{{main article|Ordnance Survey National Grid}}

The Ordnance Survey's original maps were made by [[triangulation]]. For the second survey, in 1934, this process was used again and resulted in the building of many triangulation pillars ([[trig point]]s): short (c. 4 feet/1.2&amp;nbsp;m high), usually square, concrete or stone pillars at prominent locations such as hill tops. Their precise locations were determined by triangulation, and the details in between were then filled in with less precise methods.

Modern Ordnance Survey maps are largely based on [[aerial photography|aerial photographs]], but large numbers of the pillars remain, many of them adopted by private land owners. Ordnance Survey still has a team of surveyors across Great Britain who visit in person and survey areas that cannot be surveyed using photogrammetric methods (such as land obscured by vegetation) and there is an aim of ensuring that any major feature (such as a new motorway or large housing development) is surveyed within six months of being built. While original survey methods were largely manual, the current surveying task is simplified by the use of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] technology, allowing the most precise surveying standards yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Surveying guidelines |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/help-and-support/navigation-technology/os-net/surveying.html |work=Business &amp; government |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordnance Survey is responsible for a UK-wide network of GPS stations known as "OS Net". These are used for surveying and other organisations can purchase the right to utilise the network for their own uses.

Ordnance Survey still maintains a set of master [[Geodesy|geodetic]] reference points to tie the Ordnance Survey [[Geodetic datum|geographic datum points]] to modern measurement systems such as GPS. Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain use the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] rather than [[Geographic coordinate system#Geographic latitude and longitude|latitude and longitude]] to indicate position. The Grid is known technically as [[OSGB36]] (Ordnance Survey Great Britain 1936) and was introduced after the 1936–1953 retriangulation.

Whereas cartography is the art and science of mapmaking, cartographic design concerns the map user. It governs the design of a map and it is the cartography that ensures the intended message is delivered both efficiently and aesthetically.{{Clarify|date=May 2017|reason=surely the design, not cartography, delivers the message? Source for this opinion?}}

Ordnance Survey's CartoDesign team performs a key role in the organisation, as the authority for cartographic design and development, and engages with internal and external audiences to promote and communicate the value of cartography. They work on a broad range of projects and are responsible for styling all new products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carto Design team |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/resources/carto-design/index.html |work=Business &amp; government |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''OS MasterMap''==
Ordnance Survey's flagship digital product, launched in November 2001, is ''[[OS MasterMap]]'', a database that records, in one continuous digital map, every fixed feature of Great Britain larger than a few metres. Every feature is given a unique [[TOID]] (TOpographical IDentifier), a simple identifier that includes no semantic information. Typically, each TOID is [[Polygon mesh|associated with a polygon that represents the area]] on the ground that the feature covers, in [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|National Grid]] coordinates.

===''OS MasterMap'' layers===
OS MasterMap is offered in themed layers, each linked to a number of TOIDs. As of September 2010, the layers are:

; Topography : The primary layer of ''OS MasterMap'', consisting of vector data comprising large-scale representation of features in the real world, such as buildings and areas of vegetation. The features captured and the way they are depicted is listed in a specification available on the Ordnance Survey website.
; Integrated transport network : A link-and-node network of transport features such as roads and railways. This data is at the heart of many [[Satellite navigation|satnav]] systems. In an attempt to reduce the number of [[Heavy goods vehicle|HGV]]s using unsuitable roads, a data-capture programme of "Road Routing Information" was recently{{when|date=January 2014}} undertaken, aiming to add information such as height restrictions and one-way streets.
; Imagery : [[Orthophoto|Orthorectified aerial photography]] in raster format.
; Address : An overlay adding every address in the UK to other layers.
; Address 2 : Adds further information to the Address layer, such as addresses with multiple occupants (blocks of flats, student houses, etc.) and objects with no postal addresses, such as fields and electricity substations.

Pricing of licenses to ''OS MasterMap'' data depends on the total area requested, the layers licensed, the number of TOIDs in the layers, and the period in years of the data usage. ''OS MasterMap'' can be used to generate maps for a vast array of purposes and maps can be printed from ''OS MasterMap'' data with detail equivalent to a traditional 1:1250 scale paper map.

Ordnance Survey states that thanks to continuous review, ''OS MasterMap'' data is never more than six months out of date. The scale and detail of this mapping project is unique.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} By 2009, around 440 million TOIDs had been assigned, and the database stood at 600 gigabytes in size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/public-sector/mapping-agreements/index.html Public sector mapping agreements | Business and government]. Ordnance Survey. Retrieved on 12 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently (March 2011), OS claims 450 million TOIDs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/mastermap-products.html OS MasterMap products | Business and government]. Ordnance Survey. Retrieved on 12 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, ''OS MasterMap'' was at version 6; 2010's version 8 includes provision for Urban Paths (an extension of the "integrated transport network" layer) and pre-build address layer. All these versions have a similar [[Geography Markup Language|GML]] schema.

==Geographical information science research==
For several decades Ordnance Survey has had a research department that is active in several areas of geographical information science, including:
* Spatial cognition
* Map generalisation
* Spatial data modelling
* Remote sensing and analysis of remotely sensed data
* Semantics and ontologies

Ordnance Survey actively supports the academic research community through its external research and university liaison team. The research department actively supports MSc and PhD students as well as engaging in collaborative research. Most Ordnance Survey products are available to UK universities that have signed up to the [[Digimap]] agreement and data is also made available for research purposes that advances Ordnance Survey's own research agenda.

==Data access and criticisms==
{{see also|Open Data in the UK}}

Ordnance Survey has been subject to criticism. Most centres on the point that Ordnance Survey possesses a virtual government monopoly on geographic data in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1726229,00.html |last1=Arthur |first1=Charles |last2=Cross |first2=Michael |title=Give us back our crown jewels |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 March 2006 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, although a government agency, it has been required to act as a [[Trading Fund]] (i.e. a commercial entity) from 1999 to 2015. This meant that it is supposed to be entirely self-funded from the commercial sale of its data and derived products whilst at the same time the public supplier of geographical information. In 1985, the Committee of Enquiry into the Handling of Geographic Information was set up to "advise the Secretary of State for the Environment within two years on the future handling of geographic information in the UK, taking account of modern developments in information technology and market needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chorley |first=RRE |authorlink=Roger Chorley, 2nd Baron Chorley |year=1987 |title=Handling Geographic Information. Report of the Committee of Enquiry chaired by Lord Chorley |place=London |publisher=HMSO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's final report, published in 1987 under the name of its chairman [[Roger Chorley, 2nd Baron Chorley|Roger Chorley]], stressed the importance of accessible geographic information to the UK and recommended a loosening of policies on distribution and cost recovery.

In 2007 Ordnance Survey were criticised for contracting the public relations company Mandate Communications&lt;ref&gt;{{UK Parliament |date=1 May 2008 |place=Written Questions |url= https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2008-05-01b.202287.h |column=668W |speaker=[[Greg Clark]] |title=Ordnance Survey: Mandate Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; to understand the dynamics of the [[Open Data in the United Kingdom|free data movement]] and discover which politicians and advisers continued to support their current policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/21/politicsandtechnology |title=Ordnance Survey hires PR company to lobby politicians |date=21 August 2008 |first=Michael |last=Cross |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''OS OpenData''===
In response to the feedback from a consultation,{{which|date=January 2014}} the government announced&lt;ref name="OSA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconresponse |archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconresponse |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 19 September 2012 |title= Policy options for geographic information from Ordnance Survey: Consultation – Government Response |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a package of Ordnance Survey data sets would be released for free use and re-use. On 1 April 2010 Ordnance Survey released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2010/OpenData.html |title=Ordnance Survey launches OS OpenData in groundbreaking national initiative |publisher=Ordnance Survey |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the brand ''[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/opendata-products.html OS OpenData]'' under an attribution-only license compatible with [[Creative Commons license|CC-by]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/docs/licences/os-opendata-licence.pdf |title=OpenData License Terms and Conditions |publisher=Ordnance Survey |format=PDF |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups and individuals had campaigned for this release of data, but some were disappointed when some of the profitable datasets, including the leisure 1:50,000 scale and 1:25,000 scale mapping, as well as the low scale Mastermap were not included. These were withheld with the counter-argument that if licensees do not pay for OS data collection then the government would have to be willing to foot a £30 million per annum bill to obtain the future economic benefit of sharing the mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/02/ordnance-survey-open-data |title=The Ordnance Survey has opened up its map data for free after a long campaign. Find out what was released |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2013 Ordnance Survey described an "enhanced" [[Linked data|linked-data]] service with a [[SPARQL]] 1.1-compliant endpoint and bulk-download options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Ordnance Survey Linked Data service proving popular with developers |url= http://www.directionsmag.com/pressreleases/new-ordnance-survey-linked-data-service-proving-popular-with-developers/340085 |date=17 July 2013 |accessdate=28 July 2013 |publisher=Ordnance Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, following the recommendations of the [[Geospatial Commission]] it was announced that parts of OS Mastermap would be released under the [[Open Government Licence]] would include:
* OS MasterMap Topography Layer, including building heights and functional sites
* OS MasterMap Greenspace Layer
* OS MasterMap Highways Network
* OS MasterMap Water Network Layer
* OS Detailed Path Network

However, these would only be free within a usage threshold that was yet to be defined at the release of the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unlocking of Government’s mapping and location data to boost economy by £130m a year |url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2018/mastermap-announcement.html |website=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical material===
Ordnance Survey historical works are generally available, as the agency is covered by [[Crown Copyright]]: works more than fifty years old, including historic surveys of Britain and Ireland and much of the New Popular Edition, are in the public domain. However, finding suitable originals remains an issue as Ordnance Survey does not provide historical mapping on 'free' terms, instead marketing commercially 'enhanced' reproductions in partnership with companies including GroundSure and Landmark.

The [[National Library of Scotland]] has been developing its archive to make Ordnance Survey maps for all of Great Britain more easily available through their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ordnance Survey Maps |url= http://maps.nls.uk/os/ |publisher=National Library of Scotland |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sets are complete in the sense of including at least one copy of each of the sheets in the series, not in the sense of including all revision levels.

The UK approach can be contrasted with, for example, that in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in more recent times, where [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] claims regular copyright over its mapping (and over digital copies of the public domain historical mapping). All Ordnance Survey Ireland maps (historic and current) are available free to view on their online website.

The '''Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment''' ('''SCOPE''') was established by the 10th meeting of the Executive Committee of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) in 1969.&lt;ref name=icsu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scopenvironment.org/about2/history.htm |title=History |publisher=SCOPE |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCOPE's members include 38 national science academies and research councils, and 22 international scientific unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scopenvironment.org/members.htm |title=SCOPE Members |publisher=SCOPE |accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current president is [[Jon Samseth]] ([[Norway]]). The secretariat is located in the Netherlands.

SCOPE exists primarily to develop scientific reviews of key environmental issues around the themes of managing societal and natural resources, ecosystem processes, and biodiversity, health and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scopenvironment.org/about2/mission.htm |title=Mission |publisher=SCOPE |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, SCOPE and [[Elsevier]] established a quarterly [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]], ''[[Environmental Development]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-development/ |title=Environmental Development |publisher=Elsevier |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SCOPE-Zhongyu Environmental Awards==
The SCOPE-Zhongyu Environmental Awards were introduced in 2010. They include three categories of annual Young Scientist awards ([[environmental sciences]], [[environmental technology|environmental technologies]], and [[environmental management]]). Every second year the Lifetime Achievements Award is given to two scientists with major contribution to the environmental sciences.

==SCOPE-Zhongyu Environmental Forum==
The SCOPE-Zhongyu Environmental Forum is an annual event first organised in [[Yixing]] in 2011. It addresses current environmental issues, trying to bring scientists from different fields together with policy makers.

==United Nations==
SCOPE has through the years developed a close collaboration with [[United Nations]] organizations, in particular [[UNESCO]] and [[UNEP]]. SCOPE is a major contributor to UNEP's yearbooks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/yearbook/About_uyb.asp |title=About UNEP Year Book Report |publisher=UNEP |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishes a policy brief series together with UNESCO and UNEP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scopenvironment.org/Unesco_scope.htm |title=UNESCO-SCOPE Policy Briefs Series  |publisher=Scope |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg|thumb|400px|A mid-15th century [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] [[mappa mundi|world map]] based on the 1st (modified conic) projection in [[Jacobus Angelus]]'s 1406 [[Latin]] translation of [[Maximus Planudes]]'s late-13th century rediscovered Greek manuscripts of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s 2nd-century ''[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geography]]''. Serica is shown in the far northeast of the world.]]

'''Serica''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛr|ɪ|k|ə}}) was one of the easternmost [[country|countries]] of [[Asia]] known to the [[classical antiquity|Ancient]] [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] and [[Ancient Romans|Roman]] [[Greco-Roman geography|geographers]]. It is generally taken as referring to [[North China]] during its [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]], [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]], and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]], as it was reached via the overland [[Silk Road]] in contrast to the [[Sinae]], who were reached via the [[maritime Silk Road|maritime routes]]. A similar distinction was later observed during the [[Middle Ages]] between "[[Cathay]]" (north) and "Mangi" or "China" (south). The people of Serica were the '''Seres''', whose name was also used for their region. Access to Serica was eased following the Han conquest of the [[Tarim Basin]] (modern [[Xinjiang]]) but largely blocked when the [[Parthian Empire]] fell to the [[Sassanids]]. [[Henry Yule|Yule]] summarized the classical geographers:{{sfnp|Yule|1878|p=[[:s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/China#627|627]]}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we fuse into one the ancient notices of the Seres and their country, omitting anomalous statements and manifest fables, the result will be something like the {{nowrap|following:—}}&amp;ldquo;The region of the Seres is a vast and populous country, touching on the east the [[Oceanus|Ocean]] and the limits of the [[Ecumene|habitable world]], and extending west to [[Imaus]] and the confines of [[Bactria]]. The people are civilized, mild, just, and frugal, eschewing collisions with their neighbours, and even shy of close intercourse, but not averse to dispose of their own products, of which [[raw silk]] is the staple, but which include also [[silk|silk-stuffs]], fine furs, and iron of remarkable quality.&amp;rdquo; That is manifestly a definition of the [[#Inhabitants|Chinese]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some scholars, however, contend the Seres were not the Chinese themselves but tribes speaking [[Indo-European languages]] who traded with the ancient Indians, such as the [[Yuezhi]], [[Saka]], and [[Tocharians]].

The [[Latin]] forms ''{{lang|la|Serica}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Seres}}'' derive from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''Sērikḗ'' ({{lang|grc|Σηρική}}) and ''Sḗres'' ({{lang|grc|Σῆρες}}).&lt;ref&gt;Schoff, Wilfred H.: "The Eastern Iron Trade of the Roman Empire", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 35 (1915), pp. 224-239 (237)&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to derive from their words for [[silk]] ({{lang-grc-gre|σηρικός}}, ''sērikós''; {{lang-la|sericum}}), which since [[Julius Klaproth|Klaproth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Klaproth |authorlink=Klaproth |title=Mem. rel. à l'Asie, ''Vol. III'' |p=265 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; has often been linked to the [[China|Chinese]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|絲}}}},&lt;ref name=silky&gt;{{harvp|Yule|1866|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SgcVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR44 xliv]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation has been [[reconstruction of Old Chinese|reconstructed]] as {{nowrap|/*[s]ə/}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[reconstruction of Old Chinese|Baxter-Sagart]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The rhotic final of the Greek and Roman term may have been [[dialects of Chinese|dialectical]] or a [[Central Asia]]n addition.

Some [[classical studies|classicists]] have argued that it was extremely improbable that a nation would be named after an insect.

===Overview===
{{further information|Sino-Roman relations|Daqin}}
Beginning in the 1st century BC with [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Strabo]], Roman histories offer only vague accounts of China and the silk-producing ''[[Seres]]'' of the Far East.&lt;ref name="ostrovsky 2007 p44"/&gt; Florus seems to have confused the Seres with peoples of India, or at least noted that their skin complexions proved that they both lived "beneath another sky" than the Romans.&lt;ref name="ostrovsky 2007 p44"&gt;Max Ostrovsky (2007), ''Y = Arctg X: the Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham, Boulder, New York, Toronto, Plymouth: University Press of America, {{ISBN|0-7618-3499-0}}, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st-century geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] asserted that the lands of the Seres formed the center of the coast of [[Pacific Ocean|an eastern ocean]], flanked to the south by India and to the north by the [[Scythians]] of the [[Eurasian Steppe]].&lt;ref name="ostrovsky 2007 p44"/&gt; The historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (c. 330 - c. 400) wrote that the land of the Seres was enclosed by great natural walls around a river called Bautis, possibly a description of the [[Yellow River]].&lt;ref name="ostrovsky 2007 p44"/&gt; From [[Turkic Khaganate|Turkic peoples]] of Central Asia the later [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Romans]] (i.e. Byzantines) derived a new name for China, Taugast (Turkic: ''Tabghach''), during its [[Northern Wei]] (386-535) period.&lt;ref name="luttwak 2008 p168"/&gt; By the time of [[Byzantine emperor|the Eastern Roman]] ruler [[Justinian I]] (r. 527-565), the Byzantines purchased Chinese silk from [[Sogdia]]n intermediaries.&lt;ref name="luttwak 2008 p168"/&gt; However, they also [[Smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire|smuggled silkworms out of China]] with the help of [[Nestorian]] monks, who claimed that the land of "[[Serindia]]" was located north of India and produced the finest silk.&lt;ref name="luttwak 2008 p168"&gt;Luttwak, Edward N. (2009). ''The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire''. Cambridge and London: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-03519-5}}, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ctesias===
The first surviving European accounts of the Seres are those in [[Ctesias]]'s 5th-century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]]'', where he calls them "a people of portentous stature and longevity".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ctesias|Ctes.]], ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Ind.]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The authenticity of the account is, however, disputed.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Strabo===
[[Strabo]]'s 1st-century ''[[Geography (Strabo)|Geography]]'' mentions the Seres in two asides. In the first passage, he mentions that "some writers" claim the Seres to be longer lived than the Indians of Musicanus, whom [[Onesicritus]] claimed lived to the age of 130.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geography (Strabo)|Geo.]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;query=head%3D%23119 Book XV, Ch. i].&lt;/ref&gt; In the second, a passage discussing the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], he mentions that [[Apollodorus of Artemita]] claimed the Bactrians' borders stretched "even as far as the Seres and the [[Phryni]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geography (Strabo)|Geo.]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+11.11.1 Book XI, Ch. xi].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pomponius Mela===
[[Pomponius Mela]]'s ''[[De Situ Orbis]]'' names the Seres as one of three peoples inhabiting the eastern extremity of Asia. He places the Seres between the [[Indian people|Indians]] to the south and the [[Scythians]] to the north.&lt;ref name=pompa/&gt;{{efn|"In the furthest east of Asia are the [[Indian people|Indians]], Seres, and [[Scythians]]. The Indians and Scythians occupy the two extremities, the Seres are in the middle.&lt;ref name=pompa&gt;[[Pomponius Mela|P. Mela]], ''De Situ Orbis'', Bk. I, Ch. ii.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In a later passage, he notes:&lt;ref name=pompb&gt;[[Pomponius Mela|P. Mela]], [http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/III-2-F-b-2/V-1/page/0169.html.ja ''De Situ Orbis'', Bk. III, Ch. vii].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;From these the course [of the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] shore] makes a bend and trends to the coast line which faces the east. That part which adjoins the [[Scythians|Scythian]] promontory is first all impassable from snow; then an uncultivated tract occupied by savages. These tribes are the [[Cannibal]] Scythians and the [[Sakas]], severed from one another by a region where none can dwell because of the number of wild animals. Another vast wilderness follows, occupied also by wild beasts, reaching to a mountain called Thabis which overhangs the sea. A long way from that the ridge of Taurus rises. The Seres come between the two; a race eminent for integrity and well known for the trade which they allow to be transacted behind their backs, leaving their wares in a desert spot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pliny===
[[File:Green glass Roman cup unearthed at Eastern Han tomb, Guixian, China.jpg|thumb|Green [[Roman glass]] cup unearthed from an [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25-220 AD) tomb, [[Guangxi]], China]]
[[Pliny the Elder]] discussed the Seres in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'', Book VI, chapter xx.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]], ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Nat. Hist.]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+6.20 Bk VI, Ch xx].&lt;/ref&gt; He similarly placed the Seres beyond a wasteland on the other side of [[Scythia]]; like [[Vergil]] before him, he patently misunderstands [[sericulture]], believing the silk to be a product of certain trees:&lt;ref name=silky/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then [''sc.'' east of the Caspian], we again find tribes of Scythians and again desert tracts occupied only by wild animals, till we come to that mountain chain overhanging the sea which is called Tabis. Not till nearly half the length of the coast which looks north-east has been past do you find inhabited country. The first race then encountered are the Seres, so famous for the [[silk|fleecy product]] of their forests... The Seres are famous for the woolen substance obtained from their forests; after a soaking in water they comb off the white down of the leaves... So manifold is the labour employed, and so distant is the region of the globe drawn upon, to enable the Roman maiden to flaunt transparent clothing in public...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ammianus]] also reports this version, although [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] knew that silk came from insects specially cultivated by the Seres for the purpose, suggesting closer attention to [[Sino-Roman relations|Roman diplomats and traders]] who had visited China.{{sfnp|Yule|1866|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SgcVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR45 xlv]}}

Elsewhere, Pliny mentions that their iron—which they "send to us with their tissues and skins"—is the highest quality in the world, surpassing even [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] iron.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]], ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Nat. Hist.]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D34%3Achapter%3D41 Bk XXXIV, Ch xli].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny also reports a curious description of the Seres made by an embassy from [[Taprobane]] to Emperor [[Claudius]], suggesting they may be referring to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] populations of the [[Tarim Basin]], such as the [[Tocharians]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]], ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Nat. Hist.]]'', http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+6.24 Bk VI, Ch xxiv].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They also informed us that the side of their island which lies opposite to India is ten thousand [[stade (unit)|stadia]] in length, and runs in a south-easterly direction—that beyond the Emodian Mountains ([[Himalayas]]) they look towards the Serve (Seres), whose acquaintance they had also made in the pursuits of commerce; that the father of Rachias (the ambassador) had frequently visited their country, and that the Serae always came to meet them on their arrival. These people, they said, exceeded the ordinary human height, had flaxen hair, and blue eyes, and made an uncouth sort of noise by way of talking, having no language of their own for the purpose of communicating their thoughts. The rest of their information (on the Serae) was of a similar nature to that communicated by our merchants. It was to the effect that the merchandize on sale was left by them upon the opposite bank of a river on their coast, and it was then removed by the natives, if they thought proper to deal on terms of exchange. On no grounds ought luxury with greater reason to be detested by us, than if we only transport our thoughts to these scenes, and then reflect, what are its demands, to what distant spots it sends in order to satisfy them, and for how mean and how unworthy an end!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The country of "Serica" is positioned in the 150 AD [[Ptolemy world map]] in the area beyond the "Imaus" ([[Pamir Mountains]]). This shows that he considered Serica to either incorporate or consist of what is now [[Xinjiang]].

{{quote|The inhabited part of our earth is bounded on the east by the Unknown Land which lies along the region occupied by the easternmost nations of Asia Major, the Sinae and the nations of Serice|sign=Ptolemy|source=Geographia, ca 150 AD}}

[[Ptolemy]] also positions the Sinae quite precisely:

{{quote|The eastern extremity of the known earth is limited by the meridian drawn through the metropolis of the Sinae, at a distance from [[Alexandria]] of 119.5 degrees, reckoned upon the equator, or about eight equinoctial hours. . . .|source=Book vii, ch. 5}}

Ptolemy also speaks of "Sera, the Capital of the Seres".  [[Henry Yule]] argued that Ptolemy's misrendering of the [[Indian Sea]] as a closed basin meant that Ptolemy must also have misplaced the Chinese coast, and therefore the idea that Sinae is a separate country from Serica would be a misconception.&lt;ref name="yule2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Yule, Henry |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SgcVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cathay and the Way Thither, Volume 1| pages= xxxvii &amp;ndash; xxxviii |isbn= 8120619668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy wrote of lands in and around the [[Indian Ocean]]. He explained that a port city called [[Kattigara]] lay beyond the [[Golden Chersonese]] (i.e. the [[Malay Peninsula]]) and was visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander, most likely a merchant.&lt;ref name="young 2001 p29"&gt;Gary K. Young (2001), Rome's Eastern Trade: International Commerce and Imperial Policy, 31 BC - AD 305, {{ISBN|0-415-24219-3}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1877 publication [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] offered the idea that Kattigara was located near modern [[Hanoi]], within the ancient Chinese province of [[Jiaozhi]] that existed in northern [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand von Richthofen, ''China'', Berlin, 1877, Vol.I, pp. 504–510; cited in Richard Hennig, ''Terrae incognitae : eine Zusammenstellung und kritische Bewertung der wichtigsten vorcolumbischen Entdeckungsreisen an Hand der daruber vorliegenden Originalberichte'', Band I, Altertum bis Ptolemäus, Leiden, Brill, 1944, pp.387, 410–411; cited in Zürcher (2002), pp 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeological finds of Roman and Mediterranean artefacts at [[Óc Eo]] (near [[Ho Chi Minh City]]) in the [[Mekong Delta]] of southern Vietnam hint that this was the location of the port city related by Ptolemy.&lt;ref name="young 2001 p29"/&gt; Roman golden [[medal]]lions dating to the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]] were uncovered there, seeming to suggest [[Roman commerce|Roman commercial]] activity in [[Southeast Asia]] during at least the [[Antonine]] period (supported by other finds in [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]]).&lt;ref name="young 2001 p29"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For further information about archaeology in [[Óc Eo]], see: Milton Osborne (2006), ''The Mekong: Turbulent Past, Uncertain Future'', Crows Nest: Allen &amp; Unwin, revised edition, first published in 2000, {{ISBN|1-74114-893-6}}, pp 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese histories]] affirmed that merchants of "[[Daqin]]" (i.e. the Roman Empire) were active in [[Kingdom of Funan|Cambodia and Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="young 2001 p29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"&gt;{{cite web|orig-year=1998|date=2000|author=Paul Halsall|editor=Jerome S.

As Ptolemy describes it, Serica was bordered in the north by the ''Annibi'' and ''Auxacii Montes'', identified as the [[Altai Mountains]]. The ''Montes Asmiraei'', a Serican district, are the Da-Uri Chain&lt;!--where are they?--&gt; while the ''Cassi Montes'' are believed to be the mountains of the [[Gobi Desert]]. Ptolemy names the principal river of the Seres as the ''Bautisus'', identified as the [[Yellow River]].

The Greco-Roman writers name over a dozen tribes and fifteen cities of the Seres. It is evident from their portrayals that they are not all of the same ethnicity but share a common national appellation. Their capital is named as ''Sera''. Possible candidates include [[Kashgar]] and [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]]. ''Issedon'', the capital of the Serican [[Issedones]], is thought to have been situated on the eastern slopes of the [[Pamirs]] or even the [[Altai Mountains]], while the third notable city, ''Aspacara'', was described as located near the source of the [[Yellow River]].

The ancient fathers also describe the pleasant climate of Serica and its plenitude in natural resources. Among these are iron, furs and skins, and precious stones.

[[Image:ClassCanalStreetNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|240px|According to the spatial mismatch theory, opportunities for low-income people are located far away from where they live.]]'''Spatial mismatch''' is the mismatch between where low-income households reside and suitable job opportunities. In its original formulation (see below) and in subsequent research, it has mostly been understood as a phenomenon affecting African-Americans, as a result of [[Racial segregation in the United States|residential segregation]], [[economic restructuring]], and the suburbanization of employment.

Spatial mismatch was first proposed by [[John F. Kain]] in a seminal 1968 article, "Housing Segregation, Negro Employment, and Metropolitan Decentralization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John F. |last=Kain |title=Housing Segregation, Negro Employment, and Metropolitan Decentralization |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |year=1968 |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=175–197 |doi=10.2307/1885893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That article did not specifically use the term "spatial mismatch", and Kain disclaimed credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John F. |last=Kain |title=A pioneer's perspective on the spatial mismatch literature |journal=[[Urban Studies (journal)|Urban Studies]] |year=2004 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=7–32 |doi=10.1080/0042098032000155669}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1987, [[William Julius Wilson]] was an important exponent, elaborating the role of economic restructuring, as well as the departure of the black middle-class, in the development of a ghetto underclass in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=William Julius |title=The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy |year=1987 |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-90130-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ingram Park Mall1.JPG|thumb|240px|Suburban shopping malls took employment out of the inner city.]]
After [[World War I]], many wealthy Americans started decentralizing out of the cities and into the suburbs. During the second half of the 20th century, [[department store]]s followed the trend of moving into the suburbs. In 1968, Kain formulated the “Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis”, but he did not refer to it by this term. His hypothesis was that black workers reside in segregated zones that are distant and poorly connected to major centers of growth. The phenomenon has many implications for inner-city residents dependent on low-level entry jobs. For example, distance from work centers can lead to increasing unemployment rates and further dampen poverty outcomes for the region at large.

==Factors==
In 2007, Laurent Gobillon, Harris Selod, and Yves Zenou suggested that there are seven different factors that support the spatial mismatch phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gobillon |first=Laurent |last2=Selod |first2=Harris |last3=Zenou |first3=Yves |year=2007 |title=The Mechanisms of Spatial Mismatch |journal=Urban Studies |volume=44 |issue=12 |pages=2401–2427 |doi=10.1080/00420980701540937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four factors are attributed to potential workers accessibility and initiatives. The remaining three factors stress employers' reluctance to divert away from the negative stigma of city people and in particular minorities when hiring.
	
===Potential workers perspectives===
[[Image:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|thumb|240px|Urban redevelopment projects such as [[Pruitt–Igoe]] in St. Louis concentrated and separated workers from their surroundings and work. Such projects created a ghettoized underclass in America.]]
*Commuting cost is seen as an obstacle for inner city people to be present for job interviews and furthermore to arrive to work everyday on time. In other words, cars may be too expensive for some workers and they may have to rely heavily on public transportation. Public transportation is problematic in a sense that it is not always prompt and may not stop at all job location sites.
*Information access to jobs decreases as distance increases away from the job center. People who are living away from the job center are generally less knowledgeable about potential openings than individuals who live closer to the job center. Therefore, networking and [[knowledge spillover|information spillovers]] are of a major advantage in accessing information about potential openings.
*There seems to be a lack of incentive for distance workers to search intensively for a job that is relatively far away. Gobillion, Selod and Zenou believe that minorities, more or less, do a tradeoff between short term loss and long term benefits. The short term loss involves making frequent search trips to distant work centers. However, the long term benefit involves obtaining a stable job and thus a higher wage rate. Unfortunately, minorities tend to weigh the short term loss higher than the long term benefits and as a result decreases their opportunity at obtaining a job in the suburbs.
*There also seems to be a high search cost involve for urban workers looking for a job in the suburbs. It might be associated with paying a job agency to expand their search beyond the urban residential area or locating an agency in the suburbs.

==China==
Growth of [[List of under-occupied developments in China|ghost cities in China]], mostly from not yet agglomerated areas between or adjacent metropolitan areas or coal mining towns, as in the case of the most famous example, [[Kangbashi New Area]] of [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]], are an example of spatial mismatch.  In the case of places near metropolitan areas, it represents less of a risk going forward than in mining areas.

'''Spur and groove formations''' are a [[geomorphic]] feature of many [[coral reef]]s. They are ridges of reef formed by [[coral]] "spurs" separated by channels "grooves" which often have sediment or rubble bed. Spur and groove formations vary in their size and distribution worldwide but are a common feature on many forereefs of [[fringing reef]]s, [[barrier reefs]], and [[atolls]] which are exposed to moderate wave energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storlazzi|first1=Curt|title=Quantitative morphology of a fringing reef tract from high-resolution laser bathymetry: Southern Molokai, Hawaii|journal=Geol. Soc. Am. Bull|date=2003|url=http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/115/11/1344.short |volume=115 |issue=11 |pages=1344–1355 |doi=10.1130/B25200.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spur and groove formations are influenced by the incoming [[surface wave]]s, and the waves induce a circulation pattern of counter rotating circulation cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Justin|title=Hydrodynamics of spur and groove formations on a coral reef |journal=J. Geophys. Res.|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrc.20225/full |date=2013 |volume=118 |issue=6 |pages=3059–3073 |doi=10.1002/jgrc.20225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alongshore shape of spur and groove formations varies from smoothly varying rounded spurs, to flat spurs with shallow rectangular grooves, or deeply cut  rectangular or overhanging channels sometimes called buttresses. Spur and groove formations have typical scales of: spur height 0.5 to 10 m, alongshore wavelength 5 to 150 m, width of groove 1 to 100 m, and found in depths from 0 to 30 m. The mechanism for maintaining preferential coral growth on the spur is thought to be caused by higher wave stress on the spur which causes sediment to be shed towards the groove and downslope and preferential [[coral]] growth on the spur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Justin|title=Field observations of wave‐driven circulation over spur and groove formations on a coral reef|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JC010464/full |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|date=2015|volume=118 |issue=6 |pages=3059–3073 |doi=10.1002/2014JC010464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is believed that spur and grooves are essentially constructional in formation, while a less important mechanism may occur from sediment scour in the grooves.

'''The Streels of Urtah''' is a location in the [[fantasy]] [[novel]]s ''[[Shardik]]'' and ''[[Maia (novel)|Maia]]'' by [[Richard Adams]].

==''Shardik''==
''Shardik'' is a novel of the ancient struggle between good and evil, and some of the effects of faith on the behaviour of human beings. In it The Streels of Urtah are depicted as a dreadful place where people who have done much evil are sent, without their knowledge, by God.

Guardians and priests live near the Streels. Their job is to kill anyone who enters the Streels, since they believe only the evil are drawn to the Streels by God. Shardik descends into the Streels and remains there overnight, and the guardian attempts to kill him, but he escapes and leaves the Streels in the morning. It is understood that he must die, and that there is no reprieve, but it is suggested that his death will be redemptive and that he will accomplish the will of God in dying.

==''Maia''==
In ''[[Maia (novel)|Maia]]'', Adams's other novel set in the Beklan Empire, the girl Occula also enters the Streels at the prompting of those nameless spirits who have impelled her throughout, to pursue and kill Fornis, the depraved and cruel ruler of Bekla, who has herself entered the Streels at the prompting of those same spirits.  She does this by causing Fornis to stab herself, and she becomes aware that the Streels are for those who have committed crimes for which there is no forgiveness or redemption.  Occula has herself entered the Streels and her life is therefore forfeit – [[deodand]] – she has to stay apart from the world for a long time to recover herself, tended by the priest, guardian of the Streels.

'''Tatyana Ustinova''' (November 14, 1913, [[Alushta]] — September 4, 2009, [[Vancouver]]) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] geologist, who discovered [[Valley of Geysers]] in [[Kamchatka]].

==Biography==
Tatyana Ustinova [[graduation|graduated]] [[Kharkiv University]], and subsequently worked she worked on projects in the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Ilmen Reserve|Reserve Ilmen]]. In 1940, together with her husband, [[Yury Averin]] she was transferred to [[Kronotsky Reserve]] in Kamchatka. In April 1941, while accompanied by the guide Anysyfor Pavlovich Krupenin, she found the Valley of Geysers.

Until 1946 Ustinova remained on the Kamchatka peninsula, researching Valley of Geysers. She gave the names to the most powerful and impressive [[hot spring]]s there. Later on she worked in [[Chişinău]]. In 1951, she published a book ''Geysers of Kamchatka''.

In 1989, Ustinova left her homeland to live in Canada along with her eldest daughter, Tatyana, and she died there on September 4, 2009.

==Death==
Following Ustinova's testament, her ashes were buried in Valley of Geysers on August 5, 2010, 11 months and 2 days after her death.

The following '''telephone numbers in Kenya''' are destination codes for international calls terminating in Kenya as well as the procedures for dialling internationally from within Kenya. Until 1999, [[Kenya]] shared its [[telephone numbering plan]] with [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]], meaning that to make calls between the three countries, subscribers needed only dial the area code and number, a legacy of the East African Post and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC) which was dissolved in 1977. As a result of the reorganisation of Tanzania's numbering plan in that year, direct dialling was discontinued, although calls between the three countries do not require international dialling, only a special three-digit code.

==Land lines==
Land line phone numbers in Kenya follow the format Area Code + Phone Number.
To dial a number within an Area and/or City, only the Phone Number needs to be dialled. When dialling from a different Area/City, the telephone number is dialled in the format 0 + Area Code + Phone Number. When dialling from overseas, the 0 is omitted.

The USGS is a bureau of the [[United States Department of the Interior]]; it is that department's sole scientific agency. The USGS employs approximately 8,670 people&lt;ref name=AP-20091023&gt;{{cite news |agency= [[Associated Press]] |title= Monterey Aquarium's McNutt new USGS Director |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010126506_apususgsdirector.html |work= [[The Seattle Times]] |date=October 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is headquartered in [[Reston, Virginia]]. The USGS also has major offices near [[Lakewood, Colorado]], at the [[Denver Federal Center]], and [[Menlo Park, California]].

The current motto of the USGS, in use since August 1997, is "science for a changing world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/97financial/about.html FY 1997 Annual Financial Report], U.S. Geological Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usgs.gov/visual-id/outside_use.html |title= USGS Visual Identity System |publisher= United States Geological Survey |date= July 27, 2006 |accessdate= December 29, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022940/http://www.usgs.gov/visual-id/outside_use.html |archive-date= January 30, 2009 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency's previous slogan, adopted on the occasion of its hundredth anniversary, was "Earth Science in the Public Service."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/techrpt/sta30.pdf Suggestions to Authors of the Reports of the United States Geological Survey]'', U.S. Geological Survey (7th ed. 1991), pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the USGS science focus is directed at  six topical "Mission Areas",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Start with science |url=http://www.usgs.gov/start_with_science/ |publisher= United States Geological Survey |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  namely (1) Climate and Land Use Change, (2) Core Science Systems, (3) Ecosystems, (4) Energy and Minerals and Environmental Health, (5) Natural Hazards, and (6) Water.  In December 2012, the USGS split the Energy and Minerals and Environmental Health Mission Area resulting in seven topical Mission Areas, with the two new areas being: [http://usgs.gov/energy_minerals Energy and Minerals] and [http://usgs.gov/envirohealth Environmental Health]. Administratively, it is divided into a Headquarters unit and six Regional Units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Map of Geographic Areas |url = http://www.usgs.gov/aboutusgs/organized/key_officials.asp#geo_area_map |accessdate = December 12, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130115205356/http://www.usgs.gov/aboutusgs/organized/key_officials.asp#geo_area_map |archive-date = January 15, 2013 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other specific programs include:

===Topographic mapping===
[[File:Mount Marcy New York USGS topo map 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|1892 15-minute map (or ''topographic sheet'') of the [[Mount Marcy]] area of the [[Adirondacks]] in New York State from the first decades of the USGS]]

The USGS produces several national series of [[topographic maps]] which vary in [[scale (map)|scale]] and extent, with some wide gaps in coverage, notably the complete absence of 1:50,000 scale topographic maps or their equivalent. The largest (both in terms of scale and quantity) and best-known topographic series is the 7.5-minute, 1:24,000 scale, [[Quadrangle (geography)|quadrangle]], a non-metric scale virtually unique to the United States. Each of these maps covers an area bounded by two lines of [[latitude]] and two lines of [[longitude]] spaced 7.5 [[minute of arc|minutes]] apart. Nearly 57,000 individual maps in this series cover the [[Continental United States|48 contiguous states]], [[Hawaii]], [[United States Territories|U.S.&amp;nbsp;territories]], and areas of [[Alaska]] near Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Prudhoe Bay. The area covered by each map varies with the latitude of its represented location due to convergence of the meridians. At lower latitudes, near 30° north, a 7.5-minute quadrangle contains an area of about {{convert|64|sqmi|km2|0}}. At 49° north latitude, {{convert|49|sqmi|km2|0}} are contained within a quadrangle of that size. As a unique non-metric map scale, the 1:24,000 scale naturally requires a separate and specialized [[romer]] scale for plotting map positions.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topomaps.usgs.gov/|title=USGS – Topographic Maps|first=USGS Rolla|last=Missouri|website=Topomaps.usgs.gov|accessdate=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412214110/http://topomaps.usgs.gov/|archive-date=April 12, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/usgsmaps/usgsmaps.html |title= USGS Maps Booklet|website=erg.usgs.gov|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, budget constraints have forced the USGS to rely on donations of time by civilian volunteers in an attempt to update its 7.5-minute topographic map series, and USGS stated outright in 2000 that the program was to be phased out in favor of ''[[The National Map]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thor-f5.er.usgs.gov/topomaps/revision_overview.pdf |format= PDF |title= The U.S. Geological Survey's Revision Program for 7.5-Minute Topographic Maps |first= Larry |last= Moore |publisher= United States Geological Survey |date= December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with the [[National Atlas of the United States]] produced by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], one of whose bureaus is USGS).

An older series of maps, the 15-minute series, was once used to map the contiguous 48 states at a scale of 1:62,500, but was discontinued some time ago for maps covering the continental United States. Each map was bounded by two [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] and two [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] spaced 15 minutes apart—the same area covered by four maps in the 7.5-minute series. The 15-minute series, at a scale of 1:63,360 (one inch representing one mile), remains the primary topographic quadrangle for the state of Alaska (and only for that particular state). Nearly 3,000 maps cover 97% of the state.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; The United States remains virtually the only developed country in the world without a standardized civilian topographic map series in the standard 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 metric scales, making coordination difficult in border regions (the U.S. military does issue 1:50,000 scale topo maps of the continental United States, though only for use by members of its defense forces).

The next-smallest topographic series, in terms of scale, is the 1:100,000 series. These maps are bounded by two lines of longitude and two lines of latitude. However, in this series, the lines of latitude are spaced 30 minutes apart and the lines of longitude are spaced 60 minutes, which is the source of another name for these maps; the 30 x 60-minute quadrangle series. Each of these quadrangles covers the area contained within 32 maps in the 7.5-minute series. The 1:100,000 scale series is unusual in that it employs the [[Metric system]] primarily. One centimeter on the map represents one kilometer of distance on the ground. [[Contour interval]]s, spot elevations, and horizontal distances are also specified in meters.

The final regular quadrangle series produced by the USGS is the 1:250,000 scale topographic series. Each of these quadrangles in the conterminous United States measures 1&amp;nbsp;degree of latitude by 2&amp;nbsp;degrees of longitude. This series was produced by the U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[Army Map Service]] in the 1950s, prior to the maps in the larger-scale series, and consists of 489 sheets, each covering an area ranging from {{convert|8218|sqmi|km2|0}} at 30° north to {{convert|6222|sqmi|km2|0}} at 49° north.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; Hawaii is mapped at this scale in quadrangles measuring 1° by 1°.

USGS topographic quadrangle maps are marked with grid lines and tics around the map collar which make it possible to identify locations on the map by several methods, including the [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] measurements of longitude and latitude, the [[Survey township|township]] and [[section (land)|section]] method within the [[Public Land Survey System]], and [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian coordinates]] in both the [[State Plane Coordinate System]] and the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]].

Other specialty maps have been produced by the USGS at a variety of scales. These include [[county (United States)|county]] maps, maps of special interest areas, such as the [[United States National Park|national parks]], and areas of scientific interest.

A number of Internet sites have made these maps available on the web for affordable commercial and professional use. Because works of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government are in the [[public domain]], it is also possible to find many of these maps for free at various locations on the Internet. [[Georeference]]d map images are available from the USGS as [[digital raster graphic]]s (DRGs) in addition to digital data sets based on USGS maps, notably [[digital line graph]]s (DLGs) and [[digital elevation model]]s (DEMs).

In 2015, the USGS unveiled the topoView website, a new way to view their entire digitized collection of over 178,000 maps from 1884–2006. The site is an interactive map of the United States that allows users to search or move around the map to find the USGS collection of maps for a specific area. Users may then view the maps in great detail and download them if desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/maps/topoview/|title=topoView - USGS|author=|date=|website=USGS Topoview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The National Map and U.S. Topo==
In 2008 the USGS abandoned traditional methods of surveying, revising, and updating topographic maps based on aerial photography and field checks.&lt;ref name="MOO"&gt;{{cite news |last= Moore |first= Larry |url= http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/us-topo-a-new-national-map-series/178707 |title=US Topo: A New National Map Series |work= Directions Magazine |date= May 16, 2011 |accessdate= April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today's U.S. Topo quadrangle (1:24,000) maps are mass-produced, using automated and semiautomated processes, with cartographic content supplied from the National GIS Database.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt; In the two years from June 2009 to May 2011, the USGS produced nearly 40,000 maps, more than 80 maps per work day.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt; Only about two hours of interactive work are spent on each map, mostly on text placement and final inspection; there are essentially no field checks or field inspections to confirm map details.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt;

While much less expensive to compile and produce, the revised digital U.S. topo maps have been criticized for a lack of accuracy and detail in comparison to older generation maps based on aerial photo survey and field checks.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt; As the digital databases were not designed for producing general purpose maps, data integration can be a problem when retrieved from sources with different resolutions and collection dates.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt;  Man-made features once recorded by direct field observation are not in any public domain national database, and are frequently omitted from the newest generation digital topo maps, including windmills, mines and mineshafts, water tanks, fence lines, survey marks, parks, recreational trails, buildings, boundaries, pipelines, telephone lines, power transmission lines, and even railroads.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt;  Additionally, the digital map's use of existing software may not properly integrate different feature classes or prioritize and organize text in areas of crowded features, obscuring important geographic details.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt;  As a result, some have noted that the U.S. Topo maps currently fall short of traditional topographic map presentation standards achieved in maps drawn from 1945  to 1992.&lt;ref name="MOO"/&gt;

== USGS Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility ==
The Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility (HIF) has four sections within its organizational structure;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = USGS |title = History of the HIF |url = http://water.usgs.gov/hif/about/history/ |publisher = United States Geological Survey |access-date = October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Field Services Section which includes the warehouse, repair shop, and Engineering Unit; the Testing Section which includes the Hydraulic Laboratory, testing chambers, and Water Quality Laboratory; the Information Technology Section which includes computer support and the Drafting Unit; and the Administrative Section.

The HIF was given national responsibility for the design, testing, evaluation, repair, calibration, warehousing, and distribution of hydrologic instrumentation. Distribution is accomplished by direct sales and through a rental program. The HIF supports data collection activities through centralized warehouse and laboratory facilities. The HIF warehouse provides hydrologic instruments, equipment, and supplies for USGS as well as Other Federal Agencies (OFA) and USGS Cooperators. The HIF also tests, evaluates, repairs, calibrates, and develops hydrologic equipment and instruments. The HIF Hydraulic Laboratory facilities include a towing tank, jet tank, pipe flow facility, and tilting flume. In addition, the HIF provides training and technical support for the equipment it stocks.

The Engineering Group seeks out new technology and designs for instrumentation that can work more efficiently, be more accurate, and or be produced at a lower cost than existing instrumentation. HIF works directly with [[Forest Technology Systems|vendors]] to help them produce products that will meet the mission needs of the USGS. For instrument needs not currently met by a vendor, the Engineering Group designs, tests, and issues contracts to have HIF designed equipment made. Sometimes HIF will patent a new design in the hope that instrument vendors will buy the rights and mass-produce the instrument at a lower cost to everyone.

===Locating USGS publications===
The [[United States Geological Survey Library]] holds copies of current and historical USGS publications, and is the largest earth sciences library in the world. Most publications are available for inter-library loan within the United States. Under the Organic Act, which provided for the formation of the USGS, the library was given extra copies of all USGS publications when published to be used in exchange with other domestic and foreign geological agencies, making the acquisition of the USGS Library collection one of the most cost efficient libraries in the U.S. government.

USGS publications are available for purchase at USGS Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.usgs.gov/ |title=USGS Store |publisher=United States Geological Survey |date=May 17, 2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many USGS published reports are available to view and access on-line from the USGS Publications Warehouse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ivan Suftin |author2=David Sibley |author3=James Kreft |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/ |title=USGS Publications Warehouse |publisher=United States Geological Survey |date= |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while many USGS publications are now available online (see [[External links#Publications|Publications]] below).

Many older USGS publications have been scanned and digitized by such services as [[Google Books]] and the [[Hathi Trust]] and [[Internet Archive]]. An online search will quickly reveal if a digital version is available. All USGS publications are [[public domain]].

== History ==
Prompted by a report from the [[National Academy of Sciences]], the USGS was created, by a last-minute amendment, to an act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] on March 3, 1879. It was charged with the "classification of the public lands, and examination of the geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain". This task was driven by the need to inventory the vast lands added to the United States by the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1848.

The legislation also provided that the [[Hayden Geological Survey of 1871|Hayden]], [[Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869|Powell]], and [[Wheeler Survey|Wheeler]] surveys be discontinued as of June 30, 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1050/establish.htm |title=Establishment of the U.S. Geological Survey, USGS Circular 1050 |publisher=United States Geological Survey |date= |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clarence King]], the first director of USGS, assembled the new organization from disparate regional survey agencies. After a short tenure, King was succeeded in the director's chair by [[John Wesley Powell]].

The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] and [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] and were [[geocentric model|geocentric]], placing [[Earth]] at the centre of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From China to Paris: 2000 Years Transmission of Mathematical Ideas |first=Yvonne |last=Dold-Samplonius |date=2002 |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval Science Technology and Medicine: An Encyclopedia |author1=Thomas F.

In developing the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] built upon Copernicus' work as well as observations by [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].

Further observational improvements led to the realization that our Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in a [[galaxy]] we call the [[Milky Way]], which is one of at least hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy [[exoplanet|have planets]]. [[Observable universe#End of Greatness|At the largest scale]] galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in [[galactic cluster|clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s which form immense [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] and [[void (cosmology)|voids]] in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-1292022932|edition=International|pages=1173–74|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then,&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawking, Stephen |date=1988 |title=A Brief History of Time |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0553053401 |page=125 |authorlink=Stephen Hawking}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.&lt;ref name="nobel_2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[cosmology|cosmological]] description of the development of the Universe. Under this theory, space and time emerged together {{val|13.799|0.021|u=billion years}} ago&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Planck Collaboration|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results.

After an [[inflationary epoch|initial accelerated expansion]] at around 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, and the separation of the [[fundamental interaction|four known fundamental forces]], the Universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first [[subatomic particle]]s and simple [[atom]]s to form. [[Dark matter]] gradually gathered forming a [[foam|foam-like]] structure of [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] and [[void (cosmology)|voids]] under the influence of [[gravity]]. Giant clouds of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most [[density|dense]], forming the first [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[star]]s, and everything else seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion [[light-year]]s because [[metric expansion of space|space itself has expanded]], and it is still expanding today. This means that objects which are now up to 46 billion light years away can [[observable universe|still be seen]] in their distant past, because in the past when their light was emitted, they were much closer to the Earth.

From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more [[matter]] than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as [[dark matter]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Redd|first1=Nola|title=What is Dark Matter?|url=https://www.space.com/20930-dark-matter.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''dark'' means that there is a wide range of strong [[indirect evidence]] that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The [[Lambda-CDM]] model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about {{val|69.2|1.2|u=%}} [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a [[scalar field]] known as [[dark energy]] which is responsible for the current [[expansion of space]], and about 25.8% [2015] is dark matter.&lt;ref name="planck_2015"&gt;[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/10/aa27101-15/T9.html Planck 2015 results, table 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary ("[[baryonic matter|baryonic]]") matter is therefore only 4.9% [2015] of the physical universe.&lt;ref name="planck_2015" /&gt; Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.3% of the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

There are many competing hypotheses about the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various [[multiverse]] hypotheses, in which the Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.&lt;ref name="Brian Greene 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EllisKS032" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason.

A term for "universe" among the ancient Greek philosophers from [[Pythagoras]] onwards was {{lang|grc|τὸ πᾶν}}, ''tò pân'' ("the all"), defined as all matter and all space, and {{lang|grc|τὸ ὅλον}}, ''tò hólon'' ("all things"), which did not necessarily include the void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=πᾶς | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/πᾶς}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=ὅλος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/ὅλος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another synonym was {{lang|grc|ὁ κόσμος}}, ''ho kósmos'' (meaning the [[world (philosophy)|world]], the [[cosmos]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott |title = A Greek–English Lexicon | quote = κόσμος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/κόσμος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms are also found in Latin authors (''totum'', ''mundus'', ''natura'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, C.T. | author2=Short, S | date=1879 | title=A Latin Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-864201-5 | pages=1175, 1189–90, 1881–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words ''Das All'', ''Weltall'', and ''Natur'' for ''Universe''.

== Chronology and the Big Bang ==
{{Main|Big Bang|Chronology of the universe}}

The prevailing model for the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Silk|title=Horizons of Cosmology|publisher=Templeton Pressr|date=2009|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Singh|title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=2005|page=560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the Universe subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. A version of the model with a [[cosmological constant]] (Lambda) and [[cold dark matter]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]], is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and [[redshift]] of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.

The initial hot, dense state is called the [[Planck epoch]], a brief period extending from time zero to one [[Planck time]] unit of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, and [[gravity]] - currently the weakest by far of the [[fundamental interactions|four known forces]] - is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been [[grand unification|unified]]. Since the Planck epoch, space has been [[metric expansion of space|expanding]] to its present scale, with a very short but intense period of [[cosmic inflation]] believed to have occurred within the first [[Scientific Notation|10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt;]] seconds.&lt;ref name=Sivaram&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. Sivaram | journal=Astrophysics &amp; Space Science | date=1986 | volume=125 | issue=1 | pages=189–99 | doi=10.1007/BF00643984 | bibcode=1986Ap&amp;SS.125..189S | title= Evolution of the Universe through the Planck epoch}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today. Objects in space did not physically move; instead the [[metric expansion of space|metric]] that defines space itself changed. Although objects in [[spacetime]] cannot move faster than the [[speed of light]], this limitation does not apply to the metric governing spacetime itself. This initial period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat, and much larger than light could travel since the start of the universe.

Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence, the four fundamental forces had separated. As the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state, various types of [[subatomic particles]] were able to form in short periods of time known as the [[quark epoch]], the [[hadron epoch]], and the [[lepton epoch]]. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. These [[elementary particle]]s associated stably into ever larger combinations, including stable [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, which then formed more complex [[atomic nuclei]] through [[nuclear fusion]]. This process, known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], only lasted for about 17 minutes and ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred. About 25% of the [[proton]]s and all the [[neutron]]s in the universe, by mass, were converted to [[helium]], with small amounts of [[deuterium]] (a [[isotope|form]] of [[hydrogen]]) and traces of [[lithium]]. Any other [[chemical element|element]] was only formed in very tiny quantities. The other 75% of the protons remained unaffected, as [[hydrogen]] nuclei.

After nucleosynthesis ended, the universe entered a period known as the [[photon epoch]]. During this period, the Universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral [[atom]]s, so it contained a hot, dense, foggy [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of negatively charged [[electron]]s, neutral [[neutrino]]s and positive nuclei. After about 377,000 years, the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable [[atom]]s. This is known as [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] for historical reasons; in fact electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time. Unlike plasma, neutral atoms are [[Opacity (optics)|transparent]] to many [[wavelength]]s of light, so for the first time the universe also became transparent. The photons released ("[[photon decoupling|decoupled]]") when these atoms formed can still be seen today; they form the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB).

As the Universe expands, the [[energy density]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] decreases more quickly than does that of [[matter]] because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. At around 47,000 years, the [[energy density]] of matter became larger than that of photons and [[neutrino]]s, and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe. This marked the end of the [[radiation-dominated era]] and the start of the [[matter-dominated era]].

In the earliest stages of the universe, tiny fluctuations within the universe's density led to [[filament (cosmology)|concentrations]] of [[dark matter]] gradually forming. Ordinary matter, attracted to these by [[gravity]], formed large gas clouds and eventually, stars and galaxies, where the dark matter was most dense, and [[void (cosmology)|voids]] where it was least dense. After around 100 - 300 million years,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} the first [[star]]s formed, known as [[Population III]] stars. These were probably very massive, luminous, [[metallicity|non metallic]] and short-lived. They were responsible for the gradual [[reionization]] of the Universe between about 200-500 million years and 1 billion years, and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium, through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Scientific American | title= The First Stars in the Universe |author1=Richard B. Larson  |author2=Volker Bromm  |lastauthoramp=yes | date=March 2002 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-first-stars-in-the-un/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universe also contains a mysterious energy - possibly a [[scalar field]] - called [[dark energy]], the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present [[dark-energy-dominated era]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33&lt;/ref&gt; In this era, the expansion of the Universe is [[accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]] due to dark energy.

Of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s, [[gravitation]] is the dominant at astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the [[weak nuclear force|weak]] and [[strong nuclear force]]s, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

The Universe appears to have much more [[matter]] than [[antimatter]], an asymmetry possibly related to the [[CP violation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 28, 2003 |url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |title=Antimatter |publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council |accessdate=August 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307075727/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |archivedate=March 7, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today, since matter and antimatter, if equally produced at the [[Big Bang]], would have completely annihilated each other and left only [[photon]]s as a result of their interaction.&lt;ref name="TT-20171025"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adamson |first=Allan |title=Universe Should Not Actually Exist: Big Bang Produced Equal Amounts Of Matter And Antimatter |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/214821/20171025/universe-should-not-actually-exist-big-bang-produced-equal-amounts-of-matter-and-antimatter.htm |date=19 October 2017 |work=TechTimes.com |accessdate=26 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20171020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smorra C. et al. |title=A parts-per-billion measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment |url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v550/n7676/full/nature24048.html |date=20 October 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=550 |issue=7676 |pages=371–74 |doi=10.1038/nature24048 |pmid=29052625 |accessdate=26 October 2017 |bibcode=2017Natur.550..371S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universe also appears to have neither net [[momentum]] nor [[angular momentum]], which follows accepted physical laws if the Universe is finite.

Consequently, the sum of the charges on the two sides of the surface is zero."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size and regions ===
{{See also|Observable universe|Observational cosmology}}
The size of the Universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to the general theory of relativity, far regions of [[space]] may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite [[speed of light]] and the ongoing [[expansion of space]]. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.&lt;ref name="Kaku2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ube-MQcFFZQC&amp;pg=PA202|date=March 11, 2008|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0385525442|pages=202–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are, even though we can never interact with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the [[observable universe]]. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.&lt;!-- [[Hubble's law]] links to this section --&gt;

=== Age and expansion ===
{{Main|Age of the universe|Metric expansion of space}}
Astronomers calculate the [[age of the Universe]] by assuming that the [[Lambda-CDM model]] accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (satellite)|Planck]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for [[Type Ia supernovae]], and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Assuming that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the age of the Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 [[Measurement uncertainty|±]] 0.021 billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;

Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been [[redshift]]ed; the [[photon]]s emitted have been stretched to longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency]] during their journey.

The more matter there is in the Universe, the stronger the mutual [[gravitational]] pull of the matter. If the Universe were ''too'' dense then it would re-collapse into a [[gravitational singularity]]. However, if the Universe contained too ''little'' matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures, like galaxies or planets, to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded [[monotonic]]ally. [[Anthropic principle#Anthropic coincidences|Perhaps unsurprisingly]], our universe has [[Critical Mass Density of the Universe|just the right mass-energy density]], equivalent to about 5 protons per cubic meter, which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | author=[[Sean Carroll (physicist)|Sean Carroll]] and [[Michio Kaku]] | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | date=2014 | publisher=Discovery Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe; and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the [[deceleration parameter]], which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative, approximately -0.55, which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic [[scale factor cosmology|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a}&lt;/math&gt; has been positive in the last 5-6 billion years.&lt;ref name="nobel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A 'Cosmic Jerk' That Reversed the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/us/a-cosmic-jerk-that-reversed-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceleration does not, however, imply that the Hubble parameter is currently increasing; see [[deceleration parameter]] for details.

Spacetimes are the arenas in which all physical events take place. The basic elements of spacetimes are [[event (relativity)|events]]. In any given spacetime, an event is defined as a unique position at a unique time. A spacetime is the union of all events (in the same way that a line is the union of all of its points), formally organized into a [[manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The Universe appears to be a smooth spacetime continuum consisting of three [[space|spatial]] [[dimension]]s and one temporal ([[time]]) dimension (an event in the spacetime of the physical Universe can therefore be identified by a set of four coordinates: {{nowrap begin}}(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t''){{nowrap end}} ). On the average, [[3-space|space]] is observed to be very nearly [[Shape of the universe|flat]] (with a [[curvature]] close to zero), meaning that [[Euclidean geometry]] is empirically true with high accuracy throughout most of the Universe.&lt;ref name="Shape"&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/mr_content.html WMAP Mission: Results&amp;nbsp;– Age of the Universe]. Map.gsfc.nasa.gov. Retrieved November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Spacetime also appears to have a [[simply connected space|simply connected]] [[topology]], in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions (which is postulated by theories such as the [[String theory]]) and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or [[toroid]]al topologies of two-dimensional [[space]]s.&lt;ref name="Nat03"&gt;{{cite journal

The spacetime of the Universe is usually interpreted from a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] perspective, with space as consisting of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], and time as consisting of [[one dimension]], the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10714-006-0254-9 | bibcode=2006GReGr..38..643B | arxiv=gr-qc/0407022 | title=Spacetime and Euclidean geometry | journal= General Relativity and Gravitation | volume=38 | issue=4 | year=2006 | pages=643–51 | last1=Brill | first1=Dieter | last2=Jacobsen | first2=Ted| citeseerx=10.1.1.338.7953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining space and time into a single [[manifold]] called [[Minkowski space]], physicists have simplified a large number of [[Theoretical physics|physical theories]], as well as described in a more uniform way the workings of the Universe at both the [[Physical cosmology|supergalactic]] and [[quantum mechanics|subatomic]] levels.

Spacetime [[event (relativity)|events]] are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally but rather are known to be relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. Minkowski space approximates the Universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity.

=== Shape ===
{{Main|Shape of the universe}}
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|250px|The three possible options for the shape of the Universe]]

General relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy (gravity). The [[topology]] or [[geometry]] of the Universe includes both [[Shape of the universe#Local geometry (spatial curvature)|local geometry]] in the [[observable universe]] and [[Shape of the universe#Global geometry|global geometry]].
Cosmologists often work with a given [[space-like]] slice of spacetime called the [[Comoving distance|comoving coordinates]]. The section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward [[light cone]], which delimits the [[cosmological horizon]].
The cosmological horizon (also called the particle horizon or the light horizon) is the maximum distance from which [[Elementary particle|particles]] can have traveled to the [[observation|observer]] in the [[age of the Universe]]. This horizon represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the Universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robert Harrison|title=Cosmology: the science of the universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&amp;pg=PA447|accessdate=May 1, 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521661485|pages=447–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew R.

An important parameter determining the future evolution of the Universe theory is the [[density parameter]], Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible [[Shape of the universe|geometries]] depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.&lt;ref name=FateOfTheUniverse&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe?|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html|website=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations, including the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE), [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP), and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] maps of the CMB, suggest that the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] (FLRW) models.&lt;ref name="nasa_popular_uni_curv"&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html Will the Universe expand forever?], WMAP website at NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RBSG08"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Roukema|first =Boudewijn|author2=Zbigniew Buliński |author3=Agnieszka Szaniewska |author4=Nicolas E.

=== Support of life ===
{{main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
The Universe may be ''fine-tuned''; the Fine-tuned Universe hypothesis is the proposition that the conditions that allow the existence of observable [[life]] in the Universe can only occur when certain universal [[physical constant|fundamental physical constants]] lie within a very narrow range of values, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would have been unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of [[matter]], astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood.&lt;ref name=toa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI301.html |title=CI301: The Anthropic Principle |accessdate=October 31, 2007 |author=Mark Isaak (ed.) |date=2005 |work=Index to Creationist Claims |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition is discussed among [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[science|scientists]], [[theology|theologians]], and proponents of [[creationism]].

Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to [[vacuum energy]]. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant.

=== Dark matter ===
{{main|Dark matter}}
Dark matter is a hypothetical kind of [[matter]] that is invisible to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], but which accounts for most of the matter in the Universe. The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] of the Universe. Other than [[neutrinos]], a form of [[hot dark matter]], dark matter has not been detected directly, making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern [[astrophysics]]. Dark matter neither [[blackbody spectrum|emits]] nor absorbs light or any other [[electromagnetic radiation]] at any significant level. Dark matter is estimated to constitute 26.8% of the total mass–energy and 84.5% &lt;!--26.8/(4.9 + 26.8)--&gt; of the total matter in the Universe.&lt;ref name = DarkMatter&gt;Sean Carroll, Ph.D., Caltech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 p. 46, Accessed October 7, 2013, "...dark matter: An invisible, essentially collisionless component of matter that makes up about 25 percent of the energy density of the universe... it's a different kind of particle... something not yet observed in the laboratory..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=planckcam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/planck-captures-portrait-of-the-young-universe-revealing-earliest-light |title=Planck captures portrait of the young Universe, revealing earliest light |date=March 21, 2013 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ordinary Matter ===
{{main|Matter}}
The remaining 4.9% of the mass–energy of the Universe is ordinary matter, that is, [[atom]]s, [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s and the objects they form. This matter includes [[star]]s, which produce nearly all of the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] and [[intergalactic medium|intergalactic]] media, [[planet]]s, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze.&lt;ref name=Davies2&gt;

Ordinary matter commonly exists in four [[state of matter|states]] (or [[phase (matter)|phases]]): [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. However, advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s and [[fermionic condensate]]s.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the proton is formed of two [[up quarks]] and one [[down quark]]; the neutron is formed of two down quarks and one up quark; and the electron is a kind of lepton. An atom consists of an [[atomic nucleus]], made up of protons and neutrons, and electrons that orbit the nucleus. Because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which is made up of [[baryons]], astronomers often use the term ''baryonic matter'' to describe ordinary matter, although a small fraction of this "baryonic matter" is electrons.

Soon after the [[Big Bang]], primordial protons and neutrons formed from the [[quark–gluon plasma]] of the early Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in a process known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]], but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some [[boron]] may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, [[carbon]], was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of [[metallicity|heavier elements]] resulted from [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Clayton1983&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Donald D.|title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis|date=1983|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226109534|pages=362–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hadrons ====
{{Main|Hadron}}
A hadron is a [[composite particle]] made of [[quark]]s [[bound state|held together]] by the [[strong force]]. Hadrons are categorized into two families: [[baryon]]s (such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) made of three quarks, and [[meson]]s (such as [[pion]]s) made of one quark and one [[antiparticle|antiquark]]. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.
From approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]], during a period is known as the [[hadron epoch]], the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by [[hadron]]s. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.&lt;ref name=Allday2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allday|first1=Jonathan|title=Quarks, Leptons and the Big Bang|date=2002|publisher=IOP Publishing|isbn=978-0750308069|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

==== Leptons ====
{{main|Lepton}}
A lepton is an [[elementary particle|elementary]], [[half-integer spin]] particle that does not undergo strong interactions but is subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classes of leptons exist: [[electric charge|charged]] leptons (also known as the ''electron-like'' leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as [[neutrino]]s). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the Universe, whereas [[muon]]s and [[tau (particle)|taus]] are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in [[high energy physics|high energy]] collisions, such as those involving [[cosmic ray]]s or carried out in [[particle accelerator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various [[composite particle]]s such as [[atom]]s and [[positronium]]. The [[electron]] governs nearly all of [[chemistry]], as it is found in [[atom]]s and is directly tied to all [[chemical property|chemical properties]].

The [[lepton epoch]] was the period in the evolution of the early Universe in which the [[lepton]]s dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the [[Big Bang]], after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the [[hadron epoch]]. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermal history of the Universe and early growth of density fluctuations|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~gamk/TUM_Lectures/Lecture4.pdf|work=Guinevere Kauffmann|publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons.

==== Photons ====
{{Main|Photon epoch}}
{{See also|Photino}}
A photon is the [[quantum]] of [[light]] and all other forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is the [[force carrier]] for the [[electromagnetic force]], even when [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static]] via [[virtual photons]]. The effects of this [[force]] are easily observable at the [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and at the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] level because the photon has zero [[rest mass]]; this allows long distance [[fundamental interaction|interactions]]. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by [[quantum mechanics]] and exhibit [[wave–particle duality]], exhibiting properties of [[wave]]s and of [[wikt:particle|particles]].

The photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were [[annihilation|annihilated]] at the end of the lepton epoch, about 10 seconds after the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the remainder of the photon epoch the Universe contained a hot dense [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of nuclei, electrons and photons. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms. As a result, photons no longer interacted frequently with matter and the Universe became transparent. The highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave background. Tiny variations in temperature and density detectable in the CMB were the early "seeds" from which all subsequent [[structure formation]] took place.&lt;ref name=Allday2002/&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

== Cosmological models ==
=== Model of the Universe based on general relativity ===
{{main|Solutions of the Einstein field equations}}
{{See also|Big Bang|Ultimate fate of the Universe}}
[[General relativity]] is the [[Differential geometry|geometric]] [[Theoretical physics|theory]] of [[gravitation]] published by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in [[modern physics]]. It is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes [[special relativity]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[Time in physics|time]], or spacetime. In particular, the [[curvature]] of spacetime is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the [[acceleration]] of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt;

With the assumption of the [[cosmological principle]] that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, a specific solution of the field equations that describes the Universe is the [[metric tensor]] called the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]],
:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = -c^{2} dt^2 +
R(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where (''r'', θ, φ) correspond to a [[spherical coordinate system]]. This [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] has only two undetermined parameters. An overall [[dimensionless]] length [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''R'' describes the size scale of the Universe as a function of time; an increase in ''R'' is the [[expansion of the Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A curvature index ''k'' describes the geometry. The index ''k'' is defined so that it can take only one of three values: 0, corresponding to flat [[Euclidean geometry]]; 1, corresponding to a space of positive [[curvature]]; or −1, corresponding to a space of positive or negative curvature.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66" /&gt; The value of ''R'' as a function of time ''t'' depends upon ''k'' and the [[cosmological constant]] ''Λ''.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |last1=Zeilik |first1=Michael |last2=Gregory |first2=Stephen A. |date=1998 |edition=4th |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0030062285 | section=25-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; The equation describing how ''R'' varies with time is known as the [[Friedmann equation]] after its inventor, [[Alexander Friedmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Friedmann A.|date = 1922|title = Über die Krümmung des Raumes|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 377–86|doi = 10.1007/BF01332580|bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F|authorlink = Alexander Friedmann|url=http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/16735/E001554876.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solutions for ''R(t)'' depend on ''k'' and ''Λ'', but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale ''R'' of the Universe can remain constant ''only'' if the Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (''k''=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt; However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe is known to be inhomogeneous on smaller scales, ''R'' must change over time. When ''R'' changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and never moved faster than the [[speed of light]].

Second, all solutions suggest that there was a [[gravitational singularity]] in the past, when ''R'' went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, ''R'' grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when ''R'' had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the [[Big Bang]] model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a [[quantum theory of gravity]], which has not yet been formulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=122–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the curvature index ''k'' determines the sign of the mean spatial curvature of spacetime&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion [[light year]]s). If ''k''=1, the curvature is positive and the Universe has a finite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70" /&gt; A Universe with positive curvature is often visualized as a [[3-sphere|three-dimensional sphere]] embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if ''k'' is zero or negative, the Universe has an infinite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when ''R''=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when ''k'' does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a [[torus]] is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with [[periodic boundary conditions]].

The [[ultimate fate of the Universe]] is still unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index ''k'' and the cosmological constant ''Λ''. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a [[Big Crunch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly starting a new Universe in a [[Big Bounce]]. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the [[Future of an expanding universe|Big Freeze]] and the [[heat death of the Universe]].&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt; Modern data suggests that the rate of expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a [[Big Rip]]. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (''k'' = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=88, 110–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speculative theories have proposed that our Universe is but one of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]], challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe.&lt;ref name="EllisKS032"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Munitz MK|date = 1959|title = One Universe or Many?|journal = Journal of the History of Ideas|volume = 12|pages = 231–55|doi = 10.2307/2707516|issue = 2|jstor = 2707516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as [[plane (esotericism)|alternate planes of consciousness]] and [[simulated reality]].

[[Max Tegmark]] developed a four-part [[Multiverse#Max Tegmark's four levels|classification scheme]] for the different types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in response to various [[Physics]] problems. An example of such multiverses is the one resulting from the [[bubble universe theory|chaotic inflation]] model of the early universe.&lt;ref name="chaotic_inflation"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Linde A.|date = 1986|title = Eternal chaotic inflation|journal = Mod.

In this interpretation, parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to [[quantum superposition]] and [[decoherence]], with all states of the [[wave function]]s being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, in the many-worlds interpretation the multiverse evolves as a [[universal wavefunction]]. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.&lt;ref name=everett1957&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Everett | first1 = Hugh | authorlink = Hugh Everett | year = 1957 | title = Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 454–62 |bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..454E |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The least controversial category of multiverse in Tegmark's scheme is [[Multiverse#Level I: An extension of our Universe|Level I]]. The multiverses of this level are composed by distant spacetime events "in our own universe". If space is infinite, or sufficiently large and uniform, identical instances of the history of Earth's entire [[Hubble volume]] occur every so often, simply by chance.

Historically, there have been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by physical laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt; Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gernet|first = J.|date = 1993–1994|title=Space and time: Science and religion in the encounter between China and Europe|journal=Chinese Science|volume=11|pages=93–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Ng|first=Tai|title=Chinese Culture, Western Culture: Why Must We Learn from Each Other?|chapter=III.3|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1915 [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name="Blandford"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A century of general relativity: Astrophysics and cosmology|author=Blandford R.

=== Mythologies ===
{{Main|Creation myth|Creator deity|Religious cosmology}}
Many cultures have [[List of creation myths|stories describing the origin of the world and universe]]. Cultures generally regard these stories as having some [[truth]]. There are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin, ranging from a god directly creating the Universe as it is now to a god just setting the "wheels in motion" (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote="In common usage the word 'myth' refers to narratives or beliefs that are untrue or merely fanciful; the stories that make up national or ethnic mythologies describe characters and events that common sense and experience tell us are impossible. Nevertheless, all cultures celebrate such myths and attribute to them various degrees of literal or symbolic ''truth''." | last=Leeming | first=David A. | isbn=978-1598841749 | date=2010|page=xvii | title= Creation Myths of the World | publisher= ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have developed various classification schemes for the various themes that appear in creation stories.&lt;ref name=Eliade1964&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myth and Reality (Religious Traditions of the World)|date=1964|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-0042910017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Scott A.|last2=McClure|first2=Michael|title=Myth and Knowing: An Introduction to World Mythology|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0767419574|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a [[world egg]]; such stories include the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Kalevala]]'', the [[China|Chinese]] story of [[Pangu]] or the [[History of India|Indian]] [[Brahmanda Purana]]. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the [[Tibetan Buddhism]] concept of [[Adi-Buddha]], the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth), the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] goddess [[Coatlicue]] myth, the [[ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian]] [[Ennead|god]] [[Atum]] story, and the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Genesis creation narrative]] in which the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]] created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union of male and female deities, as in the [[Maori mythology|Maori story]] of [[Rangi and Papa]]. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god&amp;nbsp;— as from [[Tiamat]] in the [[Babylon]]ian epic ''[[Enuma Elish]]'' or from the giant [[Ymir]] in [[Norse mythology]]&amp;nbsp;– or from chaotic materials, as in [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] in [[Japanese mythology]]. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as [[Brahman]] and [[Prakrti]], the [[Serer creation myth|creation myth]] of the [[Serer people|Serers]],&lt;ref&gt;([[Henry Gravrand]], "La civilisation Sereer -Pangool") [in] [[Universität Frankfurt am Main]], Frobenius-Institut, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie, Frobenius Gesellschaft, "Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Volumes 43–44", F. Steiner (1997), pp. 144–45, {{ISBN|3515028420}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[yin and yang]] of the [[Tao]].

=== Philosophical models ===
{{Further|Cosmology}}
{{See also|Pre-Socratic philosophy|Physics (Aristotle)|Hindu cosmology|Islamic cosmology|Philosophy of space and time}}
The [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic Greek philosophers]] and Indian philosophers developed some of the earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unfinished Universe|page=21|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=Louise|last=B. Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or ''[[arche]]''. The first to do so was [[Thales]], who proposed this material to be [[Water (classical element)|water]]. Thales' student, [[Anaximander]], proposed that everything came from the limitless ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''. [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] proposed the primordial material to be [[Air (classical element)|air]] on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the ''arche'' to condense or dissociate into different forms. [[Anaxagoras]] proposed the principle of ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), while [[Heraclitus]] proposed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] (and spoke of ''[[logos]]''). [[Empedocles]] proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] believed that all things were composed of [[number]], with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the [[Platonic solids]]. [[Democritus]], and later philosophers—most notably [[Leucippus]]—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible [[atom]]s moving through a [[void (astronomy)|void]] ([[vacuum]]), although [[Aristotle]] did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers [[Drag (physics)|resistance to motion]]. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his contemporary [[Parmenides]] made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature. Parmenides denoted this reality as {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐν}} (The One). Parmenides' idea seemed implausible to many Greeks, but his student [[Zeno of Elea]] challenged them with several famous [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity, as well as the infinitely divisible continuum. Unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time, he believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and that cumulative stellar magnitude is only finitely multiplicative.

The [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], founder of the [[Vaisheshika]] school, developed a notion of [[atomism]] and proposed that [[light]] and [[heat]] were varieties of the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]], ''Our Oriental Heritage'': {{quote|"Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika philosophy, held that the world is composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements. The [[Jainism|Jains]] more nearly approximated to [[Democritus]] by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations. Kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance; [[Udayana]] taught that all heat comes from the Sun; and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vachaspati]], like [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD, the [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atomist]] philosopher [[Dignāga]] proposed [[atom]]s to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Stcherbatsky, F. Th. (1930, 1962), ''Buddhist Logic'', Volume 1, p. 19, Dover, New York: {{quote|"The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... "Everything is evanescent",... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff... Both systems &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Samkhya|Sānkhya]], and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called "qualities" (''guna-dharma'') in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality,... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called ''guna'', "quality", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called ''dharmas'' ('qualities')."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of [[temporal finitism]] was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]], [[John Philoponus]], presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]], [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus); the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]] (Saadia ben Joseph); and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]], [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel).&lt;ref name=Viney1985&gt;{{cite book|title=Charles Hartshorne and the Existence of God|chapter=The Cosmological Argument|author=Donald Wayne Viney|pages=65–68|year=1985|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0873959070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomical concepts ===
{{Main|History of astronomy|Timeline of astronomy}}
[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus's]] 3rd century BCE calculations on the relative sizes of, from left to right, the Sun, Earth, and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy.]]

Astronomical models of the Universe were proposed soon after [[astronomy]] began with the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]], who viewed the Universe as a [[Flat Earth|flat disk]] floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].

Later [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were concerned with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on [[empirical evidence]]. The first coherent model was proposed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidos]]. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, [[celestial spheres]] eternally [[uniform circular motion|rotate with uniform motion]] around a stationary Earth. Normal [[classical elements|matter]] is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.

''[[De Mundo]]'' (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC), stated, "Five elements, situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater—namely, earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by ether—make up the whole Universe".&lt;ref name=1908DeMundo&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/demundoarisrich|title=De Mundo|year=1914|author=Aristotle; Forster, E. S. (Edward Seymour), 1879–1950; Dobson, J. F. (John Frederic), 1875–1947|page=2|publisher=Oxford : The Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model was also refined by [[Callippus]] and after concentric spheres were abandoned, it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by [[Ptolemy]]. The success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]]). Other Greek scientists, such as the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean]] philosopher [[Philolaus]], postulated (according to [[Stobaeus]] account) that at the center of the Universe was a "central fire" around which the [[Earth]], [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[Planet]]s revolved in uniform circular motion.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. (1968) [https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics ''A History of Mathematics'']. Wiley, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known individual to propose a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the Universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in [[Archimedes]]' book ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' describes Aristarchus's heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You, King Gelon, are aware the Universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the Universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why [[stellar parallax]] had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from [[Plutarch]] suggests (''On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Cleanthes]] [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the [[Stoics]]] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe [i.e. the Earth], ... supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the Earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a [[Hellenistic astronomer]] who lived a century after Aristarchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Otto E.

Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of [[tide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''Flussi e riflussi'', Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, {{ISBN|8807103494}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Strabo]] (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987|loc=p. 527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a [[Geometry|geometric]] model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] later did in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987| loc=pp. 527–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] models were also proposed by the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] [[Aryabhata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987 | loc=pp. 529–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Islamic astronomy|Persian astronomers]] [[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Albumasar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987 | loc=pp. 534–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al-Sijzi]].&lt;ref name=Nasr&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nasr |first=Seyyed H. |authorlink=Hossein Nasr |origyear=1964 |date=1993 |title=An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines |edition=2nd |publisher=1st edition by [[Harvard University Press]], 2nd edition by [[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=978-0791415153 |pages=135–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|thumb|left|[[Copernican heliocentrism|Model of the Copernican Universe]] by [[Thomas Digges]] in 1576, with the amendment that the stars are no longer confined to a sphere, but spread uniformly throughout the space surrounding the [[planet]]s.]]

The Aristotelian model was accepted in the [[Western world]] for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the [[Earth]] rotated on its axis and if the [[Sun]] were placed at the center of the Universe.

{{quote|In the center rests the Sun. For who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time?|Nicolaus Copernicus| in Chapter 10, Book 1 of ''De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestrum'' (1543)}}

As noted by Copernicus himself, the notion that the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] is very old, dating at least to [[Philolaus]] (c. 450 BC), [[Heraclides Ponticus]] (c. 350 BC) and [[Ecphantus the Pythagorean]]. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar [[Nicholas of Cusa]] also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, ''On Learned Ignorance'' (1440).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Misner|Misner, Thorne and Wheeler]], p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Sijzi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science in the Quran|volume=1|publisher=Malik Library|first=Ema Ākabara|last=Ālī|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. [[Empirical research|Empirical evidence]] for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of [[comet]]s, was given by [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]] (1201–1274) and [[Ali Qushji]] (1403–1474).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ragep |first=F.

In 1919, when [[Hooker Telescope]] was completed, the prevailing view still was that the Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, [[Edwin Hubble]] identified [[Cepheid variable]]s in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] and [[Triangulum Nebula|Triangulum]] among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.&lt;ref name="SharovNovikov1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharov|first1=Aleksandr Sergeevich|last2=Novikov|first2=Igor Dmitrievich|title=Edwin Hubble, the discoverer of the big bang universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttEwkEdPc70C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=December 31, 2011|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521416177|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
