'''Alan John Percivale Taylor''' {{postnom|FBA}} (25 March 1906&amp;nbsp;– 7 September 1990) was an English [[historian]] who specialised in 19th- and 20th-century European [[diplomacy]]. Both a journalist and a broadcaster, he became well known to millions through his television lectures. His combination of academic rigour and popular appeal led the historian [[Richard Overy]] to describe him as "the [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] of our age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Riddle Radical Ridicule |author=[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |date=30 January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early life===
Taylor was born in 1906 in [[Birkdale]], [[Southport]], which was then part of [[Lancashire]]. His wealthy parents held [[left-wing]] views, which he inherited. Both his parents, Percy Lees and Constance Sumner (Thompson) Taylor, were pacifists who vocally opposed the [[First World War]], and sent their son to [[Quaker]] schools as a way of protesting against the war. These schools included [[The Downs Malvern|The Downs School]] at [[Colwall]] and [[Bootham School]] in [[York]].&lt;ref name=wrigley&gt;Wrigley 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff|publisher=Bootham Old Scholars Association (BOSA)|title=Bootham School Register|place=York, England|year=2011|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb1&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, A. F.|chapter=A. J. P. Taylor|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biographies]], Volume 53|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=858–59|isbn=0-19-861403-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Geoffrey Barraclough]], a contemporary at [[Bootham School]], remembered Taylor as "a most arresting, stimulating, vital personality, violently anti-bourgeois and anti-Christian".&lt;ref name=burk&gt;Burk 2000, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, he went to [[Oriel College, Oxford]], to study modern history.

In the 1920s, Taylor's mother, Constance, was a member of the [[Comintern]] while one of his uncles was a founder member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Constance was a [[suffragette]], [[feminism|feminist]], and advocate of [[free love]] who practised her teachings via a string of extramarital affairs, most notably with [[Henry Sara]], a communist who in many ways became Taylor's surrogate father. Taylor has mentioned in his reminiscences that his mother was domineering, but his father enjoyed exasperating her by following his own ways. Taylor had a close relationship with his father, and enjoyed his father's quirkiness. Taylor himself was recruited into the Communist Party of Great Britain by a friend of the family, the military historian [[Tom Wintringham]], while at Oriel; a member from 1924 to 1926, he broke with the Party over what he considered to be its ineffective stand during the [[UK General Strike of 1926|1926 General Strike]]. After leaving, he was an ardent supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for the rest of his life, remaining a member for over sixty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Old Man's Diary |author=Taylor, A. J. P.|year= 1984 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his break with the Communist Party, he visited the Soviet Union in 1925, and again in 1934.

===Academic career===
Taylor graduated from Oxford in 1927. After working briefly as a legal clerk, he began his post-graduate work, going to [[Vienna]] to study the impact of the [[Chartist movement]] on the [[Revolution of 1848]]. When this topic turned out not to be feasible, he switched to studying the question of [[Italian unification]] over a two-year period. This resulted in his first book, ''The Italian Problem in European Diplomacy, 1847–49'' published in 1934.&lt;ref name=burk /&gt;

===Manchester years===
Taylor lectured in history at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] from 1930 to 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/subjects/history/our-people/former-historians/taylor/ "Our History"] [[University of Manchester]] website&lt;/ref&gt; He came with his wife to live firstly in an unfurnished flat (before they could get a furnished one) at the top floor of an eighteenth-century house opposite the entrance to [[Didsbury Park]] called The Limes at 148 Wilmslow Road at the southern end of Didsbury village and set back from the street (still there in 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Burk 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
===Oxford years===
He became a Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], in 1938, a post he held until 1976. He also lectured in modern history at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] from 1938 to 1963. At Oxford he was such an extraordinarily popular speaker he had to give his lectures at 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to avoid the room becoming over-crowded. 

In 1962, Taylor wrote in a review of ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-1849'' by Cecil Woodham-Smith that: "All Ireland was a Belsen...The English governing class ran true to form. They had killed two million Irish people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor added that if the death rate from the Irish Potato Famine was not higher it "was not for want of trying" on the part of the British government, writing: "I have always felt a certain horror of political economists since I heard one of them say that the Famine in Ireland would not kill more than a million people, and that would scarcely be enough to do much good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor later reprinted his book review under the stark title "Genocide" in  his 1976 book ''Essays in English History''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, when Oxford refused to renew his term as lecturer in the aftermath of the controversy occasioned by ''The Origins of the Second World War'', he became a lecturer at the [[Institute of Historical Research]] in London, [[University College London]], and the [[University of North London|Polytechnic of North London]].

An important step in Taylor's "rehabilitation" was a ''[[festschrift]]'' organised in his honour by [[Martin Gilbert]] in 1965. He was honoured with two more ''festschriften'', in 1976 and 1986. The ''festschriften'' were testaments to his popularity with his former students as receiving even a single ''festschrift'' is considered to be an extraordinary and rare honour.

===Second World War===
During the [[Second World War]], Taylor served in the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] and befriended émigré statesmen from [[Eastern Europe]], such as the former Hungarian President Count [[Mihály Károlyi]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] President [[Edvard Beneš]]. These friendships helped to enhance his understanding of the region. His friendship with Beneš and Károlyi may help explain his friendly portrayal of them, in particular Károlyi, whom Taylor portrayed as a saintly figure. Taylor became friends with Hubert Ripka, the press attache for Beneš, who lived in Oxford, and through him, got to know President Beneš who lived in London.{{sfn|Burk|2001|p=236}} Taylor wrote that because Beneš was a President, "he was not allowed to brave the front line in London and had to live in a sovereign state at Aston Abbots-a Rothschild house of, for them, a modest standard. Bored and isolated, Beneš summoned an audience whatever he could and I was often swept over to Aston Abbots in the presidential car".{{sfn|Burk|2001|p=236}} In 1943, Taylor wrote his first pamphlet, ''Czechoslovakia's Place in a Free Europe'', explaining his view that Czechoslovakia would after the war serve as a "bridge" between the Western world and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Burk|2001|p=236}} ''Czechoslovakia's Place in a Free Europe'' began as a lecture Taylor had given at the Czechoslovak Institute in London on 29 April 1943 and at the suggestion of Jan Masaryk was turned into a pamphlet to explain Czechoslovakia's situation to the British people.{{sfn|Burk|2001|p=236}} Taylor argued that the Czechoslovaks would have to "explain" to the Soviets and "explain" socialism to the British, saying: "You must appear to the English people as communists and to the Russians as democrats and therefore receive nothing, but abuse from both sides".{{sfn|Burk|2001|p=236}} ''Czechoslovakia's Place in a Free Europe'' reflected Beneš's theory of "convergence" as he felt based on what he was seeing in wartime Britain that the western nations would become socialist after the war while the Soviet Union would become more democratic. In 1945, Taylor wrote: "Beck, Stojadinović, Antonescu, and Bonnet despised Beneš's integrity and prided themselves on their cunning; but their countries, too, fell before the German aggressor, and every step they took has made the resurrection of their countries more difficult. In contrast, the foreign policy of Dr. Beneš during the present war has won Czechoslovakia a secure future".{{sfn|Lukes|1996|p=159}} During the same period, Taylor was employed by the [[Political Warfare Executive]] as an expert on Central Europe and frequently spoke on the radio and at various public meetings. During the war, he lobbied for British recognition of [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] as the legitimate government of [[Yugoslavia]].

===Move from Oxford to London===
In 1964, while he retained his college fellowship, the University of Oxford declined to renew Taylor's appointment as a university lecturer in modern history. This apparently sudden decision came in the aftermath of the controversy around his book ''The Origins of the Second World War''. Moving to London, he became a lecturer at the [[Institute of Historical Research]] at [[University College London]] and also at the [[University of North London|Polytechnic of North London]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;Bernstein, Richard (September 8, 1990) [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/08/obituaries/ajp-taylor-british-historian-dies.html "A.J.P. Taylor, British Historian, Dies"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation from British Academy===

In 1979, Taylor resigned in protest from the [[British Academy]] over its dismissal of [[Anthony Blunt]], who had been exposed as a [[Soviet]] spy. Taylor took the position that:&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

{{bquote|It's none of our business, as a group of scholars, to consider matters of this sort. The academy's only concern should be his scholarly credentials, which are unaffected by all this.}}

===Personal life===
Taylor married three times. He married his first wife, Margaret Adams, in 1931 (divorced in 1951) and with her he had four children. For a time in the 1930s, he and his wife shared a house with the writer [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] and his wife [[Kitty Muggeridge|Kitty]]. It was suggested that he had had an affair with Kitty Muggeridge.

Taylor lived for a while in [[Disley]], [[Cheshire]], where [[Dylan Thomas]] (who was his first wife's lover) was his guest; he later provided Thomas with a cottage in [[Oxford]] so that he could recover from a breakdown. His second wife was Eve Crosland, whom Taylor married in 1951 and divorced in 1974; he had two children by her. Even after divorcing Margaret Adams, Taylor continued to live with her, while maintaining a household with Eve. His third wife was the Hungarian historian Éva Haraszti, whom he married in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. J. P. (1983) ''A Personal History''. London: Hamish Hamilton. p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===''The Italian Problem in European Diplomacy, 1847–49''===
Taylor's first book, published in 1934, addressed the question of Italian unification ''The Italian Problem in European Diplomacy, 1847–49'' . However, Taylor's speciality was in Central European, [[History of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[diplomatic history]]. He was especially interested in the [[Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]. His main mentors in this period were the Austrian-born historian [[Alfred Francis Pribram]] and the Polish-born historian Sir [[Lewis Bernstein Namier]]. Taylor's earlier writings reflected Pribram's favourable opinion of the Habsburgs; however, his 1941 book ''The Habsburg Monarchy 1809–1918'' (published in a revised edition in 1948) showed the influence of Namier's unfavourable views. In ''The Habsburg Monarchy'', Taylor stated that the Habsburgs saw their realms entirely as a tool for foreign policy and thus could never build a genuine nation-state. To hold their realm together, they resorted to playing one ethnic group off against another and promoted [[German people|German]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] hegemony over the other ethnic groups in [[Austria-Hungary]].

===''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848–1918''===
In 1954 he published his masterpiece, ''[[The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848–1918]]'' and followed it up with ''The Trouble Makers'' in 1957, a critical study of British foreign policy. ''The Trouble Makers'' was a celebration of those who had criticised the government over foreign policy, a subject dear to his heart. ''The Trouble Makers'' had originally been the [[Ford Lectures]] in 1955 and was his favourite book by far. When invited to deliver the Ford Lectures, he was initially at a loss for a topic, and it was his friend [[Alan Bullock]] who suggested the topic of foreign policy dissent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Addison|Addison, Paul]] (1993) "Introduction" to Taylor, A. J. P. ''The Troublemakers'' Pimlico. {{ISBN|0-7126-5922-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bismarck: The Man and the Statesman''===
The recurring theme of accidents deciding history appeared in Taylor's best-selling 1955 biography of Bismarck. Taylor controversially argued that the Iron Chancellor had unified Germany more by accident than by design; a theory that contradicted those put forward by the historians [[Heinrich von Sybel]], [[Leopold von Ranke]], and [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] in the latter years of the 19th century, and by other historians more recently.

===''The Origins of the Second World War''===
In 1961, he published his most controversial book, ''[[The Origins of the Second World War]]'', which earned him a reputation as a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]].&lt;ref name=martel&gt;Martel 1999, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Martel]] notes that "it made a profound impact. The book became a classic and a central point of reference in all discussion on the Second World War."&lt;ref name=martel /&gt;

In the book Taylor argued against the widespread belief that the outbreak of the Second World War (specifically between Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom and France, September 1939) was the result of an intentional plan on the part of [[Adolf Hitler]]. He began his book with the statement that too many people have accepted uncritically what he called the "Nuremberg Thesis", that the Second World War was the result of criminal conspiracy by a small gang comprising Hitler and his associates. He regarded the "Nuremberg Thesis" as too convenient for too many people and held that it shielded the blame for the war from the leaders of other states, let the German people avoid any responsibility for the war and created a situation where West Germany was a respectable [[Cold War]] ally against the Soviets.

Taylor's thesis was that Hitler was not the demoniacal figure of popular imagination but in foreign affairs a normal German leader. Citing [[Fritz Fischer]], he argued that the foreign policy of the [[Third Reich]] was the same as those of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[German Empire|Second Reich]]. Moreover, in a partial break with his view of [[History of Germany|German history]] advocated in ''[[The Course of German History]]'', he argued that Hitler was not just a normal German leader but also a normal Western leader. As a normal Western leader, Hitler was no better or worse than [[Gustav Stresemann]], [[Neville Chamberlain]] or [[Édouard Daladier]]. His argument was that Hitler wished to make Germany the strongest power in Europe but he did not want or plan war. The outbreak of war in 1939 was an unfortunate accident caused by mistakes on everyone's part and was not a part of Hitler's plan.

Notably, Taylor portrayed Hitler as a grasping opportunist with no beliefs other than the pursuit of power and [[anti-Semitism]]. He argued that Hitler did not possess any sort of programme and his foreign policy was one of drift and seizing chances as they offered themselves. He did not even consider Hitler's anti-Semitism unique: he argued that millions of Germans were just as ferociously anti-Semitic as Hitler and there was no reason to single out Hitler for sharing the beliefs of millions of others.

Taylor argued that the basic problem with an interwar Europe was a flawed [[Treaty of Versailles]] that was sufficiently onerous to ensure that the overwhelming majority of Germans would always hate it, but insufficiently onerous in that it failed to destroy Germany's potential to be a Great Power once more. In this way, Taylor argued that the Versailles Treaty was destabilising, for sooner or later the innate power of Germany that the Allies had declined to destroy in 1918–1919 would inevitably reassert itself against the Versailles Treaty and the international system established by Versailles that the Germans regarded as unjust and thus had no interest in preserving. Though Taylor argued that the Second World War was not inevitable and that the Versailles Treaty was nowhere near as harsh as contemporaries like [[John Maynard Keynes]] believed, what he regarded as a flawed peace settlement made the war more likely than not.

===''English History 1914–1945''===
In 1965 he rebounded from the controversy surrounding ''The Origins of the Second World War'' with the spectacular success of his book ''[[English History 1914–1945]]'', his only venture into [[social history|social]] and [[cultural history]], where he offered a loving, affectionate portrayal of the years between 1914 and 1945. ''English History 1914–1945'' was an enormous best-seller and in its first year in print sold more than all of the previous volumes of the ''[[Oxford History of England]]'' combined. Though he felt there was much to be ashamed of in British history, especially in regard to Ireland, he was very proud to be British and more specifically English. He was fond of stressing his [[nonconformist]] [[Northern England|Northern English]] background and saw himself as part of a grand tradition of radical dissent that he regarded as the real glorious [[history of England]].

===''The Reichstag Fire'' (introduction)===
In 1964 Taylor wrote the introduction for ''The Reichstag Fire'' by the journalist Fritz Tobias. He thus became the first English-language historian and the first historian after [[Hans Mommsen]] to accept the conclusions of the book, that the Nazis had not set the [[Reichstag (building)|''Reichstag'']] on fire in 1933 and that [[Marinus van der Lubbe]] had acted alone. Tobias and Taylor argued that the new Nazi government had been looking for something to increase its share of the vote in the elections of 5 March 1933, so as to activate the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] and that van der Lubbe had serendipitously (for the Nazis) provided it by burning down the Reichstag. Even without the [[Reichstag fire]], the Nazis were quite determined to destroy German democracy. In Taylor's opinion, van der Lubbe had made their task easier by providing a pretext. Moreover, the German Communist propaganda chief [[Willi Münzenberg]] and his [[OGPU]] handlers had manufactured all of the evidence implicating the Nazis in the arson. In particular, Tobias and Taylor pointed out that the so-called "secret tunnels" that supposedly gave the Nazis access to the ''Reichstag'' were in fact tunnels for water piping. At the time Taylor was widely attacked by many other historians for endorsing what was considered to be a self-evident perversion of established historical facts.

===''War by Timetable''===
In his 1969 book ''War by Timetable'', Taylor examined the origins of the [[First World War]], concluding that though all of the great powers wished to increase their own power relative to the others, none consciously sought war before 1914. Instead, he argued that all of the great powers believed that if they possessed the ability to mobilise their armed forces faster than any of the others, this would serve as a sufficient deterrent to avoid war and allow them to achieve their foreign policy. Thus, the general staffs of the great powers developed elaborate timetables to mobilise faster than any of their rivals. When the crisis broke in 1914, though none of the statesmen of Europe wanted a world war, the need to mobilise faster than potential rivals created an inexorable movement towards war. Thus Taylor claimed that the leaders of 1914 became prisoners of the logic of the mobilisation timetables and the timetables that were meant to serve as deterrent to war instead relentlessly brought war.

===''Beaverbrook: A Biography''===
In the 1950s and 1960s, Taylor befriended [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and later wrote his [[biography]] in 1972. Beaverbrook, Canadian in origin, was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] who believed strongly in the British Empire and whose entry into politics was in support of [[Bonar Law]], a Conservative leader strongly connected with the establishment of Northern Ireland. Despite the disdain for most politicians expressed in his writings, Taylor was fascinated by politics and politicians and often cultivated relations with those who possessed power. Beside Lord Beaverbrook, whose company Taylor very much enjoyed, his favourite politician was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Michael Foot]], whom he often described as the greatest Prime Minister Britain never had.

===Introductions===
Taylor also wrote significant introductions to British editions of [[Marx]]'s ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' and of ''[[Ten Days that Shook the World (book)|Ten Days that Shook the World]]'', by [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]]. He had long been an advocate of a treaty with the Soviet Union so British Communists expected him to be friendly. In 1963, the [[British Communist Party]], which held the copyright to ''Ten Days that Shook the World'' in the United Kingdom, offered Taylor the opportunity to write the introduction to a new edition. The introduction Taylor wrote was fairly sympathetic towards the [[Bolsheviks]]. However, it also pointed out certain contradictions between Reed's book and the official [[historiography in the Soviet Union]]—for instance, that [[Leon Trotsky]] played a very prominent, heroic role in ''Ten Days That Shook The World'' while in 1963 Trotsky was almost a non-person in [[Soviet historiography]], mentioned only in terms of abuse. The British Communist Party rejected Taylor's introduction as anti-Soviet. The rejection annoyed Taylor. When the copyright expired in 1977 and a non-Communist publisher reissued the book, asking Taylor to write the introduction, he strengthened some of his criticisms. Taylor also wrote the introduction for ''[[Fighter: The True Story of the Battle of Britain]]'' by [[Len Deighton]].

===Journalism===
Starting in 1931, Taylor worked as book reviewer for the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'', and from 1957 he was a columnist with the [[The Observer|''Observer'']]. In 1951 Taylor made his first move into mass-market journalism, spending just over a year as a columnist at the tabloid ''[[Sunday Pictorial]]'', later renamed the ''Sunday Mirror''. His first article was an attack on the stance of the [[United Nations]] during the [[Korean War]], in which he argued that the UN was merely a front for American policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UNO Has Failed! |author=Taylor , A. J. P.|newspaper=[[Sunday Pictorial]] |date=28 January 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the ''Sunday Pictorial'' in 1952, in the wake of editor [[Philip Zec]]'s dismissal, he began writing a weekly column the following year for the [[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|''Daily Herald'']] until 1956. From 1957 until 1982 he wrote for the ''[[Sunday Express]]'', owned by his friend and patron Lord Beaverbrook. His first column for that paper was "Why Must We Soft-Soap The Germans?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Must We Soft-Soap The Germans? |author=Taylor, A. J. P. |newspaper=[[Sunday Express]] |date=27 October 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he complained that the majority of Germans were still Nazis at heart and argued the [[European Economic Community]] was little more than an attempt by the Germans to achieve via trade what they failed to accomplish through arms in the First and Second World Wars. At a time when the relationship with the EEC was a major issue in Britain, Taylor's [[Commonwealth of Nations|pro-Commonwealth]] [[Euroscepticism]] became a common theme in many of his articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Macmillan Has Not Found The Answer Yet |author=Taylor, A.

===Broadcasting===
The Second World War gave Taylor the opportunity to branch out from print journalism, initially into radio and then later television. On 17 March 1942 Taylor made the first of seven appearances on ''The World at War – Your Questions Answered'' broadcast by BBC Forces' Radio. After the war Taylor became one of the first television historians. His appearances began with his role as a panellist on the [[BBC]]'s ''In The News'' from 1950 to 1954. Here he was noted for his argumentative style, and in one episode he declined to acknowledge the presence of the other panellists. The press came to refer to him as the "sulky don" and in 1954 he was dropped. From 1955 Taylor was a panellist on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s rival discussion programme ''Free Speech'', where he remained until the series ended in 1961. In 1957, 1957–1958 and 1961 he made a number of half-hour programmes on ITV in which he lectured without notes on a variety of topics, such as the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the First World War. These were huge ratings successes. Despite earlier strong feelings against the BBC, he lectured for a BBC historical series in 1961 and made more series for it in 1963, 1976, 1977 and 1978. He also hosted additional series for ITV in 1964, 1966 and 1967. In ''Edge of Britain'' in 1980 he toured the towns of northern England. Taylor's final TV appearance was in the series ''How Wars End'' in 1985, where the effects of [[Parkinson's disease]] on him were apparent.

Taylor had a famous rivalry with the historian [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], with whom he often debated on television. One of the more famous exchanges took place in 1961. Trevor-Roper said "I'm afraid that your book ''[[The Origins of the Second World War]]'' may damage your reputation as a historian", to which Taylor replied "Your criticism of me would damage your reputation as a historian, if you had one."

The origins of the dispute went back to 1957 when the [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Oxford)|Regius Professorship for History]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] was vacant. Despite their divergent political philosophies, Taylor and Trevor-Roper had been friends since the early 1950s, but with the possibility of the Regius Professorship, both men lobbied for it. The Conservative Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] awarded the chair to the Tory Trevor-Roper rather than the Labourite Taylor. In addition, a number of the other Oxford dons had felt that Taylor's profile in [[journalism]] was "demeaning" to the historian's craft and had lobbied against him.

In public, Taylor declared that he would never have accepted any honour from a government that had "the blood of Suez on its hands". In private, he was furious with Trevor-Roper for holding an honour that Taylor considered rightfully his. Adding to Taylor's rancour was the fact that he had arrived at Oxford a decade before Trevor-Roper. From then on, Taylor never missed a chance to disparage Trevor-Roper's character or scholarship. The famously combative Trevor-Roper reciprocated. The feud was given much publicity by the media, not so much because of the merits of their disputes but rather because their acrimonious debates on television made for entertaining viewing. Likewise, the various articles written by Taylor and Trevor-Roper denouncing each other's scholarship, in which both men's considerable powers of invective were employed with maximum effect, made for entertaining reading. Beyond that, it was fashionable to portray the dispute between Taylor and Trevor-Roper as a battle between generations. Taylor, with his populist, irreverent style, was nearly a decade older than Trevor-Roper, but was represented by the media as a symbol of the younger generation that was coming of age in the 1950s–1960s. Trevor-Roper, who was unabashedly old-fashioned (he was one of the last Oxford dons to lecture wearing his professor's robes) and inclined to behave in a manner that the media portrayed as pompous and conceited, was seen as a symbol of the older generation. A subtle but important difference in the style between the two historians was their manner of addressing each other during their TV debates: Trevor-Roper always addressed Taylor as "Mr Taylor" or just "Taylor", while Taylor always addressed Trevor-Roper as "Hugh".

Another frequent sparring partner on TV for Taylor was the writer [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. The frequent television appearances helped to make Taylor the most famous British historian of the 20th century. It was a measure of his fame that featured in a cameo in the 1981 film ''[[Time Bandits]]'' and was satirised in an episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', in which a scantily clad woman (identified by an onscreen caption as "A. J. P. Taylor, Historian"), dubbed over with a man's voice, delivers a lecture on "Eighteenth Century Social Reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montypython.net/scripts/18thcent.php|title=Eighteenth Century Social Legislation/The Battle of Trafalgar|publisher=MontyPython.net|accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Another foray into the world of entertainment occurred in the 1960s when he served as the historical consultant for both the [[Oh, What a Lovely War!|stage]] and [[Oh! What a Lovely War|film versions]] of ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!]]''. Though he possessed great charm and charisma and a sense of humour, as he aged he presented himself as, and came to be seen as, cantankerous and irascible.

==Opinions==
Throughout his life, Taylor took public stands on the great issues of his time. In the early 1930s, he was in a [[left-wing]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] group called the Manchester Peace Council, for which he frequently spoke in public. Until 1936, Taylor was an opponent of [[British rearmament]] as he felt that a re-armed Britain would ally itself with Germany against the Soviet Union. However, after 1936, he resigned from the Manchester Peace Council, urged British rearmament in the face of what Taylor considered to be the Nazi menace, and advocated an Anglo-Soviet alliance to contain Germany. After 1936, he also fervently criticised [[appeasement]], a stance that he would disavow in 1961.

In 1938, he denounced the [[Munich Agreement]] at several rallies and may have written several leaders in the ''Manchester Guardian'' criticising it; later, he would compare the smaller number of Czechoslovak dead with the number of Polish dead. In October 1938, Taylor attracted particular controversy by a speech he gave at a dinner held every October to commemorate a protest by a group of Oxford dons against [[James II of England|James II]] in 1688, an event that was an important prelude to the [[Glorious Revolution]]. He denounced the Munich Agreement and those who supported it, warning the assembled dons that if action were not taken immediately to resist Nazi Germany, then they might all soon be living under the rule of a much greater tyrant than James II. Taylor's speech was highly contentious, in part because in October 1938 the Munich Agreement was popular with the public even if subsequently it was to be reviled along with the policy of appeasement, and also because he used a non-partisan and non-political occasion to make a highly partisan, politically charged attack on government policy.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Throughout his life, Taylor was sympathetic to the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, and after 1941 he was overjoyed to have the Soviet Union as Britain's ally, as this was the realisation of his desire for an Anglo-Soviet alliance. The Second World War further increased Taylor's pro-Soviet feelings, as he was always profoundly grateful for the [[Red Army]]'s role in destroying [[Nazi Germany]]. Despite his pro-Soviet views he was strongly critical of [[Stalinism]], and in 1948 he attended and did his best to sabotage a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] cultural congress in [[Wrocław]], Poland. His speech, which was broadcast live on Polish radio and via speakers on the streets of Wrocław, about the right of everyone to hold different views from those who hold power, was enthusiastically received by the delegates and was met with thunderous applause. The speech was clearly intended as a rebuttal of a speech given by the Soviet writer [[Alexander Alexandrovich Fadeyev|Alexander Fadeyev]] the previous day, who had demanded obedience on the part of everyone to [[Joseph Stalin]].

After 1945, he was very disappointed to see Britain choose the United States, not the Soviet Union, as its major ally.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} As a [[Socialism|socialist]], Taylor saw the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system as wrong on practical and moral grounds, although he rejected the [[Marxism|Marxist]] view that capitalism was responsible for wars and conflicts. He felt that the status quo in the West was highly unstable and prone to accidents, and prevented a just and moral international system from coming into being. Moreover, Taylor was enraged by the decision of the Western powers, which he blamed on the US, to re-build and establish the [[West Germany|West German state]] in the late 1940s, which Taylor saw as laying the foundations for a [[Fourth Reich]] that would one day plunge the world back into war.

He also blamed the United States for the [[Cold War]], and in the 1950s and 1960s was one of the leading lights of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. Though he preferred that the United Kingdom be neutral in the Cold War, he felt that if Britain should have to align itself with a major power, the best partner was the Soviet Union rather than America, which in Taylor's opinion was carrying out reckless policies that increased the risk of [[World War Three]]. Taylor never visited the United States, despite receiving many invitations.

In 1950 he was again temporarily banned by the [[BBC]] when he attempted to deliver a radio address against British participation in the [[Korean War]]. After a public outcry, the BBC relented and allowed him to deliver his address. In 1956 Taylor demonstrated against the [[Suez War]], though not the Soviet crushing of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], which he believed had saved Hungary from a return to the rule of Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]]. He also championed [[Israel]], which he saw as a model socialist [[democracy]] threatened by reactionary [[Arab]] dictatorships. Taylor was also opposed to, and condemned, the US intervention in the [[Vietnam War]].

Taylor was also opposed to the [[British Empire]] and against Britain's participation in the [[European Economic Community]] and [[NATO]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In an interview with Irish State radio in April 1976, Taylor argued that the British presence in [[Northern Ireland]] was perpetuating the [[The Troubles|conflict]] there. Taylor claimed the best solution would be for an "armed push" by the Irish nationalists to drive out the one million Ulster Protestants from Ireland. He cited as a successful precedent the [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] after the Second World War. On the threat of civil war should Britain quit Ireland, Taylor answered: "What we have, after all, is an incipient civil war. To put it brutally, if there were a civil war in Northern Ireland, and I am not convinced that there would be, quite a lot of people would be killed and the war would be decided within a few months. Spread over the years, probably more people have been killed".&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Christopher (12 April 1976) "Protestant expulsion from Ulster by Irish nationalists would be the best solution, Mr A J P Taylor says", ''[[The Times]]'' p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor was fearless in championing unpopular people and causes. In 1980, he resigned from the [[British Academy]] in protest against the expulsion of the art historian and Soviet spy [[Anthony Blunt]], which he saw as an act of [[McCarthyism]]. Closer to his work as a historian, Taylor championed less government secrecy and, paradoxically for a staunch leftist, fought for more privately owned television stations. His experiences with being banned by the BBC had led him to appreciate the value of having many broadcasters. In regard to government archives, Taylor took part in a successful attempt to lobby the British government to replace the 50-year rule with a [[30-year rule]].

===Germanophobia===
Taylor held fierce [[Anti-German sentiment|Germanophobic]] views. In 1944, he was temporarily banned from the [[BBC]] following complaints about a series of lectures he gave on air in which he gave full vent to his anti-German feelings. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In his 1945 book, ''[[The Course of German History]]'', he argued that [[Nazism|National Socialism]] was the inevitable product of the entire history of the Germans going back to the days of the [[Germanic tribes]]. He was an early champion of what has since been called the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' (Special Way) interpretation of German history, that German culture and society developed over the centuries in such a way as to make [[Nazi Germany]] inevitable. Moreover, he argued that there was a symbiotic relationship between Hitler and the German people, with [[Adolf Hitler]] needing the Germans to fulfil his dreams of conquest and the German people needing Hitler to fulfil their dreams of subjugation of their neighbours. In particular, he accused the Germans of waging an endless [[Drang nach Osten]] against their [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] neighbours since the days of [[Charlemagne]]. For Taylor, Nazi racial imperialism was a continuation of policies pursued by every German ruler. ''The Course of German History'' was a best-seller in both the United Kingdom and the United States; it was the success of this book that made Taylor's reputation in the United States. Its success also marked the beginning of the breach between Taylor and his mentor Namier, who wanted to write a similar book. By the 1950s, relations between Taylor and Namier had noticeably cooled and in his 1983 [[autobiography]], ''A Personal History'', Taylor, though acknowledging a huge intellectual debt to Namier, portrayed him as a pompous bore.

===Populism===
Taylor's approach to history was a [[populism|populist]] one. He felt that history should be open to all and enjoyed being called the "People's Historian" and the "Everyman's Historian". He usually favoured an anti-[[Great man theory]], history being made for the most part by towering figures of stupidity rather than of genius. In his view, leaders did not make history; instead they reacted to events — what happened in the past was due to sequences of blunders and errors that were largely outside anyone's control. To the extent that anyone made anything happen in history, it was only through their mistakes.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Though Taylor normally preferred to portray leaders as fools blundering their way forward, it is fair to add that he did think that individuals sometimes could play a positive role in history—his heroes were [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[David Lloyd George]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} But for Taylor, people like Lloyd George and Lenin were the exceptions. Despite Taylor's increasing ambivalence toward appeasement from the late 1950s, which became explicitly evident in his 1961 book ''Origins of the Second World War'', [[Winston Churchill]] remained another of his heroes. In ''English History 1914–1945'' (1965) he famously concluded his biographical footnote of Churchill with the phrase "the saviour of his country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English History 1914–1945|author=Taylor, A. J. P.|year=1965|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another person Taylor admired was the historian [[E. H. Carr]], who was his favourite historian and a good friend.

===Irony and humour===
His narratives used irony and humour to entertain as well as inform. He examined history from odd angles, exposing what he considered to be the pomposities of various historical characters. He was famed for "Taylorisms": witty, epigrammatic, and sometimes cryptic remarks that were meant to expose what he considered to be the absurdities and paradoxes of modern [[international relations]]. An example is in his television piece ''Mussolini'' (1970), in which he said the dictator "kept up with his work — by doing none."  Or, about [[Metternich]]'s political philosophies: "Most men could do better while shaving". His determination to bring history to everyone drove his frequent appearances on radio and later on television. He was also careful to puncture any aura of infallibility that historians might have. On one occasion when asked what he thought the future might bring, he replied "Dear boy, you should never ask an historian to predict the future – frankly we have a hard enough time predicting the past." Taylor wrote about ''English History 1914-1945'' that he offered up a parody of Oxford historians:"...delivering the Judgement of History in the highest Olympian spirit. I followed their example except the poor were always right and the rich always wrong-a judgement that happens to be correct historically. Some of the details were also a parody, as for instance the solemn discussion as when 'Fuck' attained literary through not conversational respectability. I had more fun writing ''English History 1914-1945'' than in writing any of my other books".{{sfn|Burk|2001|p=302}}

==="The Establishment"===
Taylor has been credited with coining the term "[[the Establishment]]" in a 1953 book review, but this is disputed. On 29 August 1953, in reviewing a biography of [[William Cobbett]] in ''[[New Statesman]]'', Taylor wrote "The Establishment draws in recruits from outside as soon as they are ready to conform to its standards and become respectable. There is nothing more agreeable in life than to make peace with the Establishment — and nothing more corrupting."

=== Speed Limits ===
In 1967, Taylor wrote an article for the [[Daily Express|Sunday Express]] in which he argued that [[Speed limit|speed limits]] had made absolutely no positive difference to road safety and that 'on the contrary, [speed limits] tend to increase the risks and dangers'. Taylor went on to claim 'I have been driving a car for 45 years. I have consistently ignored all the various speed limits. Never once have I encountered the slightest risk as a result'. The article caused a member of the public to lodge a complaint with the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]], on the grounds that Taylor's remarks 'amount[ed] to an indirect incitement to drivers to break the law'. The Council eventually rejected the complaint and ruled that 'while Mr Taylor's views are controversial, he has an unchallengeable right to express them'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Press and the People|last=|first=|publisher=The Press Council|year=1968|isbn=|location=London|pages=45-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Press Writer's Freedom is Defended|last=|first=|date=11 December 1967|work=Birmingham Daily Post|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

===''The Origins of the Second World War''===
{{main|The Origins of the Second World War}}
''The Origins of the Second World War'' was received negatively in some quarters when it was published in 1961. The book set off a huge storm of controversy and debate that lasted for years. At least part of the vehement criticism was due to the confusion in the public's mind between Taylor's book and another book published in 1961, ''Der Erzwungene Krieg'' (''The Forced War'') by the American historian [[David Hoggan]]. Taylor criticised Hoggan's thesis that Germany was the innocent victim of an Anglo-Polish conspiracy in 1939 as nonsense but many critics confused Taylor's thesis with Hoggan's.
Most of the criticism was over Taylor's arguments for [[appeasement]] as a rational political strategy, his mechanistic portrayal of a world destined for another world war by post-war settlement of 1918–1919, his depiction of the Second World War as an "accident" caused by diplomatic blunders, his portrayal of Hitler as a "normal leader" and what many considered his flippant dismissal of Nazi ideology as a motivating force. Leading the charge against Taylor was his arch-enemy Trevor-Roper, who contended that Taylor had wilfully and egregiously misinterpreted the evidence. In particular, Trevor-Roper criticised Taylor's argument that the [[Hossbach Memorandum]] of 1937 was a meaningless document because none of the scenarios outlined in the Memorandum as the prerequisite for war such as the [[Spanish Civil War]] leading to a war between Italy and France in the Mediterranean or civil war breaking out in France occurred. In Trevor-Roper's opinion, what really mattered about the Hossbach Memorandum was that Hitler clearly expressed an intention to go to war sooner rather than later and it was Hitler's intentions rather than his plans at the time which mattered. However, in the newest edition of the book, Taylor argues that the significant parts, if not the whole, of the memorandum are in fact fabrications. Other historians who criticised ''The Origins of the Second World War'' included; [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[Louis Morton]], [[Barbara Tuchman]], [[Ian Morrow]], [[Gerhard Weinberg]], [[G.F. Hudson]], [[Elizabeth Wiskemann]], [[W.N. Medlicott]], [[Timothy Mason|Tim Mason]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Frank Freidel]], [[Harry Hinsley]], [[John Wheeler-Bennett]], [[Golo Mann]], [[Lucy Dawidowicz]], [[Gordon A. Craig]], [[A. L. Rowse]], [[Raymond Sontag]], [[Andreas Hillgruber]] and [[Yehuda Bauer]].
Rowse, who had once been a close friend of Taylor's, attacked him with an intensity and vehemence that was second only to Trevor-Roper's. In addition, several historians wrote books on the origins of the Second World War with the aim of refuting Taylor's thesis. Taylor was angered by some of the criticism, especially the implication that he had set out to exonerate Hitler, writing that "to the best of my recollection, those who now display indignation against me were not active [against appeasement] on the public platform."&lt;ref&gt;Burk 2000, p.292&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable examples include [[Gerhard Weinberg]]'s two-volume ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany'' and [[Andreas Hillgruber]]'s ''Deutschlands Rolle in der Vorgeschichte der beiden Weltkriege'', translated as ''Germany And The Two World Wars''.

The issue of misinterpretation is also addressed in [[Gordon A. Craig]]'s book ''Germany: 1866–1945'', where it is argued that Taylor dismissed Hitler's foreign policy, as presented in ''Mein Kampf'', and in particular, the remilitarisation of the Rhineland, as a jumble of idle thoughts written down under the impact of the French occupation of the Ruhr.

As angry as the reaction in Britain was to ''The Origins of the Second World War'', it was greater when the book was published in January 1962 in the United States. With the exception of [[Harry Elmer Barnes]] and [[Murray Rothbard]]&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/library/review-origins-second-world-war&lt;/ref&gt;, every American historian who reviewed Taylor's book gave it a negative review. Perhaps ironically, Taylor had indirectly criticised Barnes when he wrote contemptuously of certain self-styled American Revisionist historians whose work Taylor characterised as marked by obsessive loathing for their own country, nostalgia for [[isolationism]], hatred for the [[New Deal]] and a tendency to engage in bizarre conspiracy theories. Despite the best efforts of Barnes and his protégé [[David Hoggan]] to recruit Taylor to their cause, Taylor always made clear that he wanted nothing to do with either Barnes or Hoggan.

Despite the criticism, ''The Origins of the Second World War'' is regarded as a watershed in the [[historiography]] of the origins of the Second World War. In general, historians have praised Taylor for the following:

* By showing that [[appeasement]] was a popular policy and that there was continuity in British foreign policy after 1933, he shattered the common view of the appeasers as a small, degenerate clique that had mysteriously hijacked the British government sometime in the 1930s and who had carried out their policies in the face of massive public resistance.
* By portraying the leaders of the 1930s as real people attempting to deal with real problems, he made the first strides towards attempting an explanation of the actions of the appeasers rather than merely condemning them.
* By showing that the ''[[Anschluss]]'' was enormously popular in Austria, he helped to discredit the notion of Austria as a victim of Nazi aggression brought unwillingly into the ''Reich''.
* By being one of the first historians to present Hitler as an ordinary human being rather than as a "madman", Taylor helped to open the door to seeing Hitler as a human being, albeit one who held morally repellent beliefs, offering possibilities to explain his actions.
* By being the first English language historian to bring attention to the work of the French economist and historian [[Étienne Mantoux]], especially his 1946 book ''The Carthaginian Peace: or The Economic Consequences of Mr Keynes'', he was able to show that Germany was capable of paying [[war reparations|reparations]] to France after the First World War; the only problem was that the Germans were unwilling. In this way, he started an important debate over who was really responsible for the [[hyperinflation]] that destroyed the German economy in 1923.
* By highlighting certain continuities in German foreign policy between 1871 and 1939, he helped to place Nazi foreign policy in a wider perspective, though the degree of continuity is still subject to considerable debate.
* By focusing on the improvised character of German and Italian foreign policy, he helped to create a debate over the degree to which fascist states were fulfilling a programme versus taking advantage of events.
* By showing that Hitler just as often reacted as acted, he offered a balance to previous accounts where Hitler was portrayed as the sole agent and the leaders of Britain and France as entirely reactive.
* Finally, in response to Taylor's argument that Hitler had no programme because his foreign policy seemed to operate in a haphazard and slapdash way, Taylor's critics such as Trevor-Roper worked out a formula by which Hitler held "consistent aims" but sought to achieve them via "flexible methods".

===Portrayal of Mussolini===
Another criticism is of Taylor's views on Italy. Taylor drew a picture of [[Benito Mussolini]] as a great showman but an inept leader with no beliefs. The first part of this picture has not been generally challenged by historians but the second part has been questioned. Taylor argued that Mussolini was sincere when he helped forge the [[Stresa Front]] with Britain and France to resist any German challenge to the ''status quo'' in Europe and that only the [[League of Nations]] [[International sanctions|sanctions]] imposed on [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] for [[Second Italo–Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] drove Mussolini into an alliance with Nazi Germany. Recently, a number of specialists in [[History of Italy|Italian history]] have challenged this by arguing that Mussolini possessed a belief in the ''[[spazio vitale]]'' (vital space) as a guiding foreign policy concept in which the entire [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the [[Balkans]], the Middle East and the [[Horn of Africa]] were regarded as rightfully belonging to Italy, leading to inevitable conflict with the two dominant Mediterranean powers, Britain and France.

=== The French Third Republic ===
Finally, Taylor has been criticised for promoting the ''La décadence'' view of the [[French Third Republic]]. This historical concept portrays the Third Republic as a decadent state, forever on the verge of collapse. In particular, advocates of the ''La décadence'' concept have asserted that inter-war France was riven by political instability; possessed a leadership that was deeply divided, corrupt, incompetent and pusillanimous, which ruled over a nation rent by mass unemployment, strikes, a sense of despair over the future, riots and a state of near-civil war between the Left and the Right. Of all the French governments of the interwar era, only the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government of [[Léon Blum]] was presented sympathetically by Taylor, which he praised for carrying out what he regarded as long overdue social reforms. Many experts in [[History of France|French history]] have admitted that there is a kernel of truth to Taylor's picture of France but have complained that Taylor presented French politics and society in such a manner as to border on caricature.

==Retirement==
Taylor was badly injured in 1984 when he was run over by a car while crossing [[Old Compton Street]] in London. The effect of the accident led to his retirement in 1985. In his last years, he endured [[Parkinson's disease]], which left him incapable of writing. His last public appearance was at his 80th birthday, in 1986, when a group of his former students, including Sir [[Martin Gilbert]], [[Alan Sked]], [[Norman Davies]] and [[Paul Kennedy]], organised a public reception in his honour. He had, with considerable difficulty, memorised a short speech, which he delivered in a manner that managed to hide the fact that his memory and mind had been permanently damaged by Parkinson's disease.

In 1987, he entered a nursing home in [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]], London, where he died on 7 September 1990 aged 84. He was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]].&lt;ref name=odnb1 /&gt;

'''Andrew Ryan''' is a fictional character in the ''[[BioShock (series)|BioShock]]'' video game series developed by [[Irrational Games]]. He serves as the primary [[antagonist]] of the first half of the first ''[[BioShock]]'' and a minor character in its sequel, ''[[BioShock 2]]''. Ryan is an idealistic [[business magnate]] in the 1940s and 1950s; seeking to avoid scrutiny from governments and other oversight, he ordered the secret construction of an underwater city, [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]]. When Ryan's vision for a utopia in Rapture collapsed into dystopia, he hid himself away and used armies of mutated humans ("[[Splicer (Bioshock)|Splicers]]") to defend himself and fight against those resisting him, including the player-character Jack within the first game.

Ryan was created by [[Irrational Games]]' [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], based on figures like [[Ayn Rand]], [[Howard Hughes]],&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/08/20/exclusive-ken-levine-on-the-making-of-bioshock/|title=Exclusive: Ken Levine on the making of Bioshock|last=Gillen|first=Kieron|date=20 August 2007|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|accessdate=2 December 2018| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091009131020/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/08/20/exclusive-ken-levine-on-the-making-of-bioshock/| archivedate= 9 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citizen Kane]], and [[Walt Disney]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The character has received significant praise from critics, with ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' ranking him ninth on their list of top ten video game politicians.&lt;ref name="Scott Sharkey 2008"&gt;Scott Sharkey, "''EGM'''s Top Ten Videogame Politicians: Election time puts us in a voting mood,” ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 234 (November 2008): 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He is voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]], whose voice acting was cited as one of the contributing factors to the success of ''BioShock'' as it won "Best Use of Sound" from [[IGN]]. Ryan has been compared to several different real-life and fictional figures, and his world of Rapture compared to the world of [[Galt's Gulch]] in the Ayn Rand novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.

==Concept and creation==
''[[BioShock]]'' director Ken Levine described Andrew Ryan as a character of ideals, in contrast to the game's other antagonist, Frank Fontaine, who has no ideals. Designing the encounter between the player and Ryan was a controversial decision for the developers, due to the question of what the player's motive is at this point. Ryan taking his own life to prevent Jack, the protagonist, from accomplishing this, was described as the "ultimate insult" by Levine. The scene took a long time for the developers to finish. Levine stated that they figured out who the character of Andrew Ryan is too early, adding that they underestimated the impact that this would make.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2"&gt;{{cite web |title=GDC: Ken Levine Speaks: Empowering Players to Care About Your Stupid Story |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17531 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=13 October 2009 |date=20 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091016194454/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17531| archivedate= 16 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he is saner than the opponents the players encounter before him, including a plastic surgeon who takes his ideal of beauty too far, he is as unmovable as they are, unwilling to change his ideals. When discussing how many people would get the good ending to ''BioShock'', he commented that Ryan would not, choosing to take the easier path.&lt;ref name="shacknews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=539|title=Ken Levine on BioShock: The Spoiler Interview|last=Remo|first=Chris|date=30 August 2007|publisher=[[Shacknews]]|accessdate=10 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091016213627/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=539| archivedate= 16 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In creating the world of Rapture, Levine imagined a [[utopia]] that its creators did not want the outside world to discover. Following this, he created the character of Ryan as its creator, giving him a "pseudo-[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]] and extremely [[capitalistic]] view on the world" as well as a fear of the [[New Deal]]ers in the United States and communists in Russia would find it. Levine states that to him, Ryan's philosophies come from [[Art Deco]], describing the style as, "Yes, we are men, and we control the universe!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/bioshock/799226p1.html|title=Rationalizing Rapture with BioShock's Ken Levine|date=25 June 2007|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered Ryan a combination of historical figures such as [[Howard Hughes]] and [[Ayn Rand]]; and, though he compared Ryan to [[John Galt]], he considered Ryan  more similar to a real person, making mistakes and having fear and doubts.&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun" /&gt; Levine purposely named Ryan as he did, using a semi-anagram of Ayn Rand's name to establish the connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2012/12/13/bioshock-infinites-ken-levine-of-sounds-and-pixels/ | title = BioShock Infinite's Ken Levine: of sounds and pixels | publisher = [[VG247]] | first = Stace | last = Harmen | date = 13 December 2012 | accessdate = 17 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a questions and answers segment, a questioner stated that he did not want to kill Ryan, asking Levine, "Are [we] still doomed to make games where we have to use plot devices to clean that up?" to which Levine responded that video games were admittedly linear, saying that it was hard enough to come up with one good plot, let alone multiple ones.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2"/&gt; Levine stated that he did not expect the "ugly comedown from the stratospheric highs" from the Andrew Ryan scene near the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Opinion: When Should Games Say Goodbye? |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19388 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=13 October 2009 |date=21 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091109093255/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19388| archivedate= 9 November 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Andrew Ryan has [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivist]] ideals, to a degree that they are the most important thing to him, more so than his own life.&lt;ref name="shacknews"/&gt; He has an enormous hatred of what he refers to as "parasites" consisting mainly of people who support left-wing political viewpoints, namely socialism and communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[BioShock]]|developer=[[Irrational Games]]|publisher=[[2K Games]]|date=21 August 2007|platform=Xbox 360/Microsoft Windows|version=|level=|isolang=|quote='''Andrew Ryan''': In 1919 I fled a country that had traded in despotism for insanity.

Of the army. Of the king. Of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan is a strong supporter of [[meritocracy]]. He believes that all individuals have the right to keep what they earn and the place to live without government interference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=BioShock|developer=Irrational Games|publisher=2K Games|date=21 August 2007|platform=Xbox 360/Microsoft Windows|version=|level=|isolang=|quote='''Andrew Ryan''': Doctor Suchong, frankly, I'm shocked by your proposal.

Ryan coined his own economic philosophy which he named the ''Great Chain of Industry,'' or simply the ''Great Chain'', similar to the "[[invisible hand]] of the market" metaphor coined by [[Adam Smith]]. Ryan conceptualised all of society as bound together by an invisible, intangible "chain" of economic inter-relations.  This great, invisible chain of industry only pulls society in the right direction when all pull on it to serve their own interests, i.e. in a totally [[free market]] completely free of any government regulation (similar to Ayn Rand's views of totally unregulated capitalism).  This principle extended to the point that Ryan opposed regulation for basic quality control or safety, on the grounds that the "Great Chain" of the free market would ensure that a stable level of quality was maintained without outside interference.  As a practical result, after fifteen years this plunged Rapture's economy into a [[race to the bottom]]: every product was made as cheaply as possible and at the lowest quality, meaning that the only way any one business could turn a profit was to also sell low quality products at inflated prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=BioShock|developer=Irrational Games|publisher=2K Games|date=21 August 2007|platform=Xbox 360/Microsoft Windows|version=|level=|isolang=|quote='''Andrew Ryan''' [src]: There is something more powerful than each of us, a combination of our efforts, a Great Chain of industry that unites us.

==Role in ''BioShock''==
The player only encounters Ryan once in person throughout the entire [[BioShock (series)|''BioShock'' franchise]], with most of his appearance being made via [[radio transmission]] and [[Diary#Audio journals|audio diaries]]. Ryan is always seen with his hair slicked back and sporting a smart [[suit (clothing)|suit]] and necktie. In an image the player encounters of Ryan during the ''Welcome to Rapture'' and ''Rapture Control Centre'' levels, he can be seen wearing a black [[fedora]].&lt;ref name="BioShock"&gt;{{cite video game|title=BioShock|developer=Irrational Games|publisher=2K Games|date=21 August 2007|platform=Xbox 360/Microsoft Windows|version=|level=|isolang=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan's first appearance in the franchise is in ''[[BioShock]]'', the first installment of the series.  He created ''BioShock''{{'}}s world, [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]], as a means to escape from such constraints as religion, communism, and [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. Rapture eventually fell apart after the scientist [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Brigid Tenenbaum|Brigid Tenenbaum]] discovered a substance she later named "ADAM". While the initial properties of her new discovery were confusing, she later diagnosed that when "ADAM" was injected via a [[hypodermic syringe]] into the arm, it allows the user to "bend the [[double-helix]]" and provides what could be described as "superpowers." However, the long-term effects of ADAM soon became obvious later, as the substance is highly addictive and both mental and physical deterioration begin to occur.&lt;ref name="BioShock"/&gt;

When [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Jack|Jack]] (the player's character in ''[[BioShock]]'') arrives in [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]], Ryan views him as a threat, initially believing him to be a government agent, most likely sent by the Russian [[KGB]] or the American [[CIA]]. Ryan attempts to do whatever possible to kill Jack, who is aided by Ryan's nemesis, [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Frank Fontaine/Atlas|Atlas]]. Over the course of the game it is gradually revealed to the player that Jack is actually Andrew Ryan's illegitimate son.  Ryan had [[sexual intercourse]] with a young female stripper named Jasmine Jolene, resulting in her [[pregnancy]], though Ryan was not aware of this. Throughout Rapture's history Ryan had frequent encounters with a smuggler named [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Frank Fontaine/Atlas|Frank Fontaine]], who later became a leading figure in Rapture's genetic arms race towards the end of the 1950s. Fontaine decided to take advantage of this opportunity, and paid a high-ranking employee of his, Brigid Tenenbaum, to purchase the embryo from Jolene, which Jolene agreed to simply because she "needed the money." After Andrew Ryan became aware of this, he brutally murdered her, leaving her corpse on a bed in the ''Eve's Garden'' [[strip club]]. Fontaine later named the child, "Jack", and ordered a scientist under his employment, [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Yi Suchong|Dr. Yi Suchong]] to accelerate Jack's growth, and make him vulnerable to several mental techniques; one such technique was to force Jack to perform any requested action by pronouncing the phrase "Would you kindly...".&lt;ref name="BioShock"/&gt;

When Andrew Ryan and Jack finally meet, Ryan states that Jack was his "greatest disappointment." Ryan gives a short [[monologue]], explaining his past to Jack, and saying how little he differs from a simple [[slave]]. According to Ryan, "In the end, what separates a man from a slave? Money? Power? No... A man chooses, a slave obeys." Ryan hands Jack his golf [[putter (golf)|putter]], and then asks Jack, using the "would you kindly" phrase, to kill him, which Jack is forced to do.&lt;ref name="BioShock"/&gt;

Ryan also appears through audio diaries in ''BioShock's'' sequel, ''[[BioShock 2]]'', which give the player an expanded insight into Ryan's history and ideals.&lt;ref name="BioShock 2"&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[BioShock 2]]|developer=[[2K Marin]]|publisher=2K Games|date=9 February 2010|platform=Xbox 360/Microsoft Windows|version=|level=|isolang=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Armin Shimerman.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Armin Shimerman]] provided the voice for Andrew Ryan. He has received praise for his portrayal, contributing to ''BioShock'' winning Best Use of Sound from [[IGN]].]]

He is ranked ninth in ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'}}s list of the top ten video game politicians.&lt;ref name="Scott Sharkey 2008"/&gt; [[IGN]] editor Charles Onyett described him as "anything but a prototypical villain", describing him as having a bottomless ambition for creating a city at the bottom of the sea. He added that while his words resemble "totalitarian propaganda", players cannot help but sympathise with him.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/16/bioshock-review-5|title=BioShock Review|last=Onyett|first=Charles|date=16 August 2007|publisher=IGN|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During a discussion about the potential plot of the game's sequel ''[[BioShock 2]]'', editor Hilary Goldstein said that Ryan should reappear in it, and that while it should be in a new area, it should still have connections to him. Onyett called Ryan a key element, and if not included in the sequel, there would be a dramatic loss of personality. He claimed that much of Rapture's personality comes from Ryan, and it would have much less of an impact without him. Editor Ryan Geddes agreed, adding that he felt there was more to Ryan than Rapture. Editor Nate Ahem suggested that the game's sequel, ''[[BioShock 2]]'', could potentially put the players in the role of Ryan, to explore the story of trying to create a perfect world and having it crumble beneath their feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/22/what-we-want-in-bioshock-2|title=What We Want in BioShock 2|last=Haynes|first=Jeff|date=22 October 2008|publisher=IGN|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gamasutra]] editor Leigh Alexander ranked him the third most affecting character of 2007, behind [[GLaDOS]] from ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' and player-created characters such as in [[MMORPG|massive multiplayer online role-playing games]]. Leigh calls him a  "cautionary example of the danger of pure philosophy", adding that while he begins as the primary antagonist, players sympathise with him once it becomes clear that he is so "bitterly wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gamasutra's Best of 2007: Top 5 Most Affecting Characters |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16569 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=13 October 2009 |date=12 December 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091009082620/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16569| archivedate= 9 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Volk of Gamasutra described him as a fascinating take on the [[mad scientist]] character, adding that if more developers steer away from stereotypes of the character type, these characters could easily rival those in film, television, or novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Applying Robert McKee's "Story" to Video Games |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamVolk/20090821/2808/Applying_Robert_McKees_Story_to_Video_Games.php |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=13 October 2009 |date=21 August 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091108220349/http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamVolk/20090821/2808/Applying_Robert_McKees_Story_to_Video_Games.php| archivedate= 8 November 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book "Halos and Avatars: Playing Video Games with God", author Craig Detweiler calls him an "obvious reference to the objectivist writer and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GomyEvcocJsC Halos and Avatars: Playing Video Games with God – Google Boeken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Onyett praised Shimerman for his portrayal of Ryan, calling him a "joy to listen to" and adding that he would "give Stephen Colbert a run for his money."&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; 411 Mania editor Adam Larck agreed, praising the introduction Ryan gives to the player as they enter Rapture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/games/columns/116440|title=Best Video Game Voice Acting |last=Vote|first=Todd|date=17 September 2009|publisher=411mania|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game Chronicles editor Mark Smith praised the voice acting of the game, praising Shimerman's commitment to the story and theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamechronicles.com/reviews/ps3/bioshock/bioshock.htm|title=BioShock – Overview|last=Smith|first=Mark|date=29 November 2008|publisher=Game Chronicles|accessdate=10 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091102161942/http://www.gamechronicles.com/reviews/ps3/bioshock/bioshock.htm| archivedate= 2 November 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total PlayStation editor gave similar praise to Shimerman, commenting that he and Atlas' voice actor rounded out the cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totalplaystation.com/ps3/bioshock/reviews/8133/|title=BioShock finally comes to the PlayStation 3|last=Waits|first=Nick|date=25 November 2008|publisher=Total PlayStation|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worthplaying editor Brian Dumlao commented that Ryan's voice "conveys ... the struggle of a man whose ideals are being threatened by a rival businessman", and praising the delivery of the actors to why the story is so good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2008/11/2/reviews/56291/|title=PS3 Review – 'BioShock'|last=Dumlao|first=Brian|date=2 November 2008|publisher=Worth Playing|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their Game of the Year awards, [[IGN]] praised the voice acting, citing Ryan's speech he delivers to players as what convinced them.

He has been compared to several other characters in fiction and real life. Ryan's world of Rapture has been compared to that of [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Blog Critics editor described Ryan as arrogant, greedy, and naive, adding that these traits led Rapture to destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/gaming/article/a-demand-for-deeper-video-games/|title=A Demand for Deeper Video Games|last=Rainey|first=Tim|date=8 October 2009|publisher=[[Blogcritics]] Gaming|accessdate=10 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091012021811/http://blogcritics.org/gaming/article/a-demand-for-deeper-video-games/| archivedate= 12 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lou Kesten of the San Francisco Chronicle also made this comparison, comparing the name "Andrew Ryan" to the author, "Ayn Rand", in its similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/08/22/entertainment/e110646D06.DTL |title=Vid-Games: `Madden' Mania; `Shock' Waves |last=Kesten |first=Lou |date=22 August 2007 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=10 October 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onyett agreed, describing him as a "Randian hero".&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; He has also been compared to the [[eponymous]] character of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/bioshock|title=BioShock Review|last=Colin|date=21 August 2007|publisher=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Official Xbox Magazine]] editor Dan Griliopoulos likened his appearance to that of [[Gomez Addams]], the father from ''[[The Addams Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/1182/reviews/bioshock-review/|title=BioShock Review|last=Griliopoulos|first=Dan|date=24 August 2007|publisher=[[Official Xbox Magazine]]|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] editors Phil Pirrello and Christopher Monfette described him as being more communist than [[Vladimir Lenin]], the first head of state of the [[Soviet Union]], also comparing him to [[Italians|Italian]] philosopher and writer [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/12/big-screen-big-daddy?page=2 |title=Big Screen Big Daddy|last=Pirrello|first=Phil|last2=Christopher Monofette|date=12 May 2008|publisher=IGN|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While discussing potential actors who could portray Ryan in the upcoming ''BioShock'' film, IGN editors chose [[Anthony Hopkins]] as the perfect choice for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/20/bioshock-the-movie|title=BioShock: The Movie!|date=20 August 2007|publisher=IGN|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IGN later put Andrew Ryan at number 10 in their list of the Top 100 Videogame Villains, saying, "The force of his personality and clarity of his vision is admirable throughout the game. Rapture wouldn't be nearly as interesting without Ryan and his complementing the action and exploration, shouting propaganda and taking every opportunity to broadcast his world view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/videogame-villains/10.html|title=The Top 100 Videogame Villains – 10: Andrew Ryan|date=20 August 2007|publisher=IGN|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[PlayStation Official Magazine - UK|PlayStation Official Magazine]]'' placed him as the eighth best videogame villain on PS3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2012/10/24/the-top-playstation-villains/8/#gallery-top|title=10 of the best videogame villains on PS3|work=[[PlayStation Official Magazine - UK|PlayStation Official Magazine]]|date=24 October 2012|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2694">'''Anna "Anno" O'Rahilly (née Rahilly)''' (17 February 1873 – 1958) was an Irish revolutionary and [[Cumann na mBan]] member, republican prisoner and hunger-striker active in the period from 1916 to 1923.  Born in Ballylongford, Co. Kerry to grocer and nationalist public representative [[Richard Rahilly]] and Ellen Mangan, she was a sister of the 1916 leader [[The O'Rahilly]] and the Cummann na mBan leader [[Nell Humphreys]] (née Rahilly).&lt;ref&gt;http://theirishrevolution.ie/26845-2/&lt;/ref&gt;   She was educated at Ursuline College Waterford&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ursulinewaterford.ie/wp/alumni/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waterfordmuseum.ie/exhibit/web/Display/article/382/26/Waterfords_Revolutionary_Women_19161922_Anno_and_Nell_ORahilly.html&lt;/ref&gt; and became a member of the [[Gaelic League]]. Like The O'Rahilly, she changed her name from the original Rahilly.  In April 1914 she was one of a small group of women present at the founding of Cumann na mBan in Wynne's Hotel, Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waterfordmuseum.ie/exhibit/web/Display/article/382/26/Waterfords_Revolutionary_Women_19161922_Anno_and_Nell_ORahilly.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of her brother The O'Rahilly in combat in 1916 she was arrested and detained in the aftermath of the [[Easter rising]].She provided the first money to be handled by Dail Eireann in 1919, a loan for £2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://humphrysfamilytree.com/ORahilly/anno.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.generalmichaelcollins.com/life-times/finance/national-loan-191920/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Library of Ireland]] holds a letter from her appealing for money on behalf of republican prisoners' dependents.&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000540469&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Civil war, on 4 November 1922 she was accidentally shot in the family home in Ailesbury Road by [[Ernie O'Malley]]&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.waterfordmuseum.ie/exhibit/web/Display/article/382/26/Waterfords_Revolutionary_Women_19161922_Anno_and_Nell_ORahilly.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See https://books.google.ie/booksid=EiibBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&amp;lpg=PT54&amp;dq=anno+o%27rahilly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TqLFkU7Q_M&amp;sig=9udiR63qFILB1Bh8NgQ9qmlPdtE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDnt_i573TAhUrCMAKHSf8BjYQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=anno%20o'rahilly&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

After her recovery, she was detained for the rest of the civil war in Mountjoy Prison, Kilmainham Gaol and the North Dublin Union, where she was on hunger strike in October–November 1923.&lt;ref&gt;http://humphrysfamilytree.com/ORahilly/anno.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bat-Mite''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Bat-Mite is an [[imp]] similar to the [[Superman]] villain [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]. Depicted as a small, childlike man in an ill-fitting costume, Bat-Mite possesses what appear to be near-infinite magical powers, but he actually utilizes highly advanced technology from the fifth dimension that cannot be understood by humans' limited four-dimensional views. Unlike Mxyzptlk, Bat-Mite idolizes his superhero target and thus he has visited Batman on various occasions, often setting up strange events so that he could see his hero in action. Bat-Mite is more of a nuisance than a [[supervillain]], and often departs of his own accord upon realizing that he has angered his idol.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Beatty  | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Bat-Mite | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 39  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Publication history==
Bat-Mite made his first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #267 (May 1959) in a story titled "Batman Meets Bat-Mite" written by [[Bill Finger]], with art by [[Sheldon Moldoff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/15035/ ''Detective Comics'' #267 (DC, 1937 Series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character history==
===Pre-Crisis===
[[File:Bat Mite Cover.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to Detective Comics #267 (May 1959), art by [[Curt Swan]]]]

Bat-Mite regularly appeared in ''Batman'', ''Detective Comics'', and ''World's Finest Comics'' for five years. Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk teamed up four times in the pages of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' to plague Superman and Batman together, as well. In 1964, however, when the Batman titles were revamped under new editor [[Julius Schwartz]], Bat-Mite vanished along with the other extraneous members of the Batman family such as [[Ace the Bat-Hound]]. After this, only three more Bat-Mite stories were published in the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' DC Universe: two Bat-Mite/Mr. Mxyzptlk team ups in ''World's Finest Comics'' #152 (August 1965) and #169 (September 1967) (which were not edited by Schwartz but by [[Mort Weisinger]]), and "Bat-Mite's New York Adventure" from ''Detective Comics'' #482 (February–March 1979), in which the imp visits the DC Comics offices and insists that he be given his own feature in a Batman comic. This story featured protestors with [[Picketing (protest)|picket signs]] shouting "We want Bat-Mite!" outside the [[666 Fifth Avenue|Tishman Building]] (where DC's editorial offices were located at the time), and was accompanied by an editorial comment that this story was published specifically to acknowledge the actual requests of fans for this character's revival.

Later Bat-Mite appeared in a one-page story in the 200th issue of ''The Brave and the Bold''.

===Post-Crisis===
After the continuity-changing 1985 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was published, Bat-Mite was mostly removed from the Batman comics canon. Bat-Mite made an appearance in the series ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'', although he may have been the [[hallucination]] of a drug-addled criminal named Bob Overdog. This comic states that Bat-Mite is one of the many admirers of superheroes from another dimension. This version of Bat-Mite later appeared in ''Batman: Mitefall'', a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] book which was a parody of the "[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]" Batman storyline (with Overdog in the [[Azrael (comics)|Jean-Paul Valley]] role). In #6 of the 1999 ''World's Finest'' miniseries, Mr. Mxyzptlk encountered Bat-Mite, shortly after being mistaken for him by Overdog. While in this story the post-''Crisis'' Bat-Mite encountered Batman for the first time, Superman and Batman subsequently concluded that Mxyzptlk had created him, inspired by Overdog's ravings.

Bat-Mite also appeared in the 2000 one-shot [[Elseworlds]] comic special ''[[Superman and Batman: World's Funnest|World's Funnest]]'', in which he battles Mr. Mxyzptlk, destroying the pre-''Crisis'' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] and the post-''Crisis'' DC Universe, as well as the Elseworlds of ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and the [[DC animated universe]]. As an Elseworlds story itself, ''World's Funnest'' has no impact on continuity, as inferred from ''Dark Knight Returns'' and ''Kingdom Come'' being introduced to the official DC multiverse as a result of the series. ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The DC Comics Art of Alex Ross|last= Ross|first= Alex|authorlink=Alex Ross|year= 2003|publisher= Pantheon Books|ISBN= 978-0375422409 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from ''World's Funnest'', there has been no direct connection between Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk. In the ''Bizarro Comics'' anthology, Mxyzptlk's native 5th Dimension seemed to include beings similar to Bat-Mite and [[Johnny Thunder]]'s Thunderbolt. Neither of these comics are considered canonical; however, in a JLA/JSA crossover in ''[[Justice League|JLA]]'' and in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #78–80 it was revealed that both Mxyzptlk and Thunderbolt come from the 5th Dimension. [[Comic book letter column|Letter columns]] and writer interviews suggest that Bat-Mite comes from there as well, although this has never been shown thus far in the comic stories themselves.

In the post-''Crisis'' issue ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #25, it was revealed that [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] had gained Fifth Dimensional powers by maintaining the essence of Mr. Mxyzptlk from the earlier "Emperor Joker" storyline; at the end, [[Bizarro]] was able to extract this latent magical essence from the Joker, which manifested in a form recognizable as Bat-Mite.  As such, a Bat-Mite has been fully reestablished into the current continuity as an outgrowth of Mr. Mxyzptlk incubated within the Joker.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #25 (May 1, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' appearance of Bat-Mite was in ''Batman'' #672, written by [[Grant Morrison]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #672 (Feb. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Batman is confronted with Bat-Mite (or "Might") after being shot in the chest and suffering a heart attack. Might, who bears a green [[List of extraterrestrials in fiction by type#Insectoid and arachnid aliens|insectoid]] creature on his back, claims to have come from "Space B at the Fivefold Expansion of Zrfff"&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #674 (April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; (at times Zrfff has been used as the name of Mr. Mxyzptlk's home dimension). Only Batman sees him. As Batman is having an increasingly difficult time keeping his grip on reality during this period, it is possible that Mite is a mental delusion.

In ''Batman'' #678, after Batman transforms himself into "the [[Batman of Zur-En-Arrh]]", Might reappears on the last page with him, commenting "uh-oh" regarding Batman's increasing delusions. He then counsels the Zur-En-Arrh Batman, a 'back-up' personality manufactured by Bruce himself to keep Batman able to fight in case he was [[mindwipe]]d, or driven to insanity. ''Batman'' #680 reveals that Might is indeed a product of Batman's imagination, representing the last vestiges of Batman's rational mind within the Zur-En-Arrh Batman, although when asked by Batman whether he is an extra-dimensional being or a figment of his imagination, Bat-Mite responds that "the fifth dimension ''is'' imagination".&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #680 (Oct. 1, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Superman/Batman'' #52, Bat-Mite appears having had a bet with Mr. Mxyzptlk similar to that of ''World's Funnest''. This Bat-Mite appears to admire Batman, and Batman addresses him with familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #52(October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
On February 6, 2015, DC Comics announced a ''Bat-Mite'' monthly series for release in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2015/02/06/dc-entertainment-announces-new-books-new-creators-broader-focus-for-the-dc-universe DC ENTERTAINMENT ANNOUNCES NEW BOOKS, NEW CREATORS, BROADER FOCUS FOR THE DC UNIVERSE]&lt;/ref&gt; The six-issue series concluded in November.

===Television===
[[File:Batmanbatmite.JPG|thumb|right|Bat-Mite, Batman, and Robin from ''The New Adventures of Batman''.]]
* Bat-Mite was a regular character of the 1977 [[Filmation]] [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' voiced by [[Lou Scheimer]]. He was depicted as a well-meaning magical fan of the superhero. As such, he tried to help Batman even though he usually complicated matters, with a whiny "All I wanna do is help!" as a near-catchphrase. One episode featured his home planet called Ergo as well as a villain of Bat-Mite's species named Zarbor. He also has a crush on [[Batgirl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p5.html|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The New Adventures of Batman|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/28992/new-adventures-of-batman-the/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* An [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] Bat-Mite briefly appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Deep Freeze", voiced by [[Pat Fraley]]. Bat-Mite enthusiastically greeted Batman, saying "Greetings, Dynamic Duo! I'm your biggest fan!" before kissing Robin, who was shocked. It then malfunctions and falls apart stuttering "I just wanna help!". It is revealed just to be a robot toy, created by robotics expert Karl Rossum (voiced by [[William Sanderson]]). In the background, an animatronic [[Mister Mxyzptlk]], [[Streaky the Supercat]] and [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]] can also be seen in Rossum's apartment.

* Bat-Mite also appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episodes "Legends of the Dark Mite", "Emperor Joker", "Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases!" and the series finale, "Mitefall!", voiced by [[Paul Reubens]]. This version of Bat-Mite is powerful enough to regularly break the [[fourth wall]] and read to Batman his past, present and future exploits from real world comic books, and make fun of real-world comic convention fans.

* Bat-Mite appears in the television special ''[[Lego DC Comics: Batman Be-Leaguered]]'' voiced again by Paul Reubens. He was behind the abduction of the Justice League members and specific objects in order to eliminate the Justice League so that Batman can be the greatest hero in the universe. To do this, he became the mysterious benefactor to Lex Luthor, Joker, Penguin, Man-Bat, Captain Cold, and Black Manta in order to pull off the heists. When the Justice League members were abducted and placed in a cage, Bat-Mite assembled a special death trap that would be activated by the sun's rays. Batman arrives at the Hall of Justice where the captured Justice League members were held and informs them about his previous encounters with Bat-Mite. The Justice League members got out of the death trap when it turned out that the cage was unlocked. Bat-Mite ends up using his powers to summon the villains to fight Batman and the Justice League. When Batman and the Justice League defeat the villains, Bat-Mite makes them disappear and states that the Justice League has impressed him as he leaves. Batman warns the Justice League members that Bat-Mite may become fans of them as well.

===Video games===
* Bat-Mite appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]].

{{Gospel Jesus}}

The '''biblical Magi'''{{efn|[[Koine Greek|Greek]]: [[Wiktionary:μάγος|μάγοι]], ''magoi''}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|dʒ|aɪ}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary |publisher=[[Holman Bible Publishers]] |location=Nashville, Tennessee |year=2003 |page=1066 |isbn=0-8054-2836-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|dʒ|aɪ}}; singular: magus), also referred to as the ('''Three''') '''Wise Men''' or ('''Three''') '''Kings''', were, in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and Christian tradition, a group of distinguished foreigners who visited [[Jesus]] after his birth, bearing gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]]. They are regular figures in traditional accounts of the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] celebrations of [[Christmas]] and are an important part of Christian tradition.

[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] is the only of the four [[canonical gospels]] to mention the [[Magi]]. Matthew reports that they came "from the east" to worship the "king of the Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|2:1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel never mentions the number of Magi, but most [[Western Christianity|western Christian]] denominations have traditionally assumed them to have been three in number, based on the statement that they brought three gifts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geza Vermes]], ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', London, Penguin, 2006, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Eastern Christianity]], especially the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac churches]], the Magi often number twelve.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, 24 [80]&lt;/ref&gt; Their identification as kings in later Christian writings is probably linked to Psalm 72:11, "May all kings fall down before him".&lt;ref name = "EBO magi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/356642/Magi|title=Magi|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}} Online Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |work=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=Third |date= April 1910 |title=s.v. ''magi''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==
Traditional [[nativity scene]]s depict three "Wise Men" visiting the infant Jesus on the night of his birth, in a manger accompanied by the shepherds and angels, but this should be understood as an artistic convention allowing the two separate scenes of the [[Adoration of the Shepherds]] on the birth night and the later [[Adoration of the Magi]] to be combined for convenience.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 114&lt;/ref&gt;  The single biblical account in Matthew simply presents an event at an unspecified point after Christ's birth in which an unnumbered party of unnamed "wise men" ("μάγοι") visits him in a house ("οἰκίαν"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%202|title=Matthew 2|work=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt; not a stable, with only "his mother" mentioned as present. The [[New Revised Standard Version]] of [[Matthew 2:1]]–[[Matthew 2:12|12]] describes the visit of the Magi in this manner:

{{quote|In the time of [[Herod the Great|King Herod]], after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage." When King Herod heard this, he was frightened and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet: 'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.{{'"}} Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage." When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another path.}}

The text specifies no interval between the birth and the visit, and artistic depictions and the closeness of the traditional dates of December 25 and January 6 encourage the popular assumption that the visit took place the same winter as the birth, but later traditions varied, with the visit taken as occurring up to two winters later. This maximum interval explained Herod's command at [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:16|Matthew 2:16–18]] that the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] included boys up to two years old. More recent commentators, not tied to the traditional feast days, may suggest a variety of intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 96; ''The New Testament'' by Bart D. Ehrman 1999 {{ISBN|0-19-512639-4}} p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The wise men are mentioned twice shortly thereafter in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:16|verse 16]], in reference to their avoidance of [[Herod the Great|Herod]] after seeing Jesus, and what Herod had learned from their earlier meeting. The star which they followed has traditionally become known as the [[Star of Bethlehem]].

==Description==
The Magi are popularly referred to as ''wise men'' and ''kings''. The word ''magi'' is the plural of [[Latin language|Latin]] ''magus'', borrowed from [[Greek language|Greek]] μάγος ''magos'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third edition, April 2010, ''s.v.'' magus&lt;/ref&gt; as used in the original Greek text of the Gospel of Matthew ("μάγοι"). Greek ''magos'' itself is derived from [[Old Persian]] ''maguŝ'' from the [[Avestan]] ''magâunô'', i.e., the religious caste into which [[Zoroaster]] was born (see [[Yasna]] 33.7: "ýâ sruyê parê magâunô" = "so I can be heard beyond Magi"). The term refers to the Persian priestly [[caste]] of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Boyce]], ''A History of Zoroastrianism: The Early Period'' (Brill, 1989, 2nd ed.), vol. 1, pp. 10–11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=F3gfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22in+the+distant+nomadic+days%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0 online]; Mary Boyce, ''Zoroastrians: their religious beliefs and practices'' (Routledge, 2001, 2nd ed.), p. 48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=%22Iranian+plateau.+according+to+Herodotus%+inauthor:boyce&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0 online]; Linda Murray, ''The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 293; Stephen Mitchell, ''A History of the Later Roman Empire, AD 284–641: The Transformation of the Ancient World'' (Wiley–Blackwell, 2007), p. 387 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-FDJi3tiUjUC&amp;pg=PA387&amp;dq=magus+Zoroastrian+priestly+caste&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of their religion, these priests paid particular attention to the stars and gained an international reputation for [[astrology]], which was at that time highly regarded as a science. Their religious practices and use of astrology caused derivatives of the term ''Magi'' to be applied to the [[occult]] in general and led to the English term ''[[magick (paranormal)|magic]]'', although Zoroastrianism was in fact strongly opposed to [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcery]]. The [[King James Version]] translates the term as ''wise men''; the same translation is applied to the wise men led by [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] of earlier Hebrew Scriptures ({{bibleverse||Daniel|2:48|KJV}}).  The same word is given as ''sorcerer'' and ''sorcery'' when describing "[[Elymas]] the sorcerer" in {{bibleverse||Acts|13:6–11|NKJV}}, and [[Simon Magus]], considered a [[heresy|heretic]] by the early Church, in {{bibleverse||Acts|8:9–13|NKJV}}. Several translations refer to the men outright as [[astrologer]]s at Matthew Chapter 2, including [[New English Bible]] (1961); [[Phillips New Testament in Modern English]] (J.B.Phillips, 1972);  [[Twentieth Century New Testament]] (1904 revised edition); [[Amplified Bible]] (1958-New Testament); [[An American Translation]] (1935, Goodspeed); and [[The Living Bible]] (K. Taylor, 1962-New Testament).

Although the Magi are commonly referred to as "kings," there is nothing in the account from the Gospel of Matthew that implies that they were rulers of any kind. The identification of the Magi as kings is linked to Old Testament prophecies that describe the Messiah being worshipped by kings in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 60:3, [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 68:29, and Psalm 72:10, which reads, "Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations serve him."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+72%3A11&amp;version=KJV Psalm 72:11] (King James Version)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Magi". ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;s.v. magi. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (Third ed.). April 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Early readers reinterpreted Matthew in light of these prophecies and elevated the Magi to kings.

Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 24 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Christian interpretation stressed the Adorations of the Magi and shepherds as the first recognition by the people of the earth of Christ as the Redeemer, but the reformer [[John Calvin]] was vehemently opposed to referring to the Magi as kings. He once wrote: "But the most ridiculous contrivance of the Papists on this subject is, that those men were kings... Beyond all doubt, they have been stupefied by a righteous judgment of God, that all might laugh at [their] gross ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, Chad.

One candidate for the origin of the name Caspar appears in the [[Acts of Thomas]] as ''[[Gondophares]]'' (21 – c. AD 47), i.e., Gudapharasa (from which "Caspar" might derive as corruption of "Gaspar"). This Gondophares declared independence from the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]]s to become the first [[Indo-Parthian]] king, and he was allegedly visited by [[Thomas the Apostle]]. According to Ernst Herzfeld, his name is perpetuated in the name of the Afghan city [[Kandahar]], which he is said to have founded under the name Gundopharron.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Herzfeld, ''Archaeological History of Iran'', London,  Oxford University Press for the British Academy, 1935, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, many [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian Christians]] name the Magi ''[[Avesta#The Vendidad|Larvandad]]'', ''[[list of names for the Biblical nameless|Gushnasaph]]'', and ''[[Ahura Mazda|Hormisdas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Witold Witakowski, "The Magi in Syriac Tradition", in George A. Kiraz (ed.), ''Malphono w-Rabo d-Malphone: Studies in Honor of Sebastian P. Brock'', Piscataway (NJ), Gorgias Press, 2008, pp. 809–844.&lt;/ref&gt; These names have a far greater likelihood of being originally Persian, though that does not guarantee their authenticity.

In the Eastern churches, [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Christianity]], for instance, has ''Hor'', ''Karsudan'', and ''Basanater'', while the Armenian Catholics have ''Kagpha'', ''Badadakharida'' and ''Badadilma''.&lt;ref name="Acta Sanct"&gt;''Acta Sanctorum'', May, I, 1780.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carols"&gt;[http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Text/concerning_the_magi_and_their_na.htm Concerning The Magi And Their Names].&lt;/ref&gt;
Many [[Christianity in China#Christianity in the contemporary PRC|Chinese Christians]] believe that one of the magi came from China.&lt;ref&gt;Hattaway, Paul; Brother Yun; Yongze, Peter Xu; and Wang, Enoch. ''Back to Jerusalem.'' (Authentic Publishing, 2003). retrieved May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country of origin and journey==
The phrase ''from the east'' (ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν), more literally ''from the rising [of the sun]'', is the only information Matthew provides about the region from which they came. The [[Parthian Empire]], centered in Persia, occupied virtually all of the land east of Judea and Syria (except for the deserts of Arabia to the southeast). Though the empire was tolerant of other religions, its dominant religion was Zoroastrianism, with its priestly magos class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Axworthy |first=Michael |year=2008 |title=A History of Iran |publisher=Basic Books |page=31–43 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Matthew's account does not explicitly cite the motivation for their journey (other than seeing the star in the east, which they took to be the star of the King of the Jews), the [[Syriac Infancy Gospel]] provides some clarity by stating explicitly in the third chapter that they were pursuing a prophecy from their prophet, Zoradascht ([[Zoroaster]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hone, William (1890 (4th edit); 1820 (1st edition)).

See: Retrieved 26 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] tradition identifying the "Magi of Bethlehem" as [[Balthazar (Magus)|Balthasar]] of Arabia, [[Melchior (Magi)|Melchior]] of Persia, and [[Saint Caspar|Gaspar]] of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Vrej |last1=Nersessian |year=2001 |title=The Bible in the Armenian Tradition |publisher=Getty |isbn=978-0-89236-640-8}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[John of Hildesheim]] relates a tradition in the ancient [[silk road]] city of [[Taxila]] (near [[Islamabad]] in Pakistan) that one of the Magi passed through the city on the way to Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Trium Regum'' (''History of the Three Kings'') by John of Hildesheim (1364–1375){{Specify|date=January 2012|reason=needs a page number or direct quote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebastian Brock, a historian of Christianity, has said: "It was no doubt among converts from Zoroastrianism that… certain legends were developed around the Magi of the Gospels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sebastian |last1=Brock |chapter=Christians in the Sasanian Empire: A Case of Divided Loyalties |title=Religion and National Identity |editor1-first=Stuart |editor1-last=Mews |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell |year=1982 |series=Studies in Church History, 18 |pages=1–19 |isbn=978-0-631-18060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ugo Monneret de Villard,  ''Le Leggende orientali sui Magi evangelici'',  Citta del Vaticano, Biblioteca apostolica vaticana, 1952.{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Anders Hultgård concluded that the Gospel story of the Magi was influenced by an Iranian legend concerning magi and a star, which was connected with Persian beliefs in the rise of a star predicting the birth of a ruler and with myths describing the manifestation of a divine figure in fire and light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Anders |last1=Hultgård |chapter=The Magi and the Star—the Persian Background in Texts and Iconography |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Schalk |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Stausberg |title='Being Religious and Living through the Eyes': Studies in Religious Iconography and Iconology: A Celebratory Publication in Honour of Professor Jan Bergman |publisher=Uppsala, Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International |year=1998 |series=Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis: Historia Religionum, 14 |pages=215–25 |isbn=978-91-554-4199-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A model for the homage of the Magi might have been provided, it has been suggested, by the journey to Rome of King [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]] of Armenia, with his magi, to pay homage to the [[Emperor Nero]], which took place in 66 AD, a few years before the date assigned to the composition of the Gospel of Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;A.

There was a tradition that the Central Asian [[Naimans]] and their Christian relatives, the [[Keraites]], were descended from the biblical Magi.&lt;ref&gt;''In regno Tarsae sunt tres provinciae, quarum dominatores se reges faciunt appellari. Homines illius patriae nominant Iogour. Semper idola coluerunt, et adhuc colunt omnes, praeter decem cognationes illorum regum, qui per demonstrationum stellae venerunt adorare nativitatem in Bethlehem Judae. Et adhuc multi magni et nobiles inveniunt inter Tartaros de cognatione illa, qui tenent firmiter fidem Christi.'' (In the kingdom of Tarsis there are three provinces, whose rulers have called themselves kings. the men of that country are called Uighours. They always worshipped idols, and they all still worship them except for the ten families of those Kings who from the appearance of the Star came to adore the Nativity in Bethlehem of Judah.

==Gestures of respect==
[[Image:Bartolomé Esteban Murillo - Adoration of the Magi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Adorazione dei Magi'' by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]], c. 1655 ([[Toledo Museum of Art]], [[Ohio]]]]

The Magi are described as "falling down", "kneeling" or "bowing" in the worship of Jesus.&lt;ref name="mat:202:64"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%202;&amp;version=64; |title=Matthew 2; – Passage Lookup – New International Version – UK |publisher=BibleGateway.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gesture, together with Luke's birth narrative, had an important effect on Christian religious practices. They were indicative of great respect, and typically used when venerating a king. While prostration is now rarely practised in the West it is still relatively common in the Eastern Churches, especially during [[Lent]]. Kneeling has remained an important element of Christian worship to this day.

== Traditional identities and symbolism ==
Apart from their names, the three Magi developed distinct characteristics in Christian tradition, so that between them they represented the three ages of (adult) man, three geographical and cultural areas, and sometimes other things.  In the normal Western account, reflected in art by the 14th century (for example in the [[Arena Chapel]] by [[Giotto]] in 1305) Caspar is old, normally with a white beard, and gives the gold; he is "King of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], land of merchants" on the Mediterranean coast of modern Turkey, and is first in line to kneel to Christ.  Melchior is middle-aged, giving frankincense from his native [[Arabia]], and Balthazar is a young man, very often and increasingly black-skinned, with myrrh from [[Sabaeans|Saba]] (modern south [[Yemen]]).  Their ages were often given as 60, 40 and 20 respectively, and their geographical origins were rather variable, with Balthazar increasingly coming from [[Ethiopia]] or other parts of Africa, and being represented accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 401&lt;/ref&gt;  Balthazar's blackness has been the subject of considerable recent scholarly attention; in art it is found mostly in northern Europe, beginning from the 12th century, and becoming very common in the north by the 15th.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gifts==
Three gifts are explicitly identified in Matthew: [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]], in [[Koine Greek]]: ''chrysós'' ([[Wiktionary:χρυσός|χρυσός]]), ''líbanos'' ([[Wiktionary:λίβανος|λίβανος]]) and ''smýrna'' ([[Wiktionary:σμύρνα|σμύρνα]]). Many different theories of the meaning and symbolism of the gifts have been brought forward. While gold is fairly obviously explained, frankincense, and particularly myrrh, are much more obscure. See the previous section for who gave which.

[[Image:Early Christian Magi.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|One of the earliest known depictions from a third-century sarcophagus ([[Vatican Museums]]). The clothing of the Magi here is typical of [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] nobles.]]

The theories generally break down into two groups:
#All three gifts are ordinary offerings and gifts given to a king. Myrrh being commonly used as an anointing oil, frankincense as a perfume, and gold as a valuable.
#The three gifts had a spiritual meaning: gold as a symbol of kingship on earth, frankincense (an [[incense]]) as a symbol of deity, and myrrh (an embalming oil) as a symbol of death.
#:*This dates back to [[Origen]] in ''[[Contra Celsum]]'': "gold, as to a king; myrrh, as to one who was mortal; and incense, as to a God."&lt;ref&gt;[[Origen]], ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04161.htm I.60].&lt;/ref&gt;
#:*These interpretations are alluded to in the verses of the popular carol "[[We Three Kings]]" in which the magi describe their gifts. The last verse includes a summary of the interpretation: "Glorious now behold Him arise/King and God and sacrifice."
#:*Sometimes this is described more generally as gold symbolizing virtue, frankincense symbolizing [[prayer]], and myrrh symbolizing suffering.

Myrrh was used as an embalming ointment and as a penitential incense in funerals and cremations until the 15th century. The "holy oil" traditionally used by the Eastern Orthodox Church for performing the sacraments of chrismation and unction is traditionally scented with myrrh, and receiving either of these sacraments is commonly referred to as "receiving the myrrh". The picture of the Magi on the 7th century [[Franks Casket]] shows the third visitor – he who brings myrrh – with a [[valknut]] over his back, a pagan symbol referring to Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franks-casket.de/english/front02.html|title=Franks Casket - F - panel (Front) - Pictures: The Magi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by scholars that the "gifts" were [[medicinal]] rather than precious material for [[tribute]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, Sophie,"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dr5RkceEK3wC Magic In Medieval Manuscripts]''".

The Syrian King [[Seleucus II Callinicus]] is recorded to have offered gold, frankincense and myrrh (among other items) to [[Apollo]] in his temple at [[Miletus]] in 243 BC, and this may have been the precedent for the mention of these three gifts in Gospel of Matthew ([[Matthew 2:11|2:11]]).  It was these three gifts, it is thought, which were the chief cause for the number of the Magi becoming fixed eventually at three.&lt;ref&gt;August Friedrich von Pauly et al., ''Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft'', Vol. XVI, 1, Stuttgart, 1933, col.1145; Leonardo Olschki, "The Wise Men of the East in Oriental Traditions", ''Semitic and Oriental Studies'', University of California Publications in Semitic Philology, Vol.11, 1951, pp. 375 ''395'', p. 380, n. 46; cited in Mary Boyce and Frantz Genet, ''A History of Zoroastrianism'', Leiden, Brill, 1991, p. 450, n. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode can be linked to {{bibleverse||Isaiah|60|NRSV}} and to {{bibleverse||Psalm|72|NRSV}}, which report gifts being given by kings, and this has played a central role in the perception of the Magi as kings, rather than as astronomer-priests. In a hymn of the late 4th-century [[hispanic]] poet [[Prudentius]], the three gifts have already gained their medieval interpretation as prophetic [[emblem]]s of Jesus' identity, familiar in the carol "[[We Three Kings]]" by [[John Henry Hopkins, Jr.]], 1857.

[[John Chrysostom]] suggested that the gifts were fit to be given not just to a king but to God, and contrasted them with the Jews' traditional offerings of sheep and calves, and accordingly Chrysostom asserts that the Magi worshiped Jesus as God.

[[File:7222 Adoración de los Reyes Magos.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.5|''Adoración de los Reyes Magos'' by [[El Greco]], 1568 ([[Museo Soumaya]], [[Mexico City]])]]

What subsequently happened to these gifts is never mentioned in the scripture, but several traditions have developed.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, John Chisholm, in [[James Hastings]] (ed.) ''A Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels''. Page 100.&lt;/ref&gt; One story has the gold being stolen by the two thieves who were later crucified alongside Jesus. Another tale has it being entrusted to and then misappropriated by [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]. One tradition suggests that Joseph and Mary used the gold to finance their travels when they fled Bethlehem after an angel had warned, in a dream, about [[Herod the Great|King Herod's]] plan to kill Jesus. And another story proposes the theory that the myrrh given to them at Jesus' birth was used to anoint Jesus' body after his crucifixion.

There was a 15th-century golden case purportedly containing the Gift of the Magi housed in the Monastery of St. Paul of [[Mount Athos]]. It was donated to the monastery in the 15th century by [[Mara Branković]], daughter of the [[King of Serbia]] [[Đurađ Branković]], wife to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Murat II]] and godmother to [[Mehmet II]] the Conqueror (of [[Constantinople]]). After the Athens earthquake of September 9, 1999 they were temporarily displayed in [[Athens]] in order to strengthen faith and raise money for earthquake victims. The relics were displayed in Ukraine and Belarus in Christmas of 2014, and thus left Greece for the first time since the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/non-political/715098|title=Gifts of the Magi delivered to Minsk for worship|publisher=[[ITAR-TASS]]|date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martyrdom traditions==
[[File:Three kings.tif|thumb|upright=1.5|The Three Wise Kings, ''[[Catalan Atlas]],'' 1375, fol. V: "This province is called Tarshish, from which came the Three Wise Kings, and they came to Bethlehem in Judaea with their gifts and worshipped Jesus Christ, and they are entombed in the city of Cologne two days journey from Bruges."]]

Christian Scriptures record nothing about the biblical Magi after reporting their going back to their own country (Matthew 2:12 uses the feminine singular noun, χώραν, noting one country, territory or region of origin). Two separate traditions have surfaced claiming that they were so moved by their encounter with Jesus that they either became Christians on their own or were quick to convert fully upon later encountering an Apostle of Jesus. The traditions claim that they were so strong in their beliefs that they willingly embraced martyrdom.

===Chronicon of Dexter===
One tradition gained popularity in Spain during the 17th century; it was found in a work called the Chronicon of Dexter. The work was ascribed to [[Flavius Lucius Dexter]] the bishop of Barcelona, under [[Theodosius I|Theodosius the Great]]. The tradition appears in the form of a simple martyrology reading, "In Arabia Felix, in the city of Sessania of the Adrumeti, the martyrdom of the holy kings, the three Magi, Gaspar, Balthassar, and Melchior who adored Christ."&lt;ref name="Breen"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Harmonized Exposition of the Four Gospels, Volume 1|author=Andrew Edward Breen|location=Rochester, New York|date=February 1, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; First appearing in 1610, the Chronicon of Dexter was immensely popular along with the traditions it contained throughout the 17th century. Later, this was all brought into question when historians and the Catholic hierarchy in Rome declared the work a pious forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|article=On certain Literary Frauds and Forgeries in Spain And Italy|title=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Vol 8|author=R. R. Madden, M.D.|year=1864|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relics at Cologne===
A competing tradition asserts that the biblical Magi "were martyred for the faith, and that their bodies were first venerated at [[Constantinople]]; thence they were transferred to [[Milan]] in 344. It is certain that when [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (Barbarossa) [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor#First Italian Campaign: 1154–55|imposed his authority on Milan]], the relics there were transferred to [[Cologne Cathedral]], housed in the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]], and are venerated there today."&lt;ref name="Breen"/&gt;  The Milanese treated the fragments of masonry from their now-empty tomb as secondary relics and these were widely distributed around the region, including southern France, accounting for the frequency with which the Magi appear on [[Chasse (casket)|chasse]] [[Reliquary|reliquaries]] in [[Limoges enamel]].&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier M-M. and François G., ''Émaux méridionaux: Catalogue international de l'oeuvre de Limoges – Tome I: Epoque romane'', p. 11, Paris 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tombs==
There are several traditions on where the remains of the Magi are located, although none of the traditions is considered as an established fact or even as particularly likely by secular history. [[Marco Polo]] claimed that he was shown the three tombs of the Magi at [[Saveh]] south of [[Tehran]] in the 1270s:

{{quote|text=In Persia is the city of Saba, from which the Three Magi set out and in this city they are buried, in three very large and beautiful monuments, side by side. And above them there is a square building, beautifully kept. The bodies are still entire, with hair and beard remaining.|sign=Marco Polo|source=Polo, Marco, ''The Book of the Million'', book i.}}

Paul William Roberts provides some modern-day corroboration of this possibility in his book ''Journey of the Magi''.&lt;ref&gt;''Journey of the Magi'', Paul William Roberts, (2006) Tauris Parke Paperbacks, pgs 27-38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cologne Cathedral Shrine of Magi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] in [[Cologne Cathedral]], Germany, c. 1200.]]

A [[Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral]], according to tradition, contains the bones of the Three Wise Men. Reputedly they were first discovered by [[Helena of Constantinople|Saint Helena]] on her famous pilgrimage to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the Holy Lands. She took the remains to the church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]]; they were later moved to [[Milan]] (some sources say by the city's bishop, [[Eustorgius I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/70600 |title=Sant' Eustorgio I di Milano |publisher=Santiebeati.it |date=2001-09-09 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;), before being sent to their current resting place by the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] in 1164. The Milanese celebrate their part in the tradition by holding a medieval costume parade every 6 January.

A version of the detailed elaboration familiar to us is laid out by the 14th century cleric [[John of Hildesheim]]'s ''Historia Trium Regum'' ("History of the Three Kings"). In accounting for the presence in Cologne of their mummified relics, he begins with the journey of [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], mother of [[Constantine I]] to Jerusalem, where she recovered the [[True Cross]] and other relics:

[[File:Reliquary Three Wise Men MNMA Cl23822.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Journey of the Magi'' (top) and ''Adoration of the Magi'' (side) on a [[Limoges]] [[champlevé]] [[Chasse (casket)|chasse]], c. 1200 ([[Musée de Cluny]], Paris)]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Queen Helen… began to think greatly of the bodies of these three kings, and she arrayed herself, and accompanied by many attendants, went into the Land of Ind… after she had found the bodies of Melchior, Balthazar, and Gaspar, Queen Helen put them into one chest and ornamented it with great riches, and she brought them into Constantinople... and laid them in a church that is called Saint Sophia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religious significance==
The visit of the Magi is commemorated in most [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] churches by the observance of [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]], 6 January, which also serves as the feast of the three as saints.  The [[Eastern Orthodox]] celebrate the visit of the Magi on 25 December.

[[Qur'an]] omits Matthew's episode of the Magi. However, the Persian Muslim encyclopaedist [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], writing in the 9th century, gives the familiar symbolism of the gifts of the Magi. Al-Tabari gave his source for the information to be the later 7th century Perso-Yemenite writer [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]].&lt;ref name="Munabbih"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198006/we.three.kings.of.orient.were.htm |title=We, three kings of Orient were |publisher=Saudiaramcoworld.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113083949/http://saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198006/we.three.kings.of.orient.were.htm |archive-date=2010-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
{{See also|Mystery Play of the Three Magic Kings}}

Holidays celebrating the arrival of the Magi traditionally recognise a distinction between the date of their arrival and the date of Jesus' birth. The account given in the Gospel of Matthew does not state that they were present on the night of the birth; in the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary remain in Bethlehem until it is time for Jesus' dedication, in Jerusalem, and then return to their home in Nazareth.

===Spanish customs===
[[Image:Reyes Magos en centro comercial.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Three Wise Men receiving children at a shopping centre in Spain. Letters with gift requests are left in the letterbox on the left-hand side.]]

Western Christianity celebrates the Magi on the day of [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]], January 6, the day immediately following the ''[[twelve days of Christmas]]'', particularly in the [[Hispanosphere|Spanish-speaking parts of the world]]. In these areas, the Three Kings ("''los Reyes Magos de Oriente''", and "''Los Tres Reyes Magos''" or simply "''Los Reyes Magos''") receive letters from children and so bring them gifts on the night before Epiphany. In Spain, each one of the Magi is supposed to represent one different continent, Europe (Melchior), Asia (Caspar) and Africa (Balthasar). According to the tradition, the Magi come from the [[Orient]] on their [[camel]]s to visit the houses of all the children, much like ''[[Sinterklaas]]'' and [[Santa Claus]] with his reindeer elsewhere, they visit everyone in one night. In some areas, children prepare a drink for each of the Magi. It is also traditional to prepare food and drink for the camels, because this is the only night of the year when they eat.

In Spain, Argentina, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay, there is a long tradition for having the children receive presents by the three "''Reyes Magos''" on the night of January 5 (Epiphany Eve) or morning of January 6. Almost every Spanish city or town organises ''[[Cavalcade of Magi|cabalgatas]]'' in the evening, in which the ''kings'' and their ''servants'' parade and throw sweets to the children (and parents) in attendance. The ''cavalcade of the three kings'' in [[Alcoy (Spain)|Alcoy]] claims to be the oldest in the world, having started in 1886. The [[Mystery Play of the Three Magic Kings]] is also presented on Epiphany Eve. There is also a "Roscón" (Spain) or "Rosca de Reyes" (Mexico) as explained below.

In the Philippines, beliefs concerning the Three Kings ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Tatlóng Haring Mago'', lit. "Three Magi Kings"; shortened to ''Tatlóng Harì'' or [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] ''Tres Reyes'') follows Hispanic influence, with the Feast of the Epiphany considered by many Filipinos as the traditional end of [[Christmas in the Philippines|their Christmas season]]. The tradition of the Three Kings' ''[[Cavalcade of Magi|cabalgada]]'' is today done only in some areas, such as the old city of [[Intramuros]] in [[Manila]], and the island of [[Marinduque]]. Another dying custom is children leaving shoes out on Epiphany Eve, so that they may receive sweets and money from the Three Kings. With the arrival of American culture in the early 20th century, the Three Kings as gift-givers have been largely replaced in urban areas by [[Santa Claus]], and they only survive in the greeting "Happy Three Kings!" and the [[Filipino name|surname]] ''Tatlóngharì''. The Three Kings are especially revered in [[Gapan, Nueva Ecija]], where they are enshrined as [[patron saint]]s in the [[National Shrine of Virgen La Divina Pastora]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In Paraguay, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, children cut grass or greenery on January 5 and put it in a box under their bed for the Kings' camels.  Children receive gifts on January 6, which is called ''Día de Reyes'', and is traditionally the day in which the Magi arrived bearing gifts for the Christ child. Christmas starts in December and ends in January after Epiphany, although in Puerto Rico there are eight more days of celebration (''las octavitas'').

====Campaign for a real black Balthazar in Spain====
In 2009 a campaign started in Spain over the fact that Balthazar is commonly played by a white person in [[blackface]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101213132147/http://www.guinguinbali.com/index.php?lang=es&amp;mod=news&amp;task=view_news&amp;cat=2&amp;id=1211 News about blackface Balthazars] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425123248/http://www.wanafrika.org/2010/12/no-mas-baltasares-pintados.html Vídeo demanding true black Baltazars] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:01 Das katholische Fest der Heiligen drei Könige 2013 in Sanok.JPG|thumb|''Sternsinger'' – Christmas carolers in [[Sanok]], Poland.]]

A tradition in Poland and German-speaking Catholic areas is the writing of the three kings' initials (''C+M+B'' or ''C M B'', or ''K+M+B'' in those areas where Caspar is spelled Kaspar) above the main door of Catholic homes in chalk. This is a new year's blessing for the occupants and the initials also are believed to also stand for "''Christus mansionem benedicat''" ("May/Let Christ Bless This House").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsensibility.wordpress.com/2006/01/05/113647675145151910/ |title=Christus Mansionem Benedicat « Catholic Sensibility |publisher=Catholicsensibility.wordpress.com |date=2006-01-05 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the city or town, this will be happen sometime between Christmas and the Epiphany, with most municipalities celebrating closer to the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. Also in Catholic parts of the German-speaking world, these markings are made by the "''Sternsinger''" (literally, "[[star singers]]") – a group of children dressed up as the magi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Sternsingen |title=Duden &amp;#124; Sternsingen &amp;#124; Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition |language=German |publisher=Duden.de |date=2012-10-30 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sternsinger'' carry a star representing the one followed by the biblical magi and sing [[Christmas carol]]s as they go door to door, such as "[[Stern über Bethlehem]]". An adult chaperones the group but stays in the background of the performance. After singing, the children write the three kings' initials on the door frame in exchange for charitable donations. Each year, German and Austrian dioceses pick one charity towards which all ''Sternsinger'' donations nationwide will be contributed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Traditionally, one child in the ''Sternsinger'' group is said to represent Baltasar from Africa and so, that child typically wears [[blackface]] makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name bedeutet: Gott schütze sein Leben (babylon.-hebr.) |url=http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienB/Balthasar.htm |title=Balthasar – Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon |publisher=Heiligenlexikon.de |date=2007-03-25 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02226c.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Baltasar |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://black-face.com/blackface-world.htm |title=Blackface!

=== Roscón de Reyes ===
{{Main|Roscón de Reyes}}

In Spain and in Portugal (where it is called [[Bolo-rei]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matosinhoshoje.com/index.asp?idEdicao=448&amp;id=23655&amp;idSeccao=3427&amp;Action=noticia À mesa com o tradicional Bolo-rei – Uma instituição nacional] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100601042822/http://www.matosinhoshoje.com/index.asp?idEdicao%3D448 |date=2010-06-01 }} Matosinhos Hoje, 6 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;), the cake, which is ring-shaped, is most commonly bought, not baked, and it contains both a small [[figurine]] of one of the Magi (or another surprise depending on the region) and an actual dry [[broad bean]]. The one who gets the figurine is "crowned" (with a crown made of cardboard or paper), but whoever gets the bean has to pay the value of the cake to the person who originally bought it. In Mexico they also have the same ring-shaped cake ''Rosca de Reyes'' (Kings Bagel or Thread) with figurines inside it. Whoever gets a figurine is supposed to organize and be the host of the family celebration for the ''[[Candlemas|Candelaria]]'' feast on February 2.

In France and Belgium, a cake containing a small figure of the baby Jesus, known as the "broad bean", is shared within the family. Whoever gets the bean is crowned king for the remainder of the holiday and wears a cardboard crown purchased with the cake. A similar practice is common in many areas of Switzerland, but the figurine is a miniature king. The practice is known as ''tirer les Rois'' (Drawing the Kings).  A queen is sometimes also chosen.

In [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], parts of southern [[Texas]], and surrounding regions, a similar ring-shaped cake known as a "[[King Cake]]" traditionally becomes available in bakeries from Epiphany to [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]]. The baby Jesus figurine is inserted into the cake from underneath, and the person who gets the slice with the figurine is expected to buy or bake the next King Cake. There is wide variation among the types of pastry that may be called a King Cake, but most are a baked cinnamon-flavoured twisted dough with thin frosting and additional sugar on top in the [[New Orleans Mardi Gras#Traditional colors|traditional Mardi Gras colours]] of gold, green and purple. To prevent accidental injury or choking, the baby Jesus figurine is frequently not inserted into the cake at the bakery, but included in the packaging for optional use by the buyer to insert it themselves. Mardi Gras-style beads and [[doubloon]]s may be included as well.

{{Main|Adoration of the Magi}}
[[Image:Fra Angelico, Fra Filippo Lippi, The Adoration of the Magi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Adoration of the Magi (Fra Angelico and Filippo Lippi)|''Adoration of the Magi'']], [[tondo (art)|tondo]] by [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Filippo Lippi]], c. 1450 ([[National Gallery of Art|NGA]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]])]]

The Magi most frequently appear in European art in the ''Adoration of the Magi''; less often in the ''Journey of the Magi'' has been a popular subject in art, and ''[[literary topos|topos]]'', and other scenes such as the ''Magi before Herod'' and the ''Dream of the Magi'' also appear in the Middle Ages. In [[Byzantine art]] they are depicted as Persians, wearing trousers and [[phrygian cap]]s. Crowns appear from the 10th century. Despite being saints, they are very often shown without [[halo (religious iconography)|halos]], perhaps to avoid distracting attention from either their crowns or the halos of the [[Holy Family]]. Sometimes only the lead king, kneeling to Christ, has a halo the two others lack, probably indicating that the two behind had not yet performed the act of worship that would ensure their status as saints. Medieval artists also [[allegory|allegorised]] the theme to represent the three [[Ages of Man|ages of man]]. Beginning in the 12th century, and very often by the 15th, the Kings also represent the three parts of the known (pre-Columbian) world in Western art, especially in Northern Europe. Balthasar is thus represented as a young African or [[Moors|Moor]] and Caspar may be depicted with distinctly [[Oriental]] features.

An early [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon depiction]] survives on the [[Franks Casket]] (early 7th century, whalebone carving), the only Christian scene, which is combined with pagan and classical imagery. In its composition it follows the oriental style, which renders a courtly scene, with the Virgin and Christ facing the spectator, while the Magi devoutly approach from the (left) side. Even amongst non-Christians who had heard of the Christian story of the Magi, the motif was quite popular, since the Magi had endured a long journey and were generous. Instead of an angel, the picture places a swan-like bird, perhaps interpretable as the hero's [[fylgja]] (a protecting spirit, and [[shapeshifter]]).

Austrian artist [[Gottfried Helnwein]] depicted a more controversial tableau in his painting, ''[[:File:Gh293.jpg|Epiphany I: Adoration of the Magi]]'' (1996). Intended to represent the "many connections between the Third Reich and the Christian churches in Austria and Germany",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Kenneth |last= Baker |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Dark and detached, the art of Gottfried Helnwein demands a response. |url= |work= San Francisco Chronicle |publisher= accessed with [[EBSCOHost]] |date= 9 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi officers in uniform stand around an [[Aryan]] Madonna.

More generally they appear in popular [[Nativity scene]]s and other [[Christmas]] decorations that have their origins in the [[Napoli|Neapolitan]] variety of the Italian ''presepio'' or Nativity crèche.

'''Breton Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of [[Breton people|Breton]] descent or a [[Brittany]]-born person who resides in [[Canada]].

According to the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]], 11,845 Canadians claimed that they had full or partial Breton ancestry. However, the ''Amicale des Parents d'Émigrés d'Amérique du Nord'' (Association of Relatives of Emigrants to North America), an organisation headquartered in [[Gourin]], [[Brittany]], has estimated that around 45,000 Bretons immigrated to Canada between the years of 1870 and 1980 and that 8,000 Breton Canadians live or work in the [[Montreal]] area.

'''Celebrity comics''' are [[comics]] based on the fame and popularity of a celebrity.&lt;ref name="Weyer, Geert 2014"&gt;De Weyer, Geert, "België gestript",Standaard Uitgeverij, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; They are a byproduct of [[merchandising]] around a certain media star or franchise and have existed since the mass media and [[comics]] came into existence in the 19th century. Celebrity comics are usually not held in high esteem by critics, because of their purely commercial nature. They are solely created to capitalize on media trends and therefore published so quickly and cheaply that drawings and narratives tend to be of very low quality.&lt;ref name="Weyer, Geert 2014"/&gt;

==Definition==
Celebrity comics are usually written and drawn for commercial purposes.&lt;ref name="Weyer, Geert 2014"/&gt; Publishers try to cash in on the fame of a well known radio, TV, film star or series by launching a comic book or an entire comic book series about these media stars.&lt;ref name="Weyer, Geert 2014"/&gt; Comics about sports champions or theatrical actors fall in the same category. The line of thought behind these works is that the audience will be more likely to buy something they already recognize from theatre, film, radio or TV than a brand new series about an original creation.

Despite the commercial potential few of these celebrity comics last long. Their sales are usually based on the amount of attention a certain celebrity receives during a certain period. If the media craze or [[fad]] dies down the comic version usually fizzles out as well.&lt;ref name="Weyer, Geert 2014"/&gt; Another reason why many of these comics fail in the long run has to do with the fact that companies usually pass both the writing and drawing to less skilled artists, many of which don't have much experience in their profession. Apart from that the artists in question are put under pressure of a TV channel, company or the media star himself to follow their own demands and expectations as much as possible.&lt;ref name="Weyer, Geert 2014"/&gt;

Celebrity comics should not be confused with [[satire|satirical comics]] or political comics, which lampoon celebrities. While these can sometimes be made to play-off the fame of a celebrity, they usually tend to be less respectful towards the media stars in question and are seldom made with their own participation.

Despite the fact that celebrity comics are considered pure pulp some people have interest in these titles as a mere nostalgic or historical curiosity, of which they enjoy the [[campiness]].

==History==
[[File:Leno magazine.jpg|thumb|upright|''Dan Leno's Comic Journal'', Issue No. 1, February 26, 1898]]

Celebrity comics have existed since the late 19th century. The earliest example was the magazine ''Dan Leno's Comic Journal'' (1898), based on the popularity of British [[music hall]] comedian [[Dan Leno]]. The paper was primarily aimed at young adults and featured a fictional version of Leno. He personally wrote most of the gags and stories, while [[Tom Browne (illustrator)|Tom Browne]] contributed many of the illustrations.&lt;ref name=Anthony170&gt;Anthony, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The comedian retained editorial control of the paper, deciding which items to omit.&lt;ref name=Brandreth70&gt;Brandreth, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; After a run of nearly two years the novelty wore off, and Leno lost interest. The paper shut down on December 2, 1899.&lt;ref name=Anthony170/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brandreth70/&gt; Another early example was a comic strip drawn between 1909 and 1913 about the local village eccentric [[Robert W. Patten]] by [[John Hager (cartoonist)|John Hager]], which was published in the [[Seattle Daily Times]].&lt;ref name=newell&gt;{{cite book|author1=Newell, Gordon  |author2=Sherwood, Don|title=Totem Tales of Old Seattle| publisher=Ballantine|year=1974|isbn=0-345-24141-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hollywood started making [[slapstick]] films many comics series were made about popular film comedians. [[E.C. Segar]]'s ''[[Charlie Chaplin's Comedy Capers]]'' is perhaps the most famous example and ran for a solid two years, between 1916 and 1918. Between the 1920s and early 1960s the British magazines ''[[Radio Fun]]'' and ''[[Film Fun]]'' were even completely based around comics about radio and film celebrities. In the mid 1930s American artists like  Alfred Buescher &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/buescher_alfred-j.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, Clifton H. Crittenden &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/crittenden_clifton.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, Roland Jack Scott, and Arthur J. Palmer also made [[text comics]] based on the lives of celebrities who made headlines at the time. When television became popular in the 1950s and 1960s it opened the door for a whole stream of comics based on popular TV shows and stars. In every country with a comics industry examples of celebrity comics can be found.

==Celebrity animated cartoons==

A subgenre is celebrity animated cartoon series, based on the popularity of a well known musical artist (''[[Hammerman]]''), band (''[[The Beatles (TV series)|The Beatles]], [[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|The Jackson 5ive]], [[The Osmonds (TV series)|The Osmonds]], [[New Kids on the Block (TV series)|New Kids on the Block]]''), film stars (''[[The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show]], [[Jackie Chan Adventures]], [[Amigo and Friends]], [[Laurel and Hardy (animated series)|Laurel and Hardy]], [[Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action]], [[Chuck Norris: Karate Kommandos]], [[The New Three Stooges]]'',...), TV star (''[[The Gary Coleman Show]], [[Partridge Family 2200 A.D.]], [[Mister T (TV series)|Mr. T]], [[Laverne &amp; Shirley in the Army]], [[The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]'') and/or sports champion (''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]], [[I Am the Greatest: The Adventures of Muhammad Ali]], [[Mike Tyson Mysteries]], [[Ronaldinho Gaucho's Team]]'',...).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">[[Gardener]]s who have achieved fame through their pioneering innovations, writing or, more often, their [[television]] personas, may be classed as '''celebrity gardeners'''.

The writing of [[Helena Rutherfurd Ely]], [[C. Z. Guest]] and [[Esther Deans]] brought them enough fame for them to be considered celebrity gardeners.

In England, the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] has described both [[Alan Titchmarsh]] and [[Monty Don]] as celebrity gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhs.org.uk/whatson/events/documents/debatetherapy.pdf#search=%22RHS%20celebrity%20gardener%20alan%22].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhs.org.uk/thegarden/pubs/garden0903/compass0903.pdf#search=%22%22celebrity%20gardener%22%20monty%22].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claire Lucia Wineland''' (April 10, 1997&amp;nbsp;– September 2, 2018) was an American activist and author. Through her non-profit organization "Claire's Place Foundation", she worked to support and organize people with terminal and chronic illness and their families.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/05/health/claire-wineland-cystic-fibrosis-eprise/index.html Living while dying: 'Little Buddha' wisdom from a terminally ill 'goofball']. [[CNN]], July 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bustle"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/178819-who-is-claire-wineland-the-my-last-days-subject-is-helping-others-live-their-best-lives|title=Who Is Claire Wineland? The 'My Last Days' Subject Is Helping Others Live Their Best Lives|last=Rosenfeld|first=Laura|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wineland wrote the book ''Every Breath I Take, Surviving and Thriving with Cystic Fibrosis'' and was a [[TED (conference)|TEDx]] speaker.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bustle" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wineland was born with [[cystic fibrosis]] in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://northstarmoving.com/blog/2010/meet-claire/|title=Meet Claire|publisher=North Star Moving|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She enjoyed performing from a young age and appeared in ''[[The Music Man]]'' at age 4.&lt;ref name="Bustle" /&gt; At age 13, her lungs failed, and she was placed in a [[medically-induced coma]].&lt;ref name=longer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/29/health/claire-wineland-transplant-stroke/index.html|title=A lung transplant gave her hope for a longer life; now her family prays for 'another miracle'|publisher=CNN|date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given a 1% chance of survival and awoke after 16 days.&lt;ref name=longer/&gt; She then founded an organization in support of families affected by terminal illness, specifically cystic fibrosis.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

== Activism ==
Wineland founded the Claire's Place Foundation at age 13.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Inspired by the community's support while she was in a coma, she launched the [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit to provide support to children with cystic fibrosis and their affected families.&lt;ref name="Bustle" /&gt; The foundation operates through two programs: Support Families, which offers personalized support and assistance in areas such as treatment, care processes and emotional support from other parent volunteers; and Extended Hospital Stay Grants which provide financial assistance to families who are struggling with extended hospital stays.&lt;ref name="Bustle" /&gt; Claire's Place Foundation has provided financial assistance to 26 families to date.&lt;ref name="Bustle" /&gt;

Wineland was chosen to be the keynote speaker at [[AARC Congress]], the 63rd International Respiratory Convention and Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aarc.org/claire-wineland-congress-keynote/|title=AARC Congress Announces Claire Wineland As Keynote Speaker|date=2017-07-20|work=AARC|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a TEDx speaker and has spoken at a number of conferences worldwide. Claire appeared in an episode of ''[[Red Band Society]]'' and in the documentary series ''My Last Days''.&lt;ref name="Bustle" /&gt; She joined the Philips "Breathless Choir" as a soloist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clairesplacefoundation.org/tag/breathless-choir/|title=breathless choir – Claire's Place Foundation|website=clairesplacefoundation.org|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Clairity Project and YouTube channel===
The Clairity Project is a website featuring a series of educational videos and vlogs hosted on YouTube, which hope to inspire and educate others about living with a terminal illness.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; According to the website, Wineland's activism aims "to shed some light on what it's really like to be sick, and change the way we view illness and those living with it".&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

On August 7, 2017, after not uploading any videos onto her YouTube channel for over a year, Wineland made a return to YouTube with a new account under her real name. Her first uploaded video titled, "I stopped doing the Clarity Project because I got screwed over", revealed that The Clairity Project was not operated by her, but by a video editing company, and she had little to no control or input over the editing of her videos apart from its filming and creation. She revealed that after taking a break from creating videos for some months due to declining health, the company refused to allow her to log into any accounts relating to The Clarity Project. Due to no formal contracts over ownership of the project being in place, the company continued to profit from The Clairity Project, which essentially had her namesake, without Wineland ever having any control or seeing any profits. However, Wineland stated she does not have the energy or the money to take the case to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Claire Wineland |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeg83eig0BE |title=I stopped doing the Clairity Project because I got screwed over |work=Claire Wineland |publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=7 August 2017 |accessdate=9 September 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909072714/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeg83eig0BE |archivedate=9  September 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wineland continued to operate her very own YouTube channel where she uploaded personal vlogs regarding her personal feelings and thoughts, cystic fibrosis, her life expectancy and a [[Lung transplantation|lung transplant]]. She uploaded nine videos prior to her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Claire Wineland |url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTw8xGVrk4FTAJwMG6mw22w |title=Claire Wineland YouTube channel |work=Claire Wineland |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=7 August 2017 |accessdate=9 September 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909073037/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTw8xGVrk4FTAJwMG6mw22w |archivedate=9  September 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On August 26, 2018, Wineland had a stroke due to a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] which "cut off blood flow to the right side of her brain."&lt;ref name=CNN2 /&gt; She died, aged 21, on September 2, 2018, at 6:21 PM, at the [[UCSD Thornton Hospital|UC San Diego Thornton Pavilion]], one week after a double-lung transplant.&lt;ref name=CNN2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/03/health/claire-wineland-obit/index.html|title=Claire Wineland, inspirational speaker and social media star, dies one week after lung transplant|publisher=CNN|date=September 3, 2018|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Claire's Place Foundation, Inc. via Facebook" /&gt; Her organs were donated to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/03/health/claire-wineland-obit/index.html|title=Claire Wineland, inspirational speaker and social media star, dies one week after lung transplant|last=CNN|first=Jessica Ravitz,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 2016, Wineland was listed as one of [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'' magazine's]] 17 Power Teens. She was a [[Fox Teen Choice Award]] Honoree in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Meet the 2015 Teen Choice Pro-Social Honorees|url=http://www.teenchoice.com/article/2015-teen-choice-pro-social-honorees-0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109071733/http://www.teenchoice.com/article/2015-teen-choice-pro-social-honorees-0|archive-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes&lt;ref name="Bustle" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;and ''[[Los Angeles Business Journal]]''{{'s}} Small Nonprofit of the Year Award in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Nonprofit &amp; Corporate Citizenship Awards 2014|url=http://www.cbjonline.com/a2labj/supplements/NonprofitAwards_20140630.pdf|journal=Los Angeles Business Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7521">'''Elshad Islam oglu Abdullayev''' ({{lang-az|Elşad Abdullayev}}; born 25 September 1961, [[Kurdamir]]) is an [[Azerbaijan]]i lawyer and former university rector who gained wide popularity in 2012 after producing and publishing hidden camera videos, raising public and international awareness of [[corruption]] in the Azerbaijani government. The controversy that arose as a result came to be known as the '''Gulargate''' scandal, after former MP [[Gular Ahmadova]] of the ruling [[New Azerbaijan Party]], who featured in the first video.

==Early career==
Abdullayev was born in the town of Kurdamir in central Azerbaijan where he received secondary education. In 1979, he graduated with an honors degree in law from the [[Baku State University]]. He received a master's and later a doctorate degree in law in [[Moscow]] in 1985 and 2000 respectively. He was the dean of the constitution law department of the [[Baku State University]] since 1995 and a professor since 2004. He is married and has three children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dejure.az/elm-xadimleri/464-abdullayev-elad-slam-olu- Elshad Abdullayev]. DeJure Professional Law Firm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005 parliamentary election campaign and voter bribery==
Abdullayev joined the [[New Azerbaijan Party]] and unsuccessfully ran as a candidate in the parliamentary election of [[Azerbaijan parliamentary election, 2005|2005]]. Notably, his constituency of [[Binagadi|Binagadi II]] was among the five in which the voting results (according to which Abdullayev won) became void and new voting was scheduled for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/politics/42964.html In By-Elections New Azerbaijan Party to Run with 5 Candidates]. ''Day.az''. 3 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a polling station official reported violations during the campaign, namely that Elshad Abdullayev had reportedly been bribing the electorate to gain votes. A criminal case ensued and the court was presented evidence, following which Abdullayev's candidacy was annulled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/politics/47654.html Elshad Abdullayev's Candidacy Annulled for Voter Bribery]. ''Day.az''. 29 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Abdullayev claimed that he believed he had in fact won the election, but that "certain powers" did not wish to see him in the parliament, as that would enable Abdullayev to expose the actions of a "criminal gang of kidnappers" who, he alleged, were responsible for the kidnapping of his older brother, Ministry of State Security officer Mahir Abdullayev, back in 2003 and poisoning of his younger brother Eldaniz Abdullayev who undertook a personal investigation of the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sehife.az/politika/2758-elshad-abdullaev-predstavil-novuyu-sensacionnuyu-videozapis-video.html Elshad Abdullayev Released New Feature Video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008223139/http://sehife.az/politika/2758-elshad-abdullaev-predstavil-novuyu-sensacionnuyu-videozapis-video.html |date=2012-10-08 }}. 4 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies around the Azerbaijan International University==
{{main|Azerbaijan International University}}
In 1997, Abdullayev founded the Azerbaijan International University, a registered private institution for post-secondary education in [[Baku]], Azerbaijan. In 2006, the Attorney General's Office announced it had received reports of corruption taking place in the institution,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/society/51708.html Republical Attorney General's Carried Out Investigation at Azerbaijan International University]. ''Day.az''. 22 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; including proof of bribe-based student admission while passing over the official state admission examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/society/126853.html Is Azerbaijan International University License Annulled?].

In September 2012, Abdullayev accused government officials of Azerbaijan of having forced him to pay a 2,000,000-dollar bribe back in 2005 in return for finding his brother and obtaining a seat in the National Assembly. Neither even happened, according to Abdullayev, and the money was not returned to him. Abdullayev specifically accused the head of the Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan [[Ramiz Mehdiyev]] and claimed that Member of Parliament [[Gular Ahmadova]] helped broker the deal.&lt;ref name="firstvideo"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/24719935.html A Video Accusing MP Gular Ahmadova Released].

'''Gene Porter Bridwell''' was the seventh director of the [[NASA]] [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] located in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. He served as director from January 6, 1994 to February 3, 1996.

Before becoming director of the Marshall Center, G.P. (Porter) Bridwell served as manager of the Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle Definition Office, where he supervised efforts involving the proposed vehicle's design, development, and integration. He also served on special assignment with the Space Station Redesign Team and later the U.S./Russian Space Station Integration Team. Previously, he served as manager of the Shuttle Projects Office. There he managed the [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle]]'s propulsion elements, including the Space Shuttle Main Engine, External Tank, Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor, Solid Rocket Booster, Advanced Solid Rocket Motor, and related systems and activities, including the Michoud Assembly Facility.

Bridwell was born in [[Linton, Indiana]], on October 4, 1935 and graduated from State High School in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], in 1953. He earned a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering in 1958 from [[Purdue University]], [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]. He began his professional career as an engineer with Rocketdyne in [[Canoga Park, California]]. He joined the Marshall Center in 1962, and his early experience included assignments within the former Saturn Systems Office and [[Saturn V]] Program Office. In 1975, he transferred to the [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle]] Projects Office and served in key positions including chief of the Project Engineering Office, and deputy manager of the External Tank Project. In February 1983, he was appointed manager of the External Tank Project.

In the spring of 1987, he served temporarily as acting deputy center director of National Space Technology Laboratories in Mississippi. He was appointed director of institutional and program support at the Marshall Center in October 1988, and assumed the position of manager, Shuttle Projects Office, in May 1989.

In January 1990, Bridwell became the director of National Launch Systems for NASA Headquarters, co-located at the Marshall Center. In February 1992, he was officially transferred back to the Marshall Center from headquarters, where he assumed his post as manager of the Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle Definition Office.

Since 2015, govy has been focusing more on science and space art projects.

== Early work ==
Before debuting her visual work with photography, govy performed in a few theater, video pieces and films but then decided to focus on writing. In 1999, she published the first book on the internet that actually looked like a real book,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/tlramafr-2001/|title=telerama|last=|first=|date=2001|website=govy|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be published in 2001 under the title "Mes Cendres Nues"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mes Cendres Nues|last=|first=|publisher=IDLivre|year=2001|isbn=2-7479-0036-3|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by French publisher IDLivre. Her early wiritng is also part of the French Poetry Anthology "Les Nouveaux Poètes Français et Francophones",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Les Nouveaux Poètes Français et Francophones|last=French Poetry Anthology|first=|publisher=Edition Huguet|year=2004|isbn=2915412006|location=Paris|pages=179|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by Edition Huguet in 2004.

In 2000 she started an interactive piece where she would photograph her daily life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002|title=Fotografías De Una Vida|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/ciclo-2002/|journal=Ciclo|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; during one year without interruption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/readme-2002/|title=A Year of Emotions "Incarcerated" in a Photographic Diary|last=Yamada|first=Ryoji|date=2002-06-12|website=ReadMe|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early piece launched her career as a visual artist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bagot|first=Laurence|date=2002|title=Photographic-Diary|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/photophiles-2002/|journal=PHOTOPHILES|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was one of the first interactive pieces on the internet at the time and created before the fashion of photographic diaries via blogs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ocad.ca/wordpress/cs07nl/online-art-project-review/?doing_wp_cron=1478021540.5767090320587158203125|title=Online Art Project Review {{!}} Carolyn's Blog|website=blog.ocad.ca|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; would start spreading worldwide in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004|title=Les Nouveaux Journaux Intimes|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/lexpress-mag-2004/|journal=L’EXPRESS MAG|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, it could be considered an art piece very much about growing up on the [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum]] and struggling with a personal quest of identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This work has received two awards and has been exhibited internationally in art galleries and museums.

[[File:Hörður Barðdal.jpg|thumb|right|Hörður Barðdal]]

'''Hörður Barðdal (Hordur Barddal)''' (22 May 1946 in [[Reykjavík]] – 4 August 2009) was a competitive [[water polo]] player, competitive swimmer, competitive skier, competitive golfer, and a disabled athlete activist.&lt;ref&gt;Björnsson, Björn Jóhann. 2009. Andlát: Hörður Barðdal [Obituary: Hörður Barðdal]. ''Morgunblaðið'', 7 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Óli S. Barðdal, director of Seglagerðin Ægir, and Sesselja Guðnadóttir Barðdal. Óli died in 1983 but Sesselja outlives her son.

At the age of nine, Hörður contracted [[polio]], yet he never let his paralysis stop him at either work or play. His athletic achievements and his pioneering work within the sports arena speak of diligence, fighting spirit and positivity that inspired others in the same position with courage and eagerness to stand at an equal footing with able people.

During the years 1965–1970, Hörður played water polo with able athletes with Reykjavík F.C (KR) and he won the Reykjavík and Icelandic Championships several times in that area of sports. He was also a coach at the Reykjavík F.C. for a while, where he trained both able and disabled people in swimming. He was one of the first competitive athletes in the Reykjavík’s Sport Union for the Disabled (ÍFR) and he competed among other places at the Nordic Championships for the Disabled in 1976 and 1977 in swimming, where he won a bronze and silver medal. He was awarded the first Disabled Athlete of the Year in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;[No Author]. 2010. ''Hvati''. 20(2): 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and he concluded his swimming career at the [[1980 Summer Paralympics]] in Arnhem, Netherlands.

Hörður was one of the founders of the Icelandic Sports Associations for the Disabled (ÍF) and was a member of the board of the Association until 1986. Hörður was often a team mangager at large sport events, for instance at the 1994 Winter Paralympics in Lillehammer; he was an integral player in the launch of winter sports for the disabled in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, Guðný. 2011. ''Einn sá flottasti í brekkunum: Skíðaiðkun fatlaðs fólks – greinargerð'' [One of the Awesomest in the Hills: Disabled People's Skiing – A Report], pp. 18–19. Reykjavík: University of Iceland M.Ed. Thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; He received the gold award from the Icelandic Sports Association for the Disabled in the year 1994 for his efforts to promote sports among the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Lúðvíksson, Sveinn Áki. 2009. ''Hvati'' 19(2): 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last years, it was golf that totally captured Hörður’s heart, and he carried out groundbreaking work in enhancing disabled people’s appreciation of the sport. He founded the Icelandic Disabled Golf Association (GSFÍ), in collaboration with the Icelandic Golf Association (GSÍ), and was the president of the board until his untimely death in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Einarsdóttir, Hildur. 2004. Yfirvinnum hindranir fatlaðra [Overcoming Hindrances for the Disabled]. ''Morgunblaðið'', 6 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a board member of the European Disabled Golf Association (EDGA), who decided, in the fall 2010, to commission a trophy in his memory, "The Hordur Barddal Trophy",&lt;ref&gt;Pals, Sigi. 2010. Ein Engel, der sich vergoldet hat. ''Zeitung'', 7 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been awarded since in both male and female categories.

Hörður married Bergþóra Sigurbjörnsdóttir in the year 1968 but their ways parted. They had three daughters together: Jóhanna Ingileif, Sesselja Engilráð and Bergþóra Fanney Barðdal. He then married Soffía Kristín Hjartardóttir in the year 1980. Soffía died in 2007. Hörður’s stepson from his marriage with Soffía is Þórður Vilberg Oddsson. The grandchildren are nine in total.

The Hörður Barðdal’s Memorial Fund for Disabled Golfers was founded in the summer 2011 by Hörður’s mother, his three daughters, Kristmann Magnússon, director of Pfaff in Iceland, the Icelandic Sports Association for the Disabled, and the Icelandic Golf Association.&lt;ref&gt;''Stjórnartíðindi'' [Iceland's Legal Gazette]. 2011.

Dr. '''James Miranda Steuart Barry''' (c. 1795 – 25 July 1865) was a military surgeon in the [[British Army]], born in Ireland. Barry obtained a medical degree from the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], then served first in [[Cape Town]], South Africa and subsequently in many parts of the [[British Empire]]. Before retirement, Barry had risen to the rank of Inspector General (equivalent to [[Brigadier-general (United Kingdom)|Brigadier General]]) in charge of [[military hospital]]s, the second highest medical office in the British Army. Barry not only improved conditions for wounded soldiers, but also the conditions of the native inhabitants, and performed the first [[caesarean section]] in Africa by an Irish surgeon in which both the mother and child survived the operation.&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt;
 
Although Barry's entire adult life was lived as a man, Barry was born Margaret Ann Bulkley&lt;ref name=""BBCNews" /&gt; and was known as female in childhood. Barry lived as a man in both public and private life, at least in part in order to be accepted as a university student and pursue a career as a surgeon, Barry’s birth sex only becoming known to the public and to military colleagues after death.&lt;ref name="New Scientist"/&gt;

==Early life==
&lt;!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as "Barry" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.--&gt;
Other than some personal correspondence, there are few sources of information about the non-military parts of Barry's life. The scant available evidence provides a skeleton onto which a great deal of myth and speculation has been added by various commentators. In his detailed research into Barry's early life,{{sfn|du Preez|2008}} Michael Du Preez states that Barry was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1789, a birth date based on Mrs Bulkley's description of her child being fifteen years old in a letter dated 14 January 1805.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=5}} Various other sources give birth dates of 1792,{{sfn|Kubba|Young|2001|pp=352–356}}&lt;ref name=leitch /&gt; 1795,&lt;ref name=canada /&gt; and 1799, but these incorrect dates are almost certainly the result of Barry later lying about age on official documents to aid passing as a man.&lt;ref name=ondb/&gt;

Barry was the second child born to Jeremiah and Mary-Ann Bulkley, and was given the name Margaret Anne.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=5}} Mary-Ann Bulkley was the sister of [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], a celebrated Irish artist and professor of painting at London's Royal Academy. Jeremiah Bulkley ran the [[weigh house]] on Merchant's Quay, Cork. However, [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic sentiment]] led to his dismissal from this post. This and subsequent financial mismanagement left Mary-Ann and Barry without the support of either Jeremiah Bulkley (whose debts led to him spending time in [[City Marshalsea, Dublin|the Marshalsea]] prison in Dublin) or later the Bulkleys' married son John.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=7}} A third child appeared in the Bulkley family and was named Juliana. Although presented as being Barry's sister, it is likely that she was Barry's daughter as a result of childhood sexual assault, as the charwoman who discovered Barry's sex when laying out the body stated that [[Stretch marks|pregnancy stretch marks]] were present.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=7,8}}

The teenage Barry was educated with the prospect of becoming a [[governess|tutor]], but given a lack of evidence of any work history, the Bulkleys appear to have struggled to find Barry any suitable tutoring positions.{{sfn|du Preeze|Dronfield|2016|pp=43-45}} A conspiracy appears to have developed between Barry, Mary-Ann Bulkley and some of the late James Barry's influential, liberal-minded friends (General [[Francisco de Miranda]], Dr [[Edward Fryer]], who had become Barry's personal tutor, and Daniel Reardon, the family's solicitor) to enable the teenage Barry to enter medical school.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=56}} The [[University of Edinburgh]] was chosen and Mary-Ann and Barry boarded a [[Leith]] [[Smack (ship)|smack]] on 30 November 1809.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc=pp. 62–63 reproducing a letter dated 14 December 1809 from Mary-Ann to Daniel Readon}} And so, Margaret Anne Bulkley became James Barry, nephew of the late [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry RA]] the Irish romantic painter and remained known thus for the next 56 years.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=58–60}} In a letter to Daniel Readon, sent on 14 December, Barry asked for any letters addressed to Margaret Bulkley to be forwarded to Mary-Ann Bulkley (whom Barry now refers to as "my aunt"), and mentions that '...it was very usefull {{sic}} for Mrs. Bulkley (my aunt) to have a Gentleman to take care of her on Board Ship and to have one in a strange country...'. Although the letter was signed "James Barry", the solicitor indiscreetly wrote on the back of the envelope 'Miss Bulkley, 14 December'; this crucial piece of evidence was the one which enabled researchers to finally confirm that Margaret Bulkley and James Barry were one and the same.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=407}}

Arriving in Edinburgh in November 1809, Barry began studies at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|Medical School]] as a 'literary and medical student'. Barry's short stature, unbroken voice, delicate features and smooth skin led many to suspect that Barry was a young boy not past puberty, and the University Senate initially attempted to block Barry's application for the final examinations due to this apparent youth.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=75–77}} However, the [[David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan|Earl of Buchan]], a friend of Dr Fryer and Barry's late namesake, persuaded the Senate to relent and Barry qualified [[Doctor of Medicine|''Medicinae Doctor (MD)'']] in 1812.{{sfn|Barry|1812|p=}}{{efn|Barry's thesis was about [[Femoral hernia]], a condition that is much more common in women than men}} Barry then moved back to London, signing up for the Autumn Course 1812/1813 as a pupil of the United Hospitals of [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas']], whose teachers included [[Henry Cline]] and celebrated surgeon [[Astley Cooper]].{{sfn|du Preeze|Dronfield|2016|pp=82–93}} On 2 July 1813, Barry successfully passed the examination of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]].{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=97–100}}

==Career==
&lt;!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as "Barry" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.--&gt;
[[Image:James Barry (surgeon)05.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of James Barry, painted circa 1813–1816]]
Upon joining the army, Barry was commissioned as a Hospital Assistant in the British Army on 6 July 1813, taking up posts in Chelsea and then the [[HMNB Devonport|Royal Military Hospital in Plymouth]], achieving a promotion to Assistant Surgeon to the Forces, equivalent to lieutenant, on 7 December 1815.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=101–105}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17096|page=4|date= 2 January 1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17106|page=205|date=3 February 1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this military training, Barry was posted to [[Cape Town]], South Africa in 1816.{{sfn|Kubba|Young|2001|p=352}}{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=115–118}} Through Lord Buchan, Barry had a letter of introduction to the Governor, [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lieutenant General Lord Charles Henry Somerset]].{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=119}} Following the successful, even spectacular, treatment of Lord Charles's sick daughter, Barry was welcomed into the family,{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=123}} maintained a close friendship with the Governor, and became his personal physician. In 1822 Somerset appointed Barry as Colonial Medical Inspector,{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=167}} an extraordinary jump in expectations from Barry's low military rank which brought with it great responsibility. Over ten years of work in the Cape, Barry effected significant changes, among them improvements to sanitation and water systems, improved conditions for slaves, prisoners and the mentally ill, and provision of a sanctuary for the leper population. Barry also performed one of the first known successful [[Caesarean section]]s in which both mother and child survived;{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=215, 216}} the child was christened [[James Barry Munnik]] in Barry's honour, and the name was passed down through the family, leading to Barry's name being borne by a later Prime Minister of South Africa, [[J. B. M. Hertzog]]. Barry also gained enemies by criticising local officials and their handling of medical matters, but the advantage of a close relationship with the Governor meant that the repercussions of these outspoken views were usually smoothed over.

Barry was promoted to Surgeon to the Forces on 22 November 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18424|page=2582|date=18 December 1827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barry's subsequent posting was to [[Mauritius]] in 1828. In 1829, Barry risked a great deal of trouble by going absent without leave to return to England and treat Somerset, who had fallen ill, and remained there until his death in 1831.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=228,231}} Barry's subsequent posting was to [[Jamaica]], and then the island of [[Saint Helena]] in 1836. At St Helena, one clash with a fellow army surgeon resulted in Barry being arrested and [[court-martial]]led on a charge of "conduct unbecoming of the character of an Officer and a Gentleman". Barry was found not guilty, and honourably acquitted.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=268–271}}

In 1840 Barry was posted to the [[Leeward Islands]] and [[Windward Islands]] of the West Indies, there focusing on medicine, management and improving the conditions of the troops, and receiving a promotion to [[Principal Medical Officer]]. In 1845, Barry contracted [[yellow fever]] and left for England for sick leave in October. After being cleared for duty, Barry was posted to [[Malta]] in 1846. Here Barry was severely reprimanded for inexplicably taking a seat in the local church that was reserved for the clergy, and had to deal with the threat - and eventual actuality - of a [[cholera]] epidemic, which broke out in 1850.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol. II for 1865, p. 293.}}

The following posting was to [[Corfu]] in 1851, which brought with it a promotion to the rank of Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals on 16 May, equivalent to [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name="Lords" /&gt;{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol. II for 1865, p. 293.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21210|page=1296|date=16 May 1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; From here, Barry temporarily visited the [[Crimea]] on leave - as a request to be posted there officially had been denied - where a famous altercation took place between Barry and [[Florence Nightingale]] at [[Selimiye Barracks|Scutari Hospital]]. Finally, in 1857 Barry was posted to Canada, and granted the local rank of [[Inspector General#United Kingdom|Inspector General]] of Hospitals (equivalent to [[Brigadier General]]) on 25 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=6740|page=873|date=29 September 1857|city=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that position, Barry fought for better food, sanitation and proper medical care for prisoners and [[Leprosy|lepers]], as well as soldiers and their families.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol. II for 1865, p. 293.}}  This local rank was confirmed as substantive on 7 December 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22214|page=5589|date=31 December 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Barry (surgeon)01.jpg|thumb|right|Barry (left) with John, a servant, and Barry's dog Psyche, c. 1862, Jamaica]]
Wherever Barry served across the [[British Empire]], improvements were made to sanitary conditions and the conditions and diet of both the common soldier and other, under-represented groups. Barry was outraged by unnecessary suffering, and took a heavy-handed and sometimes tactless approach to demanding improvements for the poor and underprivileged which often incited anger from officials and military officers; on several occasions Barry was both arrested and demoted for the extremity of this behaviour. Barry held strict and unusually modern views about nutrition, being completely [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and [[Teetotalism|teetotal]], and, while keeping most personal relationships distant, was very fond of pets, particularly a beloved poodle named Psyche.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol. II for 1865, p. 293.}} Playwright Jean Binnie's radio play ''Doctor Barry'' (BBC, 1982) identified John Joseph Danson as the black servant Barry first employed in South Africa and who remained with Barry until the doctor's death.&lt;ref name="Binnie1982"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Dr Barry | last = Binnie | first = Jean | work = BBC Radio 4 Extra | date = 1982 | accessdate = 2018-04-13 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09yh0qg | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
&lt;!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as "Barry" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.--&gt;
Despite protesting the decision, Barry was forcefully retired by the army on 19 July 1859 due to ill health and old age, and was succeeded as inspector general of hospitals by [[David Dumbreck]].{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=364-365}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22289|page=2803|date=19 July 1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a quiet retirement in London, Barry finally died from [[dysentery]] on 25 July 1865.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=371–374}} The identity of the woman who discovered the truth of Barry's sex is disputed, but she was probably a charwoman who also laid out the dead.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=390-391}} The charwoman, after failing to elicit payment for her services, sought redress in another way; she visited Barry's physician, Major D. R. McKinnon, who had issued the death certificate upon which Barry was identified as male. The woman claimed that Barry's body had been biologically  female and had marks suggesting Barry had at one point borne a child.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=378–379}} When McKinnon refused to pay her, she took the story to the press, and the situation became public. It was discussed in an exchange of letters between George Graham of the General Register Office, and Dr McKinnon.{{sfn|Kubba|Young|2001|pp=354–355}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sir,

It has been stated to me that Inspector-General Dr James Barry, who died at 14 Margaret Street on 25 July 1865, was after his death found to be female.

As you furnished the Certificate as to the cause of his death, I take the liberty of asking you whether what I have heard is true, and whether you yourself ascertained that he was a woman and apparently had been a mother?

Perhaps you may decline answering these questions; but I ask them not for publication but for my own information.

Your faithful servant

George Graham
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McKinnon's response was as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sir,

I had been intimately acquainted with the doctor for good many years, both in London and the West Indies and I never had any suspicion that Dr Barry was a woman. I attended him during his last illness, (previously for bronchitis, and the affection for diarrhoea). On one occasion after Dr Barry’s death at the office of Sir Charles McGregor, there was the woman who performed the last offices for Dr Barry was waiting to speak to me. She wished to obtain some prerequisites [sic in source, but has to be a slip for perquisites, "perks"] of his employment, which the Lady who kept the lodging house in which Dr Barry died had refused to give her. Amongst other things she said that Dr Barry was a female and that I was a pretty doctor not to know this and she would not like to be attended by me. I informed her that it was none of my business whether Dr Barry was a male or a female, and that I thought that she might be neither, viz. an imperfectly developed man. She then said that she had examined the body, and was a perfect female and farther that there were marks of him having had a child when very young. I then enquired how have you formed that conclusion. The woman, pointing to the lower part of her stomach, said ‘from marks here. I am a maried{{sic}} woman and the mother of nine children and I ought to know.’

The woman seems to think that she had become acquainted with a great secret and wished to be paid for keeping it. I informed her that all Dr Barry’s relatives were dead, and that it was no secret of mine, and that my own impression was that Dr Barry was a Hermaphrodite. But whether Dr Barry was a male, female, or hermaphrodite I do not know, nor had I any purpose in making the discovery as I could positively swear to the identity of the body as being that of a person whom I had been acquainted with as Inspector-General of Hospitals for a period of years.

Yours faithfully,

D.R. McKinnon
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the matter was made public, many people claimed to have "known it all along". The British Army, seeking to suppress the story, sealed all records of Barry for the next 100 years.&lt;ref name="New Scientist"/&gt; The historian Isobel Rae gained access to the army records in the 1950s, and concluded that James Barry the painter was indeed Barry's uncle.&lt;ref name=sm20081230 /&gt; Barry was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] under the name ''James Barry'' and full military rank. It was claimed by several sources that the manservant who always attended Barry returned to [[Jamaica]], but his actual fate is unknown.

==Gender and personal life==
&lt;!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as "Barry" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.--&gt;
In a letter chiding John Bulkley, Barry's older brother, for abandoning legal studies for the military, 19-year-old Barry wrote: "Was I not a girl I would be a Soldier!".{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=50}}

Barry's interest in medicine was probably encouraged by the liberal-minded friends of the late [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] RA, and just before travelling to Edinburgh to enrol as a medical student in 1809, Barry assumed a male identity.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=51, 59}} A short stature, slight build, unbroken voice, delicate features and smooth skin led others to suspect that Barry was not a man but a [[Preadolescence#Prepubescence, puberty and range|pre-pubescent]] boy.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=75, 76}} This identity was maintained through surgical training and recruitment into the [[British Army]] which, at officer rank level, did not then require a medical examination.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=101}}

During Barry's first posting abroad to Cape Town in South Africa, Barry became a close friend of the Governor, Lord Charles Somerset, and his family. It has been suggested that Lord Charles discovered Dr Barry's secret and that the relationship was more than friendship.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=154}} Their closeness led to rumours and ultimately an accusation briefly appearing on a bridge post in Cape Town on 1 June 1824 saying that the writer had "detected Lord Charles buggering Dr Barry",{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=182}} which led to a court trial and investigation, as [[homosexuality]] was at that time strictly illegal. Despite these allegations, if Somerset was aware of Barry's sex, he did not reveal it.

Despite efforts to appear masculine, witness reports comment on Barry's effeminacy{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=125}} and on a somewhat contradictory reputation - Barry had a reputation for being tactless, impatient, argumentative and opinionated,{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol. II for 1865, p. 293.}} but was also considered to have had a good [[Doctor-patient relationship#Bedside manner|bedside manner]] and famous professional skill.&lt;ref name=ondb/&gt; Barry's temper and bravado led to a famous pistol duel with Captain [[Abraham Josias Cloëté|Josias Cloete]] of the 21st Light Dragoons. Barry's aim was better, the bullet striking Cloete's [[shako]] military cap and removing its peak, which dissipated its force.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=155–159}}  During the [[Crimean War]] (1854–1856), Barry got into an argument with [[Florence Nightingale]].&lt;ref name=ondb /&gt; After Barry's death Nightingale wrote that: &lt;blockquote&gt;I never had such a blackguard rating in all my life – I who have had more than any woman – than from this Barry sitting on his horse, while I was crossing the Hospital Square with only my cap on in the sun. "He" kept me standing in the midst of quite a crowd of soldiers, Commissariat, servants, camp followers, etc., etc., every one of whom behaved like a gentleman during the scolding I received while "he" behaved like a brute . . . After "he" was dead, I was told that (Barry) was a woman . . . I should  say that (Barry) was the most hardened creature I ever met.&lt;ref name="FloNight" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Barry would never allow anyone into the room while undressing, and repeated a standing instruction that "in the event of his death, strict precautions should be adopted to prevent any examination of his person"{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol. II for 1865, p. 293.}} and that the body should be "buried in [the] bed sheets without further inspection",{{sfn|Loudon|2002|p=}} indicating a desire to conceal physical sex both in life and in death. ''We Are Family,'' an LGBT magazine, argues that this is strong evidence of Barry's having been a transgender man, given that "his wish was to die and be remembered as a man."&lt;ref name="WeAreFam" /&gt;

== Intersex controversy ==
&lt;!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as "Barry" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.--&gt;
{{harvnb|Kubba|Young|2001|p=355}} picked up on Major McKinnon's statement that he did not know whether Barry was "male, female or hermaphrodite" and suggested that it might be more appropriate to say that Barry was "[[hermaphrodite]]" [or [[intersex]]] rather than "female", and "may have had ambiguous genitalia". These suppositions are based on the premise that "Concealment of one's sex for ...  40 years in the British Army, is simply unbelievable". However, {{harvnb|du Preez|Dronfield|2016}} show how Barry might have been able to conceal this secret from all but a few people, and those who did know did not reveal it while Barry was alive. N. Turner has commented on Kubba and Young's conclusion that the belief in an intersex condition was based on "vanishingly slim evidence".&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt;

{{harvnb|Holmes|2003|p=}} also raises the possibility of Barry being intersex, but acknowledges the impossibility of knowing, expressing surprise that this is a problem for so many people. The suggestion that Barry may have been intersex has been criticised for both biological and social reasons. In a review of Holmes' biography, {{harvnb|Loudon|2002|p=}} firmly rejects the implication that Barry might have been intersex.

{{harvnb|Funke|2017|p=}}, among other [[LGBT]] theorists, has voiced the opinion that the intersex theory is an attempt to impose  "[[cisgender]] male" characteristics onto Barry so as to undermine the concept that a transgender man could have achieved as much as Barry did.{{sfn|Hacker|2001|p=}}&lt;ref name="GLBT" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
&lt;!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as "Barry" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.--&gt;
The character of Barry has been played by [[Anna Massey]] in an episode of the BBC [[Docudrama|drama-documentary]] ''A Skirt Through History''.&lt;ref name="BFI" /&gt;

Barry's life is the subject of the historical novel ''James Miranda Barry'' (published in the United States as ''The Doctor'') by [[Patricia Duncker]].{{sfn|Duncker|2000|p=}}

The Canadian aspect of Barry's career was dramatised in an episode of the series ''Heritage Television'', produced by then-independent superchannel CHCH in Hamilton, and hosted by Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]].

A 2004 play, ''Whistling Psyche'' by [[Sebastian Barry]], imagines a meeting between James Barry and [[Florence Nightingale]].&lt;ref name="curtainup" /&gt;

As of April 2018, a film is said to by in early production, in which Rachel Weisz plans to produce and star, on the life of Dr. James Barry.&lt;ref name="Maureen Dowd The New York Times 2018"&gt;{{cite web |first=Maureen |last=Dowd |authorlink=Maureen Dowd |title=Rachel Weisz Has a Big Surprise |website=The New York Times |date=2018-04-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/style/rachel-weisz-disobedience-movie.html |access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further information on this has been made public beyond what Weisz herself has divulged via the sourced New York Times interview.

'''Jay Christopher Cutler''' (born April 29, 1983) is a former [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who played 12 seasons in the [[National Football League]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] and was drafted by the [[Denver Broncos]] in the first round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], for whom he played for three seasons. In 2009, he was traded to the [[Chicago Bears]], where he played for eight seasons.

Following the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]], Cutler announced his retirement and his intention to become a [[sportscaster]] for [[NFL on Fox]]'s television broadcasts. However, following a season-ending injury to [[Miami Dolphins]] quarterback [[Ryan Tannehill]] in August 2017, Cutler came out of retirement and signed a one-year deal with the team.

The most notable play of the game occurred when Cutler [[Lateral pass|lateraled]] the ball to the [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]], Cole Seifrig, who then passed it to Cutler who ran it into the [[end zone]].&lt;ref name="2000 IHSAA finals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihsaa.org/b-football/00Class3AFinals.htm |title=2000 Indiana high school finals |publisher=IHSAA |accessdate=December 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutler also played strong safety in the state championship and made 19 tackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IHSAA State Box|url=http://www.ihsaa.org/Portals/0/boys%20sports/boys%20football/Box%20Scores/2000013ABoxScore.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutler was ranked by many experts as the third-best quarterback prospect in the [[2006 NFL Draft]], after [[Matt Leinart]] of [[University of Southern California|USC]] and [[Vince Young]] of [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]]. [[ESPN]]'s [[Chris Mortensen]] and [[Ron Jaworski]] tabbed him as the best quarterback available in the draft, and some [[Scout (sport)|scouts]] believed he had better arm strength than Young and Leinart, and compared him to [[Brett Favre]] for his [[gunslinger]] attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=sando_mike&amp;id=3084020 |title=ESPN – To win big, Broncos must add to Cutler supporting cast – NFL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=October 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt |first=Jim |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/draft/2006-02-28-cutler-stock_x.htm |title=Cutler's stock continues to skyrocket |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=February 28, 2006 |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2006 [[NFL Scouting Combine]], Cutler completed 23 repetitions of a 225-pound [[bench press]] (more than some linemen) and ran a [[40-yard dash]] in 4.77 seconds.&lt;ref name="packers2006" /&gt;

He is the third first-round pick to come from Vanderbilt, preceded by [[Will Wolford]] and [[Bill Wade]].

===Denver Broncos===

====2006 season====
After a strong training camp in 2006, Cutler was promoted from third to second on the Broncos' quarterback [[depth chart]] ahead of [[Bradlee Van Pelt]]. He passed for more yards than any other rookie in the preseason.

On November 27, head coach [[Mike Shanahan]] officially announced that Cutler would replace [[Jake Plummer]] as starting quarterback despite a 7-4 record because, "I think he gives us the best chance to win now."&lt;ref name="Post_official"&gt;

Cutler took his first NFL snap on December 3 (Week 13), and after some initial jitters (0-3 with sack and fumble) completed his first touchdown to [[tight end]] [[Stephen Alexander (American football)|Stephen Alexander]] in the second quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Invesco Field, Denver, CO&amp;nbsp; |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=261203007 |title=ESPN – Hawks edge Broncos behind Brown's game-winning FG – NFL Football Recap |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 3, 2006 |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth quarter, he threw a memorable 71-yard touchdown to fellow-rookie [[Brandon Marshall]] to tie the game 20–20. It was one of the longest touchdown passes for a debut in NFL history and was also the second-longest pass play between two rookies in Broncos history.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt; He also had two interceptions and took three sacks in the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612030den.htm |title=Seattle Seahawks at Denver Broncos - December 3rd, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, in a road loss against the [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]], Cutler connected with tight end [[Tony Scheffler]] for two touchdowns in a span of 48 seconds, which is tied for fastest, in league history that two rookies produced a pair of scoring passes.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt;

Cutler's first win came in his third start on December 17, which was a 37–20 road victory over the [[2006 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=261217022 |title=ESPN – Broncos' Cutler outduels Cards' Leinart in rookie battle – NFL Football Recap |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 17, 2006 |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He finished the game 21-of-31 with 261 yards, two touchdowns, an interception and a QB rating of 101.7, the highest for a Broncos rookie since [[John Elway]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt; One touchdown traveled 65 yards in the air, and was recorded as a 54-yard touchdown to [[Javon Walker]] on the Broncos' third play of the game.

He also directed the Broncos on a 99-yard drive in the third quarter that culminated on a [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]] two-yard touchdown run. As a result of the two passing touchdowns in the game against the Bengals, Cutler became the first rookie QB in NFL history&lt;ref&gt;second player overall, joining the [[Washington Redskins]]' [[Mark Rypien]] in 1988&lt;/ref&gt; to throw for at least two touchdowns in each of his first four games played.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt; He also became the second rookie in league history (fifth player overall) to throw at least two touchdown passes in each of his first four starts.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The only other rookie to accomplish the feat was [[Dan Marino]] in his 1983 rookie season.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rasizer_calm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.insidedenver.com/drmn/nfl/article/0,2777,DRMN_23918_5237764,00.html |date=December 27, 2006 |accessdate=December 27, 2006 |title=Cutler's calm catching |author=Lee Rasizer |publisher=[[Rocky Mountain News]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Broncos' quest to clinch a playoff berth came up short in the final game of the season, when they fell at home 26–23 in overtime to the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The loss dropped the Broncos to a 9–7 overall record and 4–4 at home. Despite sustaining a concussion in the first half, Cutler finished 21 of 32 with 230 yards and a touchdown, and led Denver on a game-tying touchdown drive in the closing minutes of regulation to force overtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612310den.htm |title=San Francisco 49ers at Denver Broncos - December 31st, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In five games played on the season, Cutler finished with a record of 2–3, and went 81-of-137 for 1,001 yards, 9 touchdowns, and 5 interceptions, earning a franchise rookie record passer rating of 88.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay Cutler&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;#6&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;QB |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/stats?playerId=9597 |title=ESPN – Jay Cutler Stats, News, Photos – Denver Broncos – NFL Football |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=April 29, 1983 |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{As of|2017}}, this is the only Denver franchise record he still holds.&lt;/ref&gt; He posted the second-highest touchdown percentage (6.6) and third-highest TD-to-INT ratio (1.8) among NFL rookies since 1970 with at least 125 passing attempts.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt;

====2007 season====

The [[2007 NFL season]] marked Cutler's first full season as the starting quarterback of the Denver Broncos. In the first game of the season against the [[Buffalo Bills]], Cutler led Denver to a comeback win on a 12-play, 42-yard drive culminating in a [[Jason Elam]] 42-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] as time expired.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt; Cutler's pass attempts (39), completions (23), and yards (304) for the game were career-highs at the time.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt; He led Denver to their second straight comeback win the next week in the home opener against the Oakland Raiders. Late in regulation, Cutler moved the team 78 yards in 15 plays for the game-tying field goal with 2:18 remaining.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt; The game went into overtime, where he engineered a 52-yard drive that led to another game-winning field goal by Elam. Cutler had a touchdown pass during the game, making him the first Broncos passer to begin his Broncos career with at least one touchdown pass in his first seven starts.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt; The streak reached nine games through losses to [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] and at [[Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis]] (which featured his first career rushing touchdown), but ended with a 41–3 home loss to the San Diego Chargers in the fifth game of the season.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt;

After the [[Bye (sports)|bye week]] in Week 6, the 2-3 Broncos beat the 4–1 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], 31–28 (all three wins on last-second Elam field goals).

[[File:Jay Cutler vs 49ers.jpg|thumb|right|Cutler passes in a game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]]]
Cutler was the subject of most of the praise and criticism during the Chicago Bears' mercurial season. He began the season with 4 INTs in a loss to [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]], followed by seven touchdowns to one interception in three straight wins with a 100+ QB Rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200909130gnb.htm |title=Chicago Bears at Green Bay Packers - September 13th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bears lost eight of the next ten games behind Cutler's 11 touchdowns vs NFL-leading 20 interceptions. This included a Game 9 loss to [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]] where Cutler threw a career-high five interceptions and no touchdowns, and Game 14 loss at [[Baltimore Ravens|Baltimore]] where Cutler had career-worsts of 94 yards&lt;ref&gt;min. 15 attempts&lt;/ref&gt; and a passer rating of 7.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200911120sfo.htm |title=Chicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers - November 12th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200912200rav.htm |title=Chicago Bears at Baltimore Ravens - December 20th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Cutler again reversed direction in Game 15 against [[Brett Favre]]'s division rival [[Minnesota Vikings|Vikings]], where he threw four touchdowns, including a go-ahead late in the 4th quarter, and 31-yard game-winner in overtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota Vikings at Chicago Bears - December 28th, 2009|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200912280chi.htm|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned Offensive Player of the Week  for his effort against the Vikings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2009/week_16.htm |title=2009 NFL Week 16 Leaders &amp; Scores |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then ended the season with another four-touchdown outing and win over [[Detroit Lions|Detroit]].

====2010 season====
The Bears hired [[Mike Martz]] (famed for developing the [[St. Louis Rams]]' "[[Greatest Show on Turf]]") as offensive coordinator. Though Martz had been critical of Cutler as an analyst, both professed excitement about working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=4877772 |title=Chicago Bears hire Mike Martz as offensive coordinator - ESPN Chicago |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutler led the Bears to a 3–0 start, throwing six touchdowns and only two interceptions.  However, in week 4, Cutler was sacked nine times in the first half against the [[New York Giants]], missing the rest of that game and the next with a concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201010030nyg.htm |title=Chicago Bears at New York Giants - October 3rd, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to six sacks in a loss to [[Seattle Seahawks|Seattle]] and 4 interceptions in a loss to [[Washington Redskins|Washington]], leaving the Bears at 4–3 at their [[bye week]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201010170chi.htm |title=Seattle Seahawks at Chicago Bears - October 17th, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201010240chi.htm |title=Washington Redskins at Chicago Bears - October 24th, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cutler Quinnan8 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Cutler in 2010]]

Martz retooled the offensive line and showed more commitment to the running game, allowing Cutler to escape the next three games with just six sacks total. He won those three, followed by then-career-bests of four touchdowns and rating of 146.2 in a win over the 7–3 [[Philadelphia Eagles|Eagles]] (winning NFC Player of the Week), and an 80.8% completion percentage in a win over [[Detroit Lions|Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201011280chi.htm |title=Philadelphia Eagles at Chicago Bears - November 28th, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201012050det.htm |title=Chicago Bears at Detroit Lions - December 5th, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2010/week_12.htm |title=2010 NFL Week 12 Leaders &amp; Scores |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 152-yard, no touchdown, two interception loss to [[New England Patriots|New England]], Cutler won back-to-back games with three touchdowns, one interception, and 100+ ratings in each, before dropping the season finale to [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201012120chi.htm |title=New England Patriots at Chicago Bears - December 12th, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201101020gnb.htm |title=Chicago Bears at Green Bay Packers - January 2nd, 2011 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bears finished with an 11–5 record, an [[NFC North]] title, and a first-round bye.

In Cutler's playoff debut against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], he had 274 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, 43 rushing yards, and two rushing touchdowns in the Bears 35–24 win, making him the second quarterback in NFL history since [[Otto Graham]] in 1954 and 1955 to score two touchdown passes and two touchdown runs in a playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCauley|first=Janie|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2013/0114/Colin-Kaepernick-sets-off-the-Kaepernicking-craze-video|title=Colin Kaepernick sets off the 'Kaepernicking craze' (+video)|publisher=''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''|date=2013-01-14|accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on November 20, Cutler broke the thumb on his throwing hand tackling San Diego's [[Antoine Cason]] after an interception. He played through the final drive for the win, but the injury required season-ending surgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/chicago/nfl/story/_/id/7264419/chicago-bears-jay-cutler-surgery-fractured-thumb Jay Cutler to have thumb surgery] ESPN Chicago, November 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Under backups [[Caleb Hanie]] and [[Josh McCown]], the Bears lost six of their remaining seven games, and missed the playoffs.

===Volunteer work===
Cutler does [[volunteer work]] for young people with [[developmental disabilities]] through Vanderbilt's "Best Buddies" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nashville.gov/mc/resolutions/term_2003_2007/rs2006_1124.htm|title=RESOLUTION NO. RS2006-1124|first=Metropolitan Clerk's Office, Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County,|last=Tennessee|website=www.nashville.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2007 offseason, Cutler started the Jay Cutler Foundation, which partnered with Mile High United Way’s ''Youth Success Initiative'' to help at-risk youth overcome obstacles and graduate from high school.&lt;ref name=broncossitebio /&gt;

On May 1, 2008, Cutler announced that he had been diagnosed with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes]] and needs daily [[insulin]] shots.&lt;ref&gt;NFL.com, [http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d8081b03e&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true Cutler has Type 1 diabetes, career not in jeopardy]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is responding well with the insulin treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carucci |first=Vic |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story;jsessionid=2E36B8A73AF760F2FAEF9B26D0AE2647?id=09000d5d8093b349&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true |title=With diabetes under control, Cutler ready to roll |publisher=Nfl.com |date=July 28, 2008 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutler works with Dedicated to Diabetes, which is a Denver-based organization that aims to improve public knowledge about diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/may/02/diabetes-education-group-leader-contacts-qb/ |title=Diabetes education group leader contacts QB : Broncos |publisher=The Rocky Mountain News |date=May 2, 2008 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2009 season, Cutler teamed up with [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in a campaign called "Touchdowns For Diabetes". For every touchdown pass Cutler threw during the 2009 season, Lilly sent a child to diabetes camp by donating $1,000 to the ADA’s “Camp Scholarship” fund—roughly the cost of providing tuition for one child to attend a week of diabetes camp. For every pass Cutler completed in 2009, Lilly donated $100 to the ADA Camp Scholarship fund to allow even more kids the chance to attend camp the following summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jaycutlersix.com/Touchdowns|title=Touchdowns For Diabetes|publisher=JC6|accessdate=August 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427213206/http://www.jaycutlersix.com/Touchdowns|archivedate=April 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Cutler visited Perspectives Charter School in Chicago, and talked about diabetes awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=8816 |title=Cutler talks football, diabetes awareness |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the media===
An animated representation of Cutler briefly appeared in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode, "[[Guitar Queer-O]]." The show is set in Colorado, and the characters are avid Broncos fans. Two characters, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], meet Cutler and say, "Nice to meet you. I mean, you kinda suck, but my dad says you might be good some day." Cutler himself later responded to the episode, saying, "It was cool. I thought it was funny. They can make fun of me if they want to."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs4denver.com/broncos/Denver.Broncos.NFL.2.604965.html cbs4denver.com – Cutler Doesn't Take 'South Park' Insult Personally] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813125606/http://cbs4denver.com/broncos/Denver.Broncos.NFL.2.604965.html |date=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutler, along with former Broncos tight end [[Tony Scheffler]] and former Broncos backup quarterback [[Preston Parsons]], took part in an episode of ''[[Oprah's Big Give]]'' filmed in Denver in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bill HustedThe Denver Postdenverpost.com |url=http://www.denverpost.com/husted/ci_8506620 |title=O, hush: Denver edition of "Big Give" a big secret – The Denver Post |publisher=Denverpost.com |date= March 9, 2008|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/page.php?id=359&amp;contentID=8523 |title=– Official Website Of The Denver Broncos |publisher=Denverbroncos.com |date= |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on March 9, 2008.

In 2011, after the Bears lost five straight games while Cutler was out with a thumb injury, Chicago recording artist Magic 1 recorded "Cutty Come Back", a parody of the song "[[Baby Come Back (Player song)|Baby Come Back]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2011/12/10/bears-saturday-singalong-cutty-come-back/ |title=NFL.com Blogs " Blog Archive Chicago Saturday sing-along: "Cutty Come Back" " |publisher=Blogs.nfl.com |date=December 10, 2011 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[internet meme]], called "Smokin' Jay Cutler", portrays pictures of Cutler in an apathetic state with a cigarette photoshopped into his mouth. Cutler commented he is aware of the meme and "gets a kick out of that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katzowitz |first=Josh |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/20872986/jay-cutler-on-smokin-jay-cutler-i-get-a-kick-out-of-that |title=Jay Cutler on Smokin' Jay Cutler: 'I get a kick out of that' |work=CBS Sports |date=2012-11-07 |accessdate=2015-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Rodgers]] of the [[Green Bay Packers]] performed a smoking gesture to reference the meme during a 38–14 win over the Bears in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Demovsky |first=Rob |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/67911/aaron-rodgers-smoking-gesture-a-tribute-to-jay-cutler-or-dummy-signal-or-both |title=Aaron Rodgers: Smoking gesture a tribute to Jay Cutler or dummy signal – or both |work=ESPN |date=2014-10-14 |accessdate=2015-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Cutler played himself in an episode of the comedy show ''[[The League]]'', alongside his wife, Kristin Cavallari, who  appeared in one other episode of the show.

Cutler supported Presidential Candidate [[Mitt Romney]] in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/06/chicago-bears-jay-cutler-voting-mitt-romney-_n_2081800.html|title=Chicago Bears' Jay Cutler Voting For Mitt Romney|first=Cavan|last=Sieczkowski|date=6 November 2012|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then-Presidential Candidate [[Donald Trump]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/chicago/bears/post/_/id/4704168/jay-cutler-ive-supported-donald-trump-for-a-while|title=Jay Cutler: I've supported Donald Trump for a while|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1649">'''John Sutherland''' (August 21, 1821 – April 27, 1899) was a [[Manitoba]] political figure. 
Farmer, Senator.

He was born in [[Point Douglas]] in what was then the [[Red River Colony]] and was educated at [[St. John's College, University of Manitoba|St. John's College]]

Following the flood of 1852, he moved to [[East Kildonan]] where he operated a [[general store]] and farmed.

In 1866 he was appointed to the [[Council of Assiniboia]] which had been created by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] to govern the territory until it was dissolved in 1870.

During the [[Red River Rebellion]], Sutherland was a leader of the "loyalists" and was a delegate to the [[Council of Forty]] in 1870. In February 1870, the [[Red River Rebellion#Provisional government|Provisional Government of the Red River Colony]] appointed Sutherland Collector of Customs. When Manitoba entered [[Canadian Confederation]] on July 15, 1870, Sutherland was appointed the first [[High Sheriff]] of Manitoba and held the office until December 1871 when he was appointed to the [[Senate of Canada]] by Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] where he sat as an Independent Conservative until his death.

In his later life, Sutherland helped found [[Manitoba College]].

'''Kalasha''' (&lt;small&gt;locally:&lt;/small&gt; ''Kalashamondr'') is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] in the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] branch spoken by the [[Kalash people]], further classified as a [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] language in the [[Chitral]] group.&lt;ref name="jain-cardona-2007"&gt;{{Cite encyclopaedia

 | quote = 'Dardic' is a geographic cover term for those Northwest Indo-Aryan languages which ''[..]'' developed new characteristics different from the IA languages of the Indo-Gangetic plain. Although the Dardic and Nuristani (previously 'Kafiri') languages were formerly grouped together, Morgenstierne (1965) has established that the Dardic languages are Indo-Aryan, and that the Nuristani languages constitute a separate subgroup of Indo-Iranian.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kalasha language is phonologically atypical because it contrasts plain, long, nasal and retroflex vowels as well as combinations of these (Heegård &amp; Mørch 2004).

Kalasha is spoken by the [[Kalash people]] who reside in the remote valleys of [[Bumburet]], [[Birir Valley|Birir]] and [[Rumbur]], which are west of [[Ayun, Chitral|Ayun]], which is ten miles down the river from [[Chitral]] Town, high in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]]. The Kalash have their own religion, with gods and goddesses. There are an estimated 5,000 speakers of Kalasha.&lt;ref&gt;1998 Census Report of Pakistan. (2001). Population Census Organization, Statistics Division, Government of Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalasha should not be confused with the nearby [[Nuristani language]] [[Waigali language|Waigali]] (Kalasha-ala). According to [[Badshah Munir Bukhari]], a researcher on the Kalash, "Kalasha" is also the ethnic name for the [[Nuristanis|Nuristani]] inhabitants of a region southwest of the Kalasha Valleys, in the [[Waygal District|Waygal]] and middle [[Pech Valley|Pech Valleys]] of Afghanistan's [[Nuristan Province]]. The name "Kalasha" seems to have been adopted for the Kalash people by the Kalasha speakers of Chitral from the Nuristanis of Waygal, who for a time expanded up to southern Chitral several centuries ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.sedona.net/~strand/Nuristani/Kalasha/kalasha.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2001-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011101195044/http://users.sedona.net/~strand/nuristani/kalasha/kalasha.html |archivedate=2001-11-01 |df= }}, http://nuristan.info/Nuristani/Kalasha/kalasha.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no close connection between the Indo-Aryan language Kalasha-mun (Kalasha) and the Nuristani language Kalasha-ala (Waigali), which descend from different branches of the [[Indo-Iranian languages]].

== Study ==
Early scholars to have done work on Kalasha include the 19th-century orientalist [[Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner]] and the 20th-century linguist [[Georg Morgenstierne]]. More recently, studies have been undertaken by Elena Bashir and several others. The development of practical literacy materials has been associated with the Kalasha linguist [[Taj Khan Kalash]].

== Classification ==
Of all the languages in the subcontinent, Kalasha is likely the most conservative, along with the nearby western Dardic language [[Khowar language|Khowar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Morgenstierne]]. Indo-Iranian Frontier Languages, Vol. IV: The Kalasha Language &amp; Notes on Kalasha. Oslo 1973, p. 184, details pp. 195-237&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases, Kalasha is even more conservative than Khowar, e.g. in retaining voiced aspirate consonants, which have disappeared from most other Dardic languages.

Some of the typical retentions of sounds and clusters (and meanings) are seen in the following list. However, note some common New Indo-Aryan and Dardic features  as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Fussman]]: 1972 Atlas linguistique des parlers dardes et kafirs. Publications de l'École Française d'Extrême-Orient&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===
As with other Dardic languages, the phonemic status of the breathy voiced series is debatable. Some analyses are unsure of whether they are phonemic or simply lexical—i.e., clusters of consonants with /h/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Grammar==
Examples of conservative features in Kalasha and Khowar are (note, NIA = [[New Indo-Aryan]], MIA = [[Middle Indo-Aryan]], OIA = [[Old Indo-Aryan]]):
* Preservation of intervocalic /m/ (reduced to a nasalized /w/ or /v/ in late MIA elsewhere), e.g. Kal. ''grom'', Kho. ''gram'' "village" &lt; OIA ''grāma''
* Non-deletion of intervocalic /t/, preserved as /l/ or /w/ in Kalasha, /r/ in Khowar (deleted in middle MIA elsewhere), e.g. Kho. ''brār'' "brother" &lt; OIA ''bhrātṛ''; Kal. ''ʃau'' &lt; ''*ʃal'', Kho. ''ʃor'' "hundred" &lt; OIA ''śata''
* Preservation of the distinction between all three OIA sibilants (dental /s/, palatal /ś/, retroflex /ṣ/); in most of the subcontinent, these three had already merged before 200 BC (early MIA)
* Preservation of sibilant + consonant, stop + /r/ clusters (lost by early MIA in most other places):

'''Liu Shaoqi''' ({{small|pronounced}} {{IPAc-cmn|l|you|2|-|sh|ao|4|q|i|2}}; {{zh|c=刘少奇}}; 24 November 1898{{spaced ndash}}12 November 1969) was a Chinese revolutionary, politician, and theorist. He was [[Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee]] from 1954 to 1959, [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|First Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] from 1956 to 1966 and [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chairman (President) of the People's Republic of China]], China's ''de jure'' [[head of state]], from 1959 to 1968, during which he implemented policies of [[economic reconstruction]] in China.

For 15 years, President Liu was the third most powerful man in China, behind only Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Originally groomed as Mao's successor, Liu antagonized him in the early 1960s before the [[Cultural Revolution]], and from 1966 onward was criticized, then purged, by Mao. Liu disappeared from public life in 1968 and was labelled the "commander of China's bourgeoisie headquarters", China's foremost "[[capitalist roader|capitalist-roader]]", and a traitor to the revolution.

He died under harsh treatment in late 1969, but was [[political rehabilitation|posthumously rehabilitated]] by [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s government in 1980 and granted a national memorial service.

==Biography==
===Youth===
Liu was born into a moderately rich peasant family in Huaminglou village,&lt;ref name=Dittmer/&gt; [[Ningxiang]], [[Hunan]] province;&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Edgar, ''Red Star Over China'', Random House (New York), 1938. Citation is from the Grove Press 1973 edition, p.482-484&lt;/ref&gt; his ancestral hometown is located at [[Jishui County]], [[Jiangxi]]. He attended Ningxiang Zhusheng Middle School ({{zh|s=宁乡驻省中学|p=Nìngxiāng Zhùshěng zhōngxué}}), and was recommended to attend a class in [[Shanghai]] to prepare for studying in [[Russia]]. In 1920, he and [[Ren Bishi]] joined a Socialist Youth Corps; the next year, Liu was recruited to study at the Comintern's [[University of the Toilers of the East]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=Dittmer/&gt;

He joined the newly formed [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) in 1921. The next year he returned to [[China]], and as secretary of the All-China Labor Syndicate led several railway workers' strikes, in the Yangzi Valley and at [[Anyuan District|Anyuan]] on the [[Jiangxi]]-[[Hunan]] border.&lt;ref name=Dittmer/&gt;

===Early political activities===
In 1925, Liu became a member of the [[Guangzhou]]-based All-China Federation of Labor Executive Committee. During the next two years he led numerous political campaigns and strikes in [[Hubei]] and Shanghai. He worked with [[Li Lisan]] in Shanghai in 1925, organizing Communist activity following the [[May Thirtieth Incident]]. After his work in Shanghai, Liu traveled to [[Wuhan]]. He was briefly arrested in [[Changsha]] and then returned to Guangzhou to help organize the 16-month-long [[Canton-Hong Kong strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Dittmer, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the Party's [[Central Committee]] in 1927, and was appointed to the head of its Labor Department.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Jerome. ''Mao and the Chinese Revolution,'' (London), 1965, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Liu returned to work at the Party headquarters in Shanghai in 1929, and was named Secretary of the [[Manchuria|Manchurian]] Party Committee in [[Shenyang|Fengtian]].&lt;ref&gt;Dittmer, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 and 1931, he attended the Third and Fourth Plenums of the Sixth Central Committee, and was elected to the Central Executive Committee (i.e., Politburo) of the Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931 or 1932. Later in 1932, he left Shanghai and traveled to the [[Jiangxi Soviet]].&lt;ref&gt;Snow, p. 482-484&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior leader===
Liu became the Party Secretary of [[Fujian]] Province in 1932. He accompanied the [[Long March]] in 1934 at least as far as the crucial [[Zunyi Conference]], but was then sent to the so-called "White Areas" (areas controlled by the [[Kuomintang]]) to reorganize underground activities in northern China, centered around [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]. He became Party Secretary in North China in 1936, leading the anti-Japanese movements in that area with the assistance of [[Peng Zhen]], [[An Ziwen]], [[Bo Yibo]], [[Ke Qingshi]], [[Liu Lantao]], and [[Yao Yilin]]. Liu ran the Central Plains Bureau in 1939; and, in 1941, the Central China Bureau. Some Japanese sources have alleged that the activities of his organization sparked the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in July 1937, which gave Japan the excuse to launch the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name=dittmer17&gt;Dittmer 1974, p. 17 citing Tetsuya Kataoka, ''Resistance and Revolution in China: The Communists and the Second United Front'', 1974 pre-publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Liu traveled to the Communist base at [[Yan'an|Yanan]]; in 1941, he became a political commissar of the [[New Fourth Army]].&lt;ref name=dittmer17/&gt; He was elected as one of five CPC Secretaries at the Seventh National Party Congress in 1945. After that Congress, he became the supreme leader of all Communist forces in Manchuria and northern China,&lt;ref name=dittmer17/&gt; a stature frequently overlooked by historians.

Liu became the Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government in 1949. In 1954, China adopted a new constitution at the first [[National People's Congress]] (NPC); at the Congress's first session, he was elected [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|chairman of the Congress's Standing Committee]], a position he held until the second NPC in 1959. From 1956 until his downfall in 1966, he ranked as the First [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref name=dittmer17/&gt;

Liu's work focused on party organizational and theoretical affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Dittmer 1974, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; He was an orthodox Soviet-style Communist, and favored state planning and the development of heavy industry. He elaborated upon his political and economic beliefs in his writings. His best known works include ''How to be a Good Communist'' (1939), ''On the Party'' (1945), and ''Internationalism and Nationalism'' (1952).

===Presidency===
Liu spoke very strongly in favour of the [[Great Leap Forward]] at the Eighth CPC National Congress in May 1958.&lt;ref name="dittmer39-40"&gt;Dittmer 1974, p. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; At this Congress Liu stood together with [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Peng Zhen]] in support of Mao's policies against those who were more critical, such as [[Chen Yun]] and [[Zhou Enlai]].

As a result, Liu gained influence within the party; in April 1959, he succeeded Mao as [[President of the People's Republic of China]]. However, Liu began to voice indications of concern about the outcomes of the Great Leap in the August 1959 [[Lushan Plenum]].&lt;ref name="dittmer39-40"/&gt; In order to correct the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward, Liu and Deng led economic reforms that bolstered their prestige among the party apparatus and the national populace. Once, he said to Mao: "People write books about cannibalism!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnn.cc/reveal/200711/t20071116_670118.html |title=刘少奇回应毛泽东：人相食要上书的！_星岛环球网_揭秘 |publisher=Stnn.cc |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic policies of Deng and Liu were notable for being more moderate than Mao's radical ideas.

===Conflict with Mao===

[[File:1939 Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai.jpg|thumb|Liu Shaoqi and [[Zhou Enlai]], 1939]]

Liu was publicly acknowledged as Mao's chosen successor in 1961;&lt;ref name=Dittmer&gt;Dittmer, Lowell, ''Liu Shao-ch’i and the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Politics of Mass Criticism'', University of California Press (Berkeley), 1974, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; however, by 1962 his opposition to Mao's policies had led Mao to mistrust him.&lt;ref name = "Culture1"/&gt; After Mao succeeded in restoring his prestige during the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', New York: W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}} p.566.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu's eventual downfall became "inevitable". Liu's position as the second-most powerful leader of the CPC contributed to Mao's rivalry with him at least as much as Liu's political beliefs or factional allegiances in the 1960s,&lt;ref name = "Culture1"&gt;Qiu Jin, ''The Culture of Power: the Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution'', Stanford University Press: Stanford, California. 1999, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that Liu's later persecution was the result of a power struggle that went beyond the goals and well-being of either China or the Party.

By 1966, few senior leaders in China questioned the need for a widespread reform to combat the growing problems of corruption and bureaucratisation within the Party and the government. With the goal of reforming the government to be more efficient and true to the Communist ideal, Liu himself chaired the enlarged Politburo meeting that officially began the [[Cultural Revolution]]. However, Liu and his political allies quickly lost control of the Cultural Revolution soon after it was called, when Mao used the movement to progressively monopolize political power and to destroy his perceived enemies.&lt;ref name = "Culture2"&gt;Qiu Jin, ''The Culture of Power: the Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution'', Stanford University Press: Stanford, California. 1999, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever its other causes, the Cultural Revolution, declared in 1966, was overtly pro-Maoist, and gave Mao the power and influence to purge the Party of his political enemies at the highest levels of government. Along with closing China's schools and universities, and Mao's exhortations to young Chinese to randomly destroy old buildings, temples, and art, and to attack their teachers, school administrators, party leaders, and parents,&lt;ref name="CR1"&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', New York: W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}} p.575.&lt;/ref&gt; the Cultural Revolution also increased Mao's prestige so much that entire villages adopted the practice of offering prayers to Mao before every meal.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', New York: W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}} p.584&lt;/ref&gt;

In both national politics and Chinese popular culture, Mao established himself as a demigod accountable to no one, purging any that he suspected of opposing him&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. {{ISBN|962-996-280-2}} p.4&lt;/ref&gt; and directing the masses and [[Red Guards]] "to destroy virtually all state and party institutions".&lt;ref name = "Culture2" /&gt; After the Cultural Revolution was announced, most of the most senior members of the CPC who had voiced any hesitation in following Mao's direction, including Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, were removed from their posts almost immediately; and, with their families, subjected to mass criticism and humiliation.&lt;ref name="CR1" /&gt;

Liu and Deng, along with many others, were denounced as "[[capitalist roader]]s". Liu was labeled as a "traitor" and "the biggest capitalist roader in the Party"; he was displaced as [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Party Deputy Chairman]] by [[Lin Biao]] in July 1966. By 1967, Liu and his wife [[Wang Guangmei]] were placed under house arrest in Beijing. Liu was removed from all his positions and expelled from the Party in October 1968. After his arrest, Liu disappeared from public view.

===Vilification, death and rehabilitation===
Liu was beaten regularly at public denunciation meetings after his arrest in 1967. He was denied medicine for his diabetes, by then a long-term illness, and for pneumonia, which he developed after his arrest. Liu was eventually given treatment only when [[Jiang Qing]] feared he would die; she desired that Liu be kept alive to serve as a "living target" during the [[9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Ninth Party Congress]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="Chung1"&gt;Chung, Jang. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TYHPLULRAtAC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;lpg=PA391&amp;dq=peng+dehuai+head+tumor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sWKyWnDcbw&amp;sig=-usZwF_AREYvmJxp7Kw7K1UAf9o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hUa5T-2JC8qkiQKJs7XxBg&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=peng%20dehuai%20head%20tumor&amp;f=false ''White Swans: Three Daughters of China'']. Touchstone: New York, NY. 2003. p.391. {{ISBN|0-7432-4698-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Congress, Liu was denounced as a traitor and an enemy agent. Zhou Enlai read the Party verdict that Liu was "a criminal traitor, enemy agent and scab in the service of the imperialists, modern revisionists and the Kuomintang reactionaries". Liu's conditions did not improve after he was denounced in the Congress, and he died soon afterward.&lt;ref name="Chung1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="glover"&gt;{{cite book |title=Humanity : A Moral History of the Twentieth Century |last=Glover |first=Jonathan |publisher=London: J. Cape |year=1999 |page=289 |isbn=0-300-08700-4 |authorlink=Jonathan Glover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a memoir written by Liu's principal physician, he disputed the alleged medical maltreatment of Liu during his last days. According to Dr. Gu Qihua, there was a dedicated medical team in charge of treating Liu's illness; between July 1968 and October 1969, Liu had seven total occurrences of pneumonia due to his deteriorating immune system, and there had been a total of 40 group consultations by top medical professionals regarding the treatment of this disease. Liu was closely monitored daily by the medical team, and they made the best effort given the adverse circumstance. He died of illness on November 12, 1969, and was cremated next day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.sina.com.cn/bk/wgs/2013-11-12/155073840_2.shtml Liu Shaoqi's Emergency Treatment] 回忆抢救刘少奇, 炎黄春秋 (Nov. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1980, two years after [[Deng Xiaoping]] came to power, the Fifth Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Resolution on the Rehabilitation of Comrade Liu Shaoqi". The resolution declared Liu's ouster to be unjust and removed the labels of "renegade, traitor and scab" that had been attached to him at the time of his death. It also declared him to be "a great Marxist and proletarian revolutionary" and recognized him as one of the principal leaders of the Party. Lin Biao was blamed for "concocting false evidence" against Liu, and for working with the [[Gang of Four]] to subject him to "political frame-up and physical persecution". A high-profile national memorial ceremony was held for Liu on May 17, 1980, and his ashes were scattered into the sea at Qingdao in accordance with his last wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/CPC_90_anniversary/2011-06/22/content_22838789.htm|title= Rehabilitation of Liu Shaoqi (Feb. 1980)| accessdate= November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/344491/Liu-Shaoqi/ Liu Shaoqi] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lois K. Alexander-Lane''' (born '''Lois Marie Kindle'''; 11 June 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102602221.html|title=Lois Alexander Lane; Founder Of Harlem Institute of Fashion|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|date=2007-10-27|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; - 29 September 2007) was an African American fashion designer and founded the [[Black Fashion Museum]] in 1979.

== Personal life ==
Alexander-Lane was born in Little Rock, Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/21/AR2010052101654_3.html?sid=ST2010052101774|title=Black Fashion Museum collection finds a fine home with Smithsonian|date=2010-05-23|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander-Lane received her master's degree at [[New York University]] in 1963, she proposed a thesis on the historic role of African Americans in Manhattan retailing; her professor responded by saying African Americans played no such role. Her resulting thesis—and later her life's work—proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nmaahc.si.edu/Collections/BlackFashion|title=Black Fashion Museum Collection   Collections {{!}} National Museum of African American History and Culture|website=nmaahc.si.edu|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
The Black Fashion Museum first opened in 1979 in Harlem, originally established in Harlem on West 126th Street that now houses the [[Clinton Foundation|William J. Clinton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/21/AR2010052101654_3.html?sid=ST2010052101774|title=Black Fashion Museum collection finds a fine home with Smithsonian|date=2010-05-23|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum relocated to Washington, D.C. in 1994 to a historic row house at 2007 Vermont Ave. NW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/21/AR2010052101654.html?sid=ST2010052101774|title=Black Fashion Museum collection finds a fine home with Smithsonian|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=2010-05-23|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Alexander-Lane eventually published her own book, Blacks in the History of Fashion in 1982. Alexander-Lane died in 2007 at the age of 91. The Black Fashion Museum collection was donated to the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture|Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in 2007 by her daughter Joyce Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/21/AR2010052101654.html?sid=ST2010052101774|title=Black Fashion Museum collection finds a fine home with Smithsonian|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=2010-05-23|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Black Fashion Museum collection was originally stored in a two-story row house on Vermont Avenue in Washington, D.C. The collection comprises more than 700 garments, 300 accessories, and 60 boxes of archival material collected by Alexander-Lane throughout her life. The research collection—one of the largest and rarest of its kind—includes a dress sewn by Rosa Parks shortly before her famous arrest in Montgomery, Ala.; a beige-patterned skirt worn by an enslaved child in Leesburg, Va.; the original Tin Man costume designed by Geoffrey Holder for the 1975 Broadway musical, The Wiz."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nmaahc.si.edu/Collections/BlackFashion|title=Black Fashion Museum Collection   Collections {{!}} National Museum of African American History and Culture|website=nmaahc.si.edu|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Clothing and bonnets worn by slaves in the mid-1800s appear alongside an elaborately constructed opera cape made by a former slave. Other items include gowns by [[Ann Lowe]], a pioneering African American designer whose patrons included the Rockefellers, the Du Ponts, the Vanderbilts, and Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. 'The objects not only tell the story of black fashion,' Moresi says, 'but of the women and men who created them, wore them and held on to them for years.'

'''Marc Summers''' (born '''Marc Berkowitz'''; November 11, 1951)&lt;ref name=filmref /&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[television personality]], [[comedian]], [[game show host]], [[television producer|producer]], and [[talk show host]]. He is best [[known]] for [[Master of ceremonies|hosting]] ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Double Dare]]'' for [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]],  ''[[Unwrapped]]'' for  [[Food Network]], and recently he was [[Executive Producer]] for both ''[[Dinner Impossible]]'' and ''[[Restaurant Impossible]]'' also for Food Network.

== Early career ==
Summers was born Marc Berkowitz in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/4/Marc-Summers.html |title=Marc Summers Biography (1951-) |publisher= FilmReference.com |accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Steve|title=Radio: The Book|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Focal Press|location=Burlington and San Diego|isbn=0240806964|pages=18–19|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Westlane Middle School and [[North Central High School (Indianapolis)|North Central High School]] in Indianapolis and [[Grahm Junior College]] in Boston, Massachusetts. His early careers were as a [[radio]] [[disc jockey]] and a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]; though he held various television production jobs before Summers' career was boosted in 1986, when Nickelodeon hired him as the host of ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]''. ''Double Dare'' was [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] within two years and had a brief broadcast network run in [[prime time]] as ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)#Family Double Dare|Fox Family Double Dare]]'' in 1988. The show's popularity led to other hosting jobs including the syndicated ''[[Couch Potatoes (game show)|Couch Potatoes]]'' in 1989, and Nickelodeon's ''[[What Would You Do? (game show)|What Would You Do?]]'' in 1991. [[Game Show Network|GSN]] chose him to host its original program ''[[WinTuition]]'' in 2002. He also had a rare dramatic performance in the Nickelodeon-produced [[Halloween]] program ''[[Mystery Magical Special]]'', which also highlighted his skills as a stage [[Illusionist|magician]]. Summers also made celebrity guest rounds on other game shows including ''[[Scrabble (game show)|Scrabble]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Super Password]]'', ''[[Talk About (game show)|Talk About]]'', ''[[Lingo (U.S. game show)|Lingo]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'', and ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Summers appeared on television talk shows, including a stint on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television's]] ''[[Home (1988 TV series)|Home Show]]''. After ''Double Dare's'' cancellation in 1993, Summers co-hosted ''Our Home'', a daily talk show aimed at homemakers, on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]]. Summers left ''Our Home'' after a couple of seasons to co-host another Lifetime talk show, ''Biggers &amp; Summers''.

On March 28, 2008, the Communication and Journalism Club of [[Coastal Carolina University]] presented Summers with the first annual Peach Cobbler Award and declared that day as "Marc Summers Day". The Peach Cobbler Award was modeled after [[Harvard]]'s [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals#Honorary awards|Hasty Pudding Award]]. The Peach Cobbler Award recognizes an individual and their accomplishments in the communication field. After the ceremony, Summers hosted a mock version of ''Double Dare'' on the university's campus.

== Health ==
During an interview with Dr. Eric Hollander on ''Biggers &amp; Summers'', Summers revealed that he has [[obsessive compulsive disorder]]. Summers went public about his condition on various television shows, including ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''. In 1999, Summers produced a VHS video box set with Hollander about his experience, called ''[[Everything in Its Place|Everything in Its Place: My Trials and Triumphs with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder]]''. Summers also participated in a series of VHS videos for Freedom from Fear, a non-profit organization with the goal of addressing anxiety disorders and other related behavioral disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomfromfear.org/ftp/vid_lib/vid_lib_anx.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009031238/http://www.freedomfromfear.org/ftp/vid_lib/vid_lib_anx.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-10-09 |title=VHS Video Library - Anxiety |publisher=Freedomfromfear.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his OCD, he was able to interact fully with his fans and contestants on ''Double Dare'' to the point of even allowing himself to get slimed and shaking hands with contestants.  Going public with his OCD cost Summers a job as host of a ''Hollywood Squares'' revival, and he was replaced by [[Tom Bergeron]].&lt;ref name="Oprah"&gt;"Whitney Houston's Sister-In-Law Pat Houston &amp; Model Niki Taylor."  ''Oprah: Where Are They Now?''  Exec. Prod. Julie Simpson, Jill Van Lokeren, and Veronica Votypka.  CEO/Chief Crea. Off. Oprah Winfrey.  Oprah Winfrey Network.  16 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Summers suffered severe head injuries in an accident in a Philadelphia taxicab equipped with a partition. Summers said, "Everything on the left side [of my face] from my eye socket down was just wiped out. My eye socket got all swollen. I'm having trouble seeing completely out of the left eye ... There's lots of VCR parts in my face. I was pretty lucky that I didn't have brain damage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Marc Summers - I Broke My Face in Nasty Car Accident| url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/08/16/marc-summers-car-accident-broken-face-double-dare-food-network-host/| date=August 16, 2012| journal=[[TMZ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 interview on the Philadelphia-based "Preston and Steve" radio show (WMMR), Summers revealed that 6 years before, in 2009, he had "stomach problems" and had been in a lot of pain. Exploratory surgery revealed that he had chronic [[lymphatic leukemia]]. The initial doctor recommended [[chemotherapy]], but fearing the pain and illness involved, Summers sought the opinion of another oncologist in [[Chicago]]. The oncologist promptly misdiagnosed him with [[mantle cell lymphoma]] and told him that he only had 6 months to live. Summers went back to his initial doctor in a panic; ultimately the original diagnosis of chronic lymphatic leukemia was confirmed. Chemotherapy would go on for the next 2 years for him, which he described as "brutal". Summers has had PET scans ever since his chemo finished, and as of 2016, is in remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title=Marc Summers Reveals He Had Cancer| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOQGw6fNbuk| series=Preston &amp; Steve| station=[[WMMR]]| date=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On "[[Preston and Steve]]" on April 10, 2018, Summers discussed flying to the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center from his home in Santa Barbara for further treatment.

== Later career ==
During the 1990s, Summers continued work on television shows, each with varying success. He created and hosted the short-lived children's game show ''[[Pick Your Brain]]'', co-hosted ''Great Day America'' on the [[Ion Television|PAX Network]], produced ''[[I Can't Believe You Said That]]'', and hosted ''It's a Surprise'' on [[Food Network]].

Summers returned to Nickelodeon in 2000 as the executive consultant for ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)#Double Dare 2000|Double Dare 2000]]'', an updated version of his original show. Two years later, he was the executive producer for another Nickelodeon resurrection, ''[[Wild and Crazy Kids]]''.

He returned to television as the host of more shows, including ''[[History IQ]]'' with his old announcer [[Harvey (announcer)|Harvey]] on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]; the [[Food Network]] series ''[[Unwrapped]]''; the ''Unwrapped'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] game show, ''Trivia Unwrapped''; and the [[Game Show Network]] series ''[[WinTuition]]''. In 2005, Summers became the host of Food Network's [[reality television|reality]] series ''[[The Next Food Network Star]]''. Summers joined Chef [[Guy Fieri]] as co-host of Food Network's ''Ultimate Recipe Showdown'' in 2008. In late 2006, [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[KingWorld]] planned a new game show called ''Combination Lock'', with Summers hosting the first pilot. It was to be paired with a revival of the classic game show, ''[[The Joker's Wild]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Two Games in the Works|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/105193-Two_Games_in_the_Works.php|publisher=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=July 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a deal couldn't be reached by [[KingWorld]] and station groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Roger King Sounds Off |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/107299-Roger_King_Sounds_Off.php|publisher=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Off the screen, Summers has been involved as an executive producer on the Food Network's ''[[Dinner: Impossible]]'' and "[[Restaurant: Impossible]]." Summers currently splits his time between homes in Los Angeles and Philadelphia where his company Marc Summers Productions has a branch.

Summers has hosted [[The Price Is Right Live!|stage versions of ''The Price Is Right'']] and credits [[Bob Barker]] and ''[[The Price Is Right (US game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' for helping him pursue a game-show career. Summers was a young page at [[CBS]] when ''The Price Is Right'' premiered with ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'' and ''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]'' in 1972, and he often asked advice of Barker, [[Jack Barry (television personality)|Jack Barry]] and [[Wink Martindale]]&amp;mdash;the shows' respective hosts&amp;mdash;about a hosting career. He claims it's the best possible education and training in the game show field, and it was during this time that Summers got his first on-air experience, as a fill-in announcer on ''The Joker's Wild''.

Summers served as host of "Drunk Double Dare" during Drunk Day, an annual episode of the Philadelphia-based [[Preston and Steve]] radio show on [[WMMR]], held directly before the [[Fourth of July]] weekend. The show reunited Summers with his ''Double Dare'' cohorts [[John Harvey (announcer)|John Harvey]] and Robin Marrella. He has also hosted "Dunkel Dare" during the annual Beer Week in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Summers appears in the [[Good Charlotte]] music video for their song "[[Last Night (Good Charlotte song)|Last Night]]", which uses ''Family Double Dare'' as the motif for the video. He has also played himself on ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'',  ''[[Workaholics]]'', and ''[[Sanjay &amp; Craig]]'', and appeared in special segments on ABC's ''[[The Chew]]''.

He is the subject and executive producer of ''On Your Marc'', a documentary that chronicles his life and development of his one-man theater show, featuring interviews with [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], [[Guy Fieri]] and [[Seth Green]], and was directed by [[Mathew Klickstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On Your Marc|url=http://www.marcsummersmovie.com/about-the-film}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted a number of early preview screenings and live events as part of a nationwide promotional tour of the film in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=What’s Nickelodeon Slime Really Made Of?

Summers returned to host a 30th Anniversary of ''Double Dare'' at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]. Summers also appeared in a commemorative half-hour special in honor of the show's 30th anniversary that aired on Nickelodeon on November 23, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=After facing some big challenges, Marc Summers is back for the 30th anniversary of 'Double Dare'|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-marc-summers-double-dare-anniversary-20161121-story.html| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summers currently provides color commentary on along with his vast knowledge of the game on the revival of ''Double Dare'' with [[Liza Koshy]], now produced by RTL Group / FremantleMedia, and serves as executive producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Nordyke| first1=Kimberly| title='Double Dare' Reboot Taps YouTube Star Liza Koshy as Host| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/double-dare-reboot-taps-youtube-star-liza-koshy-as-host-1113637| newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]| date=May 22, 2018| accessdate=June 22, 2018| language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Katherine Jaynes Shell''', previously '''Mary Hosking''', usually known as '''Mary K. Shell''' (February 9, 1927 – June 14, 2018),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/former-mayor-mary-k-shell-has-died/article_492cd5fe-6ff2-11e8-a02a-afa4fa080b84.html/ Former Mayor Mary K. Shell has died]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American politician and the first woman to have served as [[mayor]] of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[California]] (1981–1985) and only the second woman to have served on the [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] Board of Supervisors (1985–1997). At the time of her retirement from public office, Shell was termed by the ''[[Bakersfield Californian]]'' as "the most popular [[politician]] in Kern County [[history]]." She was the [[widow]] of [[Joe Shell|Joseph C. Shell, Sr.]] (1918–2008), a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] minority leader of the [[California State Assembly]] from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Richard M. Nixon]]'s intraparty opponent for [[governor]] in 1962, and a lawmaker who fought to bring water to southern California in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanmarinotribune.com/tribune/read/publisher_02/2008-04-08.01 San Marino Tribune – serving San Marino, CA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429184751/http://www.sanmarinotribune.com/tribune/read/publisher_02/2008-04-08.01 |date=2008-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years, family, journalism==

Shell was the younger of two daughters born in Bakersfield to Walter Jaynes (1897–1972) and the former Mary Ellen Young (1897–1990).&lt;ref name=roots&gt;[http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi Social Security Death Index Interactive Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Shell's paternal grandfather, Harris E. Jaynes, arrived in Bakersfield about 1900 to work as a [[welder]] for the [[Southern Pacific]] [[Railroad]]. He opened a welding shop which evolved into H. E. Jaynes and Son, an [[automobile]] repair business on Chester Street. Mary K., also called "Miki" by her family and friends, worked in the shop, doing chores traditionally associated with males. She recalls servicing a [[Buick]] when news of the [[D-Day]] landings in [[Normandy]] of June 6, 1944 were announced by [[radio]]. She demonstrated a youthful interest in current events, [[journalism]], and politics. She was the editor of the student newspapers at Washington Junior High School and East Bakersfield High School. She was also a song leader and secretary to the student council. Shell said that so many extracurricular activities kept her from being an "A" student.&lt;ref name=kern&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kernpressclub.org/downloads/shellprofile.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629023645/http://kernpressclub.org/downloads/shellprofile.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Shell attended [[Bakersfield College]], a public [[community college]], but dropped out a [[semester]] shy of receiving her [[associate's degree]]. She is a donor to the college and a member of its foundation board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcfoundation.charityfinders.org/Board Bakersfield College Foundation – Board&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead she worked part-time at the ''[[Bakersfield Californian]]'' [[newspaper]], where at the age of seventeen she had been the "cub" reporter on the farm beat. She soon learned that city officials were making most decisions over lunch at the [[Hotel]] El Tejon (now the site of the [[Bank of America]] building in Bakersfield) and then routinely approving what had been decided at council meetings. This was long before the era of "open meetings" laws, known in California as the [[Ralph M. Brown Act]]. Shell had taken flying lessons while she worked as a flight dispatcher at La Cresta Airfield near the Panorama Bluffs of Bakersfield.&lt;ref name=kern/&gt;

==Three marriages==

In 1945, at the age of eighteen, she married Army Air Corps Lt.Don Sticker, but the couple divorced in 1947. She married Richard "Dick" Hosking in 1948, by whom she had three children: Geoffrey Richard Hosking (born 1951), Timothy William Hosking (1952–1979),&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; and Meredith Katherine Hosking (1959–1981). The couple lived briefly in the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] area, where Hosking attended Santa Clara Law School, and she worked at the San Jose Airport. They soon returned to Bakersfield, and she became a secretary to a [[cotton]] cooperative. Dick served on the Bakersfield City Council from 1965–1969. Mary and Dick separated in 1967 and divorced two years later. In 1970 she wed Joe Shell, a distinguished flight instructor during [[World War II]] who, like her, held a [[Aviator|pilot]]'s license. When Joe ran for California Governor in 1962, she helped in his campaign in Kern County.&lt;ref name=kern/&gt; Mary was later a reporter-[[photographer]] and then, the editor, of the ''News Bulletin'', a semi-weekly newspaper serving [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] Bakersfield.&lt;ref name=women&gt;[http://www.firstwomenofkern.org/stories/storyReader$62 First Women of Kern County : Shell, Mary K&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital correspondent==

From 1970 to 1980, Mary K. Shell was a correspondent based in the state [[capital (political)|capital]] of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] for ''The Californian'' and the [[print syndication|syndicated]] Capitol News Service. She covered the legislature and other state agencies: "That was before we even had [[fax machine]]s," she recalls. She wrote her weekly column on a [[typewriter]] and shipped it to Bakersfield on a [[Greyhound]] [[bus]]. Shell's old job was discontinued by the newspaper in 2007 because of financial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.bakersfield.com/home/Blog/politicsanyone/t1183273200 Politics, anyone? – Bakersfield.com – More than before&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Shell won honors: the 1972 Excellence in Reporting Award from the California Trial Lawyers Association and the 1975 California Taxpayers Reporting Award for her revelations about excessive early retirement benefits for legislators, a phenomenon unknown to many California voters. Joe was a [[lobbyist]] for oil companies while the couple lived in Sacramento. During that period, they generally made two trips monthly to Bakersfield, where they would move permanently in 1980.&lt;ref name=kern/&gt;

In 1978, the Shells opened an oil business together and drilled four heavy-oil wells in at the Deer Creek field in [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]] located adjacent to Kern County. Because the name "Shell" could not be used, they called the endeavor Concho Petroleum. They maintained the low-output wells until 1993.&lt;ref name=kern/&gt;

==Family tragedies==

Tragedy struck in 1979, when her younger son Tim, at twenty-six, who had fallen into a life of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and despair, died of a drug overdose.&lt;ref name=kern/&gt;

Thereafter, Shell decided to run for mayor after three-term incumbent Donald Hart announced that he would not seek reelection. The odds were so against Shell that it was said only Joe Shell actually believed that his wife could prevail against four male candidates. She went on to win the [[nonpartisan]] [[runoff election]] against former Kern County Sheriff Charles Dodge, who had led in the first round of balloting by only twenty-five votes. Although many campaigns stop their intense efforts on election eve, Shell persisted through election day; her [[grass roots]] volunteers walked door to door until the polls closed on election night.&lt;ref name=kern/&gt;

Early in the term, a second tragedy occurred when daughter Meredith died at the age of twenty-two of [[cardiac arrest]] caused by medications. Dick Hosking died thereafter.&lt;ref name=kern/&gt;

==Public accomplishments==

As mayor, Shell promoted civic self-esteem. She reached out to the minority community. She chided [[NBC]] ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' host [[Johnny Carson]] for his reference to "beautiful downtown Bakersfield" (Carson also referred to [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], though his remarks were not considered malicious). "I tried to get Johnny Carson to come here and see for himself [the improvements in Bakersfield]. He never made it", Shell remembers.&lt;ref name=kern/&gt;

A partial list of her accomplishments include:

(1) Founding the Beautiful Bakersfield Committee with an annual awards dinner and the restoration of the community [[Christmas]] [[parade]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cmconvention.org/who.html Who?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608123953/http://www.cmconvention.org/who.html |date=2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) Establishing a committee of veteran's organizations to build a memorial to [[Medal of Honor]] recipient [[Larry Pierce (Medal of Honor)|Larry Pierce]] of Bakersfield and to all from Kern County who served in the [[Vietnam War]]. The memorial is located at the county courts building.

(3) Creating the Bakersfield Historical Preservation Commission

(4) Establishing the annual Bakersfield [[Prayer]] Breakfast

(5) Serving on the California Local Government Task Force under appointment from Republican Governor [[George Deukmejian]]&lt;ref name=women /&gt;

==Supervisor Shell==

In 1985, Shell vacated the office of mayor, having been elected to the first of three four-year terms on the also nonpartisan Kern County Board of Supervisors. As a supervisor, she also served two years as chairman of the agriculture committee of the California State Association of Counties and as a subcommittee chairman of the National Association of Counties Agriculture Committee. She represented Kern County on the [[San Joaquin Valley]] [[air pollution]] control district. After her tenure as a county supervisor, Shell did consulting work for individuals having difficulty with government [[bureaucracy]] and regulations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In her first election as supervisor from a predominantly minority district in southeastern Bakersfield, Shell defeated Richard Ybarra, a son-in-law of [[Hispanic]] [[organized labor|labor]] organizer [[Cesar Chavez]], 52.4–47.5 percent. She was unopposed in 1988. In 1992, after [[redistricting]], her district became even more prominently Hispanic and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] in orientation with the inclusion of the Arvin and Lamont neighborhoods. Shell still polled 61.2 percent of the vote against Ray Gonzales and another candidate. She did not seek a fourth term in 1996, and the position went to Peter "Pete" Parra.

While in office, she personally hosted many social gatherings and joined constituents in cleaning up litter-strewn lots. Out of office, she did consulting work for individuals and companies having problems with the [[bureaucracy]] of [[government]].&lt;ref name=kern/&gt;

==Most memorable achievement==

When asked her most memorable accomplishment in office, Shell replied that it was the diversion of grant funds to establish a lighted [[soccer]] field in an underserved area of the city and the coordination undertaken for an American Youth Soccer Organization program. Shell recalls having stopped at [[McDonald's]] [[restaurant]] one day. A young woman followed her out to say, "Thank you so much – my brother was headed for trouble. Having the soccer field in our neighborhood made a difference. He joined AYSO and changed his life."&lt;ref name=women /&gt;

==Political power couple==

In their later years, Joe and Mary K. Shell became a political "power couple" in Bakersfield and were often sought out for advice and friendship by aspiring Republican candidates for office. At the funeral of Joe Shell on April 11, 2008, former Kern County [[Sheriff]] Carl Sparks recalled that "when I ran for sheriff people told me, 'The first thing you gotta do is go see Mary and Joe.' That he was willing to see you at all and talk to you as a person was a privilege."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfield.com/hourly_news/story/414524.html Family, friends remember Joe Shell – Latest news | Bakersfield.com – Kern County news, events, shopping &amp; search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shell was honored through the naming of the Mary K. Shell Journalism [[Scholarship]] and the Mary K. Shell Mental Health Facility in Bakersfield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namicalifornia.org/document-detail.aspx?page=homepage&amp;tabb=mhsaupdates&amp;lang=ENG&amp;idno=348 NAMI California – Informing, Educating &amp; Supporting People With Mental Illness &amp; Their Families&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in Bakersfield.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39778">{{Main|Council on Foreign Relations}}
There are two types of '''Council on Foreign Relations membership''': life, and term membership, which lasts for five years and is available to those between the ages of 30 and 36 at the time of their application. Only U.S. citizens (native born or naturalized) and permanent residents who have applied for U.S. citizenship are eligible. A candidate for life membership must be nominated in writing by one Council member and seconded by a minimum of three others (strongly encouraged to be other CFR members).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/membership/individual-membership |title=Individual Membership |publisher=Cfr.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate membership (250 in total) is divided into three levels: "Founders" ($100,000), "President’s Circle" ($60,000), and "Affiliates" ($30,000). All corporate executive members have opportunities to hear distinguished speakers, such as overseas presidents and prime ministers, chairmen and CEOs of multinational corporations, and US officials and Congressmen. President’s Circle and Founders are also entitled to other benefits, including attendance at small, private dinners or receptions with senior American officials and world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cfr.org/membership/corporate-membership |title="Corporate Program" }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(330&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==
The Board of Directors of the Council on Foreign Relations is composed in total of thirty-six officers. [[Peter G. Peterson]] and [[David Rockefeller]] are Directors Emeriti (Chairman Emeritus and Honorary Chairman, respectively). It also has an International Advisory Board consisting of thirty-five distinguished individuals from across the world.&lt;ref name=Prespage&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/about/ "President's Welcome] ("About CFR"), with a hyperlink to [http://www.cfr.org/about/history/ "History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012062131/http://www.cfr.org/about/history/ |date=2007-10-12 }}, both accessed February 24, 2007.

{{Muhammad|expanded=career}}
The '''military career of Muhammad''' lasted for the final ten years of his life when he served as the leader of the ''[[ummah]]'', the head of state at [[Medina]].

==History==

[[Muhammad]] spent his last ten years, from 622 to 632, as the leader of [[Medina]] in a state of war with [[Mecca]]. Muhammad and his Companions had earlier migrated from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]] in what is known as the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]''. Through sieges and diplomacy, Muhammad and his followers allied with or subdued some of the [[Arabian tribes that interacted with Muhammad|tribes and cities of the Arabian peninsula]] in their struggle to overcome the powerful [[Quraysh (tribe)|Banu Quraish]] of Mecca.

They also sent out parties against Arabic-speaking communities ruled under the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]]. Muhammad was believed by the Muslims to be [[Prophet of Islam|divinely chosen]] to spread Islam in the world, and Muhammad ultimately permitted warfare as one aspect of this [[Jihad|struggle]].&lt;ref name="javed"&gt;[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], ''[[Mizan]]'', Chapter:The Islamic Law of Jihad, Dar ul-Ishraq, 2001. OCLC: 52901690 [http://www.studying-islam.org/articletext.aspx?id=771]&lt;/ref&gt; After initially refusing to accede to requests by his followers to fight the Meccans for continued persecution and provocation, he eventually proclaimed the revelations of the Quran:
::"Permission to fight is given to those who are fought against because they have been wronged -truly Allah has the power to come to their support- those who were expelled from their homes without any right, merely for saying, 'Our Lord is Allah'..." (Quran, 22:39-40)"
After the first [[battle of Badr]] against the Quraysh, he is reported as having said "We have returned from the lesser Jihad to the greater Jihad (i.e. the struggle against the evil of one's soul)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/jihad_2.shtml BBC Article - Religion &amp; Ethics Islam, last accessed 23 September 2006. The authenticity of this quote is the focus of some argument, however it is quite widely reported and of significant influence among [[Sufi]]'s.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Esposito]] writes that Muhammad's use of warfare in general was not alien,  neither to Arab custom nor to that of the Hebrew prophets, as both believed that God had sanctioned battle with the enemies of the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Esposito]](2005), ''Islam: The Straight Path'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lead up to armed conflict ===
{{Wikisource|Constitution of Medina}}
Upon arrival in Medina he set about the establishment of a pact known as the [[Constitution of Medina]], to regulate the matters of governance of the city, as well as the extent and nature of inter-community relations, and signatories to it included the [[Muslim]]s, the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] and the various [[Jew]]ish tribes of Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hisham, as-Seerat an-Nabawiyyah, Vol. I p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant clauses of the constitution included the mutual assistance of each other if one signatory were to be attacked by a third party, the resolution that the Muslims would profess their religion and the Jews theirs, as well as the appointment of Muhammad as the leader of the state.&lt;ref&gt;al-Mubarakpuri (2002) p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims who did not migrate were subject to increased persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch4s4.html#Pre-Badr%20Missions%20and%20Invasions al-Mubarakpuri (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;
And the threat to the life of both the Ansar and the Muhajireen was such that they were reported as having to sleep by their weapons all night.&lt;ref&gt;"When the Holy Prophet and his Companions came to Madina, and the helpers gave them shelter, all the Arabs combined to fight them. The Companions had to sleep by their weapons, till the morning" (Hakim and Darimi, quoted in Shibli's Sirat an-Nabi, p. 308)&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul, who was the Madinan chief of the tribes ‘[[Banu Aws|Aws]] and [[Khazraj]] and became a Muslim upon Muhammad's arrival, however the sincerity of him being a Muslim is doubted and he was labeled a hypocrite. &lt;ref name="al-Mubarakpuri"&gt;[http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch4s4.html#Pre-Badr%20Missions%20and%20Invasions al-Mubarakpuri]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], an Ansar, went to Mecca to learn how to perform the [[Umrah]] and there was accosted by [[Abu Jahl]] at the [[Kaaba]] who threatened he would kill him, had he not been in the company of Omaiya bin Khalaf. Sa‘d then challenged him to commit any such folly if he wanted to court a risk to the Meccan trading caravans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari]], {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|5|59|286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As tensions escalated the Muslims began to take defensive measures such as stationing guards around Muhammad and sending out reconnaissance patrols.&lt;ref name="al-Mubarakpuri"/&gt;

===Raids on Meccan caravans===
{{main|Caravan raids}}
The '''Caravan raids''' refer to a series of raids which [[Muhammad]] and his [[Sahabah|Companions]] participated in. The raids were generally offensive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Montgomery Watt|first=William|title=Muhammad: prophet and statesman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV7uAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=caravan+raids+offensive&amp;q=offensive|publisher=Oxford University Press, 1974|date=21 January 2010|page=105|isbn=978-0-19-881078-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and carried out to gather intelligence or seize the trade goods of Caravans financed by the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]], (such retaliation was explained as being legitimate by saying many Muslims possessions and wealth left behind when they [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated from Mecca]] were stolen).&lt;ref&gt;Mubarakpuri, When the Moon Split, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Muhammad, Islam's first general|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadbe2XP2o4C&amp;pg=PA73|first=Richard A. |last=Gabriel |year=2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press
|isbn=978-0-8061-3860-2|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslims declared that the raids were justified and that God gave them permission to defend against [[Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans|the Meccans' persecution of Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;Welch, ''Muhammad'', Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

=== Muslim alliance versus Meccan alliance ===
{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}
With the help of Banu Nadir, the exiled Jewish tribe from Medina, Abu Sufyan, the military leader of the Quraysh mustered a force of 10,000 men. Muhammad was able to prepare a force of about 3,000 men. He had however adopted a new form of defense, unknown in Arabia at that time: Muslims had dug trenches wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack. The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, [[Salman the Persian|Salman]]. The siege of Medina began on 31 March 627 and lasted for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p. 36, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Sufyan's troops were unprepared for the fortifications they were confronted with, and after an ineffectual siege, the coalition decided to go home.&lt;ref&gt;Rodinson (2002), pp. 209–211.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an discusses this battle in verses 9-27 of sura 33, [[Al-Ahzab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|33|9|e=27|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Uri Rubin, Quraysh, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Battle of the Trench map.gif|thumb|Battle of Khandaq ([[Battle of the Trench]])]]
During the Battle of the Trench, the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Qurayza]] who were located at the south of Medina were charged with treachery. After the retreat of the coalition, Muslims besieged Banu Qurayza, the remaining major Jewish tribe in Medina. The Banu Qurayza surrendered and all the men were beheaded, apart from a few who converted to Islam, while all the women and children were enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Muhammad: the prophet of God, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Ramadan, In the Footsteps of the Prophet, Oxford University Press, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina, aside from political explanations, western historians and biographers have explained it as "the punishment of the Medina Jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the Quran's tales of what happened to those who rejected the prophets of old."&lt;ref name="Peters77"&gt;[[Francis Edward Peters]] (2003), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; F. Peters adds that Muhammad was possibly emboldened by his military successes and also wanted to push his advantage. Economical motivations according to Peters also existed since the poorness of the Meccan migrants was a source of concern for Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Peters78"&gt;F.E.Peters (2003), pp. 76–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Peters argues that Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina was "quite extraordinary" and is "quite at odds with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews he encountered outside Medina."&lt;ref name="Peters194"&gt;Francis Edward Peters (2003), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Welch, Muhammad's treatment of the three major Jewish tribes brought Muhammad closer to his goal of organizing a community strictly on a religious basis.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"&gt;Alford Welch, ''Muhammad'', Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hudaybiyyah ===
{{main|Treaty of Hudaybiyyah}}
By old custom, during the months of pilgrimage, tribal hostilities stopped and all were free to visit Mecca.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In March 628, Muhammad put on the garb of a pilgrim and taking a force and camels for sacrifice, set out for Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.al-islam.org/unschooled-prophet-ayatullah-murtadha-mutahhari/event-hudaybiyyah | title=The Event of Hudaybiyyah}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the early chronicler [[Ibn Ishaq]], Muhammad took 700 men (Guillaume 1955, p.&amp;nbsp;500). According to Watt, Muhammad took 1400 to 1600 men (Watt 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;46).

The Meccans did not accept the Muslim professions of peaceful intent and sent out an armed party against them. The Muslims evaded them by taking a side route through the hills around Mecca, and then camped outside Mecca, at Hudaybiya. Ibn Ishaq describes a tense period of embassies and counter-embassies, including a bold foray by [[Uthman ibn Affan]] into the city of Mecca, where he was temporarily held as a hostage. The Meccans told the Muslims that Uthman had been killed and open warfare seemed imminent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Then the situation shifted radically. Uthman was revealed to be alive, and the Meccans expressed their willingness to negotiate a truce. Some elements  wanted a confrontation, but Muhammad held out for a peaceful resolution.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The treaty of Hudaybiyyah committed both sides to a ten-year truce. The Muslims were to be allowed to return the next year, to perform the pilgrimage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Muslim alliance expands ===
Free of the Meccan threat, the Muslims expanded their activities against other oases and tribes. They conquered the rich oasis of Khaybar (see [[Battle of Khaybar]]) and sent raiding parties against the Ghatafan, Murrah, Sulaym, and Hawaizin (Watt 1957 pp.&amp;nbsp;52–53).

=== Muslims conquer Makkah  ===
{{main|Conquest of Mecca}}
[[File:Muhammad destroying idols - L'Histoire Merveilleuse en Vers de Mahomet BNF.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Early 19th century manuscript showing the Muslim army marching into Mecca and the subsequent smashing of its idols.]]
Less than two years after the truce of Hudaybiyyah, the truce was broken by a squabble between tribes allied to the Makkans (Meccans) and Medinans. There had long been bad blood between the Khuza'ah and the Banu Bakr bin Abd Manat, and the two groups lined up on opposite sides, the Khuza'ah with the Muslims and the Banu Bakr with the Makkans . Watt (p.&amp;nbsp;62) says that some of the Quraysh helped the Banu Bakr ambush the Khuza'ah.

Shortly afterwards, a Muslim force of 10,000 men headed for Makkah.They camped outside Makkah and the usual round of emissaries and negotiations began. Apparently Abu Sufyan had negotiated, then or earlier, a promise that he and those under him would not be attacked if they surrendered peacefully. A few Makkans  from the Makhzum faction, prepared to resist. The Muslims conquered Makkah  successfully 

On or near January 11, 630, Muhammad sent four columns of troops into Makkah. Only one column met any resistance. Twenty-eight Makkans were killed and the rest of those opposing the Muslim entry fled. The remaining Makkans surrendered to Muhammad. Some of the Makkans, even those who had been notable for their opposition to Islam, were spared. &lt;ref&gt;The Message by Ayatullah Ja'far Subhani, chapter 48 referencing Sirah by Ibn Hisham, vol. II, page 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people were ordered to be killed: Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl, Abdullah ibn Saad ibn Abi Sarh, Habbar bin Aswad, Miqyas Subabah Laythi, Huwairath bin Nuqayd, Abdullah Hilal and four women who had been guilty of murder or other offences or had sparked off the war and disrupted the peace.

The Kaaba was cleansed of all the [[Cult image|idols]] of Arabian gods, such as [[Hubal]], which were placed in it and the area was established as a Muslim sanctuary.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam: A Short History|author=Karen Armstrong|isbn=978-0-8129-6618-3|date=2000,2002|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While destroying each idol, Muhammad recited {{Cite quran|17|81|style=nosup}} which says "Truth has arrived and falsehood has perished for falsehood is by its nature bound to perish".&lt;ref name=Ahram&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/536/in7.htm Islam, iconography and the Taliban] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302095200/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/536/in7.htm |date=2008-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uscMSA&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_76.html Conquest of Makkah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201161759/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_76.html |date=2009-02-01 }} - USC MSA&lt;/ref&gt; However he ordered an icon of Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus which was in the Ka'aba not to be destroyed.{http://www.bliis.org/essay/prophet-muhammad-jesus-marys-icons-kaba/} According to Islamic tradition, the Kaaba was built by [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] as a place of worship, and then later reconstructed by [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]].

==Statistics==

===Casualties ===
The sum total of all casualties on all sides in all the battles of Muhammad might be more or less 1,000. A contemporary Islamic scholar, [[Maulana]] [[Wahiduddin Khan]], says that "during the 23-years in which this revolution was completed, 80 military expeditions took place. The Prophet, however, only participated in some 27 of them, and an even smaller number of expeditions actually involved any fighting. 259 Muslims and 759 non-Muslims died in these battles – a total of 1018 dead."&lt;ref&gt;Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, ''Muhammad: A Prophet for All Humanity'', goodword (2000), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views===

==== Muslim View====
[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]] writes in [[Mizan]] that there are certain directives of the [[Qur’an]] pertaining to war which were specific only to Muhammad against Divinely specified peoples of his times (the [[polytheists]] and the [[Israelites]] and [[Nazarites]] of [[Arabia]] and some other [[Jews]], [[Christians]], et al.) as a form of Divine punishment—for they had persistently denied the truth of Muhammad's mission even after it had been made conclusively evident to them by Allah through Muhammad, and asked the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for [[jizya]] and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for military protection as the [[dhimmis]] of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam, hence now, the only valid reason for war is to end oppression when all other measures have failed.

'''Patricia Anne Boyd''' (born 17 March 1944) is an English model and photographer. She was one of the leading international models during the 1960s and, with [[Jean Shrimpton]], epitomised the British female "look" of the era. Boyd was married to [[George Harrison]] and experienced the height of [[the Beatles]]' popularity as well as sharing in their embrace of Indian spirituality. She later married and divorced Harrison's friend, guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. Boyd inspired Harrison's songs such as "[[If I Needed Someone]]", "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" and "[[For You Blue]]", and Clapton's "[[Layla]]" and "[[Wonderful Tonight]]".
 
In August 2007, Boyd published her autobiography ''[[Wonderful Today]]''&lt;ref name="RS/SpillsBeans" /&gt; (titled ''Wonderful Tonight'' in the United States). Her photographs of Harrison and Clapton, titled ''Through the Eye of a Muse'', have been exhibited in [[Dublin]], [[Sydney]], [[Toronto]], [[Moscow]], [[London]], [[Almaty]], [[Uppsala]] and throughout the United States.

==Early life==
Boyd was born on 17 March 1944,{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=4}} in [[Taunton]], [[Somerset]],&lt;ref name=bbcsomerset&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2007/08/28/patti_boyd_feature.shtml|publisher=BBC Somerset|title=Profiles: Pattie Boyd's extraordinary life|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first child to Colin Ian Langdon Boyd{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=7}} and Diana Frances Boyd (née Drysdale). The Boyds moved to [[West Lothian]] in Scotland, where her brother, Colin, was born in 1946.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=3}} They then moved to [[Guildford]], Surrey, where her sister, [[Jenny Boyd]], was born in 1947.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=6}} Boyd's youngest sister, Paula, was born at a hospital in [[Nakuru]], Kenya, in 1951.{{sfn|Boyd|2007}} The Boyds lived in [[Nairobi]] from 1948 to 1953, after her father's discharge from the [[Royal Air Force]].{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=7}} The family returned to England, where Boyd gained two half-brothers, David (b. 1954) and Robert Jr. (b. 1955),&lt;ref name="BoydBookAmazon"/&gt; as well as two half-sisters, Clare (1962–2018) and Julia (b. 1964).

Boyd attended Hazeldean School in [[Putney]], the St Agnes and St Michael Convent Boarding School in [[East Grinstead]], and St Martha's Convent in [[Hadley Wood]], Hertfordshire. She achieved three [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] [[GCE Ordinary Level|O level]] passes in 1961.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=36}} She moved to London in 1962 and worked as a shampoo girl at [[Elizabeth Arden]]'s salon. A client who worked for ''[[Honey (magazine)|Honey]]'' magazine then inspired her to begin work as a model.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=35, 40–41}}

==Career==
===Modelling===
Boyd began her fashion career in 1962,{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=32–33}} modelling at first in London and [[Paris]].{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=50}} Among her regular assignments at that time were jobs for the [[Vogue (British magazine)|UK edition]] of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' in France, and ''Honey'', as well as fashion spreads in newspapers such as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=50}} She was photographed by [[David Bailey (photographer)|David Bailey]], [[Terence Donovan (photographer)|Terence Donovan]] and [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]], among others,{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=49}} and appeared on the cover of British ''Vogue''.&lt;ref name="RockMuseRemembers"&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Mason|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/08/23/sunday/main3198902.shtml|title=A Rock Muse Remembers|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=26 August 2007|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular models of the day, such as [[Twiggy]], based their modelling appearance on Boyd.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=499, 909}}{{refn|group=nb|[[Kim Kerrigan]], who had a natural resemblance to Boyd, changed her first name from Patsy in 1964, to avoid the perception that she and the agency representing her might be attempting to "cash in" on Boyd's popularity.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=112–13}}}} In the description of journalist [[Tom Hibbert]], Boyd and [[Jean Shrimpton]] became "international celebrities" as the embodiment of the "British female 'look' – mini-skirt, long, straight hair and wide-eyed loveliness". This look defined Western fashion for women as a result of the international popularity of [[the Beatles]] and other [[British Invasion]] musical acts from 1964 onwards.&lt;ref name="Hibbert/HistoryOfRock"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Tom|last=Hibbert|title=Britain invades the world: Mid-Sixties British Music|magazine=[[The History of Rock (magazine)|The History of Rock]]|year=1982}} Available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/britain-invades-the-world-mid-sixties-british-music Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; In her autobiography, Boyd recalls being known as the muse to designer [[Ossie Clark]], who used to call some of his designs "Pattie".{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=53}}{{refn|group=nb|Boyd's first name was often abbreviated to "Patti" also.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=32–33}}}}

In early 1964, Boyd appeared in a television advertising campaign for [[The Smith's Snackfood Company|Smith's crisps]], directed by [[Richard Lester]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=33}} Lester then cast her as a schoolgirl in the Beatles' 1964 film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'',{{sfn|Barrow|2006|p=243}}&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimesreview"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/21522/A-Hard-Day-s-Night/overview|title=A Hard Day's Night (1964)|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 February 2007|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she met and befriended the group's lead guitarist, [[George Harrison]].{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=29}}{{refn|group=nb|Her only line in the film was "Prisoners?",{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=33}} but she later appeared in the "[[I Should Have Known Better]]" segment.{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=86}}}} Boyd's modelling career skyrocketed as a result of her subsequent romantic involvement with Harrison.&lt;ref name="Hibbert/HistoryOfRock" /&gt;{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=201}} She recalls that further assignments for ''Vogue'' and ''Vanity Fair'' were the result, along with jobs for ''[[Tatler]]'' (with photographer [[Jeanloup Sieff]]), more TV commercials, for Smith's and for [[L'Oréal]]'s Dop shampoo brand, and advertisements in newspaper fashion pages.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=70–71}} 

Boyd and Harrison were among the leading couples in the [[Swinging London]] era, when, according to a 1966 article in the ''[[Daily Express]]'', "actors, pop singers, hairdressers, and models" were London's new "privileged class".{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=330–31}} [[UK underground]] writer [[Barry Miles]] later described her as "by far the most glamorous" of all the Beatles' wives and girlfriends,{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=136}} while author [[Shawn Levy (writer)|Shawn Levy]] writes that, even more so than [[Jane Asher]], the London-born stage actress who was [[Paul McCartney]]'s girlfriend for much of the 1960s, Boyd epitomised what "sixties stardom was meant to confer upon its chosen".{{sfn|Levy|2003|p=177}}{{refn|group=nb|Levy adds: "''That'' was why a provincial boy learned how to play bar chords and sing harmony and hitchhiked down the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great Northern Road]] to the capital!"{{sfn|Levy|2003|p=177}}}} Writing in 1966, British fashion designer [[Mary Quant]] commented that it had become a requisite for contemporary women to strive "to look like Pattie Boyd rather than [[Marlene Dietrich]]", adding: "Their aim is to look childishly young, naïvely unsophisticated, and it takes more sophistication to work out that look than those early would-be sophisticates ever dreamed of."{{sfn|Clayson|2003|pp=167, 476}}

At the request of [[Gloria Stavers]],{{sfn|Barrow|2006|p=243}} Boyd began writing a column, titled "Patti's Letter from London", for the American teen magazine ''[[16 Magazine|16]]''.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=34}} According to Hibbert: "She reported on the latest trends in [[Carnaby Street]], informed readers as to what the Beatles and [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]] were wearing at the moment, and gave advice on how to turn dark and curly hair straight and blonde."&lt;ref name="Hibbert/HistoryOfRock" /&gt; However, with Boyd the target of hostility from the Beatles' female fans, Harrison insisted she abandon her career, to ensure their privacy.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=34, 35}} In July 1968, she and her sister Jenny, who was also a model, opened a boutique in London's fashionable [[Chelsea Market]]. They named it "Jennifer Juniper" after [[Donovan]]'s [[Jennifer Juniper|song of the same name]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=63}} Jenny managed the shop, which sold antiques and other ''objets d'art'', while Boyd was the buyer.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=137–38}}

Boyd says she had "virtually given up" modelling by the early 1970s.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=135}} She resumed her career at that time,{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=87}} promoting designs by Ossie Clark.{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=198}} She and Twiggy then did a cover assignment in [[Milan]] for [[Vogue Italia|Italian ''Vogue'']] with photographer [[Justin de Villeneuve]], and, working again with Bailey, Boyd appeared on several covers for British ''Vogue''. In another shoot for the latter magazine, Boyd and her sisters were photographed by [[Patrick Lichfield]].{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=135–36}}

===Photography===
Boyd began taking photographs of musicians and other friends during the 1960s and was a member of the [[Royal Photographic Society]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} In a 2008 interview, she said that it was not until 2004 that she felt "emotionally ready" to revisit the images. She also said that her lack of professional status probably made for a more intimate and authentic mood in her work, since her subjects were relaxed in her company.&lt;ref name="Balfe/Ent.ie"&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Balfe|title=Interview with Pattie Boyd |url=http://entertainment.ie/music/feature/Interview-with-Pattie-Boyd/201/42.htm|publisher=[[entertainment.ie]]|date=28 August 2018|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd first exhibited her photos of Harrison and Clapton at the [[San Francisco Art Exchange]] on [[Valentine's Day]] 2005, in a show titled ''Through the Eye of a Muse''.&lt;ref name="CNN2005"/&gt; The exhibition appeared in San Francisco and London during 2006, and in [[La Jolla, California]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pattie Boyd Opening at La Jolla Gallery April 2008|url=https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/set/default.aspx?setID=555|publisher=Morrison Hotel Gallery|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Through the Eye of a Muse'' was also shown in Dublin&lt;ref name="Balfe/Ent.ie" /&gt; and in Toronto in 2008, and at the Blender Gallery in Sydney&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/fab-faces-of-swinging-60s/2009/12/01/1259429373581.html|title=Fab faces of swinging '60s|first=Adam|last=Fulton|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2 December 2009|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/beatles-clapton-pics-in-free-show/440756.html|title=Beatles, Clapton Pics in Free Show|first=Olga|last=Kuzmina|newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bajanreporter.com/2009/12/the-old-pharmacy-gallery-in-speightstown-soon-to-host-movie-classics-lanster-2010-season/|title=The Old Pharmacy Gallery in Speightstown – Soon To Host Movie Classics &amp; Lancaster 2010 Season|work=Bajan Reporter|date=16 December 2009|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity work===
Boyd became involved in charity work following her separation from Clapton in the late 1980s. In 1991, she co-founded SHARP (Self Help Addiction Recovery Program) with [[Barbara Bach]], the second wife of former Beatle [[Ringo Starr]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=40}}

==Personal life==

===Marriage to George Harrison===
[[File:Kinfauns George Harrison house.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Kinfauns, the home of Pattie Boyd and George Harrison from 1965 to 1970]]

Boyd was in a relationship with photographer Eric Swayne{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=56, 60}} when she met Harrison, on 2 March 1964,{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=135–36}} and therefore declined his initial date proposal.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=499}} Several days later, having ended the relationship with Swayne, she accompanied Harrison to a private [[gentlemen's club]] called the [[Garrick Club]], chaperoned by the Beatles' manager, [[Brian Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Varjgas|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/SummerConcert/story?id=3546199&amp;page=1|title=The Real 'Layla' Talks About George Harrison and Eric Clapton|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=31 August 2007|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Beatles frequently away on concert tours, she and Harrison subsequently saw each other as often as their professional commitments allowed.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=68, 70}} In July 1964,{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=242}} Harrison bought [[Kinfauns (George Harrison)|Kinfauns]], a house in [[Esher]], Surrey, to escape the constant attention of fans in central London,{{sfn|Barrow|2006|p=243}} and Boyd soon moved into the house also.{{sfn|Levy|2003|p=228}}

Boyd had her first encounter with [[LSD]] in early 1965{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=565}} when the couple's dentist, John Riley,{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=44}} secretly laced his guests' coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home.&lt;ref name="CNN2005"/&gt; As she was getting ready to leave with Harrison and [[John Lennon|John]] and [[Cynthia Lennon]], Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=45}} Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=565–566}} Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=45}}

The couple were engaged on 25 December 1965, and married on 21 January 1966{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=219}} in a ceremony at [[Epsom]] [[register office]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=57}} In his "How a Beatle Lives" profile in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' in March 1966, Harrison stressed the equality of their relationship and credited Boyd with broadening his outlook.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=311}} In September and October, after the Beatles' [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|final concert tour]], Boyd and Harrison spent six weeks in India,{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=367}} as guests of Indian classical musician [[Ravi Shankar]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=644–45}}{{sfn|Tillery|2011|pp=56–57}} While in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], as Harrison continued his [[sitar]] studies under Shankar's tutelage,{{sfn|Barrow|2006|p=216}} Boyd began learning to play the [[dilruba]], a bow-played string instrument.{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=201}} Due to the attention of fans and the press, they left the city with Shankar and stayed on houseboats on [[Dal Lake]] in [[Kashmir]].{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=88}}{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=127}} Upon their return to England, Boyd and Harrison continued to adhere to a lifestyle of [[yoga]] and [[vegetarianism]],{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=208}}{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=58}} and Boyd received further tuition on the dilruba from [[Shiv Dayal Batish]].{{sfn|Kruth|2015|pp=75–76}}{{refn|group=nb|Batish described her as a "smart student" who quickly mastered the basics of the instrument.{{sfn|Kruth|2015|p=76}}}}

On 25 June 1967, Boyd was among the crowd of friends who participated in the Beatles' ''[[Our World (International TV special)|Our World]]'' broadcast of "[[All You Need Is Love]]".{{refn|group=nb|She was also one of the chorus singers on "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]" in 1966 and sang the female vocal parts, with [[Yoko Ono]], on the 1968 song "[[Birthday (Beatles song)|Birthday]]".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=183, 277}}}} Boyd shared her husband's interest in Eastern [[mysticism]].{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=223}}{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=197}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marianne|last=Faithfull|chapter=We Love You|year=2002|title=[[Mojo (magazine)#Special editions|Mojo Special Limited Edition]]: 1000 Days That Shook the World (The Psychedelic Beatles – April 1, 1965 to December 26, 1967)|location=London|publisher=Emap|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having become a member of the [[Spiritual Regeneration Movement]] in February 1967, she was keen to meet the movement's leader, [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], and so suggested that she and Harrison attend his lecture on [[Transcendental Meditation]] at the London Hilton on 24 August.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=95–96}}{{sfn|Clayson|2003|pp=223–24}} Impressed with the Maharishi, Harrison and Boyd, together with the other Beatles and their partners, travelled to a seminar he hosted [[The Beatles in Bangor|in Bangor, Wales]], the following day.&lt;ref name="CNN2005"&gt;{{cite news|first=Todd|last=Lepold|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/03/pattie.boyd/|title=Harrison, Clapton and their muse|publisher=CNN|date=3 February 2005|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=710–711}} Boyd and her sister Jenny then accompanied Harrison on [[The Beatles at Rishikesh|the Beatles' visit]] to the Maharishi's [[ashram]] in [[Rishikesh]], India, in February 1968.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=219}} That same year, she told Beatles biographer [[Hunter Davies]] that the four Beatles had a bond that neither she nor any other wife could penetrate;{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=498}} she also said she wished that the band would use their fame and influence to publicly further a cause, as [[Marlon Brando]] had done on behalf of homeless children.{{sfn|Davies|2009|pp=324–25}} Boyd provided inspiration for several of Harrison's Beatles compositions, including "[[I Need You (Beatles song)|I Need You]]",{{sfn|Turner|1999|pp=78, 82}} "[[If I Needed Someone]]",{{sfn|Kruth|2015|p=103}} "[[Love You To]]", "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]"{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=271}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ashley|last=Khan|chapter=Gun for Hire|year=2003|title=[[Mojo (magazine)#Special editions|Mojo Special Limited Edition]]: 1000 Days of Revolution (The Beatles' Final Years – Jan 1, 1968 to Sept 27, 1970)|location=London|publisher=Emap|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[For You Blue]]".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=129, 172, 295}}{{refn|group=nb|Harrison later cited alternative sources of inspiration for "Something". In early 1969, by which point he had befriended members of the [[Hare Krishna movement]], he said that the song was about the Hindu deity [[Krishna]].{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=141–42}}}} In March 1969, as part of the British authorities' intolerant attitude towards the Beatles in the late 1960s, Boyd and Harrison were arrested at Kinfauns for possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=73}}

In March 1970, a month before [[the Beatles' break-up]], Boyd moved with Harrison to [[Friar Park]], a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[neo-Gothic]] mansion in [[Henley-on-Thames]].{{sfn|Browne|2011|pp=83–84}} By this point, Harrison's devotion to Indian spirituality, particularly the [[Hare Krishna movement]], had begun to divide the couple.{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=197}}{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=91}} They were also unsuccessful in starting a family, and Harrison would not consider [[adoption]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=36}}{{refn|group=nb|Harrison told friends that he was infertile, a gesture that they realised was out of consideration for Boyd, given that he was able to father a child with his second wife, [[Olivia Arias]].{{sfn|Tillery|2011|pp=91–93}}}} Boyd resumed her modelling career in May 1971, in defiance of Harrison's spiritual convictions.{{sfn|Huntley|2006|pp=87–88}}{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=197–98}} In 1973, she had an affair with [[The Faces|Faces]] guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]].{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=99}} Boyd said her decision to leave Harrison in 1974{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=209}} was based largely upon his repeated infidelities, culminating in his affair with Starr's wife [[Maureen Starkey Tigrett|Maureen]], which Boyd called "the final straw".{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=179–180}}{{refn|group=nb|Boyd characterised the last year of her marriage as "fuelled by [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]]", and claimed "George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him&amp;nbsp;... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart."{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=175–76}}}}

Author Ian Inglis, discussing Harrison's 1973 song "[[So Sad]]", describes Boyd as the musician's "closest companion" and someone who shared in his "triumphs and tragedies". Among these key events, Inglis lists the international [[Beatlemania]] phenomenon, the Beatles' decision to retire from live performance, the 1967 [[Summer of Love]], Epstein's death, the creation of [[Apple Corps]], the Beatles' exploration of Indian spirituality, the band's break-up, Harrison's ascendancy as a songwriter and then as a solo artist, and his [[Concert for Bangladesh|Bangladesh aid project]].{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=45}} The couple's divorce was finalised on 9 June 1977.{{sfn|Badman|2001|p=210}} Boyd's solicitor, Paddy Grafton-Green of the London firm [[Theodore Goddard]], later remarked on the sensitivity shown by each party towards the other, which he found particularly rare in his experience of high-stakes divorces. He said: "There was no overreacting, no greed or playing with each other's emotions – I wish all divorces were so well handled."{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=208–09}}

===Marriage to Eric Clapton===
[[File:Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|Clapton on stage, 19 June 1977]]
In the late 1960s, Clapton and Harrison became close friends and began writing and recording music together. This is when Clapton fell in love with Boyd.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=261}} In an effort to satisfy his infatuation, Clapton briefly dated Boyd's sister Paula.{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=241}} His 1970 album with [[Derek and the Dominos]], ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'', was written to proclaim his love for Boyd, particularly the hit song "[[Layla]]".&lt;ref name="CNN2005"/&gt; Clapton drew inspiration from ''The Story of Layla and Majnun'' by Persian writer [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], casting himself as the poet driven to madness by his unattainable love.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=123}} When Boyd rebuffed his advances in late 1970, Clapton descended into [[heroin addiction]] and self-imposed exile for three years.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=93}} Once cured of his addiction in 1974, Clapton again pursued Boyd, who now agreed to leave Harrison. She and Clapton were married in 1979.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=261}} They remained friendly with Harrison, who took to calling Clapton his "husband-in-law".{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=208}}

Boyd soon struggled within the marriage and took to drinking heavily, but these difficulties were masked by her public image with Clapton.{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=304–07}} He later admitted to being a "full-blown" [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] who was often violent towards his wife.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=124–25}} Boyd left Clapton in April 1987 and divorced him in 1989. Her stated reasons were Clapton's years of alcoholism, as well as his numerous affairs,&lt;ref name="Meacham/SMH" /&gt; including one with Italian actress [[Lory Del Santo]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph1999"&gt;{{cite web|first=Judith|last=Woods|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/03/17/tlboyd17.html|title=It's amazing we're still alive|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 March 1999|accessdate=5 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508004035/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1999%2F03%2F17%2Ftlboyd17.html|archivedate=8 May 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, her divorce was granted on the grounds of "infidelity and unreasonable behaviour".{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=263}} She subsequently suspected that Clapton's pursuit of her when she was married to Harrison "had more to do" with the competitive aspect of the two musicians' friendship, and that "Eric just wanted what George had."{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=ix}}

In 2007, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to Boyd as a "legendary rock muse" for her role in inspiring the music of Harrison and then Clapton.&lt;ref name="RS/SpillsBeans"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Rolling Stone staff|url=https://www.rollingstone.com:80/music/news/former-george-harrison-and-eric-clapton-muse-pattie-boyd-spills-the-beans-20070806|title=Former George Harrison, Eric Clapton Muse Pattie Boyd Spills the Beans|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=6 August 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917202738/http://www.rollingstone.com:80/music/news/former-george-harrison-and-eric-clapton-muse-pattie-boyd-spills-the-beans-20070806 |archivedate=17 September 2017|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Cormier of ''[[mental floss]]'' similarly recognises her as "one of the most important muses in rock and roll history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Roger|last=Cormier|title=Layla in Real Life: 10 Songs Written About Pattie Boyd|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/78851/layla-real-life-10-songs-written-about-pattie-boyd |publisher=[[Mental Floss|mentalfloss.com]]|date=28 April 2016|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to "Layla", she was the inspiration for Clapton's songs "[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]" and "[[Wonderful Tonight]]".{{sfn|Boyd|2007|pp=153, 201–02}}

===Marriage to Rod Weston===
Boyd met property developer Rod Weston in 1991.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=40}} The couple were married on 29 April 2015 in a ceremony held at the Register Office in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea Old Town Hall]], London. Weston was quoted as saying, "It's almost our silver anniversary so we thought we had better get on with it."&lt;ref name="Furness"/&gt;

==Autobiography==
In August 2007, [[Headline Publishing Group|Headline Review]] published Boyd's autobiography, titled ''[[Wonderful Today]]''&lt;ref name="RS/SpillsBeans" /&gt; and co-written with journalist and broadcaster [[Penny Junor]].&lt;ref name="Meacham/SMH"&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Meacham|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/07/03/1183351210250.html|title=Beatle's muse comes clean|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=4 July 2007|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-titled ''Wonderful Tonight: George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Me'' for the US market, the book contains many of Boyd's photographs.&lt;ref name="BoydBookAmazon"&gt;{{cite book|first=Boyd, Pattie|last=Junor, Penny|title=Wonderful Today: The Autobiography of Pattie Boyd|publisher=Headline Review|isbn=0755316428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meacham/SMH" /&gt; At the time, she was said to be looking forward to the idea of her book competing against Clapton's autobiography, which was published concurrently.&lt;ref name="Meacham/SMH" /&gt; Boyd carried out interviews to promote the release.&lt;ref name="RS/SpillsBeans" /&gt;

Reviewing ''Wonderful Today'' for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', [[Lynn Barber]] described it as "absolutely gripping" and a memoir that "gives more insight into the weirdness of rock-star life than anything I have ever read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3667995/Pattie-Boyds-side-of-the-story.html|first=Lynn|last=Barber|title=Pattie Boyd's side of the story|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 September 2007|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the book debuted at the top of the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/books/bestseller/0923besthardnonfiction.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=New York Times Best Seller list for 9/23/07|accessdate=5 July 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phyllis Chesler''' (born October 1, 1940) is an [[United States|American]] writer, [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]], and [[emeritus|professor emerita]] of [[psychology]] and [[women's studies]] at the [[College of Staten Island]] ([[CUNY]]). She is known as a [[Feminism|feminist]] psychologist, and is the author of 16 books, including the best-seller ''Women and Madness'' (1972). Chesler has written on topics such as gender, [[mental illness]], divorce and [[child custody]], [[surrogacy]], [[second-wave feminism]], [[pornography]], [[prostitution]], [[incest]], and [[violence against women]].

In more recent years, Chesler has written several works on such subjects as [[antisemitism]], Islam, and [[honour killings|honor killings]]. Chesler argues that many western intellectuals, including leftists and feminists, have abandoned Western values in the name of [[multicultural relativism]], and that this has led to an alliance with Islamists, an increase in antisemitism, and to the abandonment of Muslim women and religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries.

== Personal life ==
Chesler was the eldest of three children raised in a working class [[Orthodox Jewish]] family in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;McGinity, Keren R. "Phyllis Chesler". ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'', 2004.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth she joined the Socialist-Zionist, anti-religious youth movement, [[HaShomer Hatzair]], and later the even more radical left-wing [[Zionist]] youth movement, Ein Harod. Despite her parents' disapproval, she continued to rebel against her religious upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Fern Sidman,[http://righttruth.typepad.com/right_truth/2007/07/interview-with-.html Interview with Dr. Phyllis Chesler], righttruth.typepad.com, July 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended [[New Utrecht High School]] where she was the editor of the yearbook and of the literary magazine. She won a full scholarship to [[Bard College]], where she met Ali, a Westernized Muslim man from [[Afghanistan]], the son of devout Muslim parents. They married in a civil ceremony in 1961 in New York State and settled in [[Kabul]], in the large, polygamous household of her father-in-law. She credits this experience with inspiring her to become an ardent feminist.&lt;ref&gt;"The ardent feminism that she embraced on her return to America was forged in Afghanistan, she told me last week." Baxter, Sarah. "Feminism's Blind Spot", ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', August 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MEQ2006&gt;Chesler, Phyllis. [http://www.meforum.org/article/794 "How Afghan Captivity Shaped My Feminism"], ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'', Winter 2006, pp. 3–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chesler, her problems began on arrival in Afghanistan. The authorities forced her to surrender her [[United States passport|U.S. passport]], and she ended up a virtual prisoner in her in-laws' house. Chesler describes this as how foreign wives were treated.&lt;ref&gt;Chesler, Phyllis. "My Afghan Captivity".&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been documented by others.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hunter,''The Past Present: A Year in Afghanistan'', London, Hodder And Stoughton Limited, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mahmoody, Betty]], with Arnold D. Dunchock, ''For The Love of a Child'', New York, St Martins Paperbacks, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Death of Feminism; What's Next in the Struggle for Women's Freedom''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005. 1–235. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She reports that the U.S. embassy refused to help her leave the country. After several months, she contracted [[hepatitis]] and became gravely ill. At that point, her father-in-law made it possible for her return to the U.S. on a temporary visa.&lt;ref name=MEQ2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chesler, Phyllis. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article1480090.ece "How my eyes were opened to the barbarity of Islam"], ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon her return, she completed her final semester and graduated from [[Bard College|Bard]], embarked on a doctoral program, worked in a brain research laboratory for E. Roy John, published studies in ''Science''&lt;ref&gt;"Maternal Influence in Learning by Observation in Kittens". Science, November 1969 v. 166; 901–903.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Observation Learning in Cats". E.R. John, P. Chesler, I. Victor, P. Bartlett, Science, v. 159, 1489–90, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; magazine and received a fellowship in [[neurophysiology]] at the [[New York Medical College]] at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital. Thereafter, in 1969, she earned a Ph.D. in psychology at the [[New School for Social Research]] and embarked on careers as a professor, author, and psychotherapist in private practice.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler Organization Web site, CV page&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesler divorced her first husband and remarried an Israeli, whom she also later divorced. She has one son. She describes their relationship, pregnancy, childbirth, and her first year as a newborn mother in ''With Child: A Diary of Motherhood''. In the 1998 edition, her son wrote the preface to the book.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, ''With Child: A Diary of Motherhood''. New York: Four Walls Eight Windows, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Psychologist ===
In 1969, she cofounded the [[Association for Women in Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist Foremothers in Women's Studies, Psychology, and Mental Health'', Phyllis Chesler, Esther D. Rothblum, Ellen Cole, Haworth Press, 1995, p. 1. {{ISBN|1-56023-078-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, she published ''Women and Madness'', whose thesis is "that double standards of mental health and illness exist and that women are often punitively labeled as a function of gender, race, class, or sexual preference". The book sold more than 3 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler Organization Web site&lt;/ref&gt; The book received a front page ''New York Times'' review by [[Adrienne Rich]], who described it as "intense, rapid, brilliant, controversial ... a pioneer contribution to the feminization of psychiatric thinking and practice".&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Rich, rev. of ''Women and Madness'', The New York Times, December 31, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesler has been consulted by lawyers, psychologists and psychiatrists on diverse subjects including sex between patient and therapist, rape, incest, domestic violence, custody, honor killings, and the mistreatment of women in jails and in psychiatric institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, ''Patriarchy: Notes of an Expert Witness''. Monroe, ME: Common Courage Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, she taught a course in Forensic Psychology at [[John Jay College]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/cv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, she was the sole expert witness in a class action lawsuit in Nebraska on behalf of female psychiatric patients who had been sexually, physically, medically, and psychologically abused.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "No Safe Place", ''On The Issues'', Winter 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, she taught a course in Advanced Psychology and Women's Studies at [[Brandeis University]].&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; From 2008–2012, Chesler submitted courtroom affidavits in cases where girls and women have fled being honor killed and applied for asylum in America.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "On the 100th Anniversary of International Women's Day – What Are Feminists Doing About Honor Killings?", http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/03/08/100th-anniversary-international-womens-day-feminists-doing-honor-killings/#ixzz2C1fbuw9B, Fox News, March 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminism ===
Chesler is considered a [[radical feminism|radical feminist]] and a [[second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbaOAwAAQBAJ|title=Feminist Foremothers in Women's Studies, Psychology, and Mental Health|last=Cole|first=Ellen|last2=Rothblum|first2=Esther D.|last3=Chesler|first3=Phyllis|date=2014-05-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317764328|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara J. Love, ''Feminists Who Changed America 1963–1975'', Chicago, University of Illinois, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Chesler believes that men can and should be feminists, and she wrote in her book ''Letters to a Young Feminist'' that she envisions her heirs as both women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, ''Letters to a Young Feminist''. New York: Four Walls Eight Windows, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Chesler has studied male psychology and published a book on the subject (''About Men'') which discussed the father-son, mother-son, and brother-brother relationships; the book also tried to understand male conformity, how and why men obeyed the orders of male tyrants, and what kind of men resisted doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, ''About Men''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesler taught one of the first [[Women's Studies]] classes in the U.S. at [[College of Staten Island|Richmond College]] (which later merged with Staten Island Community College to form the [[College of Staten Island]]) in [[New York City]] during the 1969–1970 school year. She turned the women's studies course into a minor and then a major at the university. With Vivian Gornick, she created an early feminist salon. In 1975, she co-led one of the first feminist Passover seders and continued to do so for 18 years.&lt;ref name=Love&gt;Ed. Barbara J. Love, ''Feminists Who Changed America, 1963–1975'', University of Illinois Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at Richmond College, she established many services for female students, including [[self-defense]] classes, a [[rape crisis center]], and a [[child care]] center. She was also a leader in the class action lawsuit against CUNY on behalf of women which took 17 years to be resolved. In 1975, she became one of five cofounders of [[The National Women's Health Network]], with [[Barbara Seaman]], [[Alice Wolfson]], [[Belita Cowan]], and [[Mary Howell]], and is a charter member of the ''Women's Forum'' and a founding member of the International Committee for Women of the Wall.

In 1969, Chesler, together with others, co-founded the [[Association for Women in Psychology]]. With Dr. [[Dorothy Riddle]], Chesler presented a series of demands at the 1969 annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, demands which an Association for Women in Psychology group had worked on together. Chesler prepared a statement on the APA's obligations to women and demanded one million dollars in reparation for the damage psychology had perpetrated against allegedly mentally ill and traumatized women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/presence-timeline/|title=Timeline|publisher=|access-date=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Reinhold, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/06/archives/women-criticize-psychology-unit-1million-in-reparations-is-demanded.html?sq=phyllis+chesler+AND+reinhold&amp;scp=2&amp;st=p Women Criticize Psychology Unit; $1-Million in Reparations Is Demanded at Convention]", ''The New York Times'', September 6, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her early work, although Chesler argued for integration, she also stated in 1972 that "feminists" and feminist values must gradually and ultimately ''dominate'' public social institutions—in order to insure that they are not used against women",&lt;ref&gt;Chesler, Phyllis, ''Women and Madness'' (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1972 ({{ISBN|0-385-02671-4}})), p. 299 (emphasis so in original), and Chesler, Phyllis, ''Women and Madness'' (N.Y.: Palgrave Macmillan, rev'd &amp; updated ed., 1st ed., 2005 ({{ISBN|1-4039-6897-7}})), p. 347 (similar text).&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that there has always been "a war between the sexes".&lt;ref&gt;Chesler, Phyllis, ''Women and Madness'' (1972), ''op. cit.'', p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chesler, Phyllis, ''Women and Madness'' (2005), ''op. cit.'', p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Chesler became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}} The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chesler worked for the United Nations (1979–1980) and coordinated an international feminist conference that took place in Oslo, just prior to the 1980 UN conference on women.&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist Foremothers in Women's Studies, Psychology, and Mental Health'', ed. Phyllis Chesler, Esther D. Rothblum, Ellen Cole. Hayworth: New York, 1995. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Chesler co-organized a speakout about mothers losing custody of children at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Nearly 500 custodially embattled mothers and speakers attended, including [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], [[E.M. Broner]], [[Paula Caplan]], [[Toi Derricotte]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], and [[Kate Millett]]. New York State and national legislators and feminist leaders participated.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Johnson, "The Odds on Custody Change", ''The New York Times'', March 17, 1986; Sharon Johnson, "Casualties of Custody Battles", March 24, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1986, Chesler co-organized a congressional press briefing in Washington, D.C. on mothers and child custody. It was sponsored by then-Representatives [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY) and [[Barbara Boxer]] (D-CA). Some of the mothers she interviewed for her 1986 book ''Mothers on Trial'' spoke at the briefing.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler. ''Mothers on Trial''. Chicago: Lawrence Hill Books, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Chesler worked with [[Mary Beth Whitehead]]'s lawyer Harold Cassidy in the landmark [[Baby M]] case, in which the New Jersey Supreme Court declared that surrogacy contracts violated New Jersey law. Chesler organized demonstrations outside the courthouse, wrote articles, created an alliance of diverse groups, and ultimately documented this struggle and the issues raised by a surrogacy contract custody battle in ''Sacred Bond: The Legacy of Baby M''.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, ''Sacred Bond''. New York: First Vintage Books, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Chesler began publishing in ''On the Issues'' magazine and also functioned as its Editor-at-Large. She did so for fifteen years until the magazine became an online edition.

In 1990–1991, Chesler organized expert witnesses in the case of [[Aileen Wuornos]], a female serial killer. Chesler's stated goal was to educate the jury and the country about the lives of women in prostitution and the dangerous conditions they routinely face. The public defender did not call any of these witnesses, which became one of the grounds of the appeal that Wuornos' lawyers launched in the Florida Supreme Court. Chesler wrote about the legal and psychiatric issues raised by the case in the ''New York Times'' and ''St. John's Law Review''&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "A Woman's Right to Self-Defense: The Case of Aileen Wuornos", ''St. John's Law Review'' 66, (Fall-Winter 1993): 933–977.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Criminal Practice Law Report''.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "Sexual Violence Against Women and a Woman's Right to Self-Defense: The Case of Aileen Carol Wuornos", ''Criminal Practice Law Report'', October 1993, Vol 1, No. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views of women and Judaism ===
In 1976, the first women-only Passover seder was held in [[E. M. Broner|Esther M. Broner's]] New York City apartment and led by Broner, with 13 women attending, including Chesler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/thisweek/mar/01/1993/em-broner This Week in History – E.M. Broner publishes "The Telling" | Jewish Women's Archive]. Jwa.org (1 March 1993). Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Chesler also created and participated in Jewish feminist life cycle rituals.&lt;ref&gt;E.M. Broner. ''The Telling: Including the Women's Haggadah''.

Sharon Cohen Anisfeld, Tara Mohr, and Catherine Spector. Woodstock, VT: Jewish Lights Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Chesler was among the women who prayed with a Torah for the first time in an all-female, multi-denominational, non-[[minyan]] group at the [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]]. In 1989, Chesler co-founded the International Committee for [[Women of the Wall]] to promote the religious rights of Jewish women in Jerusalem; she became one of the name plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the state of Israel on this issue. In 2002, she and co-author Rivka Haut both edited and contributed to an anthology on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler and Rivka Haut, ''Claiming Sacred Ground at Judaism's Holy Site''. Woodstock, Vermont: Jewish Lights Publishing, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Chesler began to study [[Torah]]. She published her first [[dvar Torah]] (Bible interpretation) in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "Rape of Dina: On the Torah Portion of Vayishlach". ''Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women's Studies and Gender Issues'', Fall 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; She has since published and/or delivered additional Torah commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/topics/14/devrai-torah|title=Devrai Torah :: Items by Topic :: The Phyllis Chesler Organization|work=The Phyllis Chesler Organization|access-date=October 21, 2014|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913164716/http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/topics/14/devrai-torah|archive-date=September 13, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenofthewall.org.il/archives/category/divrei-torah|title=Divrei Torah|work=Women of the Wall – נשות הכותל|access-date=October 21, 2014|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314222208/http://womenofthewall.org.il/archives/category/divrei-torah|archive-date=March 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activist against racism and antisemitism ===
In the 1960s, Chesler was active in the [[Northern Student Movement]].&lt;ref name=Love /&gt; Chesler has written about the participation of African-American women in the American civil rights movement in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "Sister, Fear Has No Place Here", ''On the Issues'', Fall 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and was interviewed on camera in a documentary about Viola Liuzzo, a white female civil rights activist who was murdered by [[Ku Klux Klan]] members.&lt;ref&gt;"Home of the Brave", dir. Paola di Florio, Counterpoint Films, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Chesler co-organized the first press conference about feminism and antisemitism, and in 1974–1975 she co-organized the first Jewish feminist speakout in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Aviva Cantor Zuckoff, "An Exclusive Interview with Dr. Phyllis Chesler, ''Lilith'' 1, no. 2 (Winter 1976–1977): 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Chesler organized the first-ever panel on racism, anti-semitism, and feminism for the National Women's Studies Association in Storrs, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, ''The New Antisemitism: The Current Crisis and What we Must Do About It''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Book summaries ==

=== ''Women and Madness'' (1972) ===
Women and Madness is now considered a classic work. The poet and essayist [[Adrienne Rich]]'s front-page review in ''The New York Times'' (cited above) was a first of its kind for a feminist work. When it first appeared, at least one critic viewed the work as "radical" and "overstated".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://time.com/vault/issue/1973-01-22/page/52/ Women on the Couch]," review of ''Women and Madness''. ''Time Magazine'', January 22, 1973. Accessed 2016-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews were more positive. ''The Saturday Review'' opined that "this is an extremely important book, a signal that the [[women's liberation movement]] is coming of age ... she writes with high passion and compassion".&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore B. Maddi, "[https://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1972dec23-00061?View=PDF On Women-II: The Couch as Rack]," review of ''Women and Madness'', The Saturday Review, December 23, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' described it as a "stunning book ... fascinating and important to every woman";&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn See, "Is a 'Crazy' Woman Normal", rev. of ''Women and Madness'', Los Angeles Times, February 11, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Boston Phoenix'' viewed the book as "an extensively researched and deeply intuitive exploration of woman's psychic experience ... invaluable".&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Glauber, rev. of ''Women and Madness'', The Boston Phoenix, December 12, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; When the book was translated into European languages, many reviews appeared. In his review for ''Le Monde'', Roland Jaccard wrote that "like any important book, ''Women and Madness'' has the immense merit of 'troubling the world's sleep.'"&lt;ref&gt;Jaccard, Roland. "[http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1975/06/13/les-femmes-et-la-folie_2578985_1819218.html?xtmc=phyllis_chesler&amp;xtcr=1 Les femmes et la folie]" ''Le Monde''. June 13, 1975. Accessed 2016-06-16. The quote in French reads: "Réquisitoire violent et tendre, juste et injuste à la fois, ''Les femmes et la folie'', comme tout livre important, a l'immense mérite de 'troubler le sommeil du monde'."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Women, Money and Power'' (co-authored with Emily Jane Goodman) (1976) ===
The book is an in-depth study of gender-based economic disparities in America in the 1970s. Congresswoman [[Bella Abzug]] hailed the book as "powerful ... a realistic analysis of women's economic and political condition".&lt;ref name=PCO&gt;[http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/ Phyllis Chesler official website].{{Verify source|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florynce Kennedy]] wrote that the book "is the antidote for the poison of women's powerlessness".&lt;ref name=PCO /&gt; ''The New York Times'' gave it a mixed review but described it as "useful not only for its theoretical insights but for its presentation of a number of practical items".&lt;ref name=PCO /&gt; Kirkus called it "caustic and abrasive" but also "impressively researched ... one of the more challenging works to come out of the women's movement".&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus Reviews, rev. of ''Women, Money and Power'', December 15, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''About Men'' (1978) ===
'' About Men'' describes the relationships between brothers, sons and fathers, and sons and mothers. When it was published in 1978, the book was described as "psychologically voluptuous, it plunges through the bloody underbrush of male-male relationships ... insisting that we look at men with fresh and fearless eyes".&lt;ref&gt;Gail Sheehy, "What Do Men Want?" ''The New York Times'', March 19, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Seidenberg, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at SUNY, wrote that Chesler defined manhood "with a brilliance and erudition equal to the task", describing Chesler as men's "[[Tocqueville]]".&lt;ref name="PCO"/&gt; John Leonard of the ''New York Times'' wrote that Chesler "has written a brave, sad, disorderly, sometimes self-indulgent, often infuriating, always provocative book."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, John "Books of the Times." ''New York Times (1923-Current file)'': 1. Mar 09 1978. ''ProQuest.'' Accessed 16 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''With Child: A Diary of Motherhood'' (1979) ===
Chesler was one of only a small number of second-wave feminists to focus on motherhood. In ''With Child: A Diary of Motherhood'', Chesler explored the experience of pregnancy, childbirth, and the first year of "newborn" motherhood in psychological, spiritual, and mythic terms. The book was endorsed by both men ([[Alan Alda]], [[Gerold Frank]]) and women ([[Judy Collins]], [[Tillie Olsen]], [[Marilyn French]]). It was also reviewed in the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/books/with-child-a-diary-of-motherhood|title=Phyllis Chesler website|work=The Phyllis Chesler Organization|access-date=October 21, 2014|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004091010/http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/books/with-child-a-diary-of-motherhood|archive-date=October 4, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline Seebohm of the ''New York Times'' noted that this book stood out because it was written by a radical feminist, and describes the it as "a nice mixture of romantic charm and intellectual insight."&lt;ref&gt;Seebohm, Caroline. "NONFICTION IN BRIEF." New York Times (1923-Current file): 1. Oct 21 1979. ProQuest. Web. 16 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Chesler's eighteen-year-old son wrote a new introduction to the book.

=== ''Sacred Bond: The Legacy of Baby M'' (1988) ===
''Sacred Bond'' discussed the issues raised by the high-profile [[Baby M]] case, in which surrogacy was ultimately declared illegal in the state of New Jersey. Despite liberal feminist opposition, Chesler defended the rights of the birth mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, who wanted to keep her child even though the genetic father and his wife were a more educated and higher income couple.

''The New York Times'' described this book as "a powerful critique of the way many of us were inclined to think". A ''Los Angeles Times'' reviewer wrote that ''Sacred Bond'' is "a powerful, provocative book ... illustrating social problems sure to remain controversial".&lt;ref name="PCO"/&gt; The book and its views were also condemned by pro-surrogacy lobbies, pro-adoption lobbies, and by feminists who were concerned with maximizing their options in case of infertility. This issue remains timely and is frequently in the news.

=== ''Patriarchy: Notes of an Expert Witness'' (1994) ===
This volume consists of several articles written by Chesler on topics such as the [[Aileen Wuornos]], [[Baby M]], child abuse, treatment of women in mental health institutions, and patriarchy. It also includes a critique of Naomi Wolf’s book ''Fire with Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanhope|first=Victoria|date=1995|editor-last=Chesler|editor-first=Phyllis|title=Bearing Witness to Male Power: A Review of Phyllis Chesler's Patriarchy|jstor=20835058|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=25|issue=2|pages=10–11|doi=|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Letters to a Young Feminist'' (1998) ===
In 1998, Chesler wrote a "legacy" letter. She wanted to share the history of her generation of feminists with coming generations and to point to work still left undone. The work was lauded by feminists of her era and mocked or minimized by daughter-generation feminists who did not want to keep standing on the shoulders of a previous generation with whom they disagreed and with whom they were in competition.

The ''Chicago Tribune'' described this as "a frank assessment of the past and a radical recipe for the future".&lt;ref name="PCO"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' felt much of the advice was unnecessary since "Feminism's daughters have outgrown their bunk beds". The reviewer found the book "strident" and fails to reach younger feminists but concedes that "Chesler does an admirable job. She writes poignantly of the way in which her generation was eerily silent about woman-hating among women, including among feminists. She implores readers to adopt a more global perspective on women's rights."&lt;ref&gt;Kim France, rev. of Letters to a Young Feminist'', [https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/26/reviews/980426.26francet.html?_r=1 The New York Times], Apt. 26, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Salon noted that "the book mostly seemed to piss off its intended audience."&lt;ref&gt;Laura Miller, rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', [http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2002/03/29/girls Salon.com], March 29, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, reviews from feminists of her own generation were more positive. For example, [[Susan Brownmiller]] wrote, "The sweet, clear voice of these Letters should reach across the generation gap like Joshua's trumpet. This is Phyllis Chesler writing at the top of her form."&lt;ref name="PCO"/&gt; [[Gloria Steinem]] endorsed the book and found it a "warm, personal, political, irresistible guide for young feminists, women and men."{{fact|date=October 2018}}

=== ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'' (2002) ===
This pioneering book addressed the subject of female indirect aggression, both in the family and the workplace, both in childhood and adulthood, and covered woman's capacity for cruelty, competition, envy, and ostracism; the ways in which women, like men, have internalized sexist beliefs; and the importance of acknowledging the "shadow side" of female-female relationships, especially because such relationships are so important to women. The book was reviewed in many publications, and the author was interviewed widely in South America, North America (including in ''The New York Times''),&lt;ref&gt;Felicia R. Lee, "Women Are Nurturing? How about Cruel, Especially to One Another", ''The New York Times'', August 24, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Europe, and Asia. It received a front-page review in the Washington Post Book World written by Deborah Tannen. Tannen wrote: "Chesler seems to have read everything and thought deeply about it....Along with social commentary and psychological insight, Chesler offers astute literary criticism....many of Chesler's richest scenarios are drawn from the more than 500 interviews she conducted ... many of Chesler's examples have an unmistakable and heartbreaking ring of familiarity. The time has come to stop idealizing or demonizing either sex. Seeing women, like men, as capable of both courage and jealousy, of providing care, and causing pain, is no more nor less than acknowledging women as fully human."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Tannen, rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', Washington Post, March 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the book was reviewed in ''Salon'',&lt;ref&gt;Rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', Salon.com, March 29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'',&lt;ref&gt;Rev. of Woman's Inhumanity to Woman, ''Publishers Weekly''. http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-56025-351-8&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kirkus Reviews''.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', ''Kirkus Reviews'', January 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The New Anti-Semitism'' (2003) ===
Chesler's ''The New Anti-Semitism: The Current Crisis and What We Must Do About It'' was issued in 2003. The book received positive notices from [[Erica Jong]] and [[Alan Dershowitz]].&lt;Ref Name=Amazon&gt;{{Cite web
 | title= The New Anti-Semitism – Book page on Amazon.com
 | url=https://www.amazon.com/New-Anti-Semitism-Current-Crisis-About/dp/product-description/078796851X
 | access-date=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natan Sharansky]] described the book as "sensitive", "authoritative", and "essential reading".&lt;Ref Name=Amazon /&gt;

Some reviews were more critical. A 2003 review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' argued that the book "too often undercuts itself when its author intends to be provocative", citing lines such as "African-Americans (not Jews) are the Jews in America but Jews are the world's niggers." The review piece concluded that "Chesler's tone and lack of intellectual rigor will not help her ideas to be heard by those who do not already agree with her."&lt;ref&gt;"The New Anti-Semitism: The current Crisis and What We Must Do About It? [review], ''Publishers Weekly'', June 23, 2003, Vol. 250 Iss. 25, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Death of Feminism'' (2005) ===
In ''The Death of Feminism: What's Next in the Struggle for Women's Freedom'', Chesler documented how western academic and activist feminists came to abandon their former concepts of universal human rights for everyone and became multicultural relativists. She argues that their desire to avoid being labeled "racists" or "Islamophobes" eventually trumped their concern with women's and human rights in the Third World. The ''Death of Feminism'' was excerpted in ''Playboy'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "Gender Apartheid", ''Playboy'', November 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; but she was also interviewed by the ''Washington Times'', and positively reviewed in the pages of ''The Weekly Standard'' and ''The National Review''.

Kirkus called it a "loud wake up call ... a fierce polemic, filled with vigorous arguments and distressing human stories".&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus Reviews, rev. of ''The Death of Feminism'', September 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers Weekly wrote: "She has penned a cross between a cri di coeur and a deeply rhetorical polemic that makes scores of provocative points.... As in her last book, ''The New Anti-Semitism'' Chesler raised important issues, but her style will alienate the very people she means to reach."&lt;ref&gt;See reviews:https://www.amazon.com/The-Death-Feminism-Struggle-Freedom/dp/B001QCX85A&lt;/ref&gt; However, leading Second Wave feminist [[Kate Millett]], who wrote ''Sexual Politics'', ''Flying'', and ''Going to Iran'', praised ''The Death of Feminism'': "In telling her story she is sounding a warning to the West that it ignores to its peril." Liberal lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] called the work "a tour de force ... a must read".

She was also interviewed about the book in the ''Chicago Tribune''.&lt;ref&gt;Nara Schoenberg, ''Chicago Tribune'', February 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''London Guardian''. In 2006, Chesler participated at the First Muslim Dissident Conference in St. Petersburg, Florida, which she covered for the Times of London.

=== ''Mothers on Trial: The Battle for Children and Custody'' (2011) ===
In 2011, Chicago Review Press published a 25th anniversary edition of Chesler's 1986 book ''Mothers on Trial: The Battle for Children and Custody'', in which she argues that the American legal system is biased and overworked and continues to fail the needs of mothers and children, especially those whose husbands and fathers are violent and vindictive. She discusses topics such as prolonged litigation, joint custody, court enabled incest, brainwashing, kidnapping, gay and lesbian custody, fathers' rights groups, and international child custody laws. The new edition includes a new introduction and eight new chapters. The new edition received favorable notices from the ''[[Library Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/reviewsbook/890730-421/social_sciences_reviews_june_15.html.csp "Social Sciences Reviews"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714002845/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/reviewsbook/890730-421/social_sciences_reviews_june_15.html.csp |date=2011-07-14 }}, ''Library Journal'', July 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www7.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/phyllis-chesler/mothers-trial/ Kirkus Reviews]'', July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''An American Bride in Kabul: A Memoir ''(2013) ===
An account of her 1961 marriage to an Afghan man, her brief married life in a harem in Afghanistan, and the lifelong lessons she learned. The book uses material from diaries, letters, and interviews spanning a fifty-year period to describe this ill-fated relationship and the experiences that Chesler believes forged her feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/books/an-american-bride-in-kabul|title=An American Bride in Kabul: A Memoir|work=The Phyllis Chesler Organization|access-date=October 21, 2014|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202161946/http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/books/an-american-bride-in-kabul|archive-date=December 2, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=November 2013}} ''American Bride in Kabul'' won a National Jewish Book Award for 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/Default.aspx?PageID=15551390&amp;A=SearchResult&amp;SearchID=26349636&amp;ObjectID=15551390&amp;ObjectType=1|title=2013 National Jewish Book Award Winners|website=www.jewishbookcouncil.org|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statements and writing on Islam ==
On December 14, 2005, Chesler delivered a presentation before a [[United States Senate]] committee entitled, "Gender Apartheid in Iran and the Muslim World". She called for the U.S. government to oppose what she described as "Islamic gender apartheid" and to support the rights of women living in fundamentalist Islamic regimes. "If we do not oppose and defeat Islamic gender apartheid, democracy and freedom cannot flourish in the Arab and Islamic world," she said. "If we do not join forces with Muslim dissident and feminist groups; and, above all, if we do not have one universal standard of human rights for all—then we will fail our own Judeo-Christian and secular Western ideals." She also told the committee that her experience in Afghanistan taught her "the necessity of applying a single standard of human rights, not one tailored to each culture".&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;Kate Walker, "[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2005/12/25/Moral-relativism-begets-gender-apartheid/UPI-36461135520760/ Moral relativism begets gender apartheid]", UPI, December 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesler made statements critical of Islam in the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] in a 2007 interview with the ''[[Jewish Press]]''. She was quoted as saying, "It's easy to say, yes, the Muslims are against everyone who is not a Muslim. And it's true. That's part of what jihad is about, that's part of the history of Islam. [...] Here's the thing. The West, and that means Jews and Israelis, would like to lead sweet and peaceful lives. We're up against an enemy now that is dying to kill us, that lives to kill, and that at best merely wishes to impose on the rest of us its laws and strictures."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpressads.com/pageroute.do/23249/ Fern Sidman, "Israel Today &amp; Always: Breaking Ranks – An Interview With Phyllis Chesler"], ''The Jewish Press'', August 15, 2007, accessed July 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Honor-related violence and honor killings
Chesler published three essays about [[honor killing]]s in the American journal ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'' in 2009, 2010, and 2012. In one such essay, she wrote that 91% of the total worldwide cases of honour killings (as reported in English-language media) were Muslim-on-Muslim crimes, including those committed in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name=HKMEF&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence", ''Middle East Quarterly'', Spring 2009; Phyllis Chesler, "Worldwide Trends in Honor Killings", ''Middle East Quarterly'', Spring 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these sources, Chesler concluded that "there are at least two types of honor killings and two victim populations." She identified the first group as consisting of daughters with an average age of seventeen who were killed by their families, and the second group as consisting of women with an average age of thirty-six. In her most recent essay, Chesler asserts that both Hindus and Muslims commit honor killings, but that only Muslims do so worldwide.

Chesler argues that honor killings differ qualitatively from Western domestic femicide. She has acknowledged that "many honorable feminists" disagree with this position, writing that "understandably, such feminists fear singling out one group for behavior that may be common to all groups." Chesler's position is that perpetrators of domestically violent femicide are regarded as criminals in the west but that the same stigma does not attach to honor killings in all other societies.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "The Sisterhood's most Important Struggle", ''National Post'', March 12, 2011, A28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address before the [[New York County Supreme Court]], Chesler reported that she has submitted affidavits on behalf of Muslim women and converts from Islam whom she contends believed themselves to be in danger of being the victims of honor killing, and who sought asylum and citizenship in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "[http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/03/08/100th-anniversary-international-womens-day-feminists-doing-honor-killings/ On the 100th Anniversary of International Women's Day – What Are Feminists Doing About Honor Killings?]" Fox News, March 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Burqas
In 2010, Chesler wrote a further essay in ''Middle East Quarterly'' calling for the [[burqa]] to be banned in western countries. She argued in defense of this position that the [[Qur'an]] commands both men and women to dress "modestly"; that several Muslim-majority countries have, in the past, banned the full [[burqa]] or [[niqab]], and that the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries do not require that women wear a face veil; that the burqa can function as a "sensory deprivation and isolation chamber"; and that physical and psychiatric illnesses are associated with lack of sunlight. She wrote that she was not opposed to the headscarf (hijab), on the grounds that it does not obscure a woman's facial identity.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, "Ban the Burqa? The Argument in Favor". ''Middle East Quarterly'', Fall 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Chesler, [http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/11/the_feminist_politics_of_islam.html The Feminist Politics of Islamic Misogyny], American Thinker, November 13, 2010. Accessed Jul.29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chesler, Phyllis.

October 18, 2010. Web. June 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Other
Chesler has been writing about rape, incest, sexual harassment, and domestic violence since the late 1960s. Her focus has mainly been in the West. With the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, terrorism, and gender apartheid, and the Islamist persecution of women, Chesler began to explore similar themes in Muslim-majority countries. Chesler found that sexual abuse is widespread in Muslim communities worldwide, and that such abuse "leads to paranoid, highly traumatized and revenge-seeking adults". She has further argued, in a paraphrase of Nancy Kobrin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

A 2006 review in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' described Chesler's views on this subject as "compelling, if strident".&lt;ref&gt;Ron Charach, "Strict instead of empathetic; Are people raised in fundamentalist societies more apt to hate others?", ''Toronto Star'', September 17, 2006, D10.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim feminists and dissidents such as Ibn Warraq and Amir Taheri have lauded Chesler's work in this area as ground-breaking and truthful.&lt;ref&gt;See reviews: https://www.amazon.com/The-Death-Feminism-Struggle-Freedom/dp/B001QCX85A&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Chesler was appointed a Fellow of the [[Middle East Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.meforum.org/fellows.php|title = Writing Fellows|website = Middle East Forum|access-date = 2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent activities ==
Chesler’s work on honor-based violence, including honor killing, has recently led to a number of consequential events.

First, in the summer of 2017, after Taylor and Francis declined to publish her two volumes in this area, New English Review Press immediately agreed to do so. In the fall of 2017, they published Islamic Gender Apartheid: Exposing a Veiled War Against Women with a new Introduction. It received a number of respectful reviews.

Second, in April 2017, she was dis-invited by the University of Arkansas Law School to lecture at a conference about Honor-Based Violence. This was written about widely on social media. However Dr. Chesler was almost immediately invited by a group of grassroots activists in this very area to speak at a conference at U College London which took place in November of 2017. In 2018, she received a “True Honor” award from the Iranian and Kurdish Women’s Rights Organization (IKWRO) at a ceremony in London.

She selected, edited, and newly introduced her volume A Family Conspiracy: Honor Killing which appeared in April, 2018; the original Introduction appeared at Tablet, Middle East Forum, and at Mosaic. It was translated into German by Henryk K. Broder's group and posted at Achgut.

A major interview with Dr. Chesler appeared in Emma the German feminist magazine.

Fourth she was again asked by a Law School clinic familiar with her academic studies in this area, to submit an affidavit (or, in this case, a Declaration) for a women who is applying for asylum based on the strong likelihood of her being honor killed were she to be returned to India. This was her sixth such affidavit for such cases.

'''Robert Anton Wilson''' (born '''Robert Edward Wilson'''; January 18, 1932 – January 11, 2007) was an American author, novelist, [[essayist]], [[copy editing|editor]], [[playwright]], [[poet]], [[futurist]], and self-described [[agnostic]] [[mysticism|mystic]]. Recognized by [[Discordianism]] as an [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Episkopos]], Pope, and saint, Wilson helped publicize the group through his writings and interviews.

Wilson described his work as an "attempt to break down conditioned associations, to look at the world in a new way, with many models recognized as models or maps, and no one model elevated to the truth".&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Monaghan: "Robert Anton Wilson". ''Booklist'', May 15, 1999 v. 95 i. 18 p. 1680&lt;/ref&gt; His goal being "to try to get people into a state of generalized agnosticism, not [[agnosticism]] about [[God]] alone but agnosticism about everything."&lt;ref&gt;"Robert Anton Wilson".

==Early life==
[[File:Robert Anton Wilson, 1977.jpg|left|thumb|Wilson at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], London, for the 10-hour stage version of ''[[Illuminatus!]]'' in 1977.]]

{{quote|"Is", "is." "is"''—the idiocy of the word haunts me. If it were abolished, human thought might begin to make sense. I don't know what anything ''"is"''; I only know how it seems to me at this moment.|Robert Anton Wilson, ''[[The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles]]'', as spoken by Sigismundo Celine.}}

Born Robert Edward Wilson in [[New York Methodist Hospital|Methodist Hospital]], in [[Brooklyn]], New York, he spent his first years in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], and moved with his family to [[lower middle class]] [[Gerritsen Beach]] around the age of four or five, where they stayed until relocating to the steadfastly middle-class neighborhood of [[Bay Ridge]] when Wilson was thirteen. He suffered from [[polio]] as a child, and found generally effective treatment with the Kenny Method (created by [[Elizabeth Kenny]]) which the [[American Medical Association]] repudiated at that time. Polio's effects remained with Wilson throughout his life, usually manifesting as minor muscle spasms causing him to use a cane occasionally until 2000, when he experienced a major bout with [[post-polio syndrome]] that would continue until his death.

Wilson attended Catholic grammar school, likely the school associated with Gerritsen Beach's Resurrection Church {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, and attended [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] (a selective public institution) to remove himself from the Catholic influence; at "Brooklyn Tech," Wilson was influenced by [[literary modernism]] (particularly [[Ezra Pound]] and [[James Joyce]]), the Western philosophical tradition, then-innovative historians such as [[Charles A. Beard]], [[science fiction]] (including the works of [[Olaf Stapledon]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Theodore Sturgeon]]) and [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s interdisciplinary theory of [[general semantics]].&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://setiishadim.wordpress.com/2007/01/12/robert-anton-wilson/|title=Robert Anton Wilson RIP|work=The Force Holocron}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later recall that the family was "living so well... compared to the Depression" during this period "that I imagined we were [[lace-curtain Irish]] at last."&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/robert-anton-wilson|title=Mises Daily|work=Mises Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his graduation in 1950, Wilson was employed in a succession of jobs (including ambulance driver, engineering aide, salesman and medical orderly) and absorbed various philosophers and cultural practices (including [[bebop]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Ayn Rand]], whom he later repudiated) while writing in his spare time. He studied [[electrical engineering]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]] from 1952 to 1957 and English education at [[New York University]] from 1957 to 1958 but failed to take a degree from either institution.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/13/obituaries/13wilson.html Robert Anton Wilson, 74, Who Wrote Mind-Twisting Novels, Dies], The New York Times, January 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/473/000023404/|title=Robert Anton Wilson|work=nndb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After smoking [[marijuana]] for nearly a decade, he first experimented with [[mescaline]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]] on December 28, 1961.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"/&gt; Wilson began to work as a freelance journalist and advertising copywriter in the late 1950s. He adopted his maternal grandfather's name, Anton, for his writings, telling himself that he would save the "Edward" for when he wrote the [[Great American Novel]] and later finding that "Robert Anton Wilson" had become an established identity.

He assumed co-editorship of the [[Ralph Borsodi|School for Living]]'s [[Brookville, Ohio]]-based ''Balanced Living'' magazine in 1962 and briefly returned to New York as associate editor of [[Ralph Ginzburg]]'s quarterly ''fact:'' before leaving for ''[[Playboy]]'', where he served as an associate editor from 1965 to 1971. According to Wilson, ''Playboy'' "paid me a higher salary than any other magazine at which I had worked and never expected me to become a conformist or sell my soul in return. I enjoyed my years in the Bunny Empire. I only resigned when I reached 40 and felt I could not live with myself if I didn't make an effort to write full-time at last."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; Along with frequent collaborator [[Robert Shea]], Wilson edited the magazine's ''Playboy'' Forum, a letters section consisting of responses to the ''Playboy'' Philosophy editorial column. During this period, he covered [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Richard Alpert]]'s [[Millbrook, New York]]-based Castalia Foundation at the instigation of [[Alan Watts]] in ''[[The Realist]]'', cultivated important friendships with [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], and lectured at the [[Free University of New York]] on 'Anarchist and Synergetic Politics' in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;

==The ''Illuminatus!'' Trilogy==
{{Main|The Illuminatus! Trilogy}}
{{quote box|width=40%|
[[Richard Metzger]]: You have studied the Illuminati for years. Have you come to any conclusion about their aims?

Robert Anton Wilson: Usually when people ask me that question, I give them some kind of a put-on, but I can't think of a good and original put-on that I haven't done several times before.
So I'll tell you the truth, for once. After investigating the Illuminati and their critics for the last 30 years, I think the Illuminati was a short lived society of free thinkers and democratic reformers that formed a secret society within Freemasonry, using Freemasonry as a cover so they could plot to overthrow all the kings in Europe and the Pope. I'm very happy that they succeeded in overthrowing all the kings, I just wish that they had completed the job and gotten rid of the Royal family in England too, but they did pretty well on the continent. I'm sorry they haven't finished off the Pope yet, either, but I think they're still working on the project and I wish them luck.|''Disinformation: The Interviews''.

Advertised as "a [[fairy tale]] for paranoids," the three books—''The Eye in the Pyramid'', ''The Golden Apple'', and ''Leviathan'', soon offered as a single volume—philosophically and humorously examined, among many other themes, occult and magical symbolism and history, the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], [[secret societies]], data concerning author [[H.P. Lovecraft]] and author and occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], and American [[paranoia]] about [[Cabal|conspiracies]] and [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson and Shea derived much of the odder material from letters sent to ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine while they worked as the editors of its Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Prometheus.htm |title=Illuminatus stumbles |date=April 3, 2013 |publisher= |accessdate=June 15, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403011402/http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Prometheus.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The books mixed true information with imaginative fiction to engage the reader in what Wilson called "[[guerrilla ontology]]", which he apparently referred to as "[[Operation Mindfuck]]" in ''Illuminatus!'' The trilogy also outlined a set of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[axioms]] known as [[Celine's laws|Celine's Laws]] (named after Hagbard Celine, a character in ''Illuminatus!''), concepts Wilson revisited several times in other writings.

Among the many subplots of ''Illuminatus!'' one addresses [[biological warfare]] and the overriding of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], another  gives a detailed account of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] (in which no fewer than five snipers, all working for different causes, prepare to shoot Kennedy), and the book's climax occurs at a rock concert where the audience collectively face the danger of becoming a mass human sacrifice.

''Illuminatus!'' popularized [[Discordianism]] and the use of the term "[[fnord]]". It incorporates experimental prose styles influenced by writers such as [[William S. Burroughs]], [[James Joyce]], and [[Ezra Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;Conspiracy Digest Interviews printed in ''Illuminatus Papers'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Although Shea and Wilson never co-operated on such a scale again, Wilson continued to expand upon the themes of the ''Illuminatus!'' books throughout his writing career. Most of his later fiction contains cross-over characters from "The Sex Magicians" (Wilson's first novel, written before the release of ''Illuminatus!'', which includes many of his same characters) and ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy''.

''Illuminatus!'' won the Prometheus Hall of Fame award for [[science fiction]] in 1986, has many international editions, and found adaptation for the stage when [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]] produced it as a ten-hour drama. It also appeared as two card based games from [[Steve Jackson Games]], one a trading-card game ([[Illuminati: New World Order]]). Eye N Apple Productions and [[Rip Off Press]] produced a comic book version of the trilogy.

==''Schrödinger's Cat'' Trilogy, ''The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles'', and ''Masks of the Illuminati''==
{{Main|Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy|The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles|Masks of the Illuminati}}
Wilson wrote two more popular fiction series. The first, a trilogy later published as a single volume, was ''[[Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy|Schrödinger's Cat]]''. The second, ''[[The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles]]'', appeared as three books. In between publishing the two trilogies Wilson released a stand-alone novel, ''[[Masks of the Illuminati]]'' (1981), which fits into, due to the main character's ancestry, ''The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles''' timeline and, while published earlier, could qualify for the fourth volume in that series.

''Schrödinger's Cat'' consists of three volumes: ''The Universe Next Door'', ''The Trick Top Hat'', and ''The Homing Pigeons''. Wilson set the three books in differing [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universes]], and most of the characters remain almost the same but may have different names, careers and background stories. The books cover the fields of [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[Quantum mechanics, philosophy and controversy|varied philosophies and explanations]] that exist within the science. The single volume describes itself as a [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magical textbook]] and a type of [[initiation]]. The single-volume edition omits many entire pages and has many other omissions when compared with the original separate books.

''The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles'', composed of ''The Earth Will Shake'' (1982), ''The Widow's Son'' (1985), and ''Nature's God'' (1991), follows the timelines of several characters through different generations, time periods, and countries. The books cover, among many other topics, the history, legacy, and rituals of the [[Illuminati]] and related groups.

''Masks of the Illuminati'', featuring historical characters in a fictionalized setting, contains a great deal of occult data. Intermixing [[Albert Einstein]], [[James Joyce]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]], and others, the book focuses on [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and other occult icons, ideas, and practices. The book includes homages, parodies and pastiches from both the lives and works of Crowley and Joyce.

==Plays and screenplays==
Wilson's play, ''[[Wilhelm Reich in Hell]]'', was published as a book in 1987 and first performed at the [[Edmund Burke]] Theatre in [[Dublin]], in [[San Francisco]], and in [[Los Angeles]]. It features many factual and fictional characters, including [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Uncle Sam]], and [[Wilhelm Reich]] himself. Wilson also wrote and published as books two [[screenplays]], not yet produced: ''[[Reality Is What You Can Get Away With|Reality Is What You Can Get Away With: an Illustrated Screenplay]]'' (1992) and ''[[The Walls Came Tumbling Down]]'' (1997).

Wilson's book ''[[Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati]]'' has been adapted as a theatrical stage play by Daisy Eris Campbell,&lt;ref name="The_Cosmic_Trigger_driving_Miss_Daisy"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Cosmic Trigger driving Miss Daisy |url=http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/Culture/Arts/The-Cosmic-Trigger-driving-Miss-Daisy |accessdate=June 12, 2014 |work=Liverpool Confidential |date=January 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144912/http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/Culture/Arts/The-Cosmic-Trigger-driving-Miss-Daisy |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[Ken Campbell]] the British theatre maverick who staged ''[[Illuminatus#Adaptations|Illuminatus!]]'' at the Royal National Theatre in 1977.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; The play opened on November 23, 2014 in [[Liverpool]] before transferring to London and Brighton.&lt;ref name= Cosmic_Trigger_About_Play&gt;{{cite web |title=The Play - What is it About? |url= http://cosmictriggerplay.com/the-play/ |website=Cosmic Trigger Play website |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the costs were met through [[crowdfunding]].&lt;ref name=Cosmic_Trigger_IGG&gt;{{cite web |title=Cosmic Trigger Play crowdfunding campaign |url= http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cosmic-trigger-play/x/103864 |website=[[Indiegogo]] |accessdate=June 12, 2014 |date=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's book is itself dedicated to "Ken Campbell and the Science-Fiction Theatre Of Liverpool, England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati |date=2013 |publisher=New Falcon Publications |isbn=1561840033 |page=dedication |edition=First Edition, Twenty-fourth Printing |ref=Cosmic_Trigger_Book_Dedication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Cosmic Trigger'' series and other books==
In his nonfiction and partly autobiographical ''[[Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati]]'' (1977) and its two sequels, as well as in many other works, Wilson examined [[Freemasons]], Discordianism, [[Sufism]], the Illuminati, [[Futurology]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Dennis McKenna|Dennis]] and [[Terence McKenna]], [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], the occult practices of [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[G. I. Gurdjieff|G.I. Gurdjieff]], [[Yoga]], and many other [[esoteric]] or [[counterculture]] philosophies, personalities, and occurrences.

Wilson advocated [[Timothy Leary]]'s [[8-Circuit Model of Consciousness]] and neurosomatic/linguistic engineering, which he wrote about in many books including ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'' (1983, revised 1997) and ''[[Quantum Psychology]]'' (1990), which contain practical techniques intended to help the reader break free of one's [[reality tunnel]]s. With Leary, he helped promote the futurist ideas of [[Colonization of space|space migration]], [[Transhumanism|intelligence increase]], and [[life extension]], which they combined to form the word symbol [[SMI²LE]].

Wilson's 1986 book, ''[[The New Inquisition]]'', argues that whatever reality consists of it actually would seem much weirder than we commonly imagine. It cites, among other sources, [[Bell's theorem]] and [[Alain Aspect]]'s experimental proof of Bell's to suggest that mainstream science has a strong materialist bias, and that in fact modern physics may have already disproved [[materialist]] [[metaphysics]].

Wilson also supported the work and [[utopian]] theories of [[Buckminster Fuller]] and examined the theories of [[Charles Fort]]. He and [[Loren Coleman]] became friends,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/23-skidoo-raw/ 23 Skidoo] Cryptomundo&lt;/ref&gt; as he did with media theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Neuro Linguistic Programming]] co-founder [[Richard Bandler]], with whom he taught workshops. He also admired James Joyce, and wrote extensive commentaries on the author and on two of Joyce's novels, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' and [[Ulysses (novel)|''Ulysses'']], in his 1988 book ''[[Coincidance: A Head Test]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Bray, Faustin / Wallace, Brian (interviewers)/ Wilson, Robert Anton (speaker) | title=Robert Anton Wilson On ''Finnegans Wake'' and Joseph Campbell | medium=Audio CD | publisher=Sound Photosynthesis | location=Mill Valley | date=1988 | ISBN=1569648018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Wilson often lampooned and criticized some [[New Age]] beliefs, bookstores specializing in New Age material often sell his books. Wilson, a well-known author in [[occult]] and [[Neo-Pagan]] circles, used [[Aleister Crowley]] as a main character in his 1981 novel ''[[Masks of the Illuminati]]'', also included some elements of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s work in his novels, and at times claimed to have perceived encounters with magical "entities" (when asked whether these entities seemed "real", he answered they seemed "real enough," although "not as real as the IRS" but "easier to get rid of", and later decided that his experiences may have emerged from "just my right brain hemisphere talking to my left").&lt;ref&gt;''Maybe Logic: The Lives and Ideas of Robert Anton Wilson''&lt;/ref&gt; He warned against beginners using occult practice, since to rush into such practices and the resulting "energies" they unleash could lead people to "go totally nuts".&lt;ref&gt;"Robert Anton Wilson". Robert Anton Wilson Explains Everything. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson also criticized scientific types with overly rigid belief systems, equating them with [[Religious fundamentalism|religious fundamentalists]] in their [[fanaticism]]. In a 1988 interview, when asked about his newly published book ''[[The New Inquisition|The New Inquisition: Irrational Rationalism and the Citadel of Science]]'', Wilson commented: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I coined the term irrational rationalism because those people claim to be rationalists, but they're governed by such a heavy body of taboos. They're so fearful, and so hostile, and so narrow, and frightened, and uptight and dogmatic... I wrote this book because I got tired satirizing fundamentalist Christianity... I decided to satirize fundamentalist materialism for a change, because the two are equally comical... The materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the Christian fundamentalists, because they think they're rational! ...They're never skeptical about anything except the things they have a prejudice against. None of them ever says anything skeptical about the AMA, or about anything in establishment science or any entrenched dogma. They're only skeptical about new ideas that frighten them. They're actually dogmatically committed to what they were taught when they were in college....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nii.net/~obie/1988_interview.htm 1988 interview transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331111500/http://www.nii.net/~obie/1988_interview.htm |date=March 31, 2006 }}, KFJC, David A. Banton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Probability reliance==
In a 2003 interview with ''[[High Times]]'' magazine, Wilson described himself as "model-[[agnostic]]" which he said 

&lt;blockquote&gt;consists of never regarding any model or map of the universe with total 100% belief or total 100% denial. Following Korzybski, I put things in probabilities, not absolutes... My only originality lies in applying this zetetic attitude outside the hardest of the hard sciences, physics, to softer sciences and then to non-sciences like politics, ideology, jury verdicts and, of course, conspiracy theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krassner|Krassner, Paul]]. [http://www.newfalcon.com/author_articles/wilson_interview_pk_a.htm A Paul Krassner Interview With R. A. W] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803005606/http://www.newfalcon.com/author_articles/wilson_interview_pk_a.htm |date=August 3, 2003 }} – ''[[High Times]]'', March 2003 issue.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wilson claimed in ''Cosmic Trigger: Volume 1'' "not to believe anything", since "belief is the death of intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robert Anton. ''Cosmic Trigger: Volume I.'' [[Tempe, Arizona]]. New Falcon Publications. 1977. p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; He described this approach as "Maybe Logic."

Wilson wrote about this and other topics in articles for the [[cyberpunk]] magazine ''[[Mondo 2000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawilson.com/m2k.shtml "CybeRevolution Montage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019214535/http://www.rawilson.com/m2k.shtml |date=October 19, 2006 }}, ''Mondo 2000'' no. 7, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic thought==
Wilson favored a form of [[basic income|basic income guarantee]]; synthesizing several ideas under the acronym RICH.  His ideas are set forth in the essay "The RICH Economy" found in ''The Illuminati Papers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whywork.org/rethinking/whywork/rawilson.html The RICH Economy by Robert Anton Wilson from ''The Illuminati Papers''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613011108/http://whywork.org/rethinking/whywork/rawilson.html |date=June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article critical of capitalism Wilson self-identified as a "[[libertarian socialist]]", saying that "I ask only one thing of skeptics: don't bring up Soviet Russia, please. That horrible example of [[State Capitalism]] has nothing to do with what I, and other libertarian socialists, would offer as an alternative to the present system."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ep.tc/realist/27/06.html Robert Anton Wilson. "Is Capitalism a Revealed Religion?"

''Right Where You Are Sitting Now: Further Tales of the Illuminati''. Ronin Publishing. 1993. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson speaks favorably of [[Henry George]] in the essay ''Left and Right: A Non-Euclidean Perspective'': "I am still fond of the system of Henry George (in which no rent is allowed, but free enterprise is otherwise preserved)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Robert Anton |title=Left and Right: A Non-Euclidean Perspective |url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/robert-anton-wilson-left-and-right-a-non-euclidean-perspective |website=The Anarchist Library |accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson also identified as an anarchist and described his belief system as "a blend of Tucker, Spooner, Fuller, Pound, Henry George, Rothbard, Douglas, Korzybski, Proudhon and Marx."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Illuminating Discord: An Interview with Robert Anton Wilson |url=https://c4ss.org/content/40140 |website=The Center for a Stateless Society (C4SS) |accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson included Henry George's ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' and Gesell's ''The Natural Economic Order'' in his list of 20 book recommendations, "the bare minimum of what everybody really needs to chew and digest before they can converse intelligently about the 21st Century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Robert Anton |title=R.A.W.'s Recommended Book List |url=http://www.rawilson.com/bookstore.html |website=The RAW Bookstore |publisher=http://www.rawilson.com |accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Robert Anton Wilson and his wife Arlen Riley Wilson founded the ''Institute for the Study of the Human Future'' in 1975.

From 1982 until his death, Wilson had a business relationship with the [[Association for Consciousness Exploration]], which hosted his first on-stage dialogue with his long-time friend Timothy Leary&lt;ref name="plaindealer"&gt;Lesie, Michele (1989) "High Priest of LSD To Drop In", ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''The Inner Frontier''.&lt;ref&gt;''Local Group Hosts Dr. Timothy Leary'' by Will Allison (The Observer Fri.

Wilson also joined the [[Church of the SubGenius]], who referred to him as Pope Bob.&lt;ref name="popebob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/Winterstar-01/winterstar-01.html|title=Winterstar 01|work=subgenius.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to their literature, including the book ''Three-Fisted Tales of "Bob"'', and shared a stage with their founder, Rev. [[Ivan Stang]], on several occasions. Wilson also founded the Guns and Dope Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The High Times Reader |first1=Annie |last1=Nocenti |first2=Ruth |last2=Baldwin |publisher=Nation Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-1560256243 |page=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the Board of Advisors of the [[Fully Informed Jury Association]], Wilson worked to inform the public about [[jury nullification]], the right of jurors to nullify a law they deem unjust.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;[http://users.bestweb.net/~kali93/raw.htm Interview of Robert Anton Wilson], (conducted August 1997) ''Paradigm Shift'', Vol. 1 No. 1 (July 1998).

''Santa Fe New Mexican'', December 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A decades-long researcher into drugs and a strong opponent of what he called "the war on some drugs", Wilson participated as a Special Guest in the week-long 1999 Annual [[Cannabis Cup]] in [[Amsterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krassner]]: "The High Life", ''[[LA Weekly]]'', December 17, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and used and often promoted the use of [[medical marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;"In Santa Cruz, an Official Handout of Medicinal Pot."

On June 22, 2006, ''[[Huffington Post]]'' blogger [[Paul Krassner]] reported that Wilson was under [[hospice care]] at home with friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-krassner/robert-anton-wilson_b_23608.html Robert Anton Wilson] The Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2, [[Douglas Rushkoff]] reported that Wilson was in severe financial trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/blog/2006/10/2/robert-anton-wilson-needs-our-help.html|title=Douglas Rushkoff - Blog - Robert Anton Wilson Needs Our Help|work=rushkoff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slashdot]], [[Boing Boing]], and the Church of the SubGenius also picked up on the story, linking to Rushkoff's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/articles/06/10/04/0213218.shtml|title=Illumninatus! Author Needs Our Help - Slashdot|work=slashdot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061129004851/http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/02/robert_anton_wilson_.html Robert Anton Wilson needs our Help], [[BoingBoing]], October 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As his webpage reported on October 10, these efforts succeeded beyond expectation and raised a sum which would have supported him for at least six months. Obviously touched by the great outpouring of support, on October 5, 2006, Wilson left the following comment on his personal website, expressing his gratitude:

{{quote|Dear Friends, my God, what can I say. I am dumbfounded, flabbergasted, and totally stunned by the charity and compassion that has poured in here the last three days.

To steal from Jack Benny, "I do not deserve this, but I also have severe leg problems and I don't deserve them either."

Because he was a kind man as well as a funny one, Benny was beloved. I find it hard to believe that I am equally beloved and especially that I deserve such love.

Whoever you are, wherever you are, know that my love is with you.

You have all reminded me that despite George W. Bush and all his cohorts, there is still a lot of beautiful kindness in the world.

Blessings,

Robert Anton Wilson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawilson.com/main.shtml |title=Robert Anton Wilson Home Page |work=rawilson.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415144820/http://www.rawilson.com/main.shtml |archivedate=April 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On January 6, 2007, Wilson wrote on his blog that according to several medical authorities, he would likely only have between two days and two months left to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertantonwilson.blogspot.com/2007/01/do-not-go-gently-into-that-good-night.html|title=Do Not Go Gently Into That Good Night|author=Robert Anton Wilson|work=robertantonwilson.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He closed this message with "I look forward without dogmatic optimism but without dread. I love you all and I deeply implore you to keep the lasagna flying. Please pardon my levity, I don't see how to take death seriously. It seems absurd."

Wilson died peacefully five days later, on January 11 at 4:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. Pacific time, just a week short of his 75th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertantonwilson.blogspot.com/2007/01/raw-essence.html|title=RAW Essence|author=Robert Anton Wilson|work=robertantonwilson.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his cremation on January 18 (also his 75th birthday), his family held a memorial service on February 18 and then scattered most of his ashes at the same spot as his wife's—off the [[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]] in [[Santa Cruz, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertantonwilson.blogspot.com/2007/01/robert-anton-wilson-cosmic-meme-orial.html|title=RAW Data: Robert Anton Wilson Cosmic Meme-Orial|author=Robert Anton Wilson|work=robertantonwilson.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ZQ-3yk7_kLU|Robert Anton Wilson Meme-orial Procession&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early years, Paul served on the [[House Banking Committee]], where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the [[savings and loan crisis]].&lt;ref name="ny" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2008bio" /&gt; Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873–1933, and with Senator [[Jesse Helms]] convinced the Congress to study the issue.&lt;ref name="gold" /&gt; He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President [[Jimmy Carter]] and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.&lt;ref name="wsj1997" /&gt;

Paul left the Republican Party in 1987 and launched a bid for the presidency running on the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] ticket. His candidacy was seen as problematic because of the party's long support for freedom of choice on abortions. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] activist [[Russell Means]], Paul's rival for the nomination, emphasized that he was pro-choice on the abortion issue.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Turner, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/us/major-libertarian-candidate-opposes-party-stand-on-abortion.html Major Libertarian Candidate Opposes Party Stand on Abortion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408181507/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/us/major-libertarian-candidate-opposes-party-stand-on-abortion.html |date=April 8, 2016 }}, [[New York Times]], September 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; In a forum held prior to the nomination, Means dismissed the greater funds raised by Paul's campaign, commenting that Means was receiving "10 times more press" than the former Congressman and was therefore "100 times more effective".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d1cPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p4YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5224,1878387&amp;dq=ron-paul |title=Libertarian delegates hear party candidates debate |newspaper=The Bulletin |publication-place=Bend, Oregon |date=September 4, 1987 |page=3 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

According to Paul, his presidential campaign was about more than obtaining office; he sought to promote his libertarian ideas, often to school and university groups regardless of vote eligibility.

At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul announced his general support of four third-party candidates: [[Cynthia McKinney]] ([[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]]); [[Bob Barr]] ([[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]); [[Chuck Baldwin]] ([[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]); and [[Ralph Nader]] (independent). He said that each of them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing either of the two main parties' candidates (McCain&amp;nbsp;– Republican Party, or Obama&amp;nbsp;– Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the "charade" that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process.&lt;ref&gt;(2008-09-10) [http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/10/paul.endorsement/ "Ron Paul urges voters to skip McCain, Obama"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408202249/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/10/paul.endorsement/ |date=April 8, 2016 }}, CNN.

Two weeks later, "shocked and disappointed" that [[Bob Barr]] (the Libertarian nominee) had pulled out of attending the press conference at the last minute and had admonished Paul for remaining neutral and failing to say which specific candidate Paul would vote for in the general election, Paul released a statement saying that he had decided to endorse [[Chuck Baldwin]], the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] candidate, for president.&lt;ref name="campaignforliberty1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforliberty.com/blog.php?view=547#.|title=A New Alliance|author=Paul, Ron|date=September 22, 2008|accessdate=September 22, 2008|publisher=[[Campaign for Liberty]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212045449/http://www.campaignforliberty.com/blog.php?view=547 |archivedate=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, Paul's campaign announced that due to lack of funds (though despite financial backing from financiers [[Peter Thiel]] and [[Mark Spitznagel]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeBord|first=Matthew|title=Meet Mark Spitznagel, Ron Paul's L.A. hedge-fund guy|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/economy/2012/03/05/4955/meet-mark-spitznagel-ron-pauls-l-hedge-fund-guy/|accessdate=April 10, 2015|newspaper=KPCC|date=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he would no longer actively campaign for votes in the 11 remaining primary states, including Texas and California, that had not yet voted.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes05142012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC0514&gt;{{cite news|last=Good|first=Chris|title=Ron Paul to Stop Campaigning in New States|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/ron-paul-to-stop-campaigning-in-new-states/|accessdate=May 14, 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would, however, continue to seek to win delegates for the national party convention in the states that had already voted.

====Irregularities====
In June, a group of 132 supporters of Paul, demanding the freedom as delegates to the upcoming Republican party national convention to cast votes for Paul, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the [[Republican National Committee]] and 55 state and territorial Republican party organizations for allegedly coercing delegates to choose [[Mitt Romney]] as the party's presidential nominee.&lt;ref name=NJsuit&gt;{{cite news|last=Roth |first=Caroline |title=RNC Faces Suit from Paul Backers |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/rnc-faces-suit-from-paul-backers-20120619 |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |newspaper=National Journal |date=June 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619210645/http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/rnc-faces-suit-from-paul-backers-20120619 |archivedate=June 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged that there had been "a systematic campaign of [[election fraud]] at state conventions," employing rigging of voting machines, ballot stuffing, and falsification of ballot totals. The suit further pointed to incidents at state conventions, including acts of violence and changes in procedural rules, allegedly intended to deny participation of Paul supporters in the party decision-making and to prevent votes from being cast for Paul. An attorney representing the complainants said that Paul campaign advisor [[Doug Wead]] had voiced support for the legal action.&lt;ref name="NJsuit" /&gt; Paul himself told [[CNN]] that although the lawsuit was not a part of his campaign's strategy and that he had not been advising his supporters to sue, he was not going to tell his supporters not to sue, if they had a legitimate argument. "If they're not following the rules, you have a right to stand up for the rules. I think for the most part these winning caucuses that we've been involved in we have followed the rules.

=== Republican National convention ===
Paul declined to speak at the Republican National Convention as a matter of principle, saying that the convention planners had demanded that his remarks be vetted by the Romney campaign and that he make an unqualified endorsement of Romney.&lt;ref name=nytspeech&gt;{{cite news|last=Harwood|first=John|title=Libertarian legion stands ready to accept torch from Paul|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/us/politics/ron-paul-passing-torch-to-a-libertarian-legion.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul had felt that "It wouldn't be my speech...

=== Refusal to endorse the Republican nominee ===
As in 2008, in 2012 Paul ultimately refused to endorse the ticket selected by the Republican Party. He said that there was no essential difference between [[Romney–Ryan|Romney]] and his Democratic opponent, President Obama, on the most critical policies: "I've been in this business a long time and believe me there is essentially no difference from one administration to another no matter what the platforms... The foreign policy stays the same, the monetary policy stays the same, there's no proposal for any real cuts and both parties support it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=David|first=Javier|title=Ron Paul won't endorse Romney, cites more of the same|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/49374723|newspaper=CNBC|date=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul received 26,204 write-in votes, or 0.02% of the total cast in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 presidential election results state by state|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G12/President-Details.phtml?n=PAUL,RONALDERON|publisher=The Green Papers|date=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political party identification ==
Throughout his entire tenure in Congress, Paul has represented his district as a member of the Republican Party. However, he has frequently taken positions in direct opposition to the other members and the leadership of the party, and he has sometimes publicly questioned whether he really belonged in the party.

Paul voted for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] for president in 1956 when he was 21 years old.&lt;ref name=DearFrank&gt;[[s:Ron Paul's 1987 Resignation Letter to the RNC]]&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a lifelong supporter of the Republican Party by the time he entered politics in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=DearFrank /&gt; He was one of the first elected officials in the nation to support [[Ronald Reagan]]'s presidential campaign,&lt;ref name=SFC88&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Jerry|title=Libertarian Candidate Rolls Out His Values|journal=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 17, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he actively campaigned for Reagan in 1976 and 1980.&lt;ref name=DMN87&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nichols|first=Bruce|title=Ron Paul Wants to Get Americans Thinking: Republican-Turned-Libertarian Seeks Presidency|journal=Dallas Morning News|date=March 15, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Reagan's election in 1980, Paul quickly became disillusioned with the Reagan administration's policies. He later recalled being the only Republican to vote against Reagan budget proposals in 1981,&lt;ref name=SJMN88&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kutzmann|first=David M.|title=Small Party Battles Big Government Libertarian Candidate Opposes Intrusion into Private Lives|journal=San Jose Mercury News|date=May 24, 1988|page=12A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT88&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=J.

In 1981, Reagan proposed a budget with a $45 billion deficit&amp;nbsp;– which turned out to be $113 billion&amp;nbsp;– and Republicans were cheering his great victory. They were living in a storybook land."&lt;ref name=SFC88 /&gt; He expressed his disgust with the political culture of both major parties in a speech delivered in 1984 upon resigning from the House of Representatives to prepare for a (failed) run for the Senate, and he eventually apologized to his libertarian friends for having supported Reagan.&lt;ref name=SJMN88 /&gt;

{{Wikisource|Ron Paul's 1987 Resignation Letter to the RNC}}
By 1987, Paul was ready to sever all ties to the Republican Party, as he explained in a blistering resignation letter: "Since [1981] Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party have given us skyrocketing deficits, and astoundingly a doubled national debt. How is it that the party of balanced budgets, with control of the White House and Senate, accumulated red ink greater than all previous administrations put together? … There is no credibility left for the Republican Party as a force to reduce the size of government. That is the message of the Reagan years."&lt;ref name=DearFrank /&gt;&lt;ref name=DMN87 /&gt; A month later he announced he would seek the 1988 Libertarian Party nomination for president.

During the 1988 campaign, Paul called Reagan "a dramatic failure"&lt;ref name=DMN87 /&gt; and complained that "Reagan's record is disgraceful. He starts wars, breaks the law, supplies terrorists with guns made at taxpayers' expense and lies about it to the American people."&lt;ref name=PI87&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paolanonio|first=S.A.|title=Libertarian Seeks Presidency Third Party Tries a 5th Campaign|journal=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=September 13, 1987|page=E02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul predicted that "the Republicans are on their way out as a major party,"&lt;ref name=SJMN88 /&gt; and he said that, although registered as a Republican, he had always been a libertarian at heart.&lt;ref name=SJMN88 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT88 /&gt;

Paul returned to his private medical practice and managing several business ventures after losing the 1988 election; but by 1996, he was ready to return to politics, this time running on the Republican Party ticket again. He said that he had never read the entire Libertarian platform when he ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988, and that "I worked for the Libertarians on my terms, not theirs."&lt;ref name=chron96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robison|first=Clay|title=Campaign 96/U.S. House/Paul Favors Repealing Federal Anti-Drug Laws|journal=Houston Chronicle|date=February 15, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that in terms of a political label he preferred to call himself "a constitutionalist. In Congress I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not the (Republican) platform."&lt;ref name=chron96 /&gt;

When he lost the Republican Party presidential primary election in 2008, Paul criticized the two major political parties, saying that there was no real difference between the parties and that neither of them truly intended to challenge the status quo. He refused to endorse the Republican Party's nominee for president, [[John McCain]], and lent his support to third-party candidates instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two-Party 'Charade' Must End, Ron Paul Says|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2008-09-10/politics/paul.endorsement_1_paul-supporters-third-party-candidates-ron-paul-revolution?_s=PM:POLITICS|accessdate=February 1, 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=September 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101141427/http://articles.cnn.com/2008-09-10/politics/paul.endorsement_1_paul-supporters-third-party-candidates-ron-paul-revolution?_s=PM:POLITICS|archivedate=January 1, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=A New Alliance|url=http://www.campaignforliberty.com/blog/?p=582|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923183405/http://www.campaignforliberty.com/blog/?p=582|archivedate=September 23, 2008|accessdate=February 1, 2012|newspaper=Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty|date=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Political positions of Ron Paul}}
[[File:Ronpaul1.jpg|thumb|Paul at the 2007 [[National Right to Life Committee]] Convention in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], June 15, 2007]]

Paul has been described as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]].&lt;ref name=ny /&gt; According to [[University of Georgia]] [[political scientist]] Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voteview.com/Is_John_Kerry_A_Liberal.htm|title=Is John Kerry a Liberal?|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Poole, "Estimating a Basic Space From A Set of Issue Scales," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 42 (July 1998), pp. 954–93.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poole |first=Keith T. |title=Ideological Locations of 2012 Republican Presidential Candidates (Updated January 5, 2012) |url=http://voteview.com/blog/?p=258 |work=Voteview Blog |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121020625/http://voteview.com/blog/?p=258 |archivedate=January 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other analyses have judged Paul much more moderate. The ''[[National Journal]]'', for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=House |first=Billy |title=The Most Conservative Members of the House: Each is a Confirmed Budget Hawk and as a Group They are not above Being a Little Strident |journal=National Journal Daily |date=February 24, 2011 |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/member/daily/the-most-conservative-members-of-the-house-20110224 |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723031856/http://www.nationaljournal.com/member/daily/the-most-conservative-members-of-the-house-20110224 |archivedate=July 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vote Ratings 2010: How Did Your Member of Congress Vote? |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/2010voteratings?person=P000583 |work=National Journal |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216033001/http://www.nationaljournal.com/2010voteratings?person=P000583 |archivedate=February 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Journal''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s analysis gave Paul a 2011 composite ideological rating of 54% liberal and 46% conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/296/ron-paul#.W2tS-9JKiUk|title=Ron Paul's Ratings and Positions|last=|first=|date=|website=votesmart.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of Paul's political philosophy is the conviction that "the proper role for government in America is to provide national defense, a court system for civil disputes, a criminal justice system for acts of force and fraud, and little else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Political Power and the Rule of Law|journal=Texas Straight Talk|date=February 5, 2007|url=http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1106&amp;Itemid=69|accessdate=January 28, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327092107/http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1106&amp;Itemid=69|archivedate=March 27, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has been nicknamed "Dr. No,"&lt;ref name=drno /&gt; reflecting both his medical degree and his insistence that he will "never vote for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution."&lt;ref name=2008bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronpaul2008.com/about/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023173254/http://www.ronpaul2008.com/about/|archivedate=October 23, 2007|title=About Ron Paul|publisher=[[Ron Paul 2008]]|year=2007|accessdate=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defense ===

Paul has advocated for a noninterventionist foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patriotism|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul388.html|work=[[Congressional Record]]|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|author=Paul, Ron|date=May 22, 2007|accessdate=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocates [[American Sovereignty Restoration Act|withdrawal]] from the [[United Nations]], and from the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], for reasons of maintaining strong national sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Ron (January 6, 2009). [https://archive.is/20160410164345/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul500.html "Opportunities for Peace and Nonintervention"]. [[LewRockwell.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] in response to the [[September 11 attacks]], but suggested war alternatives such as authorizing the president to grant [[Letters of Marque and Reprisal]] targeting specific terrorists. An opponent of the [[Iraq War]] and potential war with Iran, he has also criticized [[neoconservatism]] and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, arguing that both inadvertently cause terrorist reprisals against Americans, such as the 9/11 attacks. Paul has stated that "Israel is our close friend" and that it is not the place of the United States to "dictate how Israel runs her affairs".&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20110519007204/en|title=Ron Paul Responds to President Obama's Middle East Speech|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523070454/http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20110519007204/en|archivedate=May 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic ===

Paul endorses [[constitutional right]]s, such as the [[right to keep and bear arms]], and ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for political detainees. He opposes the [[Patriot Act]], federal use of [[Torture and the United States|torture]], [[presidential autonomy]], a [[REAL ID Act|national identification card]], warrantless [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|domestic surveillance]], and [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]]. Paul also believes that the notion of the [[separation of church and state]] is currently misused by the court system: "In case after case, the Supreme Court has used the infamous 'separation of church and state' metaphor to uphold court decisions that allow the federal government to intrude upon and deprive citizens of their religious liberty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Restoring First Amendment Protections of Religion and Religious Speech to the U.S. House of Representatives|url=http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=330&amp;Itemid=60|accessdate=December 8, 2010|date=June 13, 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205072817/http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=330&amp;Itemid=60|archivedate=December 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime within the same month but much after the event of authorities executing a lock-down in sequence to the April 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombing]], Paul commented on the tactics used by governing forces into a harsh criticism that he has written as a "military-style occupation of an American city".&lt;ref name="Camia" /&gt;

=== Economic ===

Paul is a proponent of [[Austrian School]] economics; he has authored six books on the subject, and displays pictures of Austrian School economists [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Murray Rothbard]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]] (as well as of President [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] economist [[Milton Friedman]])&lt;ref name=will&gt;{{cite news|title=A Cheerful Anachronism|url=http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=177422&amp;Disp=41&amp;Trace=on|authorlink=George Will|last=Will|first=George F|date=February 18, 2007|accessdate=March 17, 2008|work=[[Newsweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his office wall. He regularly votes against almost all proposals for new government spending, initiatives, or taxes;&lt;ref name=saynot&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800966_2.html|title=Congressman Paul's Legislative Strategy?

He endorses eliminating most [[Government agencies#Government agencies in the United States|federal government agencies]], terming them unnecessary bureaucracies.

On April 15, 2011, Paul was one of four Republican members of Congress to vote against Rep. [[Paul Ryan]]'s budget proposal, known as "[[The Path to Prosperity]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll277.xml|title=Final vote results for roll call 277|publisher=Clerk of the House of Representatives|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul has consistently warned of [[hyperinflation]] and called for the [[gold standard]] as far back as 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Five Myths About the Gold Standard, Congressman Ron Paul, Congressional Record. 97th Congress, First Session. Volume 127, Part II. February 23, 1981.

He endorses [[free trade]], rejecting membership in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[World Trade Organization]] as "managed trade".

=== Environmental ===

As a [[free-market environmentalist]], he asserts [[private property]] rights in relation to environmental protection and pollution prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JknlzNNnLAo "Texas Straight Talk (01/06/2012)."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228155149/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JknlzNNnLAo |date=February 28, 2016 }} Accessed February 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He called [[global warming]] a hoax in a 2009 [[Fox Business]] interview, saying, "You know, the greatest hoax I think that has been around in many, many years if not hundreds of years has been this hoax on the environment and global warming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title= | network=Fox Business Network | airdate=November 4, 2009 | minutes=7 | credits=Anchor: David Asman | series=America's Nightly Scoreboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledges there is clear evidence of rising temperatures in some parts of the globe, but says that temperatures are cooling in other parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronpaul.com/on-the-issues/global-warming |title=On the Issues: Global Warming |publisher=: |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===

Paul has stated that "The government shouldn't be in the medical business." He pushes to eliminate federal involvement with and management of [[Health care in the United States|health care]], which he argues would allow prices to decrease due to the fundamental dynamics of a free market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul, Ron|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul175.html|title=Free market Medicine|publisher=LewRockwell.com|date=May 5, 2004|accessdate=November 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposes federal government influenza [[inoculation]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Arthur (April 30, 2009) [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/04/ron-paul-swine-flu-federal-government.html "Ron Paul pooh-poohs swine flu; yet another grab for more Fed control!"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408205818/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/04/ron-paul-swine-flu-federal-government.html |date=April 8, 2016 }}, ''L.A.

=== Secession ===

Paul has stated that [[secession]] from the United States "is a deeply American principle" and that "If the possibility of secession is completely off the table there is nothing to stop the federal government from continuing to encroach on our liberties and no recourse for those who are sick and tired of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Ron Paul: 'Secession is a deeply American principle{{'-}}|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/84058.html|newspaper=Politico|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul wrote the remarks in a post on his Congressional website in one of his final public statements as a member of Congress, noting that [[2012 state petitions for secession|many petitions]] had been submitted to the White House calling for secession in the wake of the November 2012 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Ron|title=Secession: Are we free to go?|journal=Texas Straight Talk|date=November 19, 2012|url=http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2029&amp;Itemid=69|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212032655/http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2029&amp;Itemid=69|archivedate=December 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendments]], Paul advocates [[states' rights]] to decide how to regulate social matters not cited directly by the Constitution.

Paul was critical of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], arguing that it sanctioned federal interference in the labor market and did not improve [[race relations]]. He once remarked: "The Civil Rights Act of 1964 not only violated the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and reduced individual liberty; it also failed to achieve its stated goals of promoting racial harmony and a color-blind society".&lt;ref name=cr1964&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul|first1=Ron|title=The Trouble With the '64 Civil Rights Act|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/07/ron-paul/the-trouble-with-the-64-civil-rights-act/|website=LewRockwell.com|publisher=Ron Paul|accessdate=November 14, 2015|ref=cr1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul opposes [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/issues/candidates/ron-paul/#affirmative-action |title=Ron Paul on the Issues |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=December 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220182530/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/issues/candidates/ron-paul/ |archivedate=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
=== Newsletters controversy ===
{{Main|Ron Paul newsletters}}
Beginning in 1978, for more than two decades Paul and his associates published a number of political and investment-oriented newsletters bearing his name (''Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report'', ''The Ron Paul Survival Report'', the ''Ron Paul Investment Letter'', and the ''Ron Paul Political Report'').&lt;ref name=sanchez-weigel/&gt;

A number of the newsletters, particularly in the period between 1988 and 1994 when Paul was no longer in Congress, contained material that later proved controversial. Topics included conspiracy theories, anti-government militia movements, and race wars.&lt;ref name= TNR120117&gt;{{cite news|last= Kirchick|first= James|title= More Selections from Ron Paul's Newsletters|url = http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/99666/ron-paul-newsletters-part-two?page=0,1 |accessdate=February 17, 2012 | newspaper =The New Republic |date= January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Paul's 1996 congressional election campaign, and his 2008 and 2012 presidential primary campaigns, critics charged that some of the passages reflected racist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic bigotry.&lt;ref name=drno /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chron96&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Alan|title= Newsletter Excerpts Offer Ammunition to Paul's Opponent/GOP Hopeful Quoted on Race, Crime| url= http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1996_1343749/campaign-96-u-s-house-newsletter-excerpts-offer-am.html | accessdate = February 17, 2012 | newspaper = Houston Chronicle|date=May 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMN96&gt;{{cite journal|last = Camia |first = Catalina |title = Candidate's Comments on Blacks Questioned|journal=Dallas Morning News|date = May 22, 1996 |page = 8A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Old Issue Causing New Problem for Ron Paul|url= http://blog.chron.com/rickperry/2011/12/old-issue-causing-new-problem-for-ron-paul/ |accessdate=February 17, 2012|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date= December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1996 interview, Paul did not deny writing the newsletters and defended some of their contents, but specified that he opposes racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Legum |first=Judd |url=http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/12/27/395391/fact-check-ron-paul-personally-defended-racist-newsletters/ |title=Fact Check: Ron Paul Personally Defended Racist Newsletters |publisher=ThinkProgress.org |date=December 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/26/ron-paul-newsletters-swiftness-of-black-men_n_1169990.html |title=Ron Paul, In 1996, 'Did Not Deny' Controversial Statement In Newsletter |work=Huffington Post |date=December 26, 2011 |accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512114222/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 12, 2007 |title=Newsletter excerpts offer ammunition to Paul's opponent |accessdate= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2001, Paul said he did not write the commentaries, but stopped short of denying authorship in 1996 because his campaign advisers had thought it would be too confusing and that he had to live with the material published under his name.&lt;ref name=TM&gt;{{cite news|last=Gwynne|first=S.

Rockwell denied responsibility for the content.&lt;ref name=sanchez-weigel/&gt; In 2011, Paul's spokesperson [[Jesse Benton]] said Paul had "taken moral responsibility because they appeared under his name and slipped through under his watch."&lt;ref name="Jackie"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kucinich |first=Jackie |title=Paul's story changes on racial comments |work=USA Today |date=December 12, 2011 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-12-21/ron-paul-racist-newsletters/52147878/1 |accessdate=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-congressional career ==
In April 2013, Paul founded the [[Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity]], a foreign policy [[think tank]] that seeks to promote his non-interventionist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Grace|last=Wyler|title=Ron Paul Is Launching His Own Foreign Policy Institute|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ron-paul-foreign-policy-institute-2013-4|accessdate=May 12, 2013|newspaper=BusinessInsider.com|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is part of his larger foundation [[Foundation for Rational Economics and Education]].

In the same month, he began to offer the ''Ron Paul Curriculum'', a homeschool online curriculum developed by [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] and taught from a "free market and Christian" perspective; it is free from grades [[kindergarten]]–5 and available to paid members from 6–12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ron Paul launches libertarian-edged home school curriculum|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/08/ron-paul-starts-libertarian-minded-money-back-guaranteed-home-school-program/|newspaper=Fox News|date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Paul criticized the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|NSA surveillance program]] and praised [[Edward Snowden]] for having performed a "great service to the American people by exposing the truth about what our government is doing in secret".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rachel|last=Weiner|title=Ron Paul praises Edward Snowden|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/10/ron-paul-praises-edward-snowden/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2017, Paul predicted the markets would lower during the year and said President Trump had taken a risk with crediting himself for the postelection market surge, reasoning Washington was still predominantly unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/29/ron-paul-the-euphoria-in-the-markets-has-passed.html|title=Ron Paul: The 'euphoria' in the markets has passed|first=Anna|last=Pei|publisher=CNBC|date=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul has been a critic of Donald Trump's plans to increase the number of military personnel in Afghanistan. In August 2017, he said that Americans don't see Afghanistan as a threat to their personal security and being aggressive in foreign policy only loses Trump some of his support base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/400571-ron-paul-trump-afghanistan-disaster/|title='Recipe for disaster': Ron Paul to RT about Trump's Afghanistan policy turn|publisher=''RT''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul has also called for Trump to bring American troops back from Syria in April 2018, on the grounds that the threat from ISIS has been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/05/ron-paul-bring-troops-home-syria-now-editorials-debates/33584443/|title=Ron Paul: Bring troops home from Syria now|publisher=''USA Today''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ron Paul Channel ===
In 2013, Paul established the "Ron Paul Channel", an Internet broadcast. Its slogan is "Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ronpaulchannel.com/ Ron Paul Channel] {{Registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about the channel, Paul said, "I was at a debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's something wrong with the media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there's a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, "They don't sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wing|first=Nick|title='The Ron Paul Channel' Launching This Summer, Wants You To 'Turn Off Your TV,' 'Turn On The Truth'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/the-ron-paul-channel_n_3569249.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Ron Paul ended all relationships with the ''Voices of Liberty'' and the Ron Paul Channel to start a new internet broadcast called the Ron Paul Liberty Report. According to Paul himself, it will not cost a thing, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, "But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe we can do better. Right now, the program has changed to the ''Ron Paul Liberty Report'', and that is what we do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news." Paul went on to say that it will be more locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforliberty.org/ron-paul-ends-relationship-voices-liberty-start-new-venture|title=Ron Paul Ends Relationship with Voices of Liberty – Campaign for Liberty|date=|work=Campaign for Liberty|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spokesman for Stansberry Research ===
In April 2015, Paul began appearing in [[infomercial]]s warning about an upcoming financial meltdown as a result of the imminent crash of the world's currencies.&lt;ref name=apocalypse&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moody|first1=Chris|title=Ron Paul's apocalypse is now|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/06/politics/rand-paul-ron-paul-election-2016/|accessdate=September 22, 2015|publisher=CNN|date=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Crisis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hook|first1=Janet|title=Ron Paul Ads Warn of Financial Crisis|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ron-paul-ads-warn-of-financial-crisis-1432245027|accessdate=September 22, 2015|publisher=WSJ|date=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He urges listeners to read ''America 2020: The Survival Blueprint'', a book written by [[Porter Stansberry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/06/politics/rand-paul-ron-paul-election-2016/index.html|title=Ron Paul's apocalypse is now|author=Chris Moody|publisher=''CNN''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Lublinski''' (February 18, 1868 - December 26, 1910) was a  Berlin-based writer, literary historian, critic, and [[Philosophy of religion|philosopher of religion]]. He was a pioneer of the socio-historical study of literary movements and a major contributor to the debates about German-Jewish national and cultural identity of the era.

==Life==

Lublinski was born in Johannisburg, East Prussia (now [[Pisz]], Poland). He came from a secular German Jewish family, and was the son of a businessman. He studied at several schools in [[Königsberg]], but was repeatedly forced to leave because of his argumentative character.&lt;ref name = bio&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd118574698.html "Lublinski, Samuel Pseudonym Salomo Liebhardt, Silvio Peregrinus, Sylvester", Deutsche Biographie]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, he moved to Verona to work for the bookseller [[Leo Olschki]]. Lublinski later moved to Venice. In 1892 he returned to Germany and set up independently as a bookseller in Heidelberg, but in 1895 finally abandoned his profession to become a full-time writer. From 1895 he moved to Berlin, becoming a journalist and essayist on numerous topics. His first book was ''Jewish characters in Grillparzer, Hebbel and Otto Ludwig'' (1899). His first truly important work was the four volume ''Litteratur und Gesellschaft'' (Literature and Society) (1899/1900), which examines the origin and development of Romanticism in German literature, and explores the social and cultural context in which it came into being. It is considered the first "sociological" account of literature in Germany. He followed this with ''Die Bilanz der Moderne'' (1904) and ''Der Ausgang der Moderne'' (1909), which articulated his personal views of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] and [[neo-romanticism]].&lt;ref name = bio/&gt;

Lublinski subsequently tried his hand as a playwright, but was not successful. Of his six plays only the last, ''Kaiser und Kanzler'' (1910) was ever produced - in 1913, three years after his death. One of the others, ''Gunther und Brunhild'', is an alternative take on the [[Niebelungenlied]] in which the conflict between the main characters becomes a psychological drama.&lt;ref name = bio/&gt;

Lublinski was also a proponent of the [[Christ myth theory]], the denial of the historical existence of [[Jesus]]. In his last years he researched his unfinished project ''Der urchristliche Erdkreis und sein Mythus'', publishing a series of booklets and essays in 1910 in which he argued that Christianity emerged from a fusion of late Judaism with Oriental and Hellenistic mystery cults.&lt;ref name = bio/&gt; He also denied the historicity of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Kampmeier, A. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/opencourt28_694caru#page/186/mode/2up ''The Unhistoricity of Paul'']. ''[[The Open Court (journal)|The Open Court]]'' 28 (3): 186-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zionism and feuds==
Lublinski was initially a staunch supporter of Zionism and was a regular contributor to [[Theodor Herzl]]'s periodical ''[[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]]'' using the pseudonym Solomon Liebhardt. However, he later withdrew from the journal when he came to identify more as "a German than a thoroughbred Jew"; he felt himself to be German "from psychological force", not merely from "theoretical conviction". As a result, he believed that he could not identify with any other nationality. He remained a supporter of Zionism, but believed that he could never go to live in Palestine himself. In letters to Herzl written in May 1899  he explained his position, asserting that he did not want to fully assimmilate into German identity, but could not imagine himself owing alliegance to another nation. After 1901, however, he argued for full assimilation of German Jews.&lt;ref name = bio/&gt;

Lublinski became embroiled in several literary and intellectual feuds, particularly about claims of writers to priority in various fields. The biggest feud was with [[Theodor Lessing]], progenitor of the concept of "self-hating" Jews, who published an extremely sharp satire on Lublinski, starting with derisory comments about his "little beautiful" appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Lessing: Samuel zieht die Bilanz und Tomi melkt die Moralkuh oder Zweier Könige Sturz. Eine Warnung für Deutsche, Satiren zu schreiben. Von Theodor Lessing. Mit Literarischen Beiträgen von Thomas Mann, Samuel Lublinski und den vierzig sittlichsten deutschen Dichtern und Denkern. Verlag des Antirüpel, Hannover 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The attack led to an equally sharply worded response from [[Thomas Mann]], creating a literary scandal in 1910.&lt;ref name = bio/&gt;

Lublinski was working on a new play about [[Cola di Rienzo|Rienzi]] and various other projects when he died suddenly on 26 December 1910 while staying with his sister in Weimar.&lt;ref name = bio/&gt;

'''Septimiu Albini''' (June 9, 1861 – November 7, 1919) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Imperial Austrian]]-born [[Romania]]n journalist and political activist. A native of [[Transylvania]], he attended the [[University of Vienna]], where he was active in the local affiliate of ''[[Junimea]]'' society. Invited by [[Ioan Slavici]], he settled in [[Sibiu]] in 1886, where he edited ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' newspaper and delved into political journalism for the following eight years. The period was marked by several stays in prison for press infractions. His time there came to an abrupt end in 1894, when he was sentenced to prison for having signed the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]]. Rather than undergo further incarceration, Albini fled to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], where he lived in relative obscurity.

==Biography==
===Origins and education===
Born in [[Șpring]], [[Alba County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region, Septimiu Albini was the first of two sons born to Vasile Albini, a former vice-tribune in the legion of [[Axente Sever]] during the [[Transylvanian Revolution of 1848|Transylvanian Revolution of 1848–1849]]; and to Emilia Neagoe, a niece of [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church|Greek-Catholic]] [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Alexandru Sterca-Șuluțiu]]. His father played an important role in Albini's intellectual development, telling stories about the events of 1848. The effort to imbue the son with patriotism began early: when the infant was forty days old, Vasile Albini symbolically dedicated him to [[Michael the Brave]].&lt;ref name="r43"/&gt; His childhood was spent in nearby [[Cut, Alba|Cut]], where the family originated.&lt;ref name="r12"&gt;Rușeț 2014, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He attended secondary school at [[Inochentie Micu Clain National College|the Romanian high school]] in [[Blaj]] and [[Samuel von Brukenthal National College|the German high school]] in [[Sibiu]], and although this environment exposed him to Latinist principles, he entered into contact with ''[[Junimea|Junimist]]'' ideas by reading ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' and soon subscribed to the society's principles.&lt;ref name="r43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p224"&gt;Popovici, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in poetry readings at the home of [[Visarion Roman]], his future father-in-law.&lt;ref name="p224"/&gt; He received a degree from Blaj.&lt;ref name="r12"/&gt;

Then, from 1879 to 1883, he attended the literature and philosophy faculty of the [[University of Vienna]] on a scholarship from ''Junimea'', based in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] city of [[Iași]]. He entered ''România Jună'' Society,&lt;ref name="r43"/&gt; while there, he advocated for a phonetic spelling of Romanian, following the lead of [[Titu Maiorescu]] and standing in opposition to the etymological approach of his former teacher [[Timotei Cipariu]].&lt;ref name="buzasi"/&gt; In later years, he would remember the friendship he developed at Vienna with a fellow Romanian student, Ioan Paul; the two would attend society meetings together and spend much of their free time discussing literature.&lt;ref name="r43"&gt;Rușeț 2013, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, wishing to chart a new course, the society members founded a literary club, "Arborele", with fourteen or seventeen participants. These selected assumed names; Albini was ''Mugur'' or "bud", a name with which he also signed literary work. He took part in festive meetings honoring ''Junimea''.&lt;ref name="r44"&gt;Rușeț 2013, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tribuna'' years===
After graduating, Albini found himself unwilling to emigrate to the Old Kingdom, like some of his classmates, and instead returned to Cut. In the subsequent period, he spent a good part of his time administering the family property, but also wrote articles and sent them to ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' newspaper in Sibiu. In 1886, [[Ioan Slavici]], the director of ''Tribuna'', invited Albini to Sibiu in order to become editor.&lt;ref name="r42"/&gt; Not only did the elder man appreciate Albini's writing and attachment to ''Tribunist'' principles, he had also decided upon founding the newspaper that a certain number of its staff, invariably including the editor, would be Greek-Catholics.&lt;ref name="p224"/&gt; Albini accepted on condition he be allowed to apply for a post for the 1886–1887 school year as teacher at the local [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|Astra]] girls' school. He embraced the newspaper's cultural views, but was not especially interested in politics at that point. In the summer of 1886, he was hired for the school job, working there until 1888.&lt;ref name="r42"/&gt; Hired as principal the previous year, he resigned due to differences with the Astra leadership.&lt;ref name="r12"/&gt; While at the school, he taught Romanian language, history and geography of Hungary; the position allowed him to promote emerging ideas and a love for rural Transylvanian values.&lt;ref name="r44"/&gt; He was a member of the [[Romanian National Party]], rising to become its secretary,&lt;ref name="r42"&gt;Rușeț 2013, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and joining its leadership committee in early 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elite-research.eu/Catalogue%20Hungary%201881-1918.pdf "The structure of the Central Electoral Committees of the Romanian National Party from Transylvania and Hungary (1881–1918)"], The Political Elite from Transylvania (1867–1918) project site&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1891, he took part in the first congress of the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]].&lt;ref name="r13"&gt;Rușeț 2014, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1888 to 1894, Albini was director and editor of ''Tribuna''; the position had become vacant following Slavici's sentencing to a year's imprisonment.&lt;ref name="p226"&gt;Popovici, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; In this position, he was deeply involved in cultural affairs,&lt;ref name="r445"/&gt; and contributed two rural-themed short stories to the newspaper, "O seară la Brustureni" and "Un sărac avut". Additionally, "Un nou filoromân" is a polemic directed against a book by an obscure Hungarian writer, Sándor Lengyel, that Albini considered defamatory toward the peasants of the [[Apuseni Mountains]].&lt;ref name="buzasi"/&gt; However, he increasingly became enmeshed in political and national matters as well. This side of his activity saw Albini charged in several press trials, leading to his incarceration in [[Cluj]] for a month in 1889 and for six months at [[Vác]] in 1890–1891. In 1893, just after becoming engaged, he spent three months in the prison at [[Szeged]].&lt;ref name="r445"/&gt; As a signer of the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]], he was put on trial. His health weakened following the winter prison stay at Szeged, he could not attend the May 1894 sentencing, and instead waited until October to learn of the two and a half years' sentence. The state of his health, combined with the fact that he was recently married and had a newborn son, and was still a young man, led Albini to flee to Romania and avoid punishment. Another contributing factor was likely the letter of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], head of Romania's [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], urging those sentenced not to accept the verdict and instead continue their struggle out of the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref name="p222"&gt;Popovici, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; His "desertion" was strongly condemned by fellow signatories who served their sentences, including by ''Tribuna'' colleagues,&lt;ref name="p222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r445"/&gt; but Albini justified his action through articles published there.&lt;ref name="r445"&gt;Rușeț 2013, pp. 44–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile and legacy===
In Romania, Albini initially experienced a period of material difficulties, eventually finding work as a secretary at the [[Romanian Academy]], remaining there until 1918.&lt;ref name="r45"/&gt; He also functioned as a schoolteacher during this period.&lt;ref name="buzasi"/&gt; His actions in Transylvania's Romanian national movement became peripheral, taking the form of occasional press articles or brochures.&lt;ref name="r45"&gt;Rușeț 2013, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, he went to [[Czernowitz]] as a delegate of the Academy, returning with eleven crates of material for [[Sextil Pușcariu]]'s dictionary of the Romanian language.&lt;ref name="r13"/&gt; He left behind eight partly unpublished manuscripts, of which six dealt with politics. These are generally of mediocre value to historians, although his unfinished memoir about the ''Tribuna'' period offers valuable first-hand insights about how the newspaper functioned.&lt;ref&gt;Rușeț 2014, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Albini married Aurelia Roman in February 1894; the marriage sponsor was [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]].&lt;ref name="r13"/&gt; The couple had three sons; the eldest was killed in the [[Battle of Mărășești]]. In 1919, following the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]], he returned to his native region for the first time since emigrating, visiting the places where he grew up. Shortly thereafter, he died of pneumonia and was buried at Cut alongside family members.&lt;ref name="r45"/&gt; In 1998, Ilie Moise published a collection of Albini's literary and pedagogical writings. Gathering nearly all his work for ''Tribuna'', the first section includes the two short stories, seen as precursors to the prose of [[Ion Agârbiceanu]] and [[Pavel Dan]], as well as history, literary criticism and folklore studies. Notable in the latter category is "Din seara de Crăciun", which looks in detail at the practice of Christmas caroling. The second includes his reflections on education, including an insistence on teaching in the Romanian language.&lt;ref name="buzasi"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Buzași, [http://www.romlit.ro/septimiu_albini "Septimiu Albini"], in ''România Literară'', nr. 15/1999&lt;/ref&gt; A second volume encompassing his ''Tribuna'' memoir, a short monograph on the ''Transilvania'' society and various political commentaries appeared in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Morariu, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; The primary school in Cut is named after Albini and features a medallion with his likeness, while a statue of him stands before the local mayor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.sebesinfo.ro/cutul-se-mandreste-cu-septimiu-albini-4931.html "Cutul se mândrește cu Septimiu Albini"], ''Sebeș Info'', October 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ted Andrews''' (July 15, 1952&amp;nbsp;– October 24, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dispatch/obituary.aspx?pid=135226018|title=Ted A. Andrews Obituary: View Ted Andrews's Obituary by The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American author and teacher of [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices who claimed to be [[clairvoyant]]. His book on animals as spirit guides and symbols, ''Animal Speak'', sold almost 500,000 copies from 1993 to 2009; the influential [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn]]-published book is widely cited by others.&lt;ref name=Weschcke&gt;{{cite web |last=Weschcke |first=Carl Llewellyn |authorlink=Carl L. Weschcke |title=Blessed Be, Ted |date=October 28, 2009 |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Andrews was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]]; he had six siblings all of whom were given names beginning with the letter 'T'. He spent most of his childhood at the east of Dayton in the city called [[Beavercreek, Ohio|Beavercreek]].&lt;ref name=DaytonDailyMemorial&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/memorial-service-set-for-celebrated-author/nM8dZ/ |title=Memorial service set for celebrated author |date=January 28, 2010 |last=Huffman |first=Dale |newspaper=Dayton Daily News }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to experience clairvoyance, by seeing things that adults could not. He spent a lot of time walking through the woods with his grandfather, learning about nature. Andrews worked at [[Brukner Nature Center]] north of Dayton in[[Troy, Ohio|Troy]] as a trail guide and animal keeper.&lt;ref name=HarmonyInterview&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.harmonychannel.com/magazine-articles/general-articles/interview-with-ted-andrews.html |title=Interview with Ted Andrews |journal=Harmony Channel |first=Edie |last=Weinstein-Moser |accessdate=July 1, 2013}} Reprint.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrews also read voraciously from the public library. A book of short stories sparked Andrews' interest in Jewish mysticism and in [[practical Kabbalah]]—the fictional story featured a group of Jewish mystics who used the Kabbalah to create a [[golem]] of mud to fight the Nazis.&lt;ref name=LearnedQabala&gt;{{cite web |last=Andrews |first=Ted |title=How I Learned Qabala |date= |work=The Llewellyn Journal |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Andrews graduated from [[Carroll High School (Dayton, Ohio)|Carroll High School]] in Dayton, a private Catholic school.&lt;ref name="DaytonDailyMemorial"/&gt;

==Career==
Andrews worked for 10&amp;nbsp;years with the [[Cincinnati Public Schools]] as a teacher and counselor, including 7&amp;nbsp;years helping children with special needs.&lt;ref name=DaytonDailyMemorial/&gt; When he and the other teachers at his [[junior high school]] were each required to form a club for the students, he started an "ESP Club".&lt;ref name=HarmonyInterview/&gt;

Andrews read about the occult, mysticism and metaphysics. In 1987 through [[Llewellyn Publications]], he produced his first book, ''Simplified Magic: A Beginner’s Guide to the New Age Qabala'', a guide to practical Kabbalah which was later reprinted as ''Simplified Qabala Magic''.&lt;ref name=Weschcke/&gt;&lt;ref name=LearnedQabala/&gt; In 1991, he wrote ''How to See and Read the Aura'', in which he says that "the aura is the energy field that surrounds all matter. Anything that has an atomic structure will have an aura..."&lt;ref name=Albanese2000&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Aura of Wellness: Subtle-Energy Healing and New Age Religion |first=Catherine L. |last=Albanese |pages=30–31 |jstor=1123890 |journal=Religion and American Culture: A Journal of Interpretation |volume=10 |number=1 |date=Winter 2000 |doi=10.2307/1123890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews wrote that the aura is a proven scientific phenomenon which can not only be viewed by humans but also manipulated using metaphysical practices such as the Jewish Kabbalah and the Indian [[pranayama]].&lt;ref name=Albanese2000/&gt;

In September 1993, Andrews published what would be his most successful book: ''Animal Speak: The Spiritual &amp; Magical Powers of Creatures Great and Small''.&lt;ref name=Weschcke/&gt; This book claimed to help the reader recognize which animal was their personal totem or spirit guide. It has been cited by researchers studying human attitudes toward animals, including professor Marian Scholtmeijer of the [[University of Northern British Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Animals and spirituality: A skeptical animal rights advocate examines literary approaches to the subject |journal=Lit: Literature Interpretation Theory |first=Marian |last=Scholtmeijer |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1999 |volume=10 |number=4 |pages=371–394 |doi=10.1080/10436920008580253}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor David Starr-Glass of [[Empire State College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exploring Organizational Culture: Teaching Notes on Metaphor, Totem, and Archetypal Images |journal=Journal of Management Education |first=David |last=Starr-Glass |doi=10.1177/1052562903252636 |date=June 2004 |volume=28 |number=3 |pages=356–371 |url=http://jme.sagepub.com/content/28/3/356.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; and doctoral candidate Venetia Laura Delano Robertson.&lt;ref name=Robertson2013&gt;{{cite journal |first=Venetia Laura Delano |last=Robertson |title=The Beast Within: Anthrozoomorphic Identity and Alternative Spirituality in the Online Therianthropy Movement |journal=Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions |date=February 2013 |volume=16 |number=3 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=13–14 |jstor=10.1525/nr.2013.16.3.7 |doi=10.1525/nr.2013.16.3.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson wrote that Andrews was a typical example of "white shamanism" in that he followed French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]]'s assertion that [[totemism]] lets the practitioner "participate in the nature of the totem animal" to connect with the sacred core of human-as-animal.&lt;ref name=Robertson2013/&gt; Andrews wrote, "when we learn to speak with the animals, to listen with animal ears and to see through animal eyes, we experience the phenomena, the power, and the potential of human essence."&lt;ref name=Robertson2013/&gt; ''Animal Speak'' sold almost 500,000 copies from 1992 to 2009.&lt;ref name=Weschcke/&gt;

==Death==
Andrews volunteered for some years at the [[Aullwood Audubon Center and Farm]], working especially with [[Bird of prey|raptors]]. Later, he lived with his wife, emergency room nurse Kathy Andrews, on a farm and animal rehabilitation center in [[Jackson, Tennessee]]. He died there of cancer on October 24, 2009. A memorial service was held in Beavercreek on January 30, 2010.&lt;ref name=DaytonDailyMemorial/&gt;

'''Atiim Kiambu''' "'''Tiki'''" '''Barber'''&lt;ref name="Football Reference"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BarbTi00.htm|title=Tiki Barber Stats - Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|iː|k|i}}; born April 7, 1975) is a former [[American football]] [[running back]] who played for the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for ten seasons. He played [[college football]] for the [[Virginia Cavaliers football|University of Virginia]]. Barber was drafted by the Giants in the second round of the [[1997 NFL Draft]], and played his entire professional career for them. Barber retired from the NFL at the end of the 2006 NFL postseason as the Giants' all-time rushing and reception leader.  Barber was inducted into the [[Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and Museum|Virginia Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2011.

Following his playing career, Barber became a national media presence, notably joining [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Today Show]]'' as a correspondent in 2007  and ''[[Football Night in America]]/[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;Associated Press. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2763247 Barber to appear on 'Today,' NBC football] ''ESPN.com'', February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has published multiple books.

He is the [[identical twin]] brother of former [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] cornerback [[Ronde Barber]].

==College career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2017}}
Barber attended the University of Virginia on an academic scholarship to major in business. While he maintained his focus on his studies, Barber also became an accomplished college athlete; he broke the University of Virginia's long jump record on his first jump, and put the University of Virginia's football program back on the map. He finished his college career with 651 carries for 3,389 yards with and 31 touchdowns, and 64 receptions for 602 yards with 2 touchdowns.

==NFL career==
Originally he was considered a third-down, "change of pace" back, Barber became a standout starting running back and the all-time leader in rushing yards in [[New York Giants]] history. In 2005, he was the NFL's top yardage gainer from the line of scrimmage. He was voted by his peers to three [[Pro Bowls]]. From 2003-2006, Tiki Barber gained the most yards from scrimmage by any NFL running back in that 4-year period.

===1997–1999===
Barber was drafted by the New York Giants in the 2nd round of the [[1997 NFL Draft]] out of the [[University of Virginia]]. He was originally intended to be a third-down running back until [[Rodney Hampton]] had disappointing years in 1996 and 1997. Hampton retired after the 1997 season, giving Barber the starting nod. He began his career with a mediocre rookie campaign in which he started at running back and ran for 511 yards and 3 touchdowns. He missed four games with a knee injury, but returned to the starting lineup for the final two games of the year. In 1998, he was replaced as a starter and went through a disappointing, injury-riddled year before rebounding in 1999 when he accumulated 1,639 all-purpose yards, utilizing his punt return and receiving skills.

===2000–2004===
Tiki Barber and the Giants represented the NFC in [[Super Bowl XXXV]] in 2001 but lost the game to the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Established as a starter and playmaker, Barber was rewarded with a six-year contract from the Giants following the 2000 season. Following the signing, he called himself "the happiest man in New York right now."

Over the next four years Barber would become an integral part of the Giants' offense. In the last regular season game of 2002, Tiki exploded for 203 yards against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], at that time one of the league's best defenses. His performance helped the Giants clinch a playoff berth, but the team fell to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in the wild-card round. He ended the season with 1,984 yards from scrimmage.

The [[2003 NFL season]] saw the Giants finish an abysmal 4-12.
During the [[2004 NFL season]], Barber reached the endzone for a career-high 15 touchdowns. He also rushed for 1,518 yards and notched 578 receiving yards for 2,096 total yards from scrimmage. On January 2, 2005, in the 2004 season finale at home versus the Dallas Cowboys, Tiki broke [[Rodney Hampton]]'s Giants' all-time rushing record and [[Joe Morris (Football Player)|Joe Morris]]'s single-season rushing record in the same game. Poignantly, Barber broke the record on the final offensive play of the game, when he scored a game-winning touchdown to end an otherwise dismal 6-10 season for the Giants on a high point.

===2005 season===
2005 was a rebound year for the Giants and Barber's career year in terms of rushing yards. Led by [[Eli Manning]] and Barber, they finished 11-5 and won the NFC East title for the first time since 2000. On December 17, 2005, Barber broke the Giants' single-game rushing record against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], rushing for 220 yards; he would break his own record the following year. It was his second (of three) 200-yard rushing games during the 2005 season, as he ran for 206 yards in week 8. The Giants promptly shut out the [[Washington Redskins]] 36-0 two days after [[Wellington Mara]] was buried, proper homage to their beloved owner, to whom Tiki himself was especially close.

He finished the 2005 regular season with 1,860 rushing yards (second in the league to [[Shaun Alexander]] and a career-high for Barber) and 2,390 all-purpose yards with a performance of 203 rushing yards against the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the final game of the season. Barber's 95-yard touchdown run set a Giants' team record for longest touchdown run, previously held by [[Hap Moran]] for a 91-yard run on November 23, 1930 vs the [[Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giants.com/team/player.asp?player_id=4 Tiki Barber] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208162915/http://www.giants.com/team/player.asp?player_id=4 |date=2006-12-08 }}, NYGiants.com. Retrieved January 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

His 960 yards from scrimmage in December 2005 was an NFL record until it was broken by [[Chris Johnson (running back)|Chris Johnson]], who had 968 from scrimmage in November 2009.

The season ended prematurely, as the Giants were shut out 23-0 to the [[Carolina Panthers]] in the wild-card round of the playoffs.

Barber's 2,390 total yards for 2005 was second highest in NFL history, at the time, behind [[Marshall Faulk]]'s 2,429 total yards in 1999. It is also the highest total for a running back 30 years of age or older. He was named to the NFC Pro Bowl squad for the second time in his career, and was voted an All Pro. Barber placed fourth in the voting for the 2005 [[NFL MVP|MVP]] award. [[Seattle Seahawks]] running back [[Shaun Alexander]] won the Award, followed by [[Peyton Manning]] (second place) and [[Tom Brady]] (third place).

He was nominated for the 2005 [[FedEx]] Ground Player of the Year Award, along with [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] and [[Shaun Alexander]]. Barber also signed a contract extension in September 2005 which extended his contract through 2008 and increased his pay.

===2006 season===
In the 2006 season, Barber continued his fine play in his final season and final games as an NFL player, a rarity for running backs who often break down late in their careers. His total yardage on the season was higher than any other running back in history in their last season.

Barber rushed for 1,662 yards and five touchdowns in his 2006 campaign. During week 14 at Carolina, Barber rushed for 112 yards to help the Giants end a four-game losing skid. Tiki's best game in 2006 was in Week 17 at Washington, where he rushed for 234 yards and 3 touchdowns in the Giants 34-28 victory against the Redskins, a win that gave the Giants a playoff berth. In that game, Tiki set a new team record for rushing yards in a single game by breaking his own record, which he had set the previous year versus Kansas City.  His 234 rushing yards are the most ever by a player over 30 years old. He also holds the record for most 200-yard rushing games by a player over 30 years old with four. Only three other players have one.

In his final game with the Giants, a playoff loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], Barber rushed for 137 yards on 26 carries. After the game, Eagles safety [[Brian Dawkins]] embraced Barber and told him, "You're a warrior."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Santoliquito|Santoliquito, Joseph]], [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs06/news/story?id=2723790 Barber ready to move on], ESPN.com. Retrieved January 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Pro Bowler in his final season, Barber's last official game was the [[2007 Pro Bowl]] on February 10, 2007 in Hawaii.

===NFL retirement===
In October 2006, Barber revealed his intention to retire at the end of the 2006 NFL season. Barber had previously indicated his desire to retire at some point and pursue a broadcasting career. When questioned why a player at the peak of his game would retire, Barber cited the toll the physical nature of football takes on a person's body and that he “simply couldn’t take it anymore”. Tiki was highly  critiqued for his decision to retire at his prime.  He declined a reported 50 million dollar / 2 year contract with the New York Giants. 

During his career with the Giants, the team never won a championship, a top goal of Barber's that he spoke publicly about in 2005.  When announcing his retirement, Barber seemed at peace to leave the game without a Super Bowl ring.  He said, "I used to think my career was defined by not winning a Super Bowl.  But I think looking back on my career, they'll see someone who was a competitor, someone who always played hard and never gave up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs06/news/story?id=2723790 |title=Barber ready to move on |accessdate=February 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   He officially filed his retirement papers with the [[National Football League Players Association|Players Association]] on February 12, 2007.

In the very next [[2007 NFL season|NFL season]] following Barber's retirement, the [[New York Giants]] went on to defeat the [[2007 New England Patriots season|previously undefeated 18–0 New England Patriots]] to win [[Super Bowl XLII]] in one of the greatest upsets in sports history. Barber was present to cover the event, but was not well received by most of his former teammates and Giants' fans, after his disparaging remarks about his former teammate and Giants quarterback, [[Eli Manning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/22844290/ |title=Tiki's offseason criticisms rallied Eli, Giants |publisher=Nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=January 26, 2008 |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempt to return to the NFL===
On March 8, 2011, Barber filed paperwork to come out of retirement.&lt;ref name="unretirement"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/03/08/tiki-barber-unretires/ Tiki Barber Unretires] ''Sports Illustrated''. Retrieved March 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the New York Giants still retained the rights to Barber, the Giants planned to release him once the NFL and the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] reach a collective bargaining agreement.&lt;ref name="unretirement"/&gt;

On April 28, 2011, Barber was quoted saying that his comeback was "not about the money"; however, the ''[[New York Post]]'' ran a contradictory news story in 2010, reporting that Barber is seeking to return to the [[NFL]] because he is not financially solvent, and unable to pay his divorce settlement with his ex-wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AiPM5E7EdhLasuZeIu8ePl5DubYF?slug%3Dap-tikibarber-comeback |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019074505/http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news |archivedate=October 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2011, the Giants officially removed Barber from the retired list, allowing him to freely sign with any team.&lt;ref&gt;http://newyork.sbnation.com/new-york-giants/2011/7/28/2301751/new-york-giants-roster-cuts-tiki-barber-officially-an-ex-giant {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/1312942126000772?url=http://newyork.sbnation.com/new-york-giants/2011/7/28/2301751/new-york-giants-roster-cuts-tiki-barber-officially-an-ex-giant |date=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;!--DashBotWC--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 2011, Barber began working out with the [[Miami Dolphins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82137b0a/article/barber-works-out-for-dolphins-in-attempt-at-nfl-comeback?module=HP11_headline_stack |title=news: Barber works out for Dolphins in attempt at NFL comeback |publisher=Nfl.com |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Player profile==

===Running style===
Starting from his breakout season in 2000, Barber was known for his exceptional cutback running, quick feet, and running vision. He also was an adept receiver out of the backfield with over 450 receiving yards and over 50 receptions every season from 2000 to 2006.

After the 2003 year, in spite of his rushing yard totals, Barber had a tendency to commit fumbles. He committed nine fumbles and six lost fumbles in the 2002 and 2003 seasons, respectively. This also includes three lost fumbles in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles on December 28, 2002. When head coach [[Tom Coughlin]] arrived, he taught Barber to hold the ball vertically instead of horizontally, of which is a common practice in [[rugby football]]. After adapting to this change, his fumbles went down significantly. In 2004, he only had two lost fumbles and proceeded to commit only lost four fumbles in his three years with Coughlin.

Barber began to focus on strength training and lifting in 2004 upon the suggestion of his new running backs coach, Jerald Ingram. Barber began to work with a strength coach, Joe Carini, in New Jersey. His added upper-body strength allowed him to break more tackles and improve as a running-back. Barber improved in other ways over the course of his career. He refined upon his patience during game-play, which is needed in football to wait for blocks to set and formed holes to emerge in the [[offensive line]] before accelerating forward. Barber also improved upon his physical toughness and blocking ability, as he was not known for being skilled in them earlier in his career. &lt;ref&gt;Barber, Tiki. '''Pure Hard Workout'''&lt;/ref&gt;  Barber additionally benefited from an improved offensive line and Coughlin's emphasis on the Giants' new strategic running game.

===Strahan contract controversy===

In 2002, All-Pro Giants defensive end [[Michael Strahan]] was negotiating a new contract, and Tiki Barber publicly criticized Michael Strahan's negotiating stance. He felt Strahan should have agreed to the contract the Giants offered and remarked that Strahan was greedy. The contract impacted the team as Strahan's cap number exceeded $12 million and the new contract would have lowered Strahan's cap number, greatly helping the team get under the 2002 Salary Cap. "I don't know if he realizes how much $17 million is," Barber told the NY Post. "That is absolutely ridiculous, to turn that down. He's already the highest-paid defensive player in the league. He's already making more than most quarterbacks...Michael is not thinking about the team; he's thinking about himself".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/news/2002/0321/1355387.html|title=ESPN.com: NFL - Barber says Strahan 'should just be quiet'|website=static.espn.go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Hamilton (American football)|Keith Hamilton]], a teammate of Strahan and Barber at the time, then responded with comments critical of Barber. Players generally believe that they should not speak about the contracts of other players. Beyond that, some members of the Giants defense harbored resentment of the offense, which was lackluster and unproductive in the 1990s. "The defense has carried the offense, carried the team, since I've been here," Hamilton told The Star-Ledger. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[Barber]&lt;/nowiki&gt; hasn't been here long enough or done enough to say anything. For him to shoot his mouth off, acting like he's Mr. New York, yeah, I'm ticked off. Strahan is the single-season sack record-holder. He's the AP Defensive Player of the Year. He's one of the best - if not the best - defensive ends in the game. And you tell me this guy is being greedy? That's a bunch of crap. I've heard enough. Who is Tiki Barber to shoot his mouth off? What has he done? He talks like he's acting in the best interest of the team. Tell him to give his $7 million (signing bonus) back. Since he's so charitable, why doesn't he volunteer his $7 million? He says all the politically correct things. Ask him if he's giving up some of his money." Despite this incident, Strahan and Barber are currently friendly with each other in public.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

===Coaching criticism===
Although Barber's statistics improved greatly after [[Tom Coughlin]] became the Giants' head coach, Barber disliked and criticized Coughlin's coaching style. During the coach's tenure, Barber publicly questioned the team's coaching on two occasions. After being shut out at home in the first round of the 2005 playoffs by the [[Carolina Panthers]], Tiki made a post-game comment that he felt the Giants had been outcoached by their former defensive coordinator, the Panthers' head coach [[John Fox (NFL)|John Fox]]. Heavy sports media attention was placed on the comment; Tiki apologized for it shortly afterwards, saying he only meant to convey the Giants' performance was 'unacceptable'.

After a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars during the 2006 season, Barber criticized the playcalling for abandoning the running game too soon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsls.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSLS%2FMGArticle%2FSLS_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1149191834676&amp;path=!sports Tiki Barber upset with lack of carries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111181426/http://www.wsls.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSLS%2FMGArticle%2FSLS_BasicArticle |date=2007-11-11 }}, Associated Press News Service. Retrieved January 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Both times Coughlin and Barber met to discuss the comments.

On the eve of what would be his last game with the Giants, Barber told ESPN that he is "demeaned and talked down to" by Coughlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogs.newsday.com/sports/football/giants/blog/2007/01/ Inside the Giants&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109003007/http://weblogs.newsday.com/sports/football/giants/blog/2007/01/ |date=2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring, Barber attributed his decision to retire to Coughlin's unrelenting style in practice. "(Coughlin) pushed me in the direction (of television),"&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nj.com/ledgergiants/2007/02/tiki_takes_a_parting_shot_at_c.html], nj.com: Tiki takes a parting shot at Coughlin&lt;/ref&gt; said Barber. "I don't know if you realize this, but we were in full pads for 17 weeks, and with the amount of injuries that we had, it just takes a toll on you. You physically don't want to be out there, when your body feels the way you do, in full pads."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/sports/football/14tiki.html?pagewanted=print], The New York Times: NBC Gives Barber the Ball, and He Runs With It&lt;/ref&gt;

The Giants would then go on to win the Super Bowl, the year following Barber's retirement.

==Post-football career==

===Broadcasting===
After retiring from the NFL, Barber began a second career as a television broadcaster.  Barber immediately landed a role with NBC in which he contributed to the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' program, covered sports for NBC Sports, and hosted entertainment events for NBC Universal. Barber was introduced as a correspondent for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' and analyst for ''[[Football Night in America]]/[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' on February 13, 2007.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; This came after a competition for his services was waged between ABC, FOX, NFL, and NBC. As a ''Today'' correspondent, Barber anchored lifestyle segments and reports on news stories. He was rumored to be a potential long-term candidate for [[Matt Lauer]]'s co-host position on Today.  However, Lauer renewed his contract with NBC in 2012 and was fired on November 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/business/media/matt-lauer-nbc-news-firing.html|title=Matt Lauer Firing Caps a Difficult Time at NBC News|first1=Michael M.|last1=Grynbaum|first2=John|last2=Koblin|date=29 November 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber is unusual among retired athletes in his desire to cover hard news and political stories; in 2006 Barber cited a lunch with Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] as the highlight of his year.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Sara. [http://www.gotham-magazine.com/cover.php A Giant Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610095434/http://www.gotham-magazine.com/cover.php |date=2004-06-10 }}.

While still an NFL player, Barber gained broadcasting experience. On television, he co-hosted the morning news program ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'' on select Tuesday mornings. On radio, he hosted ''Barber Shop'' a weekly show on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] with his brother Ronde during the football season. In the offseason, he hosted a [[Talk radio|political and general interest radio program]]; Senator [[John McCain]] was his first interview. Barber originally began his broadcasting career on WFAN radio and the WCBS local news in New York.

In May 2008, Barber filled the spot of [[Willie Geist]] on the MSNBC program ''[[Morning Joe]]'' while Geist was on vacation.

In August 2008, Barber helped broadcast the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] on MSNBC and was a commentator for  [[Yahoo!]] sports for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].

On Wednesday, June 23, 2010, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that NBC has dropped him from his contributor's role on NBC's ''The Today Show''. Barber was quietly let go in May 2010 by the network after his contract was not renewed by NBC earlier that year.

Barber appeared as a studio [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]] on the [[BBC]]'s [[Super Bowl XLV]] coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC - BBC Sport Programmes - American Football, 2010/11, Super Bowl Live|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yf5kq|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Barber is a radio host for [[CBS Sports Radio]] with Brandon Tierney, ''Tiki &amp; Tierney'', a national show on Weekday afternoons airing 3 - 6 pm (EST).&lt;ref name="Barber,Tierney,Jacobson Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=TIKI BARBER, BRANDON TIERNEY AND DANA JACOBSON TO HOST CBS SPORTS RADIO’S WEEKDAY MORNING SHOW|url=http://www.cbsradio.com/single-press/1880?filter=2012|publisher=CBS Radio|accessdate=14 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308043646/http://www.cbsradio.com/single-press/1880?filter=2012|archivedate=8 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber was the 'mobile shout out' on an episode of the [[Discovery Channel]] game show ''[[Cash Cab (US game show)|Cash Cab]]''. The question was "What is the name of the famous [[John Steinbeck]] novel that followed the travels of [[Tom Joad]]?".  Both Barber and the contestant incorrectly answered with ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'' by [[Larry McMurtry]]; the correct answer was ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''.

In the 2008 series ''[[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', Barber played a drill sergeant who was murdered during an underground MMA fight in the episode "Fight Knight".

He was also spoofed by KITT at the end of the episode.

Barber appears in multiple episodes as himself in the 2009 iteration of ''[[The Electric Company (2009 TV series)|The Electric Company]]''. His "character" is adored by women and adolescents alike and is portrayed as a very likable and forthright role model.

She as a result had to work two or three jobs. We never felt like we wanted for everything, because my mom, which is something a lot of parents don't do, she sacrificed her life for us, for 20 whatever years it was all about us. She worked at the Girl Scouts, she worked at a flower shop downtown, worked at the grocery store, the midnight shift. I remember going to bed and my mom leaving.

'''Verdicenan Kadın''' ({{Lang-ota|ورد جنان قادين}}; 18 October 1825{{snd}}9 December 1889) was the wife of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=211}}

==Early life==
Verdicenan Kadın was born on 18 October 1825 in [[Sukhumi]], [[Abkhazia]]. Born as Saliha Achba, she was a member of Abkhaian princely family, in the [[Anchabadze]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=34}} Her father was Prince Kaytuk Giorgi Bey Achba (1793–1848) and her mother was Princess Yelizaveta Hanım (1795–1843).{{sfn|Tuna|2007|p=23}} She had five elder siblings, two brothers, Prince Islam Bey and Prince Ahmet Bey,{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=34}} and two sisters, Princess Peremrüz Hanım and Princess Embruvaz Hanım,{{sfn|Tuna|2007|p=25}} and a younger brother, Prince Mehmed Bey.{{sfn|Tuna|2007|p=23}}

Saliha had been brought to Istanbul as a young child, where her father entrusted her and her sisters to the care of her [[Bezmiâlem Sultan]], mother of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]], where her name according to the custom of the Ottoman court was changed to Verdicenan.{{sfn|Tuna|2007|p=25}}

==Marriage==
Verdicenan married Abdulmejid for a political alliance, on 17 December 1840 at the Old Çırağan Palace.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=33-34}} She was given the title of "Altıncı Kadın".{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=211}} Her whole family was ennobled, father, brothers and nephews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4112">'''William Anthony Farone''' is a former [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] Director of Applied Research. Dr. Farone was hired at Philip morris to make safer products and to find business alternatives outside the tobacco industry.

== Background ==
Farone has a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry (1965), an M.S. in Chemistry (1962) and was awarded his B.S. in Chemistry with honors in 1961. All of his degrees are from Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. Dr. Farone carried double majors during his undergraduate years and also has a strong background in business, mathematics, organic chemistry and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Farone, William Anthony [http://www.appliedpowerconcepts.com/PapersData/Farone%20Resume.pdf Resume of William Anthony Farone], estimated date 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 

Farone spent eight years as a top scientist at Philip Morris, and was tasked with creating a safer cigarette that would provide smokers with the desired pharmaceutical effects of [[nicotine]] but with less risk to health. Farone was later fired from the company. Farone has given government officials and trial lawyers valuable information on industry practices from the upper reaches of Philip Morris' internal company research.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz J, ''The Washington Post'' [http://www.well.com/conf/media/WP.tobacco.html Reengineering the Cigarette] January 31, 1999. Page W08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testimony==
Farone claimed in his testimony in the Donald A. LaBelle case in July, 2000 that it is possible to make safer cigarettes, and that the means for doing so were known to the industry. He indicated that the only way to know if you've made a safer cigarette is to test it for biological toxicity, and failure to do so means that you haven't shown that it's safer. He contended that as early as 1936 it was possible to make cigarettes safer than those that were being marketed to the public at that time. He maintained that the industry deliberately manipulated the levels of nicotine by changing the ratios of nicotine and tar in their products. The witness noted that Philip Morris continually denied causation and addiction of nicotine, but that both of those concepts were accepted when he was working as a Philip Morris scientist. He argued that some of Philip Morris' statements about the relationship between smoking and disease were unethical. He suggested that Philip Morris purposefully kept the smoking/health controversy alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/sxz75a00 Deposition of William Anthony Farone, Ph.D., July 20, 2000, LaBelle v. Philip Morris, Inc.] Deposition. 118 pp. July 20, 2000. Bates No.FARONEW072000&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Farone who has a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry, an M.S. in Chemistry, and worked for Phillip Morris from 1976-1984 as Director of Applied Research, the company Chrysalis Technologies who is a subsidiary of the [[Altria Group]], a company that is now operating as a division of [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], has developed a soft mist aerosol technology for pulmonary drug delivery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drugdiscoveryonline.com/article.mvc/Discovery-Labs-And-Chrysalis-Technologies-Mod-0001&lt;/ref&gt;

that could be used as a nicotine inhaler and could put an end to [[cigarette smoking]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.fr/title/tt0773124/ (Starts at minute 13:05)&lt;/ref&gt; he stated in the Documentary the Tobacco Consipiracy, that this just won't happen because the cigarette companies that developed it would lose all of their [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://yourbrainondrugs.net/2012/03/tobacco-profits-35bn-last-year-at-cost-of-6-million-dead/&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Farone has continued to work in the same field, this time formulating and developing innovative products for tobacco users. Mainly his formula for a nicotine and tar and chemical residue eliminating mouthwash brand-named [[Nicorinse]] and trademarked in The United States, Europe, China, and Canada. He continues to work and consult on innovations in oral health.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nicorinse.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Tinsley Keeton''' (February 3, 1933 – August 17, 1980) was an American [[zoologist]] known internationally for his work on [[ethology|animal behavior]], especially [[bird migration]],&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|date=August 21, 1980|title=Dr. William Keeton, 47; Professor of Biology and Authority on Birds|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C02EED81639E731A25752C2A96E9C94619FD6CF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for his work on [[millipede]] [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. He was a well-liked professor of biology at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]] and author of a widely used introductory textbook, ''Biological Science''.

==Biography==
William Keeton was born February 3, 1933 in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], and grew up in [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]]. Keeton attended the [[University of Chicago]] and received both his Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science degrees, working under Dr. [[Alfred E. Emerson]].  Keeton earned a master's degree at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]] (Virginia Tech), during which he revised the [[millipede]] genus ''[[Brachoria]]''.&lt;ref name=Hoffmantribute/&gt; During his time at Virginia Tech, Keeton met Barbara Orcutt, whom he married in 1958.&lt;ref name=Emlen1981/&gt; He moved to [[Cornell University]] in 1956 in order to continue his research with millipede systematics for his doctorate, where he studied under Dr. [[Howard E. Evans]]. His doctoral research culminated in a [[monograph]] on the family [[Spirobolidae]]&lt;ref name=Hoffmantribute&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first= Richard L.|title=William Tinsley Keeton (1933-1980)|date= April 1981|website=Centre International de Myriapodologie|url=  http://www.myriapodology.org/memoriam/members/keeton-content.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his doctorate in 1958 and joined the biology faculty at Cornell University as a biology professor in 1958.

Keeton was a noted and well-known Biological Science 101 professor beginning in 1958, so much so that his popularity as a professor earned his class the nickname of the "Keeton course".  In addition to his teaching Keeton is known for his work with [[pigeons]] and bird orientation and [[animal navigation|navigation]], as he studied pigeon homing behaviors for well over a decade.

During his early work at Cornell University the Biological Science Departments were reorganized, and as a result William Keeton moved from the [[Entomology]] Department to the newly created Neurobiology and Behavior Department.  It was here where he first started his research on pigeon homing, which led him to the discoveries of the effects of the [[earth's magnetic field]], the position of the sun, as well as [[olfactory navigation]] and visual cues involved in the process that pigeons use to find their way home.  Cornell University built Keeton a loft large enough to house two thousand pigeons that were the subjects of Keeton’s experiments on the behaviors and processes involved in pigeon homing.  Both students and faculty at Cornell University, as well as other scientists from around the world came and worked alongside William Keeton in his pigeon loft.&lt;ref name=Emlen1981/&gt;

William Keeton is also known for his work in writing the biology textbook named ''Biological Science'', that was first published by the [[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]] in 1967.  It took Keeton approximately five years to write the first edition of the textbook.  It went through three editions before his death in 1980.  After Keeton's death the textbook was revised for editions 4, 5, and 6 by James L. Gould (and Carol Gould).  The textbook was a combination of both [[botany]] and [[zoology]].  This combination of sciences turned out to be extremely successful in teaching many aspects of biology.  The textbook  was one of the first that integrated zoology and botany and sought common themes, guided by the process of evolution.&lt;ref name=Emlen1981/&gt;

Keeton died from [[heart attack]] on August 17, 1980 due to a failure of a [[Artificial heart valve|mechanical heart valve]]. He was 47 years old.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Jay|title=An Appreciation of Prof. William T.

==Work with pigeons==
{{further|Animal navigation}}

William Keeton had always had a fascination with pigeon homing techniques from the time he was a child.  When he was nine years old he received his first homing pigeons which he raced and trained with his friends.&lt;ref name=Emlen1981&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Memoriam: William T. Keeton|author=Emlen, Stephen T.|journal=The Auk|volume=98|number=1 |year=1981|pages=167–172|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v098n01/p0167-p0172.pdf|jstor=4085619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientists speculated ideas about the devices pigeons were using including the use of the position of the sun, the earth's magnetic field, and landmark recognition and olfactory navigation.  William Keeton tested these various speculations throughout his time at Cornell University.

===Magnetic interference===
{{Details|Magnetoception}}
[[File:Homing pigeon.jpg|thumb|Homing pigeons were a central subject of Keeton's work]]
In William Keeton’s 1970 ''Magnets Interfere with Pigeon Homing'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keeton |first1=W. T. |title=Magnets Interfere with Pigeon Homing |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1971 |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=102–106 |doi=10.1073/pnas.68.1.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Keeton proved that pigeons were affected by changes in the magnetic field surrounding them, and that pigeons were using the [[earth's magnetic field]] as one way of finding their way home.  In this experiment, William Keeton attached [[magnets]] to the back of pigeons just before they were released and measured their [[vanishing point]] (in what direction they had flown out of sight) and the time it took to find their way home for both the experimental birds and with the control birds (control birds had a piece of brass glued to their back of the same weight as the magnet).

Keeton’s results showed that when the sun was visible, the magnets would not usually prevent the birds from finding their way home, but when the sky was overcast the birds with magnets on their back were much more unsuccessful and slower at finding their way back home than the control birds.  
Previous scientists had shown that pigeons were not relying entirely on the sun to navigate home as many scientists had speculated, when they found that many pigeons were able to navigate successfully under completely overcast skies.  This notion led Keeton to question whether the pigeons were using the earth's magnetic field to orient themselves and navigate home successfully.  Keeton’s experiments with magnets showed that there was a combination of processes being used by the pigeons to navigate home, but the use of the earth's magnetic field was very important for pigeon orientation and navigation.

Under clear skies with the sun visible, both the birds with magnets and the birds without magnets had little trouble navigating back to the loft, yet at unfamiliar locations with overcast skies the birds with magnets glued to their backs were unable to successfully orient themselves and navigate back to the loft.  Keeton speculated that this was occurring because the birds without magnets were able to use the earth's magnetic fields to orient themselves in the correct direction, whereas the birds with magnets attached to their backs were unable to use the sun, familiar landmarks, or the earth's magnetic fields to find their way home. This discovery was extremely useful in explaining one of the most interesting questions of bird navigation.

===Olfactory interference===
Many scientists hypothesized that pigeons were using olfactory information as part of the process in finding their way back to the loft.  In Italy, a study by N.E. Baldaccini, in which the bills of pigeons were applied with a strong odor, showed results that the pigeons had less accurate initial orientation.  Baldaccini also performed an experiment in which he reared pigeons in a loft in which the wind was deflected by 45 degrees.  Baldaccini's results showed that a deflection in the wind while the pigeons were young proved to have an effect on their initial orientation after being released.  Keeton replicated this experiment but found that there was a smaller deflection than the results in Baldaccini's experiment in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waldvogel |first1=Jerry A. |last2=Benvenuti |first2=Silvano |last3=Keeton |first3=William T. |last4=Papi |first4=Floriano |title=Homing pigeon orientation influenced by deflected winds at home loft |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|date=1978 |volume=128 |issue=4 |pages=297–301 |doi=10.1007/BF00657604}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Keeton speculated that there may be an effect on initial orientation based on an olfactory map, but the experiment was too general for proving that this was indeed what was occurring in this experiment.

==Work with millipedes==
[[File:Narceus americanus.jpg|thumb|Keeton brought nine previously-named species under synonymy with ''[[Narceus americanus]]'']]
Prior to his work on animal navigation, Keeton studied the [[systematics]] and [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[millipede]]s. His Master's thesis at Virginia Tech was a revision of the genus ''[[Brachoria]]'', a [[Xystodesmid]] of the order [[Polydesmida]]. His doctoral research at Cornell resulted in a [[monograph]] of the family [[Spirobolidae]] (order [[Spirobolida]]) published in 1960, that garnered praise as bringing order and clarity to  "a chaos of unrelated genera replete with poorly-known species".&lt;ref name=Hoffmantribute/&gt; He split the family into two subfamilies and reduced the number of species through synonymy - determining that various named species actually belonged to previously described species. He made many field excursions to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] with fellow millipede expert [[Richard L. Hoffman]], and also made an extended collecting trip to the [[San Martin Tuxtla|Vulcan San Martin]] of Veracruz, Mexico. He published a total of 13 works on millipedes, in which he named 19 new species, two new genera, and the new families [[Allopocockiidae]] and [[Floridobolidae]], both of the order Spirobolida.&lt;ref name=Hoffmantribute/&gt; He also studied [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[morphogenesis]],&lt;ref name=MyriaLit&gt;{{cite web|title=Works by William T. Keeton|url=http://www.myriapodology.org/myrlit/index.php?author=+Keeton%2C+W&amp;title=&amp;year=&amp;maglong=&amp;entries=100&amp;page=1&amp;form=form|website=MyriaLit Database|publisher=Centre International de Myriapodologie, Senckenberg Museum of Natural History|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked with Dr. [[Thomas Eisner]] on characterizing the defensive secretions of six species of the order [[Spirostreptida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisner|first1=T|last2=Hurst|first2=JJ|last3=Keeton|first3=WT|last4=Meinwald|first4=Y|title=Defense mechanisms of arthropods.

'''Yuvraj Singh''' ({{audio|Yuvraj_Singh.ogg|pronunciation}}) (born 12 December 1981) is an [[India]]n international [[cricket]]er, who played all forms of the game. An [[all-rounder]] who bats left-handed in the middle order and bowls [[slow left-arm orthodox]], Yuvraj is the son of former Indian [[fast bowling|fast bowler]] and [[Punjabi cinema|Punjabi]] actor [[Yograj Singh]].

Yuvraj was a member of the [[Indian cricket team]] in [[One Day International|ODI]]s since October 2000 and played his first [[Test cricket|Test]] match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007–2008. He was the Man of the Tournament in the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]], and one of the top performers at the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]], both of which India won. In a match against [[England cricket team|England]] at the 2007 World Twenty20, he famously hit six [[Boundary (cricket)|sixes]] in one over bowled by [[Stuart Broad]] — a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two Test cricket teams. In the same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all Twenty20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] match.

In 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a [[cancerous]] [[tumor]] in his left lung and underwent [[chemotherapy]] treatment in Boston and Indianapolis.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/tumour-cancerous-yuvi-undergoes-chemo/908423/|title="Tumour Cancerous, Yuvi Undergoes Chemo" – Indian Express.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] shortly before the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20|2012 World Twenty20]].

In 2012, Yuvraj was conferred with the [[Arjuna Award]], India's second highest sporting award by the [[Government of India]]. In 2014, he was awarded the [[Padma Shri]], India's fourth highest civilian honour. At the 2014 [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] auction [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] bought Yuvraj for an all-time high price of {{INR}}14 [[crore]] and, in 2015, the [[Delhi Daredevils]] bought him for {{INR}}16 crore making him the most expensive player ever to be sold in the IPL.He is currently playing for the [[Kings XI Punjab]] ([[Indian Premier League 2018|IPL 2018]])

==Early years and personal life==
Yuvraj was born in a [[Sikh]] family to [[Yograj Singh]], a former India cricketer, and Shabnam Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/item/188217-my-son-has-come-back-as-a-winner-says-yuvraj-singhs-father |title=My son has come back as a winner, says Yuvraj Singh's father |publisher=NDTV.com |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tennis]] and [[roller skating]] were Yuvraj's favorite sports during his childhood and he was quite good at both. He had also won the National Under-14 Roller Skating Championship. His father threw away the medal and told him to forget skating and concentrate on cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-10/top-stories/29403147_1_yuvi-local-train-cricket|title=Yuvraj Singh: Inside out |publisher=The Times of India |date=10 April 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would take Yuvraj to training every day.

Yuvraj studied at the DAV Public School in [[Chandigarh]]. He also did two short roles as [[child actor|child star]] in ''Mehndi Sagna Di and Putt Sardara''. After his parents divorced, Yuvraj chose to stay with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120208/jsp/sports/story_15107689.jsp#.UE6xr7LiZIU |title=Yuvi’s not meeting Lance: Shabnam |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2015, Yuvraj got engaged to [[Hazel Keech]] and married her on 30 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/Yuvraj-Singh-and-Hazel-Keech-exchange-wedding-vows/article16732191.ece|work=The Hindu|title=Yuvraj Singh and Hazel Keech exchange wedding vows|date=30 November 2016|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Youth career===
Yuvraj started his career from the Punjab Under-16s at the age of 13 years and 11 months in November of the 1995–96 season against [[Jammu and Kashmir cricket team|Jammu and Kashmir-16s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Punjab Under-16s v Jammu and Kashmir Under-16s in 1995/96|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/145/145059.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996–97, Yuvraj was promoted to Punjab Under-19s and scored 137 not out against [[Himachal Pradesh cricket team|Himachal Pradesh Under-19s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Punjab Under-19s v Himachal Pradesh Under-19s in 1996/97|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/145/145178.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuvraj made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut in late-1997 against [[Orissa cricket team|Orissa]] during the [[1997–98 Ranji Trophy]] but was dismissed for a duck opening the innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Punjab v Orissa in 1996/97|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/63/63476.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first breakout performance came in the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy Final of 1999 against Bihar at [[Jamshedpur]]; Bihar were all out with a score of 357 and Yuvraj batted at three for Punjab and made 358 runs himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bihar Under-19s v Punjab Under-19s in 1999/00|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/119/119688.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuvraj represented India in the series against Sri Lanka Under-19s in India in February 1999. In the third ODI, Yuvraj scored 89 runs from 55 balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India Under-19s v Sri Lanka Under-19s in 1998/99|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/67/67349.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1999-2000 Ranji Trophy]], he scored 149 against [[Haryana cricket team|Haryana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haryana v Punjab in 1999/00|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/68/68716.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2000 Under-19 Cricket World Cup]] which India won under the captaincy of [[Mohammad Kaif]], Yuvraj's all-round performance earned him the Player of the Tournament award and a call-up to the national squad. His performance in the tournament included 68 off 62 and 4/36 against New Zealand in a group stage match,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICC Under-19 World Cup, Group B: India Under-19s v New Zealand Under-19s at Galle, Jan 16, 2000|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/329877.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a quickfire 58 off 25 balls against Australia in the semifinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICC Under-19 World Cup, Semi-Final: Australia Under-19s v India Under-19s at Colombo (PSS), Jan 25, 2000|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/329905.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuvraj was subsequently selected in 2000 for the first intake of the [[National Cricket Academy]] in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Partab| last = Ramchand| title= First list of NCA trainees| url = http://feedsuk.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/CRICKET_NEWS/2000/APR/029816_CI_15APR2000.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| date = 15 April 2000| accessdate =8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International breakthrough===
Yuvraj was selected in the Indian squad for the [[2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy]] in the back of his impressive outings for the Under-19 team. He made his international debut against [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] in the pre-quarterfinal. He bowled four overs conceding 16 runs but did not get to bat. In the quarterfinal match against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], Yuvraj won the man of the match for his innings of 84 (80), against a pace attack consisting of [[Glenn McGrath]], [[Brett Lee]] and [[Jason Gillespie]], that helped India win by 20 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia v India|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/70/70694.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the semifinal against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], he scored 41 and picked 1/15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India v South Africa|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/70/70721.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored only 14 against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in the final which India lost. The tournament was followed by a tri-series involving India, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Yuvraj scored just 55 runs in five innings at an average of 11. Yuvraj averaged 15.50 in the ODI series against the touring Zimbabwe side in December 2000 after which he was dropped from the team.

Yuvraj made his comeback during the 2001 Coca-Cola Cup in Sri Lanka. He scored a crucial 98* against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in the fifth match in an otherwise disappointing series with the bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka v India|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/72/72720.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he proved to be useful with the ball as he took 8 wickets at an average of 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowling averages for India|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/2/Coca-Cola_Cup_%28Sri_Lanka%29_2001/India_Bowling.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Standard Bank triangular series involving hosts South Africa, India and Kenya, Yuvraj managed to score only 69 runs from 6 innings, including a duck in the final against South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Bank Triangular Tournament, 2001/02 / Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=835;type=tournament|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, [[Dinesh Mongia]] and [[Hemang Badani]] were chosen over Yuvraj in the squad for the home series against England in January 2002.

Yuvraj returned to playing domestic cricket in early 2002. After a disappointing run in the Ranji knockouts, Yuvraj struck 209 for [[North Zone cricket team|North Zone]] against [[South Zone cricket team|South Zone]] in a [[Duleep Trophy]] match in March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duleep Trophy 2001/02 - North Zone v South Zone|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/74/74279.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was immediately drafted into the national squad for the final two ODIs against [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] with India trailing the series 1-2. Yuvraj made an impact in his return match at [[Hyderabad]], scoring an unbeaten 80 off just 60 balls, to take India to a five-wicket win and level the series. He won the Man of the Match award for his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zimbabwe tour of India, 2001/02 - 4th ODI India v Zimbabwe|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64756.html|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final ODI at [[Guwahati]], Yuvraj made 75 runs from 52 balls, sharing a 157-run fifth-wicket partnership with Mongia who scored his career-best unbeaten 159, to help India post a total of 333 in their 50 overs. India went on to win the game by 101 runs and the series 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zimbabwe tour of India, 2001/02 - 5th ODI India v Zimbabwe|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64757.html|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002 NatWest Series===
After winning the ODI series in the West Indies 2-1, where Yuvraj managed scores of 1 and 10, the Indian team toured England in June for the NatWest triangular series and a four-match Test series against the hosts. The NatWest Series featured teams from England and Sri Lanka, apart from India. In the first match at [[Lord's]], Yuvraj won the man of the match for his all-round performance (3/39 and 64*) as India successfully chased down England's total of 271.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NatWest Series - 2nd match England v India|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66284.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next match against Sri Lanka, he scored 31 and shared a crucial 60-run sixth-wicket partnership with [[Mohammad Kaif]] to set up another successful run-chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NatWest Series - 3rd match India v Sri Lanka|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66285.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's next match against England was washed out due to rain after Yuvraj had scored an unbeaten 40 off 19 balls to take India to 285/4 in their 50 overs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NatWest Series - 5th match England v India|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66287.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuvraj's knock of 37, along with a fifty from [[Rahul Dravid]], helped India recover from 59/4 to reach the target of 188 against Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NatWest Series - 6th match India v Sri Lanka|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66288.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This win eliminated Sri Lanka from the series with another round of matches still to be played. Yuvraj had scores of 5 and 8 in the final round of matches but proved to be useful with the ball as he picked one wicket in each of the two games. At the end of the round-robin matches, India topped the points table with 19 points while England finished second with 15 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NatWest Series, 2002 / Points table Tweet|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/61110.html?view=pointstable|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final was played at Lord's on 13 July between India and England. After winning the toss and electing to bat first, England posted a daunting total of 325/5 in 50 overs. In reply, India was struggling at 146/5 at the end of 24 overs, when Kaif joined Yuvraj at the crease. The pair initially stabilised the innings and later scored at a brisk rate. The duo shared a partnership of 121 runs for the sixth wicket which came to an end when Yuvraj was dismissed for 69 (63 balls) as he top-edged a sweep shot in the 42nd over off the bowling of [[Paul Collingwood]] resulting in a simple catch to [[Alex Tudor]] at short fine leg. India went on to win the game by two wickets with three balls to spare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NatWest Series - Final England v India|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66292.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was India's first win in the final of an ODI tournament since 2000, after nine consecutive defeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Booth|first=Lawrence|title=NatWest Series 2002, Final: England v India|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154994.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This win is regarded as one of India's greatest victories in ODI cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sourav Ganguly reminisces about famous 2002 NatWest Series win at Lord's|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/features/specials/193467-sourav-ganguly-reminisces-about-famous-2002-natwest-win|publisher=NDTV Sports|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India crashed to a 135-run defeat and lost the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India v West Indies in 2002/03 - 7th ODI|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/75/75846.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He struggled for runs in the seven-match ODI series in New Zealand in December 2002-January 2003, averaging just above 19 with a solitary fifty.

Despite his indifferent form leading to the World Cup, Yuvraj secured a place in the 15-man Indian squad for the [[2003 ICC Cricket World Cup]] in South Africa. He scored 37 in India's opening match against [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]]. In the following games, he had scores of 0, 1 and 7* against Australia, Zimbabwe and [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] respectively. He scored a brisk 42 against England, followed by an unbeaten 50 against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] setting up wins for India in both games. In the Super Six stage of the tournament, Yuvraj had scores of 58* against Kenya and 5 against Sri Lanka. He scored 16 in the semifinal against Kenya, and 24 against Australia in the final.

Yuvraj scored his maiden ODI century (102* from 85 balls) against [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] at [[Dhaka]] on 11 April 2003. In May 2003, Yuvraj was signed-up by the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] for the 2003 county season. He became only the second Indian after [[Sachin Tendulkar]] to represent the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grunill |first=Paul |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/2941719.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Cricket &amp;#124; Yuvraj reaching for the top |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 May 2003 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yorkshire confirm Yuvraj signing|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/131207.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuvraj's Test debut came on 16 October 2003 at his home ground [[Mohali]] against New Zealand. Batting at six, he scored 20 in the first innings, and 5* in the second innings. In the TVS Cup tri-series in October–November 2003 involving India, Australia and New Zealand, he scored 113 runs from 7 games at an average of 18.83 and top-score of 44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TVS Cup (India), 2003/04 - India / Batting and bowling averages|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=876;team=6;type=tournament|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuvraj returned to form in early-2004 in the tri-series involving Australia and Zimbabwe. He scored 314 runs from 8 innings at an average of 39.25, including his second ODI hundred - 139 runs from 122 balls, with 16 fours and two sixes - against Australia at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records / VB Series, 2003/04 - India / Batting and bowling averages|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=882;team=6;type=tournament|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a mixed tour of Pakistan in March–April 2004. He disappointed in the ODI series with 141 runs from 5 matches, averaging just over 28, but found success in the Test series. In the first Test at [[Multan]], he scored 59 - his maiden Test fifty - as India registered an innings win. He also picked his maiden Test wicket during the second innings of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Test: Pakistan v India at Multan, Mar 28-Apr 1, 2004|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64081.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second Test at [[Lahore]], Yuvraj scored his maiden Test century during India's first innings while the rest of the batting lineup struggled against the bowling of [[Umar Gul]]. Yuvraj's innings of 112 came from 129 deliveries with 15 fours and two sixes. He made only 12 runs in the second innings and Pakistan leveled the series by winning the match by 9 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2nd Test: Pakistan v India at Lahore, Apr 5-8, 2004|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64082.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored 47 in the final Test at [[Rawalpindi]] where India secured the series with another innings victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3rd Test: Pakistan v India at Rawalpindi, Apr 13-16, 2004|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64082.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he lost his form in the latter half of 2004 with batting averages of 31 in the [[2004 Asia Cup]], 12.33 in the Natwest Series in England and 4.50 in the [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy]]. In October 2004, after the first two Tests of the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]], he was dropped from the Test squad as his dismal run with the bat yielded just 47 runs from the two matches.

Despite the dip in form towards the end of 2004, Yuvraj continued to be a regular feature in the Indian ODI team. In the Platinum Jubilee Match against Pakistan in November 2004, he scored a 62-ball 78 in a losing cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BCCI Platinum Jubilee Match: India v Pakistan|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66384.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, Yuvraj scored 94 runs at an average of 31.33 in the three-match ODI tour of Bangladesh including a quickfire knock of 69 from 32 balls in the final ODI at [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India in Bangladesh ODI Series, 2004/05 - India / Batting and bowling averages|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=904;team=6;type=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a disappointing ODI series at home against Pakistan in April 2005, scoring 98 runs in six matches at 19.60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan in India ODI Series, 2004/05 - India / Batting and bowling averages|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=912;team=6;type=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival in form===
In July–August 2005, Yuvraj was the leading run-getter for India in the [[2005 Indian Oil Cup]] triangular series in Sri Lanka also involving the hosts Sri Lanka and West Indies. He scored 192 runs in four matches, averaging 48.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Oil Cup, 2005 / Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=2537;type=tournament|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also recorded his third ODI century during the series - 110 runs from 114 balls (11 fours and one six) - against West Indies at [[Colombo]] for which he was awarded the man of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6th Match: India v West Indies at Colombo (RPS), Aug 7, 2005|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/215286.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuvraj then played in the [[Videocon Tri-Series 2005–06|Videocon Cup]] in August–September 2005, a triangular series involving India, New Zealand and the hosts Zimbabwe. He averaged 54 with the bat in the series, scoring 216 runs from 5 matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Videocon Triangular Series, 2005 / Records / Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/videoconseries/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=2564;type=tournament|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His innings of 120, in the final round-robin match against Zimbabwe at [[Harare]], helped India recover from a precarious position of 36/4 and successfully chase down the target of 251. It was his fourth ODI hundred and he won the man of the match award for his efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6th Match: Zimbabwe v India at Harare, Sep 4, 2005|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/217979.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the two-match Test tour of Zimbabwe that followed the tri-series in September, Yuvraj had scores of 12 and 25. In October–November 2005, Yuvraj had a quiet seven-match ODI series at home against Sri Lanka. He managed just 124 runs in six innings at an average of 31 with a top-score of 79*.

In November 2005, Yuvraj scored 103 in the first ODI against South Africa at [[Hyderabad]] to take India from 35/5 to a respectable total of 249/9, and won the man of the match award although South Africa won the game by five wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st ODI: India v South Africa at Hyderabad (Deccan), Nov 16, 2005|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/225959.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He picked 1/17 and scored the winning runs in the second ODI at [[Bangalore]], before the third match at [[Chennai]] was washed out due to rain. He scored 53 and 49 in the final two matches at Delhi and Ahmedabad respectively, and the series was drawn 2-2. Yuvraj and South African captain [[Graeme Smith]] were jointly awarded the man of the series as each of them scored 209 runs at 69.66, finishing as joint-highest run-getters of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa in India ODI Series, 2005/06 / Records / Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/indvrsa/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=2654;type=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuvraj had a mixed home Test series against Sri Lanka in December 2005 as he registered two [[duck (cricket)|duck]]s and two half-centuries. He scored 0 &amp; 77* in the second Test at [[Delhi]], and 0 &amp; 75 in the third Test at [[Ahmedabad]] as India won both the matches by comfortable margins.

Yuvraj was picked in both Test and ODI squads for the Pakistan tour in January–February 2006. The first two Tests were drawn in which he batted only once, in the second Test, scoring 4. In the third Test at [[Karachi]], he top-scored for India in both innings. After scoring 45 in the first innings, he went to score his second Test hundred in the second innings (122 runs from 144 balls). India lost the match by 341 runs and the series 1-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3rd Test: Pakistan v India at Karachi, Jan 29-Feb 1, 2006|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/234783.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the one-day series, he continued to be in sublime form. He scored a 28-ball 39 in the first ODI at Peshawar which Pakistan won by 7 runs by [[Duckworth–Lewis method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st ODI: Pakistan v India at Peshawar, Feb 6, 2006|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/235831.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored an unbeaten 82 in the second match at Rawalpindi taking India to an emphatic 7-wicket win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2nd ODI: Pakistan v India at Rawalpindi, Feb 11, 2006|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/236520.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; before scoring an unbeaten 79 in the third game at Lahore and helping India successfully chase the target of 289.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3rd ODI: Pakistan v India at Lahore, Feb 13, 2006|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/236809.html|publisher=ESPNcricnfo|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the low-scoring fourth match at Multan, he scored 37 as India took the series with a five-wicket victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4th ODI: Pakistan v India at Multan, Feb 16, 2006|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/237222.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth and the final ODI at Karachi, Yuvraj, batting at three, hit his sixth ODI century. His innings of 107* which came off 93 balls with 13 boundaries helped India comfortably chase down the target of 287 for the loss of only two wickets. He won the man of the match award for this innings and was also adjudged player of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5th ODI: Pakistan v India at Karachi, Feb 19, 2006|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/237571.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against England, Yuvraj averaged 21.33 in two Tests in March but proved to be successful with both bat and ball in the ODI series in which he again won the player of the series award. During the series, he won the back-to-back man of the match awards in the third and fourth ODIs. In the third match, he made 103 from 76 balls, and in the fourth match, he picked 2/34 and scored 48. He scored a total of 237 runs in the series at an average of 47.40 and took 6 wickets with his part-time bowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England in India ODI Series, 2005/06 - India / Records / Batting and bowling averages|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/indveng/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=2708;team=6;type=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On India's [[Indian cricket team in West Indies in 2006|tour of the West Indies]], Yuvraj hit two fifties in the ODI series. In the second ODI at Kingston, with India needing two runs to win with one wicket in hand and three balls to spare, Yuvraj was [[bowled]] by [[Dwayne Bravo]] for 93. India went on to lose the series 4-1. His poor run of form in Tests continued, with him scoring 104 runs from four matches at an average of 17.33 and a top-score of 39. In September 2006, Yuvraj was dropped from the playing eleven during the [[2006-07 DLF Cup]] in Kuala Lumpur after he registered two consecutive ducks against Australia and West Indies. He played in two group matches of the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy]] held in India in October. and scored 27* against England and 27 against West Indies. During a training session before India's final group fixture against Australia, Yuvraj suffered a ligament injury in his left knee. Mongia replaced him for the match which India lost to crash out of the tournament. In November, Indian team physio [[Andrew Leipus]] suggested that Yuvraj is unlikely to recover from the injury before the start of the World Cup in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yuvraj Singh doubtful for World Cup|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/267159.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuvraj was not named in any of the Indian squads that [[Indian cricket team in South Africa in 2006–07|toured South Africa]] in late 2006. In January 2007, less than two months before the World Cup, he made a comeback from injury for the last two matches of the [[West Indian cricket team in India in 2006–07|four-match ODI series]] against West Indies, but did not make much of an impact in either game. Despite concerns over his fitness, Yuvraj was selected in the 15-man Indian squad for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], with the chairman of selectors [[Dilip Vengsarkar]] confirming Yuvraj was fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sehwag and Pathan included in squad|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/280087.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured in the last two matches of the [[Sri Lankan cricket team in India in 2006–07|four-ODI series]] against Sri Lanka in February 2007, and struck an unbeaten 83-ball 95 in the deciding final game at Visakhapatnam.

Yuvraj made 47 in India's first match of the World Cup, a shock defeat to Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICC World Cup, 8th Match, Group B: Bangladesh v India at Port of Spain, Mar 17, 2007|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/engine/match/247464.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India's next group match at Port-of-Spain against World Cup debutants Bermuda, he hit 83 off 46 balls to help India post a total of 413/5, the highest World Cup total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICC World Cup, 12th Match, Group B: Bermuda v India at Port of Spain, Mar 19, 2007|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/engine/match/247468.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the big win against Bermuda, India were left with a must-win final group fixture against Sri Lanka. Chasing 255 to win the match, Yuvraj was dismissed [[run out]] for 6, as India were bowled out for 185 and made an early exit from the World Cup.

In the [[2007 Future Cup|three-match ODI series]] against South Africa in Ireland, Yuvraj took 3 for 36 and scored an unbeaten 49 in the second ODI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future Cup, 2nd ODI: India v South Africa at Belfast, Jun 29, 2007|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/rsavind/engine/match/293077.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before winning man of the match for his unbeaten 61 in the series-deciding final game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future Cup, 3rd ODI: India v South Africa at Belfast, Jul 1, 2007|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/rsavind/engine/match/293078.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On India's [[Indian cricket team in England in 2007|tour of England]], Yuvraj remained on the bench throughout the Test series before finishing third on the run-scorers list in the ODI series with 283 runs from 7 matches at an average of 40.42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NatWest Series [India in England], 2007 / Records / Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/engvind/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=2873;type=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 World Twenty20 and vice-captaincy===
Yuvraj was the vice-captain of the Indian squad at the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural ICC World Twenty20]] in South Africa. In India's Super 8 match against England at Durban, he hit [[Boundary (cricket)#6 Sixes in an over|six sixes]] in an over off [[Stuart Broad]]. In the process, he reached the fastest fifty ever in a [[Twenty20]] game, off just 12 balls, which was also the fastest in any form of international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/305877.html |title=Twenty20 matches-Fastest fifties |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/284095.html |title=One-Day Internationals-Fastest fifties |publisher=Cricinfo |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/284096.html |title=Test matches-Fastest fifties |publisher=Cricinfo |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the fourth time that six sixes had been hit in one over in senior cricket, the first time in Twenty20 cricket, and the first time in any form of international cricket against a bowler from a Test playing nation. He finished his innings with 58 runs off 16 balls and won the man of the match.

Yuvraj missed the next game against South Africa due to a niggle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yuvraj and I will be fit for semi-final - Dhoni|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/twenty20wc/content/story/311898.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recovered before the semifinal against Australia.

[[File:Yuvraj Singh batting.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yuvraj during batting practice in February 2008.]]
In September 2007, [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] and Yuvraj were named ODI captain and vice-captain respectively, following the resignation of [[Rahul Dravid]]. Yuvraj scored 121 at Hyderabad in a losing cause in the third of the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2007|seven ODIs against Australia]], but accumulated only 71 in the other six matches of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records / Australia in India ODI Series, 2007/08 / Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=3250;type=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed a return to form in India's [[Pakistani cricket team in India in 2007–08|home ODI series against Pakistan]] in November 2007. He scored four half-centuries in five matches, averaging 68,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records / Pakistan in India ODI Series, 2007/08 / Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=3253;type=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named player of the series as India won the series 3–2. He was also fined for showing dissent in the final match in Jaipur. Although Yuvraj was included in Indian squad for the subsequent Test series against Pakistan, Test captain [[Anil Kumble]] said that Yuvraj "will have to wait a little bit more to become a regular member in the Test squad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Yuvraj will have to wait his turn' - Kumble|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indvpak/content/story/321422.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not feature in the playing eleven in the first two matches, but was picked in the third Test at Bangalore to replace an injured [[Sachin Tendulkar]]. Batting first, India was 61/4 before Yuvraj and [[Sourav Ganguly]] shared a 300-run fifth-wicket partnership, and Yuvraj recorded his highest Test score of 169 off 203 balls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan tour of India, 3rd Test: India v Pakistan at Bangalore, Dec 8-12, 2007|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/297808.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ganguly went on to score 239 which was his highest score in tests.

He had a very poor Test series against Australia in Indian tour to that country in 2007/08. After his poor showing in the first two Tests, he was dropped for the remainder of the series.
In November 2008, he hit 138 not out from 78 balls against England at Rajkot, taking 64 balls to reach his century which at the time was the second fastest by an Indian in ODIs after [[Mohammad Azharuddin]]'s century in 1988 against New Zealand came off 62 balls. 
After reaching 50 from 42 balls, he added a further 88 in the next 36 balls. He did so despite straining his back, which necessitated the use of [[Gautam Gambhir]] as a runner. 
This was followed by 118 from 122 balls and a 4/28 all his wickets being specialist batsmen in the next match in Indore, earning him two consecutive man of the match awards.
Yuvraj scored 85 not output on an unbroken partnership of 163 with [[Sachin Tendulkar]] to defeat England in the First Test at Chennai in December 2008. It was the fourth highest successful run chase in history and the highest in India.
Yuvraj scores a quick, unbeaten 54 in the second innings of the Napier Test against New Zealand to help India save the game after following on. India preserves their lead and goes on to win the series 1-0.

Yuvraj was dropped from the Asia Cup following the team's return from the World Twenty20 in West Indies. Lack of form, disciplinary reasons and fitness are talked of as the reasons for his exclusion, but he makes a return for the series against Sri Lanka.
With [[Suresh Raina]] scoring a century on Test debut and [[Cheteshwar Pujara]] making a compelling case for higher honors with his consistent first-class performances, Yuvraj is dropped from the Test squad for the two-match series against Australia.

[[File:Yuvraj against New zealand.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Yuvraj batting against New Zealand in 2010.]]

===Golden World Cup===
Yuvraj had a dream run at the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]], where he scored 362 runs including one century and four fifties, took 15 wickets, won four Man-of-the-Match awards and was also awarded the Player of the Tournament. In the process, he became the first allrounder to score 300-plus runs and take 15 wickets in a single World Cup.
In India's match against Ireland in the same tournament, he became the first player to take 5 Wickets and score 50 runs in a World Cup match. He took his 100th ODI wicket, with the dismissal of [[Wesley Barresi]] in the 2011 World Cup match against the Netherlands. 
In the 2011 World Cup till he took charge of the chase against defending champions Australia. In recent years, he has added value to the side through his improved left arm orthodox bowling.

In the ICC World Cup 2011, he won four Man of the Match awards, which is joint best with Sri Lanka's [[Aravinda de Silva]] in 1996 and South Africa's [[Lance Klusener]] in 1999.
Yuvraj had respiratory difficulties through 2011 and in May he withdrew from the ODI series in the West Indies due to an illness. 
He toured England but had to return home after breaking his finger in the Nottingham Test and later played two home Tests against West Indies. However, he then pulled out of the ODI series against West Indies in November citing an abnormal tumor in his lung.
Yuvraj had originally targeted the CB series in Australia for his return to international cricket.

His issues began with breathing difficulties, nausea and bouts of vomiting blood before India's successful run through the 2011 World Cup, which he ended as the player of the tournament.

Post ICC World Cup he was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor stage-1 in his left lung and underwent chemotherapy treatment at the [[Cancer Research Institute]] in [[Boston]], United States as well as the Indiana University Melvin &amp; Bren Simon Cancer Center in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] where he was cared for by famed oncologist Dr. [[Lawrence Einhorn]]. His mother Shabnam Singh was with him during his diagnosis in the USA.

===Cancer diagnosis and comeback===
In March 2012, Yuvraj was discharged from hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. After his chemotherapy [[Lawrence Einhorn#Famouse patients|sessions treating seminoma]] in Indianapolis, Yuvraj's cancer showing full signs of remission, he aimed at resuming cricket at the World Twenty20. The selectors picked Yuvraj to be a part of the 15-member Indian squad for the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] in Sri Lanka in September 2012.

He played against New Zealand in a T20I at [[Chennai]] where he scored 34 off 26 balls (1 four, 2 sixes) as his side lost by only 1 run. He started his [[2012 ICC World Twenty20|World Twenty20]] campaign with a 3/24 against Afghanistan. He took 1/16 against Australia, 2/16 against Pakistan and a 2/23 against South Africa. He ended up being the highest wicket taker for India in the tournament though he could not match up to the expectations with his bat.

He got selected for the Test series against England at home. He later played 3 test matches in the 4 match test series against England after which he was dropped. He later was selected for the India-Pakistan Series in the second T20 he came back to form by scoring a blistering 72 off just 36 balls. He could not make an impact in the One Day series against Pakistan and England only scoring 1 half century in 7 matches.

In September 2013, Yuvraj made a comeback to India's limited-overs squad for the Twenty20 and first three ODIs of the home series against Australia.

[[File:Yuvraj Singh bowling (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Yuvraj bowling in 2010.]]
In October 2013, Yuvraj scored 77 off 35 showed his dominance in the only T20I against Australia at [[Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium]] in Rajkot. India was facing an asking-rate of nearly 12 at 100 for 4 in the 12th over but Yuvraj's response was so forceful that all Dhoni needed to do was give him the strike. By the end, the partnership was 102 at exactly two runs a ball.
But Yuvraj had a woeful home ODI series against Australia in October, scoring 19 runs in four innings, when he was visibly troubled by the pace of [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]].

He couldn't bat himself back into form in the home ODIs against West Indies or on the South Africa tour and was expected to be dropped for the New Zealand tour given the conditions in that country and the hosts' pace-heavy attack. He was not selected for [[2014 Asia Cup]] in Bangladesh but he selected for the [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]] same place. Yuvraj performances in the practice matches were major boosts for India ahead of the World T20. In Super10 match against he missed a full delivery and was bowled by the second ball. In both matches, he put down what could have been costly misses [[Chris Gayle]] and [[Mohammad Hafeez]] but India created and converted more chances soon after. His solitary over in the tournament so far went for 13.

Yuvraj scored 60 off 43 balls, his third fifty against Australia at Mirpur and his eighth in T20Is. Yuvraj has gone past [[Gautam Gambhir]] to become the top run-scorer for India in T20 internationals. He had an 84-run partnership with [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] is India's third-highest for the fifth wicket. India's highest partnership for the fifth wicket came in their last match against the same opposition when Yuvraj and Dhoni added 102 while chasing 202 in Rajkot.

On 5 July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World XI against [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) in the [[Bicentenary Celebration match]] at [[Lord's]], as he had been left out of India's ODI team. Under Shane Warne's captaincy, he struck almost a-run-a-ball century to rescue his team who had been struggling at 59 for 3. His 100 came up as he hit Sachin Tendulkar for a boundary. Rest of the World finished on 293 for 7 after 50 overs, but MCC went on to win the match by 7 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yuvraj Singh Smashes Guru Sachin Tendulkar En Route to a Century – 5 July |url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/226514-yuvraj-singh-smashes-guru-sachin-tendulkar-en-route-to-a-century|work=Lord's |date=5 July 2014 |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, Singh was one of the five senior players who were not considered for the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]] and was not included in India's 30-man probable for the tournament.

===Late career===
Singh was picked in India's T20I squad for the [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 2015–16|January 2016 Australia tour]] on the back of strong performances in [[2015–16 Vijay Hazare Trophy|Vijay Hazare Trophy]], where he was the third-highest run-getter with 341 runs at an average of 85.25. He finished the three-match series with 15 runs after getting to bat in just one inning, and two wickets. He was not named in the T20I squad for the [[Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 2016|tour of West Indies]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/1045157.html|title=Raina, Yuvraj out of T20Is in USA|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date= 12 August 2016|accessdate= 13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he was named captain of the India Red side for the [[2016–17 Duleep Trophy]].
His team lost to India Blue in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raina, Yuvraj, Gambhir to captain Duleep teams|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/1044957.html|accessdate=20 January 2017|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuvraj was picked in India's ODI squad for the [[English cricket team in India in 2016–17|home series against England]] in January 2017. This came on the back of his fine performances in the [[2016–17 Ranji Trophy|Ranji Trophy]], having scored 672 runs in five games for Punjab, which included a 260 against [[Baroda cricket team|Baroda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yuvraj recalled, Kohli named ODI and T20I captain|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/1075923.html|accessdate=19 January 2017|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second match of the series, he scored his career best score 150, which came off 127 balls, a knock that included 21 fours and three sixes. He put on 256 runs for the fourth wicket along with Dhoni and helped the team post a total of 381. Following the team's 15-run victory, he was named the Player of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India win series with Yuvraj and Dhoni tons|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/1078381.html|accessdate=19 January 2017|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the match, Singh revealed that he had thought of quitting after having been dropped from the team. He said, "When I came back from 
cancer it was hard work. I was not performing and after being dropped I thought (about) whether I wanted to continue or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket-had-thought-of-quitting-cricket-after-being-dropped-says-yuvraj-singh-365674|title=Had thought of quitting Cricket after being dropped, says Yuvraj Singh|website=indiatvnews.com|language=en|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuvraj was selected to play in the Champions Trophy 2017. He played a scintillating knock of 53 against Pakistan and won the man of the match award. However owing to failure in clearing the yo yo test Yuvraj was dropped from the squad before the tour of Sri Lanka in August 2017 which ended his international career.

==Indian Premier League==
Yuvraj was the [[icon player]] and captain for [[Indian Premier League]] (IPL) team [[Kings XI Punjab]] in the first two seasons; in 2010, the third season, icon player status was discontinued and the captaincy given to [[Kumar Sangakkara]].

On 1 May 2009, Yuvraj registered his first hat-trick in T20 cricket against [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] at Kingsmead in [[Durban]], the same ground where he hit his six sixes. He dismissed [[Robin Uthappa]], [[Mark Boucher]] and [[Jacques Kallis]]. On 17 May 2009, Yuvraj took his second Twenty20 hat-trick against [[Deccan Chargers]] at the [[Wanderers Stadium]] in Johannesburg.

==Playing style==
[[File:Yuvraj Singh fielding.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Yuvraj during fielding practice.]]
Yuvraj is primarily a left-handed [[batsman]] but can [[bowling (cricket)|bowl]] part-time left-arm orthodox spin, which he improved in the latter part of his career. He is regarded as a better batsman against fast bowling than [[spin bowling]], and cites the [[Indian Oil Cup 2005]] as a turning point in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Anand| last= Vasu| title= Born again| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/249085.html| access-date =5 February 2007|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuvraj is one of the athletic fielders in the Indian team, fielding primarily at [[Fielding (cricket)|point]] &amp; covers with a good aim at the stumps. Yuvraj is a natural stroke player with an aggressive style of play, as seen by his strike rate of above 150 in T20 internationals &amp; just below 90 in ODIs. Many regard him as one of the best clean strikers of the ball, with his trademark punch through the covers a treat to watch. When in good touch, he can clear the ropes quite effortlessly. A [[Cricinfo]] report published in late 2005 showed that since 1999, he was the fourth most prolific fielder in affecting [[One Day International|ODI]] [[run out]]s, and of those on the list of prolific fielders, he had the second highest rate of effecting a run out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Statistics – Run outs in ODIs | last = Basevi| first = Trevor| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/224487.html| date= 8 November 2005| access-date =5 February 2007| publisher= [[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously often characterised as having attitude problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Yuvraj speaks highly of Sourav's support| url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/105607.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| date = 28 March 2001| accessdate =5 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later often assumed leadership positions during [[Rahul Dravid]]'s tenure as captain.
His favourite cricketing shot is pull shot.
His others well known shots include flick, cover drive and cut shot.

Buguet became a "sensation" among [[Spiritualism|spiritualists]] during the early 1870s. He was even loaned money to set up his own studio. In June 1875, a police sting operation in [[Paris]] discovered that Buguet's photographic plates had pre-exposed images on them. After the exposure, Buguet admitted in court that his photographs were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Jolly. (2006). ''Faces of the Living Dead: The Belief in Spirit Photography''. Miegunyah Press. p. 22. {{ISBN|978-0977282739}} "In June 1875, Buguet was tried for fraud. He quickly confessed to surreptitiously double-exposing his plates with images of dummies, or his studio assistants, dressed up in drapery. Police raided his studio and seized two dummies, shrouds, false beards, and almost 300 pictures of various heads glued onto card."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene V. Gallagher]], W. Michael Ashcraft. (2006). ''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America''. Greenwood Press. p. 40. {{ISBN|0-275-98713-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn L. Sharp. (2006). ''Secular Spirituality: Reincarnation and Spiritism in Nineteenth-century France''. Lexington Books. p. 81. {{ISBN|978-0-7391-1339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted and served a year jail time.&lt;ref name="Houdini 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Hannavy. (2008). ''Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography''. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC. p. 552. {{ISBN|978-0-415-97235-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the magician [[Harry Houdini]], the police discovered figures and [[doll]] heads at Buguet's studio. He had used these as his "spirit" extras. Houdini noted that although Buguet was exposed as a fraud and he had confessed, some spiritualists still insisted his spirit photographs were genuine.&lt;ref name="Houdini 2011"/&gt;

The English medium [[Stainton Moses]] had supported Buguet in an article for ''Human Nature'' in May 1875.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]]. (1938). ''Beware Familiar Spirits''. C. Scribner's Sons. p. 150. {{ISBN|978-1111354879}} "Stainton Moses warmly endorsed Buguet in an article printed in May, 1875. In June, 1875, the French government arrested Buguet for fraud. At his trial he made a complete confession, and the police seized and produced his "spirit" doll and the collection of heads that fitted on it."&lt;/ref&gt; After Burguet was exposed later in the same year, Moses insisted that Buguet was still a genuine medium and he had been bribed to make a false confession.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore]].

Aquarian Press. p. 115. "Stainton Moses even insisted that the prosecution was instigated by the Church, and that Buguet had been forced or bribed into making a false confession."&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been cited by researchers as an example of spiritualists [[True-believer syndrome|willing to believe]] and refusing to accept evidence of fraud.&lt;ref name="Houdini 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Pearsall]].
