'''''The Adoration of the Magi'''''  is an [[oil painting]] on wood panel by [[Netherlandish art|Netherlandish]] artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]], executed around 1475. It is housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum, New York]], US. A prominent feature of this painting is the strong perspective effect&lt;ref&gt;M. Ilsink and J. Koldeweij, Hieronymus Bosch, Visions of Genius, Yale University Press 2016, pp.58-61&lt;/ref&gt; and also the copious use of [[gold leaf]] which is not very typical for Bosch.&lt;ref&gt;Luuk Hoogstede, Ron Spronk, Matthijs Ilsink, Robert G. Erdmann, Jos Koldeweij, Rik Klein Gotink, Hieronymus Bosch, Painter and Draughtsman: Technical Studies, Yale University Press, 2016, pp. 172 – 181&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pigments]] employed are red lake, [[azurite]], [[lead-tin-yellow]] and [[ochres]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/hieronymus-bosch-adoration-magi-new-york/ Hieronymus Bosch, The Adoration of the Magi (New York)], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise authorship of this panel is and has been disputed, but in 2016 the Bosch Research and Conservation Project attributed it to Bosch based on evidence in the underdrawing.

'''''Ali''''' is a 2001 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, produced and directed by [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]. The film focuses on ten years in the life of the [[boxing|boxer]] [[Muhammad Ali]], played by [[Will Smith]], from 1964 to 1974, featuring his capture of the heavyweight title [[Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston|from Sonny Liston]], his conversion to [[Islam]], criticism of the [[Vietnam War]], and banishment from boxing, his return to [[Fight of the Century|fight Joe Frazier]] in 1971, and, finally, his reclaiming the title from [[George Foreman]] in [[the Rumble in the Jungle]] fight of 1974. It also touches on the great social and political upheaval in the [[United States]] following the assassinations of [[Malcolm X#Assassination|Malcolm X]] and [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr.]]

The film was well received by critics, but was unsuccessful at the box office. Smith and [[Jon Voight]] received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], respectively.

==Plot==
The film begins with [[Muhammad Ali|Cassius Clay Jr.]] before his championship debut against then [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] [[Sonny Liston]]. During the pre-fight [[weigh-in]] Clay heavily taunts Liston (such as calling Liston a "big ugly bear"). In the fight Clay is able to dominate the early rounds of the match, but halfway through he complains of a burning feeling in his eyes (implying that Liston has tried to cheat) and says he is unable to continue. However, his trainer/manager [[Angelo Dundee]] gets him to keep fighting. Once Clay is able to see again he easily dominates the fight and right before round seven Liston quits, making Clay the second youngest heavyweight champion at the time after [[Floyd Patterson]]. Clay spends valued time with [[Malcolm X]] and the two decide to take a trip to [[Africa]].

Clay is then invited to the home of [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Elijah Muhammad]] where he is granted the name Muhammad Ali due to his status of World Heavyweight Champion. His father, Cassius Clay Sr. disapproves of this. Ali marries Sonji Roi, an ex-[[Playboy Bunny]], despite her not being [[Muslim]] and [[Gender segregation and Muslims|not abiding by sex segregation]]. While at home with his wife and children, Malcolm X is called by the Nation of Islam and is informed that his suspension has been extended and Ali will not go to Africa. However, Ali takes the trip to Africa where he finds Malcolm X, but later refuses to speak to him, honoring the wishes of Elijah Muhammad. He is extremely distraught when Malcolm is [[Malcolm X#Assassination|later assassinated]].

Upon returning to [[United States|America]], Ali goes against Sonny Liston a second time and knocks him out in the first round. He and Sonji divorce after she continually objects to certain obligations Muslim women have, notably Muslim dress customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/muhammad-ali-women-who-loved-8111280|title=Muhammad Ali and the women who loved him during his four marriages|last=Mirror.co.uk|date=2016-06-04|work=mirror|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being officially called to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], Ali refuses, and is subsequently stripped of his boxing license, passport and title, additionally facing five years in prison. Ali marries 17-year-old [[Khalilah Ali|Belinda Boyd]]. After a three-year hiatus, his [[Clay v. United States|conviction is overturned]] and in his comeback fight, he goes against [[Jerry Quarry]] and wins by technical knockout in three rounds when Quarry gets a cut in his eye.

Ali attempts to regain the Heavyweight Championship against [[Joe Frazier]]. Dubbed the [[Fight of the Century]], Frazier has the upper hand against Ali for most of the rounds. In the fifteenth round, he defeats Ali by decision, giving Ali the first loss of his career. When Frazier loses the championship to [[George Foreman]], Ali makes a decision to fight Foreman and become the first boxer to win his title a second time.

Foreman and Ali go to [[Kinshasa|Kinshasa, Zaire]] for [[the Rumble in the Jungle]] fight. While there, Ali meets a woman named [[Veronica Porché Ali|Veronica Porché]], and has an affair with her. After reading rumors of his infidelity through newspapers, his wife Belinda travels to Zaire to confront him about this. Ali says he is unsure as to whether he really loves Veronica or not, and just wants to focus on his upcoming title shot.

For a good portion of the fight against Foreman, Ali leans back against the ropes and covers up, letting Foreman wildly throw punches at him. During the fight, Ali realizes that he has to react sooner or else he will be knocked out or possibly die in the ring. As the rounds go on, Foreman tires himself out and Ali takes advantage. He quickly knocks out the tired Foreman, and the film ends with Ali regaining the Heavyweight Championship of which he was previously stripped.

==Production==
The project began in 1992 when Producer Paul Ardaji optioned the movie rights to Muhammad Ali's life story. Nearing the end of his option period, Ardaji signed a contract with Sony Pictures, joining forces with Producer Jon Peters as producing partner. Producer [[Jon Peters]]  started developing the film in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|url=https://variety.com/1993/voices/columns/peters-semel-team-rumored-116252/|title=Peters-Semel team rumored|work=Variety|date=1993-12-01|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Allen Howard]] wrote the initial draft of the script, which had the working title ''Power and Grace''. Howard's draft focused on Ali's life from 12 to 40 years old, and his relationship with his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brad Schreiber|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/awards/fusing-fact-and-fiction-for-art-s-sake-1117861006/|title=Fusing fact and fiction for art's sake|work=Variety|date=2002-02-19|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard was replaced by writers Stephen J. Rivele and Chris Wilkinson, and by 1998 the biopic was set up at [[Columbia Pictures]], with Will Smith attached to star and the possibility of [[Ron Howard]] directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|title=McConaughey sees 'Evel'; Horner tune$ in | url = https://variety.com/1998/voices/columns/mcconaughey-sees-evel-horner-tune-in-1117469150|work=Variety|date=1998-03-25|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming of ''[[Wild Wild West]]'', Smith presented director [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] with the script. Columbia was hoping for filming to start towards the end of 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/sonnenfeld-smith-might-team-again-on-ali-biopic-1117479505|title=Sonnenfeld, Smith might team again on Ali biopic|work =Variety| date= 1998-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was pushed back, and Sonnenfeld exited in November 1999. It was speculated the Columbia was hesitant to move forward with Sonnenfeld following the disappointing box office performance of ''Wild Wild West''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|title = Parkerperks 'Women'; Gere turns on Fawcett | url = https://variety.com/1999/voices/columns/parkerperks-women-gere-turns-on-fawcett-1117756626|work=Variety|date=1999-10-14|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2000, it was announced that [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]] had taken over as director, following his Academy Award nomination for ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]''. With this commitment to ''Ali'', Mann turned down the opportunity to direct early versions of ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', ''[[Shooter (2007 film)|Shooter]]'' and ''[[Savages (2012 film)|Savages]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Michael Fleming|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/mann-handling-ali-pic-1117776671|title=Mann handling Ali pic|work=Variety|date=2000-02-22|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought [[Eric Roth]] to co-write the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming |url=https://variety.com/2000/voices/columns/for-roth-it-s-potter-or-planet-1117783987| title=For Roth, it's 'Potter' or 'Planet'?|work=Variety|date=2000-07-20|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of being attached to the Ali biopic, Smith officially signed on in May 2000 with a $20 million salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/allen-may-be-in-big-trouble-smith-s-ali-1117781696|title=Allen may be in 'Big Trouble'; Smith's Ali|work=Variety|date=2000-05-16|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming began in [[Los Angeles]] on January 11, 2001 on a $105 million budget. Shooting also took place in [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Cathy Dunkley |url = https://variety.com/2001/film/news/ieg-punches-up-ali-deal-1117798841|title=IEG punches up 'Ali' deal|work=Variety|date=2001-05-08|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith spent approximately one year learning all aspects of Ali's life. These included boxing training (up to seven hours a day), Islamic studies and dialect training. Smith has said that his portrayal of Ali is his proudest work to date.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

One of the selling points of the film is the realism of the fight scenes. Smith worked alongside boxing promoter Guy Sharpe from SharpeShooter Entertainment, and his lead fighter Ross Kent, to get the majority of his boxing tips for the film. All of the boxers in the film are former or current world heavyweight championship caliber boxers. It was quickly decided that 'Hollywood fighting'—passing the fist (or foot) between the camera and the face to create the illusion of a hit—would not be used in favor of actual boxing. The only limitation placed upon the fighters was for Charles Shufford (who plays [[George Foreman]]). He was permitted to hit Smith as hard as he could, so long as he did not actually knock the actor out.

Smith had to gain a significant amount of weight to look the part of Muhammad Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/09/movies/the-new-season-film-michael-mann-and-will-smith-in-the-ring-with-ali.html | work=New York Times | title=THE NEW SEASON/FILM; Michael Mann and Will Smith in the Ring With Ali | date=2001-09-09 | accessdate=2012-03-10 | first1=Allen | last1=Barra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Ali'' opened on Christmas Day, 2001 and grossed a total of $14.7 million in 2,446 theaters during its opening weekend. The film went on to gross a total of $87.7 million worldwide. ''Ali'' holds a 67% "fresh" rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. In spite of the positive reviews, the film lost an estimated $63.1 million.

The film had generally favorable reviews, with the performances of Smith and Voight being well received by critics in general. [[Roger Ebert]] derided the film with two stars in his review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', and mentioned, "it lacks much of the flash, fire and humor of Muhammad Ali and is shot more in the tone of a eulogy than a celebration".&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Ali|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=2001-12-25|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20011225/REVIEWS/112250302/1023|accessdate=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, Todd McCarthy wrote, "The director's visual and aural dapplings are strikingly effective at their best, but over the long haul don't represent a satisfactory alternative to in-depth dramatic scenes; one longs, for example, for even one sequence in which Ali and Dundee discuss boxing strategy or assess an opponent", but he did have praise for the performances: "The cast is outstanding, from Smith, who carries the picture with consummate skill, and Voight, who is unrecognizable under all the makeup but nails Cosell's distinctive vocal cadences".&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Ali|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2001-12-16|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117916611.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0|accessdate=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film two and half stars out of four and stated that, "for many Ali fans, the movie may be good enough, but some perspective is in order. The documentaries ''[[a.k.a. Cassius Clay]]'' and the Oscar-winning ''[[When We Were Kings]]'' cover a lot of the same ground and are consistently more engaging".&lt;ref name= "Clark"&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Mike|title=Despite hype, ''Ali'' isn't the greatest|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2001-12-31|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-12-24-ali-review.htm|accessdate=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', Elvis Mitchell proclaimed ''Ali'' to be a "breakthrough" film for Mann, adding that it was his "first movie with feeling" and that "his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds".&lt;ref name= "Mitchell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Elvis|title=Master of the Boast, King of the Ring, Vision of the Future|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2001-12-25|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/25/movies/film-review-master-of-the-boast-king-of-the-ring-vision-of-the-future.html |accessdate=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Hoberman]], in his review for the ''[[Village Voice]]'', felt that the "first half percolates wonderfully—and the first half hour is even better than that. Mann opens with a thrilling montage that, spinning in and out of a nightclub performance by [[Sam Cooke]], contextualizes the hero in his times", and concluded that, "Ali's astonishing personality is skillfully evoked but, in the end, remains a mystery".&lt;ref name="Hoberman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoberman |first=J |title=Fight Songs |work=[[Village Voice]] |date=December 26, 2001 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/fight-songs-6396089 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ali died on June 3, 2016, Smith was chosen to be one of Ali's pallbearers for the memorial service in Louisville.

[[File:Jan van Eyck 054-096.jpg|thumb|500px|''The Annunciation'', each panel 39 x 24cm]]
'''''The Annunciation''''' (sometimes '''''Diptych of The Annunciation''''') is an oil on wood in [[grisaille]] painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artist [[Jan van Eyck]], dated by art historians as between 1434 and 1436. The panels form a [[diptych]], and  are currently in the collection of the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid.

The figures and iconography are very similar to those in the outer panels of van Eyck's earlier ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' completed in 1432.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, X&lt;/ref&gt; However, their relative small scale suggests commission for private worship rather than public celebration.

==Description==
The panels show the [[Archangel Gabriel]] on the left and the [[Virgin Mary]] on the right. Both are dressed in white robes. The figures of Mary and Gabriel are disproportionately large in relation to the scale of the rooms they occupy. Art historians agree that this follows the conventions of both the International Gothic and late Byzantine traditions of the icon by showing saints, especially Mary, in a much larger scale than their surroundings.

 | image2   = Ghent Altarpiece F - Maria message 2.jpg
 | width2    = 170
 | caption2  = Ghent exterior: The Virgin Annunciate
}}
The saints are placed on carved and inscribed [[pedestal]]s and [[architrave]]s. Heavy foldings of lighting fall across the space they occupy and accentuates the heavy fold of their drapery. Mary holds her typical attribute of a holy book, while a dove hovers above her representing the purity and the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="b61" /&gt; Despite the dramatic setting and black marble background, the figures are given  northern renaissance  naturalistic poses and very human gestures.

The diptych is highly illusionistic.&lt;ref name="b61"&gt;Borchert, 61&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant colours are multi-layered shades of white and black, intended to mimic stone sculpture creating a sense of living statues. The painted frames and mouldings are very early example of [[trompe l'oeil]], with faux spoken inscriptions. They contain the words of the Angel and Mary (from Luke 1: 26–38), and read; by the Archangel: ''Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee'', and from Mary: ''('Behold the handmaiden of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word''.

==Attribution==
If the attribution is accepted as by van eyck, it is placed as very early in his career and probably as two outer wings of a triptych; the ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]'' in Washington is a far more accomplished treatment and more likely intended as a complete work.&lt;ref name="b51"&gt;Borchert, 51&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asa Koma''' ("Red Hill") is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Djibouti]].

==Overview==
Asa Koma is an inland lake area on the Gobaad Plain. Pottery predating the mid-2nd millennium BC has been found at the site.{{When|date=July 2016}} The ware is characterized by punctate and incision geometric designs, which bear a similarity to the Sabir culture phase 1 ceramics from Ma'layba in [[Southern Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Ohvah"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walter Raunig|first1=Steffen Wenig|title=Afrikas Horn|date=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3447051752|page=439|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=JpNY7VPn1WUC|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ceramics like some of the pottery from Sihi on the Saudi coast and Subr on the Yemeni littoral have been found here.&lt;ref name="Iuoni"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Istituto universitario orientale (Naples, Italy)|title=Annali, Volume 58|date=1998|publisher=Edizione universitarie|page=527|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=zNtiAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-horned humpless cattle bones have also been discovered at Asa Koma, suggesting that domesticated cattle was present by around 3,500 years ago.&lt;ref name="Connah"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connah|first1=Graham|title=Forgotten Africa: An Introduction to Its Archaeology|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134403038|page=46|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ggD1wdQxBOcC|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After stepping down as a lobbyist for the cable industry, [[Freeport, Illinois]] native [[Robert L. Johnson]] decided to launch his own [[cable television]] network. Johnson would soon acquire a loan for $15,000 and a $500,000 investment from media executive [[John Malone]] to start the network.&lt;ref name="Market Nobody Wanted"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=Robert|last2=Dumaine|first2=Brian|title=The Market Nobody Wanted|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/10/01/330571/index.htm|work=Fortune Small Business|date=2002-10-01|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network, which was named Black Entertainment Television (BET), launched on January 25, 1980.&lt;ref name="Corporate Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporate Fact Sheet |url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=45 |publisher=BET Networks |accessdate=2008-09-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912162009/http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=45 |archivedate=September 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially broadcasting for two hours a week as a block of programming on the Madison Square Garden Sports Network (which would change their name to [[USA Network]] three months after BET launched). (it would not be until 1983 that BET became a full-fledged channel), the network's lineup consisted of [[music videos]] and reruns of popular [[black sitcom]]s.&lt;ref name="Market Nobody Wanted"/&gt;

BET launched a news program, ''BET News'', in 1988, with [[Ed Gordon (journalist)|Ed Gordon]] as its anchor. Gordon later hosted other programs and specials on BET, such as ''Black Men Speak Out: The Aftermath'', related to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], and a recurring interview show, ''Conversations with Ed Gordon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Anne Janette|title= Gordon, Ed 1960 – |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2871200026.html|work=Contemporary Black Biography|year=1996|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the talk show ''BET Tonight'' debuted with [[Tavis Smiley]] as host; in 2001, Ed Gordon replaced Smiley as host of the program.

In 1991, the network became the first black-controlled TV company to be listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="Market Nobody Wanted"/&gt; Starting the late 1990s, the network expanded with the launch of [[digital cable]] networks: what is now the general interest channel [[BET Her]] originally launched as BET on Jazz (later known as BET Jazz and BET J), created originally to showcase jazz music-related programming, especially that of black jazz musicians; in 1998, it entered into a [[joint venture]] with [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] (then-owned by John Malone's [[Liberty Media]]) to launch a multiplex service of the [[pay television|premium channel]] featuring African American-oriented movies called BET Movies: Starz! 3 (later renamed Black Starz after BET dropped out of the venture following its purchase by Viacom, then-owner of Starz rival [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], and now known as Starz InBlack). In 2001, the network lost its status as a black-owned business when it was bought by media conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] for $3 billion. In 2005, Johnson retired from the network, turning over his titles of president and chief executive officer to former BET vice president [[Debra L. Lee]].

By 2007, the network had launched two more music-oriented networks, [[BET Hip-Hop]] and [[BET Gospel]]. BET also launched a batch of original programming by this time, including reality shows ''[[Baldwin Hills (TV series)|Baldwin Hills]]'' and ''[[Hell Date]]'', competition show ''[[Sunday Best (TV series)|Sunday Best]]'', and town hall-style discussion show ''Hip Hop vs. America''.&lt;ref name="confidence"&gt;{{cite news|last=Deggans|first=Eric|title=BET diversifies with confidence|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/07/24/Tv/BET_diversifies_with_.shtml|accessdate=December 30, 2010|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=July 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; BET's president of entertainment [[Reginald Hudlin]] resigned from the network on September 11, 2008.

In March 2017, president of programming Stephen Hill and executive vice president of original programming Zola Mashariki both stepped down. Connie Orlando, senior vice president of Specials, Music Programming, and News was named the interim president of programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/bet-programming-shakeup-stephen-hill-zola-mashariki-leaving-1202055014/|title=BET Programming Shakeup: President Stephen Hill &amp; EVP Zola Mashariki Exit|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|date=2017-03-29|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Viacom signed new film and television development deals with [[Tyler Perry]]; the television development deal will begin in May 2019 following the expiration of his existing pact with [[Oprah Winfrey Network]], with new series primarily being developed for BET.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/07/tyler-perry-viacom-film-tv-deal-with-viacom-1202128622/|title=Tyler Perry Inks Mega Film &amp; Television Deal With Viacom|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2017-07-14|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{main article|List of programs broadcast by BET}}
BET's programming began with a wide scope of comedy, music, [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]], and news programming including ''[[ComicView]]'', ''[[Video Soul]]'' with [[Donnie Simpson]], ''[[Video Vibrations]]'', ''Softones'', ''[[Screen Scene]]'', ''Unreal/[[Planet Groove]]/[[Caribbean Rhythms]]'', ''[[Jam Zone]]/[[Cita's World]]'', ''[[Teen Summit]]'', ''BET News'' with [[Ed Gordon (journalist)|Ed Gordon]], ''Lead Story'', ''BET Tonight'' with [[Tavis Smiley]], and ''[[BET Nightly News]]''. Original programming currently seen on BET include ''[[The Quad (2017 TV series)|The Quad]]'', and ''[[Being Mary Jane]]''. By the early 2010s, the only regularly airing urban music video program on BET was ''[[106 &amp; Park]]'', which debuted in September 2000 and ended in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bet-106-park-tv-show-end-14-years-digital-only-20141411|title=BET's 106 &amp; Park TV Show to End After 14 Years, Become Digital-Only|date=14 November 2014|work=usmagazine.com|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BET also airs a program block called ''BET Inspiration'' which features [[Christianity|Christian]] programming. This block airs in lieu of [[infomercial]]s in late night, which the network has not aired since 1997;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=7753 BET Bails On Infomercials]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''MediaPost'', July 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; BET is one of a handful of subscription channels and one of only two Viacom-owned networks to have discontinued airing infomercials (sister network [[Nick at Nite]] ran infomercials in some overnight timeslots from 1987 to 1998, with series airing in that daypart since then). In early 2017, its Christian programming block changed its name to ''BET Rejoice''.

In addition, the channel broadcasts acquired television series, primarily in the form of sitcoms (such as ''[[The Parkers]]'', ''[[Family Matters]]'' and ''[[Moesha]]''), drama series (such as ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]''), and same-day or week-delayed late-night runs of syndicated talk shows (namely ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'', ''[[The Real (TV series)|The Real]]'', and ''[[Dish Nation]]''). Feature films released theatrically and on [[home video]] are also aired on the channel, comprising much of its primetime and weekend schedule.

BET UK first transmitted on Videotron (now known as Virgin Media) and several other subscription providers from 1993 until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madnews.wordpress.com/2007/12/30/hello-world |title=Black Entertainment Television (Bet) Uk Launch – What Happened??? « Www.Madnews.Biz |publisher=Madnews.wordpress.com |date=2007-12-30 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007 by [[Ofcom]], BET International Inc. was given a license to rebroadcast in the United Kingdom. [[BET International]] is the first international version of the channel and is available in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] through satellite providers. BET launched on February 27, 2008 on Sky channel 191 and began to be carried by [[Freesat]] channel 140 on August 8, 2008. BET+1 is also available on Sky channel 198 and Freesat channel 141, and is free-to-air. [[BET International]] shows a mix of content from the main BET channel and locally produced shows. An exclusive, but temporary, HD version of the channel was made to show the 2009 BET Awards on Freesat EPG 142.

BET is additionally an associate member of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctvcoop.com/listChannels.aspx |title=Member channels of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative |publisher=Cctvcoop.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816125823/http://www.cctvcoop.com/listChannels.aspx |archivedate=2011-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
BET became available in Canada in October 1997 on most pay television providers. The Canadian feed mirrors the American feed, though certain television programs and films are blacked out. Until 2017, they were replaced with repeats of old music video blocks (namely ''BET Music'', ''The Pull Up'' and ''BET Now''). As of May 2018, the feed now airs current music videos and other acquired sitcoms and films in place of blacked-out programs.

Following the death of civil rights leader [[Coretta Scott King]] in 2006, BET broadcast its regularly scheduled music video programming, rather than covering King's funeral live as [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel]], [[MSNBC]], and BET competitors [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] and [[Black Family Channel]] did. The BET website streamed the funeral live, while the channel periodically broadcast taped, 60-second reports from the funeral by senior news correspondent Andre Showell. Michael Lewellen, BET's senior vice president for corporate communications, defended the decision: "We weighed a number of different options. In the end, we chose to offer a different kind of experience for BET viewers." Lewellen also said that BET received around "two dozen" phone calls and "a handful" of emails criticizing BET for not showing the King funeral live.&lt;ref name="CSK"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shister|first=Gail|title=BET leaves pack on King funeral -- it sticks with scheduled program|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/buffalo-news/mi_8030/is_20060209/bet-leaves-pack-king-funeral/ai_n42906812/|accessdate=December 30, 2010|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=February 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of the funeral, February 7, 2006, BET broadcast the tribute special ''Coretta Scott King: Married to the Mission'', and BET repeated this the following Sunday, February 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=BET, BET.com Present Special Telecast, On-Line Coverage Honoring Life of Coretta Scott King |url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=364 |publisher=BET |date=February 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714064719/http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=364 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Showell hosted a program featuring highlights of the funeral, ''Coretta Scott King: Celebrating Her Spirit'', that broadcast that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=437 |title=BET Celebration of Coretta Scott King Continues Sunday With Three Hours of Tributes, Special Moments |date=February 9, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714064724/http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=437 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2007 convention, the [[National Association of Black Journalists]] gave BET its Thumbs Down Award for not broadcasting King's funeral live.&lt;ref name="thumbs down"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Juan|title='BET' Gets Thumbs Down Award From Journalists|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12668674|work=Morning Edition|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=December 30, 2010|date=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 interview, BET co-founder [[Sheila Johnson]] said that she herself is "ashamed" of what the network has become. "I don't watch it. I suggest to my kids that they don't watch it," she said. "When we started BET, it was going to be the ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine on television. We had public affairs programming. We had news... I had a show called ''[[Teen Summit]]'', we had a large variety of programming, but the problem is that then the video revolution started up... And then something started happening, and I didn't like it at all. And I remember during those days we would sit up and watch these videos and decide which ones were going on and which ones were not. We got a lot of backlash from recording artists...and we had to start showing them. I didn't like the way women were being portrayed in these videos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|title=Sheila Johnson Slams BET|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-04-29/sheila-johnsons-fight-against-hiv-in-dc/|work=The Daily Beast|date=2010-04-29|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BET Hip-Hop''' is a [[music video]] network owned by [[BET Networks]] which is exclusive to [[digital cable]] systems. It formerly aired some of BET's original programming such as ''[[Rap City (BET program)|Rap City]]'', ''[[ComicView]]'' and the network's video countdown programs. After the 2015 relaunch of the former [[MTV]] Jams as [[BET Jams]] (which has much wider distribution), the channel's programming was shifted to an automated playlist made up of BET's library of older [[hip-hop]] videos. As part of [[Viacom]]'s 2017 restructuring plan, which will see the company decrease the carriage of networks with little to no original programming or growth potential, the network is expected to lose distribution and eventually sign off.

'''''Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster''''' (1648) is a group portrait [[oil painting]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is considered one of the highlights of the [[Amsterdam Museum]], though it is generally on show in the [[Rijksmuseum]].

The painting is one of the largest civic guard group portraits for which most of the sitters are known and most of the portrayed objects have survived.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The painting is about retiring from active duty, because the [[Peace of Münster]] had finally been signed after years of negotiations. The main figures are seen with the attributes of the civic guard guilds. On the right [[Cornelis Jan Witsen]] heads up the table, holding the silver drinking horn of the [[Voetboogdoelen, Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/11259/collection.20370 KA 13965] Drinking horn  on Amsterdam Museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The art historian J.J. de Gelder mentioned the painting is dated 1648 but was probably finished at least a year later, similar to the way other group portraits by Van der Helst bear the date of the commission and not of completion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bartholomeusvand00gelduoft#page/65 J.J. de Gelder, dissertation on Bartholomeus van der Helst with a monograph of his work, 1921, cat. nr. 836]&lt;/ref&gt; The drum explains the occasion by way of the poem attached to it by [[Jan Vos (poet)|Jan Vos]]. The names mentioned in the poem are the handshakers, but in 1680 a name board was added that included 24 names:

The art historian Judith van Gent remarked that the first name on this list was Hendrik Caliber who was buried a month after the festivities took place, and agrees with De Gelder that the painting took quite a while to create and assumes the commission probably was granted well before the summer of 1648. In her catalog entry for this painting she lists short biographies of the traceable names.

'''Berlinghiero Berlinghieri''', also known as '''Berlinghiero of Lucca''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1228 &amp;ndash; between 1236 and 1242), was an Italian painter of the early thirteenth century. He was the father of the painters [[Barone Berlinghieri]], [[Bonaventura Berlinghieri]], and [[Marco Berlinghieri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.jrank.org/pages/11930/Berlinghieri.html Berlinghieri] - Berlinghiero, Berlinghieri, Barone, Bonaventura, Marco, Crucifix, St Francis and Scenes from his Life&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

His actual name is unknown, as he is known from the inscription "Berlingerius me pinxit" on the crucifix which is the basis of attributing other works to him. But the name "Berlinghiero Berlinghieri" is certainly not his name (according to Edward B. Garrison) and he should be called Berlinghiero. He is also mentioned in a parchment of 22 March 1228 among the names of the residents of Lucca who swore to keep the peace with [[Pisa]] after a five-year war. The original document has been lost since the mid-19th century and only a somewhat garbled 17th-century transcription exists today, giving rise to the mistaken interpretation of attributing him an incorrect name and an incorrect [[Lombardy|Lombardic]] origin.&lt;ref name="Garrison"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3047325 ''Toward a New History of Lucchese Painting''], by Edward B. Garrison, ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', Vol. 33, No. 1 (Mar., 1951), pp. 11-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his two adult sons were also mentioned in that document, it can be argued that Berlinghiero was then between 35 and 40 years old. This puts his birthday between 1188 and 1193.&lt;ref name="Garrison" /&gt;

== Style and works ==

[[File:Lucca.San Frediana02.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Mosaic at the facade of the [[Basilica di San Frediano]] in Lucca.]]
His style was late [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]], mainly line-based, with neohellenistic and Byzantine influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.jrank.org/pages/14605/Berlinghiero.html Berlinghiero biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be one of the main artists of the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] art of the period. He is also one of the few artists who painted in what is considered the Italo-Byzantine style to whom work can be attributed with certainty, though distinguishing his work from that of his sons is sometimes difficult.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Two Newly-Discovered Pictures of the Lucca School|jstor = 863242|journal = The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|date = 1927-08-01|pages = 56–67|volume = 51|issue = 293|first = Victor|last = Lasareff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Mostra del Tesoro di Firenze Sacra-I|jstor = 865582|journal = The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|date = 1933-08-01|volume = 63|issue = 365|first = Richard|last = Offner|page = 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His earliest work, or at least that attributed to him, is the "Madonna di sotto gli organi" in the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|cathedral of Pisa]] and dates not earlier than 1210.

One of his most famous works, ''Madonna and Child,'' is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It exemplifies several key elements that typify it as quintessentially Byzantine, but it also contains later Italian elements. One can begin with the most recognizable attributes, for example, the halos, the flat and uncrowded gold background, and the blue and red robes of the Virgin and her long features. The golden background and halos surrounding the heads of the Virgin and Child are common in Byzantine representation of divine or holy figures, as are the colors used throughout the composition. These golden halos differ between the two figures in the painting—Christ's is articulated by an inlaid cruciform to distinguish his divine status. The Madonna boasts timeless stylized features of the Virgin. Her fingers, nose, and neck are exaggeratedly long and slender and her face itself is elongated and narrow. Her soulful eyes are large and intensely focused, lending her visage a particular elegance. Upon seeing the painting in person, one can observe a red tint in the cheeks of both Jesus and Mary that gives the flesh a life-like quality - more vivacious, in fact, than its Byzantine predecessors. The particular depth created by the shading of the faces, Mary's in particular - an attribute of early Italian painting - also gives it an air of naturalism that Byzantine figures often lacked.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Works by Berlinghieri can be found at the [[San Matteo National Museum]] in [[Pisa]], the [[National Museum of Villa Guinigi]] in Lucca, the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].

'''''Brooklyn Bridge''''' is a 1915 painting by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. ''Brooklyn Bridge'' was exhibited at the Montross Gallery, New York, 1916 (no. 40) along with works by [[Jean Crotti]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/frick-31072002256933 ''Exhibition of pictures by Jean Crotti, Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger'', Montross Gallery, New York, April 4 to April 22, 1916]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the first in a series of three highly [[Abstract art|abstract]] paintings by Gleizes of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2191 Daniel Robbins, ''Albert Gleizes'', From Grove Art Online, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most abstract painting of the bridge to date. Gleizes and the Italian-American artist [[Joseph Stella]] had been friends since 1915 and it has been of interest to compare this painting with Stella's ''Brooklyn Bridge'' of 1919-20.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

The American collector [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]] acquired ''Brooklyn Bridge'' and several other works by Gleizes that had been on view at Montross Gallery, either during the exhibition or subsequently. In 1927, an exhibition and sale of Quinn's art collection took place in New York City. The sale was conducted by Otto Bernet and Hiram H. Parke at the American Art Galleries. A catalogue was published for the occasion by the [[American Art Association]]. ''Brooklyn Bridge'' (n. 263 of the catalogue) was purchased at the sale for $60.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/paintingssculptu00amer#page/110/mode/2up/search/gleizes ''Paintings and sculptures, The renowned collection of modern and ultra-modern art formed by the late John Quinn]'', Exhibition and sale at the American Art Galleries, Sale conducted by Bernet and Parke, Published by American Art Association, New York, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brooklyn Bridge'' forms part of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]] Founding Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/about-the-collection/new-york/solomon-r-guggenheim-founding-collection/1648 Solomon R.

The painting is in the permanent collection of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1465 Solomon R.

==Description==

''Brooklyn Bridge'' is an oil and gouache painting on canvas with dimensions 102 x 102&amp;nbsp;cm (40 1/8 x 40 1/8 inches) inscribed "Brooklyn Bridge, Alb. Gleizes, 15, lower right.

In a celebration of this feat of modernity, the architecture of the Brooklyn Bridge served as the inspiration for a series of works by Gleizes. In this first painting of the series, juxtaposed arabesques and distinctive diagonals interconnect dynamically, suggesting the bridge's complex architectonic engineering.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim N.Y."&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1470 Albert Gleizes, ''On Brooklyn Bridge (Sur Brooklyn Bridge)'', Guggenheim Museum, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

As in earlier works by Gleizes, this canvas is directly engaged with the environment. While highly abstract, ''Brooklyn Bridge'' maintains an evident visual basis. From 1914 to the end of the New York period, however nonrepresentational, works by the artist continued to be shaped by his personal experience, by the conviction that art was a social function, susceptible to theoretical formulation, and imbued with optimism.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/239 Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'']. Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' Gleizes and Metzinger wrote: "...let us admit that the reminiscence of natural forms cannot be banished—in any event, not yet. An art cannot be raised to the level of pure effusion at the first step."&lt;ref&gt;''Du "Cubisme"'', Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, Paris, Figuière, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, the transformation toward pure effusion would manifest itself in the ''Brooklyn Bridge'' and continue further still in subsequent works produced by the artist in New York.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; The features of the bridge are described by forceful rhythms and colors, even though the actual bridge itself has disappeared; superseded by a synthesis of Gleizes's plastic equivalents of physical reality. The three Brooklyn Bridge paintings are a prime example of Gleizes's experimentation with the plastic translation of one of his most treasured themes: ''the city which draws life from the river''.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Already, in his 1913 publication ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]'', [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] drew parallels between the work of Gleizes and the realization of metal constructions such as bridges:

:Majesty: this is what, above all, characterizes the art of Albert Gleizes. He thus brings a startling innovation to contemporary art. Something that before him was found in but few of the modern painters.&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9"&gt;[http://modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&amp;id=1299781650906252 ''The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters'', Vol. 9, No. 1: Stella Number, editor: Margaret C. Anderson, New York, 1922-09 (Autumn 1922), pp. 41&amp;ndash;59. The Modernist Journals Project, Brown University and The University of Tulsa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&amp;pg=PA220 Herschel Browning Chipp, Peter Selz, ''Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics'', University of California Press, 1968, pp. 221-248], {{ISBN|0-520-01450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:This majesty arouses and provokes the imagination; considered from the plastic point of view, it is the immensity of things.&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

:This art is vigorous. The pictures of Albert Gleizes are realized by a force of the same sort as that which realized the Pyramids and the Cathedrals, the constructions in metal, the bridges and the tunnels. (Apollinaire, 1913)&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

==Background==
Gleizes stated his admiration for the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in the first interview after his arrival in the United States, comparing it to the noblest achievements of European architecture.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

The Brooklyn Bridge was a key component of the New York landscape for the [[Ashcan School]], though it hadn't held for them the fascination that it did for the generation of modern artists that arrived or returned from Europe during the First World War.&lt;ref name="Kachur"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/research/brooklyn_bridge/pdf/GERB_08_The_Bridge_As_Icon.pdf Lewis Kachur, ''The Bridge As Icon'', Brooklyn Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Stella wrote of the Brooklyn Bridge: "Seen for the first time, as a weird metallic Apparition under a metallic sky, out of proportion with the winged lightness of its arch, traced for the conjunction of Worlds… it impressed me as the shrine containing all the efforts of the new civilization of America".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Stella, ''The Brooklyn Bridge (A page of my life)'', transition 16, June 1929, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt;

Albert Gleizes remarked: "the genius who built the Brooklyn Bridge is to be classed alongside the genius who built Notre Dame de Paris".&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes quoted in The Literary Digest, 51, November 27, 1915, p. 1225&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting Gleizes' claim that the Brooklyn Bridge belongs in the same category as the Notre Dame Cathedral, Marcel Duchamp said America's greatest works of art are its bridges and its plumbing.&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt; (Stella and [[Walter Arensberg]] accompanied Duchamp to a plumbing supply store in 1917 to purchase the infamous urinal, soon to be entitled ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' and signed "R.Mutt").&lt;ref&gt;Calvin Tomkins, ''Marcel Duchamp: A Biography'', Henry Holt, New York, 1996, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Stella, 1919-20, Brooklyn Bridge, oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, Yale University Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|230px|Joseph Stella, 1919-20, ''Brooklyn Bridge'', oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, [[Yale University Art Gallery]]]]
Whereas other proto-modernists such as [[Henry James]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]] pondered the bridge from a distance—contemplating its cultural and industrial aspects—artists like [[John Marin]], [[Max Weber]], [[Joseph Stella]] and Gleizes worked directly at the bridge itself, reveling in the personal experience.&lt;ref name="Richard Haw"&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=ungu-NmjQNgC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=gleizes,+Brooklyn+Bridge,+1915&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xfBo-eJqO0&amp;sig=S8yIHzZUdsuNv4xVbaQ6SXnSYsM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hHnPVNn0Ecuz7gbnuYCgDw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes&amp;f=false Richard Haw, ''Art of the Brooklyn Bridge: A Visual History'', Routledge, 2 October 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; This is what [[Alan Trachtenberg]] called “the classic moment” when the bridge—in front of the eyes—transforms itself from a public icon to “a private event”. The classic moment is not studied or pondered but entirely instant and radically subjective. It is a personal response to modernity of the unique structure, an attempt to “know the bridge from the inside”.&lt;ref name="Richard Haw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Trachtenberg, ''Brooklyn Bridge: Fact and Symbol'', Chicago, London, University of Chicago Press, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

Stemming back to his years at the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], the interest in ambitious subjects continued to inspire Albert Gleizes throughout the 1910s: ''[[Passy, Bridges of Paris (Gleizes)|Passy, Bridges of Paris]]'', ''[[La Chasse (painting)|La Chasse (The Hunt)]]'', ''[[Harvest Threshing|Harvest Threshing (Le Dépiquage des Moissons)]]'', ''[[Les Joueurs de football|Les Joueurs de football (Football Players)]]''. From 1915, Gleizes drew inspiration from the music of jazz, from the skyscrapers of New York, from neon signs, from the hustle and bustle of busy Manhattan streets and avenues such as Broadway, and from the Brooklyn Bridge; expressing the various sensations and vast drama of modern city life in an unprecedented series of works.&lt;ref name="Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the months of autumn, following his demobilization in 1915, Gleizes married Juliette Roche and moved to New York. There they were met by [[Carlos Salzedo]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Jean Crotti]] (who would eventually marry [[Suzanne Duchamp]]). Marcel Duchamp had emigrated to New York several months earlier after being judged physically unfit for his service in the military. Shortly after his arrival, Gleizes, accompanied by Salzedo, frequented jazz clubs in Harlem. With all it had to offer, New York had a strong impact on the artist's production.&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;

Gleizes had previously been to New York for the occasion of the [[Armory Show]] (which in 1913 introduced European [[modern art]] to an American audience), exhibiting his ''[[La Femme aux Phlox (Gleizes)|La Femme aux Phlox (Woman with Phlox)]]’’, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]], and ''[[Man on a Balcony|L'Homme au Balcon, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]’’, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

In New York Gleizes met [[Walter Pach]] (who he knew from Paris), [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]], [[Joseph Stella]], and participated in a show at Montross Gallery (April 1916)—exhibiting Brooklyn Bridge—with Duchamp, Crotti and Metzinger (who remained in Paris). At this exhibition the group was dubbed 'The Four Musketeers' in the press.&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2011/04/artseen/jean-crotti-inhabiting-abstraction John Yau, Jean Croti, Inhabiting Abstraction, The Brooklyn Rail, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=j_9DhsBoyS4C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=musketeers,+walter+pach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=geNJiQtL7r&amp;sig=4l8dEZlDUt7u1aF3Kypfygl_-1w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MOnPVKzRDIee7gaPsoDoDA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=musketeers%2C%20walter%20pach&amp;f=false Laurette E.

After Gleizes returned to Europe, Stella became interested in the Bridge as a motif. In Paris, from 1911 to 1912, Stella had been in contact with the Cubists and Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]], who admired contemporary concepts of the future, including motion, speed and technological triumphs of humanity over nature. When he return to New York he moved to Brooklyn and there found in the Bridge the perfect vehicle for his Futurist vision, though he was also interested in the structural experiments of the Cubists and the dynamic color of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]].&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Haskell, ''Joseph Stella'', Whitney Museum of American Art (exhibition catalogue), New York, 1994, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstraction==
Gleizes' ''Brooklyn Bridge'' (his first painting of the bridge) was the most abstract image made of the bridge to date.&lt;ref name="Kachur" /&gt; His second version, also of 1915, measuring 148.1 x 120.4&amp;nbsp;cm (58¼ x 47 3/8in.), is entirely abstract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/albert-gleizes-brooklyn-bridge-3948030-details.aspx Albert Gleizes, 1915, Brooklyn Bridge, oil and sand on cardboard, 148.1 x 120.4 cm (58¼ x 47 3/8in.), Christie's London, Impressionist and Modern Evening Sale, Lot 14, 25 June 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; His third and last oil painting of the series, dated 1917 and entitled ''On Brooklyn Bridge (Sur Brooklyn Bridge)'', [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York,&lt;ref name="Guggenheim N.Y." /&gt; measures 161.8 x 129.5&amp;nbsp;cm (63 3/4 x 51 in.). This composition relates most closely with a 1915 drawing (25 x 19&amp;nbsp;cm). It is an attempt to synthesize New York City under the symbol of the bridge through a collection of unifying circles, spheres and arcs. In the composition Gleizes portrays both ends of the bridge with the East River below. The Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn appear in the distance. This 1917 canvas—the least abstract of the three—more so than the other paintings of the series, resembles Stella's 1919-20 painting.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

Non-objective painting rarely has to do with realistic qualities and yet it is still bound to the logic of painting as representational of the subject matter. In Andrei Nakov's study, ''Abstract/Concrete - Russian and Polish Non-objective Art'', non-representation itself becomes the impetus for depicting a subject. In his last book, ''Painting and on Man become Painter'', written in 1948, Gleizes warns against the trend of non-representation becoming an end unto itself, insisting on the importance, instead, of [[esemplastic]] qualities. For Gleizes, the latter prevails over the concepts of representational or abstract qualities of the painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;

Toward the end of 1913 Gleizes defended the need for a representational subject matter in 'Opinion' published by [[Ricciotto Canudo]] in Monjoie!, but it was for reasons that were entirely plastic and non-representational at the same time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We are agreed that anecdote counts for nothing in a painted work. It is a pretext, so be it, but a pretext which we should not reject. Through a certain coefficient of imitation we will verify the legitimacy of the things we have discovered, the picture will not be reduced to the merely pleasurable arabesque of an oriental carpet, and we will obtain an infinite variety which would otherwise be impossible. (Gleizes, 1913)&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', Gleizes writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As we can see straightaway, it is not a matter of describing, nor is it a matter of abstracting from, anything that is external to itself. There is a concrete act that has to be realized, a reality to be produced - of the same order as that which everyone is prepared to recognize in music, at the lowest level of the esemplastic scale, and in architecture, at the highest.&lt;ref&gt;The hierarchy of esemplastic acts is a primary theme of the theoretical ''Essai de Généralisation'' which Gleizes intended to attach to ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'' when it was published by the Bauhaus&lt;/ref&gt; Like any natural, physical reality, painting, understood in this way, will touch anyone who knows how to enter into it, not through their opinions on something that exists independently of it, but through its own existence, through those inter-relations, constantly in movement, which enable us to transmit life itself. (Gleizes, 1928)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic ''Albert Gleizes, The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form''], published in a German version in 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', in Bauhausbücher. The French version was published as ''L’Epopée'' (''The Epic''), in the journal Le Rouge et le Noir, 1929. Translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The craft of [[cloisonné]] [[overglaze decoration|enameling]] is a metal and glass-working tradition practiced in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 12th century. The Byzantines perfected an intricate form of vitreous enameling, allowing the illustration of small, detailed, iconographic portraits.

== Overview ==
	The development of the Byzantine enamel art occurred between the 6th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enamelwork|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/enamelwork|website=Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] perfected a form of [[Vitreous enamel|enameling]] called [[cloisonné]], where gold strips are [[Soldering|soldered]] to a metal base plate making the outline of an image. The recessed spaces between the gold filigreed wire are then filled with a colored glass paste, or flux, that fills up the negative space in the design with whatever color chosen. Byzantine enamels usually depict a person of interest, often a member of the imperial family or a Christian icon. Enamels, because they are created from expensive materials such as gold, are often very small. Occasionally they are made into medallions that act as decorative jewelry or are set in ecclesiastical designs such as book covers, liturgical equipment like the [[chalice]] and [[paten]], or in some examples, royal crowns. Collections of small enamels may be set together to make a larger, narrative display, such as in the [[Pala d'Oro]] altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Marian|title=An Introduction to Medieval Enamels|date=1983|publisher=Stemmer House Publishers, Inc.|location=Owings Mills, Maryland|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the examples of Byzantine enamel known today have been repurposed into a new setting, making dating particularly difficult where no inscriptions or identifiable persons are visible. The [[Crusaders|Latin Crusaders]], who sacked [[Constantinople]] in 1204, took many examples of Byzantine enamel with them back West. The destruction of Constantinople meant that the production of enamel artwork went into downfall in the 13th century. It is possible that many examples left in the city were melted down and repurposed by the [[Ottoman Empire]], who cared little about the religious significance of the art and could reuse the gold but not the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wessel|first1=Klaus|title=Byzantine Enamels|date=1967|publisher=New York Graphic Society Ltd.|location=Greenwich, CT|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The art of [[vitreous enamel]]ing is an ancient practice with origins that are hard to pinpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel p.11&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few places that Byzantine craftsmen could have picked up the technique. Enameling is thought to have existed in an early form in [[ancient Egypt]], where examples of gold ornaments containing glass paste separated by strips of gold have been found in tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are questions about whether the Egyptians were using actual enameling techniques; it is possible that instead they were casting glass stones which were then enclosed, set into metal frames, and then sanded to a finish, similarly to how precious stones are set.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  In first century BCE Nubia, a method appears of soldering gold strips to a metal base, most often gold, and then filling in the sectioned off recesses with glass flux. This method, called cloisonné, later became the preferred style of enameling in the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Darbringung Christi KGM 27-19.jpg|thumb|Darbringung Christi enamel]]

The enamel workshops within the Byzantine Empire likely perfected their techniques through their connections with [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] examples.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks were already experts in enameling, soldering a filagree onto a flat base and later adding a paste of glass, or a liquid flux, to the base piece.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The entire work was then fired, melting the glass paste into the frame to create the finished work. Occasionally, the ancient Greek craftsman would apply the glass flux to the base with the aid of a brush.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]], who were experienced in glass production already, would carve a recess into the base plate and then pour glass flux into each enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The metal peeking through between the recessed glass would create the outline of the image. This technique is called [[champlevé]], and is considerably easier than the cloisonné form of enameling practiced by the Greeks and Byzantines.

== Byzantine enamel tradition ==
The Byzantines were the first craftsmen to begin illustrating detailed miniature scenes in enamel. A few examples of early Byzantine enamel frames missing the glass flux have been found, and it has been hypothesized that they were used as educational tools in workshops. Some incomplete enamel base plates show indentations marking the line to which the gold wire would be attached, indicating how designs were outlined before soldering and enameling began. Because they were not carving recesses into a base plate and then filling the hole with glass flux, Byzantine workers could also use gold wire to create patterns that would not separate recesses from one another, resulting in a style that appears more like a drawn line.

Most of the Byzantine enamels known today are from the 9th to 12th centuries. The period of [[Iconoclasm]] from 726-787 CE meant that most examples predating the 8th century were destroyed because of their iconographic nature, though there are a few examples thought to have been made earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of Byzantine enamel work is a medallion created in either the late 5th or early 6th century and features a bust portrait of [[Licinia Eudoxia|Empress Eudoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The period after Iconoclasm saw an upswing in the production of iconic portraits, to which the intricate form of cloisonné developed by the Byzantines lends itself easily. Most enamel works known today have been housed in western Europe since the beginning of the 13th century. Any examples of enamel work still inside Constantinople immediately prior to its destruction were lost or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Enamels are considered a "[[Minor arts|Minor Art]]" because of their small size, which likely led to their increase in use as decoration for small, portable containers holding holy [[relics]]. In this tradition, many enameled pieces found their way to the western empire by way of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] and gifts from the imperial family in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The high value and relatively small size of enamel pieces meant that they were made for an aristocratic audience, most likely commissioned by the imperial family, often as gifts for other royals or for the churches they patronized. For example, there is evidence that Emperor [[Justinian II]] (565-578) sent enamels to [[Radegund|Queen Radegund]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible transmission for Byzantine enamels to the west came in the form of imperial marriages. In 927, the German [[Emperor Otto II]] married the niece of the Byzantine [[John I Tzimisces|Emperor John I Tzimisces]], princess [[Theophanu]], and she supposedly introduced imperial goldsmiths and enamelers to the German church.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous examples of Byzantine enamel are ''staurothekes'', relics containing fragments of the [[True Cross]], which were greatly prized in both the east and the west, therefore more survive still in modern collections. It is likely that a ''staurotheke'' was one of the first gifts sent from the East to the West. There is some evidence that the Crusaders carried the reliquaries in front of their military campaigns as Byzantine emperors were known to have presented them.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Reliquary True Cross c800 Byzantine.jpg|thumb|Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke]]

== Notable examples ==

=== Fieschi-Morgan Staurotheke ===
[[File:Monomacho's crown - circa 1042 Budapest.JPG|thumb|Monomachus Crown - early 11th century]]
The [[Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke|Fieschi-Morgan Staurotheke]] is an example of Byzantine enameling dating to the early 9th century, though some suggest as early of a creation date as 700. It was quite possibly made in Constantinople, though there are debates around its origins, some suggesting it was made in Syria based on the inconsistencies in the Greek lettering.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel p.43&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently housed in [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Supposedly, the Fiesch-Morgan Staurotheke belonged to [[Pope Innocent IV]] and was brought to the west by the [[Fieschi family|Fieschi]] family during the Crusades.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The lid of the box features Christ on the crucifix, a style not usually seen in Byzantine art until the end of the 6th century, remaining uncommon throughout the period. The work is not particularly refined, signaling the creator was perhaps not familiar with cloisonné work.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holy Crown of Hungary]], also known as [[Saint Stephen's Crown|St. Stephen's Crown]], has been used as the coronation crown of Hungary since the year 1000, when the Hungarian royals introduced Christianity to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Return of the Holy Crown of St. Stephen|url=http://hungary.usembassy.gov/holy_crown.html|access-date=2016-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103608/http://hungary.usembassy.gov/holy_crown.html#|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains mostly Byzantine enamelwork originating from Constantinople, though it isn't proven they were crafted originally for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; The enamels are mounted around the base, with several plaques attached at the top. One enamel shows Christ, seated on the imperial throne and giving blessing.  Another enamel, positioned at the back of the crown, illustrates a bust portrait of [[Michael VII Ducas|Emperor Michael VII Ducas]] (1071-1078), next to another plaque of his son [[Constantine Doukas|Constantine]]. The Hungarian [[Géza I of Hungary|King Géza I]] (1074-1077) is also featured, though he is not wearing a nimbus like Michael VII Ducas or Constantine, which indicates his status as lower than that of the Byzantine Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beresford Hope Cross ===
The [[Beresford Hope Cross]] is a pectoral cross intended for use as a reliquary.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; On one side Christ is depicted at the Crucifixion, while the other shows Mary praying between busts of John the Baptist, Perter, Andrew, and Paul. The dating is contentious, but most agree it was made in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The style is similar to the Fieschi-Morgan Staurotheke; the cloisonné of both is unrefined and stylistically sloppy compared to other examples. The inconsistencies in the Greek lettering on the cross mean that it is possible the piece was not made in the Byzantine Empire, but in southern Italy, where the [[Lombards]] had active metal workshops of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with dating and origins ==
Many examples of Byzantine enamel are hard to date because of a lack of inscription or identifiable individual. In these cases, guesses must be made to the date of the object in question through a comparison with similar objects with known dates. This can be done by examining material sources and by comparing styles. For example, objects with green glass composed of similar material might be grouped within a similar date range. Origins of Byzantine enamel work are often even harder to pinpoint, as nearly everything made has been housed in the West since the early 13th century. One way of guessing the origins of a piece is by examining the quality of the Greek lettering; the more accurate the Greek, the more likely the work came directly from the Byzantine Empire.

== Byzantine influence on Germanic metalwork ==
The [[Migration Period]] of [[early medieval]] art sees a concurrent form of metalwork influenced by the [[Goths]]' migration through the eastern Roman Empire into the west, accumulating techniques and materials from Byzantine and [[Mediterranean]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nees|first1=Lawrence|title=Early Medieval Art|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of using traditional Byzantine enamel techniques, they often employed a [[chip-carving]] technique, where stones such as [[garnets]] are cut to fit into a wire frame. This has the appearance of cloisonné, but is more similar to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] Egyptian style. The appearance of cloisonné jewelry from Germanic workshops in the mid-5th century is a complete break with the culture’s traditions, signaling that they likely picked up the technique from the east, where the Byzantine Empire was gaining a foothold as the center of the [[Late Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deppert-Lippitz|first1=Barbara|title=Late Roman and Early Byzantine Jewelry in the Mid 5th Century|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that Late-Roman workshops in Constantinople produced semi-manufactured enamel parts intended for assembly in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arrhenius|first=Birgit|authorlink=Birgit Arrhenius|title=Garnet Jewelry of the Fifth and Sixth Centuries|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Danza de los Voladores''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈdansa ðe loz βolaˈðoɾes}}; "Dance of the Flyers"), or '''''Palo Volador''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈpalo βolaˈðoɾ|pron}}; "flying pole"), is an ancient [[Mesoamerica]]n ceremony/ritual still performed today, albeit in modified form, in isolated pockets in Mexico. It is believed to have originated with the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Huastec people|Huastec]] and [[Otomi people|Otomi]] peoples in central Mexico, and then spread throughout most of Mesoamerica.  The ritual consists of dance and the climbing of a 30-meter pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground. The fifth remains on top of the pole, dancing and playing a flute and drum.  According to one myth, the ritual was created to ask the gods to end a severe drought. Although the ritual did not originate with the [[Totonac]] people, today it is strongly associated with them, especially those in and around [[Papantla]] in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name="wilkerson7576"&gt;{{Cite book|title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffrey K |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9 |pages= 75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceremony was named an [[Intangible cultural heritage]] by [[UNESCO]] in order to help the ritual survive and thrive in the modern world.&lt;ref name="mcclat"&gt;{{Cite news|title='Flying Men' are now Cultural Heritage |newspaper=McClatchy - Tribune Business News |location=Washington, D.C. |date=2009-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Folding_Screen_with_Indian_Wedding_and_Flying_Pole_(Biombo_con_desposorio_indígena_y_palo_volador)_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|left|Mexican Indian wedding and voladores, ca. 1690]]
[[File:Nebel Voyage 21 Indios.jpg|thumb|left|Voladores ca. 1836, by [[Carl Nebel]]]]
According to Totonac myth, at least 450 years ago{{When|date=September 2018}} there was a severe drought that brought hunger to the people. The gods were withholding the rain because the people had neglected them.  The ceremony was created, to appease the gods and bring back the rains. In some versions of the story, the ritual is created by the old men of a village, who then chose five young men who were chaste. In other versions, the five men themselves create the ritual. The tallest tree in the nearby forest is cut down, with the permission of the mountain god, stripped of branches and dragged to the village. The trunk is erected with much ceremony. The youths climb the pole and four jump off while the fifth played music. The ritual pleased the rain god [[Xipe Totec]] and other gods, so the rains began again and the fertility of the earth returned.&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leyendas"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.municipiopapantla.gob.mx/content/view/94/17/ |title=LEYENDAS DE LOS VOLADORES |publisher=Municipality of Papantla |location=Papantla, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Legends of the Voladores |accessdate=11 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact origin of this ritual/dance is unknown, but it is thought to have originated with the Huastec, Nahua and Otomi peoples  in Sierra de Puebla and mountain areas of [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name="itesmorigenes"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.mty.itesm.mx/dhcs/deptos/co/co95-832/Proy_2002_S1/VoladoresPapantla/html/t-origenesdelritual.htm |title=Origenses  |publisher=[[ITESM]] |location=Monterrey, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Origins |accessdate=11 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arteshistoria"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts-history.mx/banco/index.php?id_nota=24062004102402 |title=Los Voladores de Papantla, la representación del cosmos en una danza aérea |first=Manuel |last=Zavala y Alonso |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094325/http://www.arts-history.mx/banco/index.php?id_nota=24062004102402 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkerson75"&gt;{{Cite book|title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors |last= Wilkerson |first= S.

The participants were thought to impersonate birds and in some areas were dressed as [[parrot]]s, [[macaw]]s, [[quetzal]]s and eagles. These birds represented the gods of the earth, air, fire, and water. By the 16th century, the ritual was strongly associated with solar ceremonies, such as the spring equinox.&lt;ref name="wilkerson75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vuelan"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.municipiopapantla.gob.mx/content/view/21/30/ |title=El lugar de los Hombres que Vuelan |publisher=Municipality of Papantla |location=Papantla, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The place of the Men that Fly |accessdate=11 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626163359/http://www.municipiopapantla.gob.mx/content/view/21/30/ |archivedate=26 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual is most closely tied with rain and solar deities such as Xipe, Totec and Tlazotlteotl.&lt;ref name="itesmorigenes"/&gt;

In [[Maya mythology]] the creation of the world is associated with a mythical bird deity ([[Itzamna#Principal Bird Deity|Itzamna]]) residing at the [[Mesoamerican world tree|World Tree]] (the center of the world). Five "birdmen" at the top of a pole represent bird deities. The main dancer stands in the center and plays a flute, which represents the sound of birds singing. The four other "birdmen" (representing the four directions) spin around the pole to represent the recreation of the world (and the regeneration of life)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Coppens | first = Philip | title = Rebuilding Creation | publisher = Philipcoppens.com  | url = http://www.philipcoppens.com/rebuildingcreation.html  | accessdate = 2010-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early form, instead of only five men there are six men dressed as birds with each member climbing on top and performing a dance and at the end tied ropes around their waist and who all jump in unison and descend downwards.  Many villages in Mexico banned this version of the practice due to injuries and even death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q3YzT6TaKu2o0AHgjvW_Ag&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The Weird Birdsmen of Mexico"] ''Popular Mechanics'', pp. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diego Durán]], who recorded many Aztec customs at the time of the Spanish conquest, described an incident reminiscent of the Danza de los Voladores, where an Aztec prince, Ezhuahuacatl, sacrificed himself by diving from a pole 20 ''brazas'' high (probably about 120 feet, a ''braza'' being roughly a [[fathom]], i.e. c. 6 feet).&lt;ref&gt;Durán, Diego (1994) ''The History of the Indies of New Spain'', translated and annotated by Doris Heyden, University of Oklahoma Press, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  The four modern day voladores typically circle the pole 13 times each, for a total of 52 circuits, or the number of years in the [[Aztec calendar|Aztec "calendar round"]].&lt;ref&gt;Heyden, p. 143.&lt;br&gt;Headrick, Annabeth (2002) "The Great Goddess at Teotihuacan" in Andrea Stone, ed. ''Heart of Creation: the Mesoamerican World and the Legacy of Linda Schele'', [[University of Alabama Press]], Tuscaloosa, Alabama, {{ISBN|0-8173-1138-6}}, pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual was partially lost after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], and the Spaniards destroyed many records about it.  The Church was much against "pagan" rituals such as these after the Conquest and this and many other rituals were silenced or practiced in secret. Much of what is known is due to oral tradition and writing by the first Europeans to come to Mexico. Later, Catholic elements would be added to the ritual, and it became something of a spectacle in the later colonial period. The ritual mostly disappeared in Mexico and Central America with small remnants surviving, including the Totonac people.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

Although the ritual did not originate with the Totonacs, today it is often associated with the Totonacs of the Papantla area in Veracruz.&lt;ref name="itesmorigenes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt; In modern times, a number of changes have occurred. Due to the deforestation of much of the Sierra de Puebla and mountain areas of Veracruz, most voladores perform on permanent metal poles, which in Veracruz are often donated by the oil industry.&lt;ref name="wilkerson75"/&gt;  The most controversial change has been the induction of women to perform the ceremony. Traditionally, it has been taboo to allow women to become voladores but a few have become such, all of whom are in Puebla state. One of the first males to train women, Jesús Arroyo Cerón, died when he fell from a pole during the Cumbre Tajín 2006 cultural festival&lt;ref name="cumbre_tajin2006"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Cae volador de Papantla del palo ceremonial durante la Cumbre Tajín |first=Andres T |last=Morales |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/03/21/index.php?section=espectaculos&amp;article=a09n1esp |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=2006-03-21 |accessdate=2018-05-08 |language=Spanish |trans-title= Volador of Papantla falls from ritual pole during Cumbre Tajín }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Versions==
In addition to whether or not there is a pole ceremony, other variations in the ritual exist. Among the Nahua and Otomi peoples, there is generally no dance before climbing the pole; the ceremony begins at the top. There is also a version where the suspended frame has five sides instead of four and the ritual involves six dancers and not five. The most traditional time to perform this version is on Holy Thursday at the culmination of a festival held on this day called the Huapangueada. Some dancers have rules to follow such as needing to fast for one or more days before the ceremony and abstain from sexual relations so that the gods will look upon the ceremony favorably.&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt;  Most of the variations are found in Puebla state.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;
However, the most controversial variation is whether or not to permit women to perform the ritual. In Papantla, which is the community most closely associated with the ritual. The Consejo de Ancianos Totonacas (Council of Totonac Elders) has formally prohibited the inclusion of women. Traditionally, women have been excluded from all Totonac ritual dancing.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt; Even for the dance called La Maringuilla, the female protagonist is portrayed by a man.&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt;  The prohibition stems from the belief that women are “bad entities, who bring bad luck” and their inclusion would be a sin and/or anger the gods.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt;

However, in a few communities, such as [[Cuetzalan]]  and [[Pahuatlán]] in Puebla and [[Zozocolco de Hidalgo]] in Veracruz, women have been allowed to be voladores.&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt;  Those who are allowed to take part must first complete a series of rituals designed to ask the forgiveness of the gods and Catholic saints for being a woman.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt; The women must also be virgins without a boyfriend if unmarried or abstain from sexual relations before the ritual if married. If a female volador is found to have broken the rules of sexual abstention, she is taken to an altar which is surrounded by incense burners and candles. An image of the [[Archangel Michael]] or [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] bears witness to the punishment, which involves a number of slaps to the face (bofetadas), with the quantity depending on the transgression and the decision of those in charge. It is claimed that the ritual cures “the fever” of the woman. It is believed that women who do not obey these rules will bring calamity to the ritual.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt;

It is not known when the first female was allowed to take part as a volador.&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt;  One of the first men to train women was Jesús Arroyo Ceron, who trained his daughter Isabel in 1972; after this, he trained his other three daughters. In March 2006, aged 70, he fell from a pole during the Cumbre Tajín celebrations and died. Family members believe he fell “at the side of the gods,” but many patriarchs believe the accident was divine retribution. A wooden cross and flowers at the Plaza del Volador in Parke Takilhsukut memorialize him.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt;  Approximately twenty female voladores are known to exist.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

In [[Guatemala]] the flying pole dance, called ''Palo volador'', is still celebrated in [[Joyabaj]] (15 August), [[Chichicastenango]] (17–23 January) and [[Cubulco]] (26 July).&lt;ref name="elPeriodico2010-01-17"&gt;Escobar. Lucía.  "[http://elperiodico.com.gt/es/20100117/domingo/133014 El palo volador] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605095217/http://elperiodico.com.gt/es/20100117/domingo/133014 |date=2015-06-05 }}". In ''ElPeriódico'', 17 January 2010. Guatemala.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Totonac version===
According to Totonac myth, the gods told men, “Dance, and we shall observe.”  Today, pleasing the gods of old is still a part of the most traditional version of the ritual.&lt;ref name="mexdes1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6344-Los-voladores-de-Papantla-%28Veracruz%29 |title=Los voladores de Papantla (Veracruz) |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418010531/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6344-Los-voladores-de-Papantla-%28Veracruz%29 |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Totonac dress for this ritual consists of red pants with a white shirt, a cloth across the chest and a cap. The pants, hat and chest cloth are heavily embroidered and otherwise decorated. The cloth across the chest symbolized blood. The hat is adorned with flowers for fertility; mirrors represent the sun and from the top stream multicolored ribbons representing the rainbow.&lt;ref name="wilkerson75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;  These costumes are made by the voladores themselves and can cost between 5,000 and 8,000 pesos each.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

The most traditional and lengthy version starts from the selection and cutting of the tree to be used, to the final dance after all voladores have descended from the pole. The tree selection, cutting and erecting ceremony is called the tsakáe kiki. It involves going into the forest to find a suitable tree and asking the permission or the pardon of the mountain god Quihuicolo for taking it. The tree is stripped of its branches and dragged to the ceremonial site, where a hole has been dug for the now-30-meter pole. Before erecting the pole, offerings of flowers, copal, alcohol, candles and live chickens or a live turkey are placed in the hole. These are then crushed as the pole is erected, adding to the fertility of the earth.&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt; The pole becomes a connection point between the sky and the earth and the underworld with the surface world, a representation of the [[Mesoamerican world tree|world tree]], and considered to be the fifth cardinal direction of the earth.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="itesmritual"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.mty.itesm.mx/dhcs/deptos/co/co95-832/Proy_2002_S1/VoladoresPapantla/html/t-ritual.htm |title=Ritual  |publisher=[[ITESM]] |location=Monterrey, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The post and the dancers are then purified with alcohol sprinkled in the form of a cross and  tobacco smoke.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

In most cases, however, the pole used is a permanently placed one, often of steel, and this part of the ceremony does not take place. On these occasions, the ceremony begins with a dance and song type called a “[[son (music)|son]].” Usually the initial song played and danced to is called the “son of forgiveness.”&lt;ref name="itesmritual"/&gt;  After this, the five begin to climb the pole with the chief or “caporal” going first. The caporal will not descend but rather will stay at the top of the pole until near the end of the ceremony.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt; The caporal stands on a [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]], called a manzana (apple) which is a small platform at the top of the pole. From this capstan is suspended a square frame called a cuadro (square) on which the other four voladores sit. While these four wind the ropes around the pole and tie themselves to the ends, the caporal plays the flute and drum acknowledging the four cardinal directions, beginning with the east because it is believed life came from this direction. The four ropes are each wound thirteen times for a total of fifty-two, the number of years in a Mesoamerican great year.  The caporal then bends fully backwards to acknowledge the sun, playing all the while.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="itesmritual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkerson76"&gt;{{Cite book|title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffrey K |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four voladores represent the four cardinal directions as well as the four elements: earth, air, fire and water. The caporal represents the fifth sun. The four voladores seated on the cuadro face the caporal and at the appropriate moment fall backwards to descend to the ground suspended by the wound ropes. As the ropes unwind, the voladores spin, creating a moving pyramid shape. As the other voladores descend, the caporal plays  the “son of goodbye” and dances on the narrow platform.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes1"/&gt;  Traditionally, after the descent, there is another dance of goodbye.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

==Intangible Cultural Heritage and conservation of the tradition==
[[File:Voladores from Veracruz performing in Puerto Vallarta.jpg|thumb|Voladores displaying their costumes used in performance in Puerto Vallarta]]
[[File:Rito de los voladores.jpg|thumb|Voladores in Teotihuacan]]
The Ritual Ceremony of the Voladores of Papantla was recognized as [[Intangible cultural heritage]] (ICH) by [[UNESCO]] in 2009. This is the second Mexican event to be so recognized, with the first being the Indigenous Festivity of the Dead in 2008. Governor [[Fidel Herrera Beltrán]] received the award in the name of the people and the government of Veracruz, and especially the indigenous people of the Totonacapan region of the state. Celebrations of the recognition took place on October 12, 2009, in Takilhsukut Park at [[El Tajín]] and other volador sites in Mexico.&lt;ref name="mcclat"/&gt; The ritual was inscribed along with the Traditions of the Otomi-Chichimecas of Toliman, Peña de [[Bernal, Querétaro]].&lt;ref name="toliman"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Voladores de Papantla y tradiciones de Tolimán, patrimonio de la humanidad |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/10/01/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=a06n1cul |agency= Periódico La Jornada |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date= 2009-10-01 |page=6 |accessdate=2010-02-11 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Voladores of Papantla and traditions of Toliman, world heritage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recognition carries the responsibility for Mexico to safeguard and promote the tradition to keep it alive. A part of the nomination process was an extensive regional plan of preservation, promotion and development of the cultural heritage in Veracruz and other parts of Mexico and Central America.&lt;ref name="mcclat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt;
One effort that has been underway is the establishment of the Escuela de Niños Voladores (School of Volador Children), which is located at Takilhsukut Park and is the first formal school for voladores. It has a student population of between 70 and 100 students who learn about the history, significance and values associated with the ritual from the pre-Hispanic period. These include those associated with the taking of the pole, called a tsakáe kiwi, from the forest, an aspect of the ritual that is in danger of extinction. The school is sponsored by the Veracruz state government and children begin attending between 6 and 8 years of age. Most come from the neighboring communities of Plan de Hidalgo, El Tajín, San Lorenzo and Arroyos del Arco and Oxital, and whose fathers and grandfathers are voladores. The school requires students to meet certain requirements, such as being able to speak Totonac and girls are not permitted. However, most voladores learn the ritual from their fathers and grandfathers starting at age eight or ten.&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jhernandez"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Crean escuela de 'niños voladores' |first=Julian |last=Hernandez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=2009-04-19 |page=15 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Schoold created for "Volador Children" }}&lt;/ref&gt; To become a volador in the traditional Totonac community requires 10 to 12 years ofpreparation and many consider it to be a life vocation.&lt;ref name="jhernandez"/&gt;

Another effort to conserve and promote the tradition is the Encuentro de Voladores (Volador Encounter), which was begun in 2009 and coincides with the Cumbre Tajín spring equinox event of the El Tajín site. For five days, voladores from various places perform at the poles erected at the site. The objective is not only to see the different costumes and styles of the groups but to share experiences about the fertility ritual. Voladores come from as far as [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="rreyes"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Tajín, un espacio para vivir la magia |first= Regina |last= Reyes-Heroles C |url= http://www.cnnexpansion.com/viajes/2009/02/23/tajin-un-espacio-para-vivir-la-magia |newspaper=CNN Expansion |date= 2009-02-25 |accessdate=2010-02-09 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Tajin, a space to experience the magic }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cguerrero"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Bienvenida al equinoccio: Tajin |first=Carla |last=Guerrero |newspaper=Reforma  |location=Mexico City |date=2004-03-14 |page=11 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Welcome to the equinox: Tajin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason for the need of protection is that in most cases in Mexico, the ritual is not performed for religious purposes.&lt;ref name="wilkerson75"/&gt;  The first organization for voladores came about in the 1970s but also the commercialization of the ritual.&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt; There are about 600 professional voladores in Mexico.&lt;ref name="salvaguardar"&gt;{{cite press release |title= Instaurarán consejo para salvaguardar el ritual de los Voladores de Papantla |publisher= [[CONACULTA]]|date=2009-10-09 |url= http://www.conaculta.gob.mx/sala_prensa_detalle.php?id=2207 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Creating a council to safeguard the ritual of the Voladores of Papantla |accessdate=2010-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In smaller communities, the ritual is enacted only on the feast day of the community’s patron saint or other religious events, but in larger communities, especially where there are tourists, it is performed as an attraction for donations.&lt;ref name="arteshistoria"/&gt; Two examples of this are the voladores that perform in Xcaret and Xel-Ha,&lt;ref name="xcaret"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Xcaret y Xel-Ha: 'Pequena caleta', diversion grande |newspaper=El Norte  |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=2005-05-22 |page=10 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Xcaret and Xel Ha:Little Heat, Big Fun}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Totonac voladores in Chapultepec Park in Mexico City, who are one of the parks major attractions.&lt;ref name="eneldf"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Una tradicion de Veracruz en el DF |newspaper=Reforma  |location=Mexico City |date=2006-01-08 |page=5 |language=Spanish |trans-title=A Veracruz tradition in the Distrito Federal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups of voladores try to balance respect for the ritual while still performing for spectators. There is a formal established group in [[Boca del Río, Veracruz|Boca del Río]] that has been recognized by municipal authorities and receives support in the way of space and a permanent pole.. The goal of the group is to offer to tourists a dignified version of the ritual at the Plaza Bandera that does not forget its roots. Members of the group are all natives of the city of Papantla. The ceremony is held in a public park and youths are required to leave items such as bicycles and skateboards outside the ceremonial space.&lt;ref name="cmartinez"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Entregan reconocimiento a Voladores de Papantla |url= http://www.xeu.com.mx/nota.cfm?id=193268 |last =Martinez |first=Carlos  |newspaper= XEU Noticias  |location=Mexico City |date= 2010-01-25 |page=6 |accessdate=2010-02-11 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Recognition given to the Voladores of Papantla }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote the ritual and the culture behind it internationally, groups of voladores have performed in many parts of Mexico and other countries as part of cultural festivals.&lt;ref name="arteshistoria"/&gt; Voladores have performed at the Zapopum Festival in [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]],&lt;ref name="zapopum"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Espectáculos Zapo¡pum! |newspaper=Mural  |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=2006-12-11 |page=10 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Zapopum!

'''Divine language''', the '''[[language]] of the [[deity|gods]]''', or, in [[monotheism]], the '''language of [[God]]''' (or [[angels]]) is the concept of a [[mystical]] or divine [[proto-language]], which predates and supersedes human speech.

==Abrahamic traditions==
{{Further|Adamic language}}
In Judaism and Christianity, it is unclear whether the language used by God to address [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] was the language of Adam, who as name-giver ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:19) used it to name all living things, or if it was a different divine language. But since God is portrayed as using speech during creation, and as addressing Adam before Gen 2:19, some authorities assumed that the language of God was different from the language of Paradise invented by Adam, while most medieval [[Jewish]] authorities maintained that the [[Hebrew language]] was the language of God, which was accepted in Western Europe from at least the 16th century and until the early 20th century. {{clarification needed|date=December 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;[[Kees Versteegh|Versteegh, Kees]], ''The Arabic language'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; {{better source needed|date=December 2015}}

The sacred language in Islam is [[Classical Arabic]], which is a descendant of the [[Proto-Semitic language]]. Arabic, along with Hebrew and Aramaic, is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]]. {{cn|date=December 2015}} It is considered to be sacred, as, in the Muslim view, it is the language by which Allah revealed the final revealed book, the [[Quran]], to [[Muhammad]], [[Prophet of Islam]], through the angel ''[[Jibril]]''.

==Indic traditions==
In [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], "speech" [[Vāc]], i.e. the language of liturgy, now known as [[Vedic Sanskrit]], was considered the language of the gods.

Later Hindu scholarship, in particular the [[Mīmāṃsā]] school of Vedic hermeneutics,  distinguished ''Vāc'' from ''[[Śábda]]'', a distinction comparable to the Saussurian [[langue and parole]]. The concept of [[Sphoṭa]] was introduced as a kind of transcendent aspect of ''Śábda''.

==Occultism==
In 1510, [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] published Book I of his ''De Occulta Philosophia'' (translated to English in 1651 as ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''). Chapter 23 of the book is entitled "Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst themselves, and with us" - wherein he states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We might doubt whether Angels, or Demons, since they are of pure spirits, use any vocal speech, or tongue amongst themselves, or to us; but that Paul in some place saith, If I speak with the tongue of men, or angels: but what their speech or tongue is, is much doubted by many. For many think that if they use any Idiome, it is [[Hebrew]], because that was the first of all, and came from heaven, and was before the [[confusion of languages]] in Babylon, in which the Law was given by God the Father, and the Gospell was preached by Christ the Son, and so many Oracles were given to the Prophets by the Holy Ghost: and seeing all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions, this alone doth alwaies continue inviolated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, in chapter 27, Agrippa mentions the Divine Language again:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But because the letters of every tongue, as we shewed in the first book, have in their number, order, and figure a Celestiall and Divine originall, I shall easily grant this calculation concerning the names of spirits to be made not only by Hebrew letters, but also by Chaldean, and Arabick, Ægyptian, Greek, Latine, and any other...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 16th century, the Elizabethan mathematician and scholar [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and the medium and alchemist [[Edward Kelley]] (both of whom were familiar with Agrippa's writings) claimed that during scrying sessions, a "Celestial Speech" was received directly from Angels. They recorded large portions of the language in their journals (published today as "The Five Books of the Mysteries" and "A True and Faithful Relation..."), along with a complete text in the language called the "Book of Loagaeth" (or "Speech From God"). Dee's language, called "Angelical" in his journals, often known today by the misnomer "[[Enochian]]", follows the basic Judeo-Christian mythology about the Divine Language. According to "A True and Faithful Relation..." Angelical was supposed to have been the language God used to create the world, and then used by Adam to speak with God and Angels and to name all things in existence. He then lost the language upon his Fall from Paradise, and constructed a form of proto-Hebrew based upon his vague memory of Angelical. This proto-Hebrew, then, was the universal human language until the time of the Confusion of Tongues at the Tower of Babel. After this, all the various human languages were developed, including an even more modified Hebrew (which we know as "Biblical Hebrew"). From the time of Adam to the time of Dee and Kelley, Angelical was hidden from humans with the single exception of the patriarch Enoch - who recorded the "Book of Loagaeth" for humanity, but the book was lost in the Deluge of Noah.

[[George William Russell]] in ''The Candle of Vision'' (1918) argued that (p.&amp;nbsp;120) "The mind of man is made in the image of Deity, and the elements of speech are related to the powers in his mind and through it to the being of the Oversoul. These true roots of language are few, alphabet and roots being identical."

The '''Edinburgh Festival Theatre''' (originally '''Empire Palace Theatre''' and later shortened to '''Empire Theatre''') is a performing arts venue located on Nicolson Street in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] used primarily for performances of [[opera]] and [[ballet]], large-scale musical events, and touring groups.  After its most recent renovation in 1994, it seats 1,915. It is one of the major venues of the annual summer [[Edinburgh International Festival]] and is the Edinburgh venue for the [[Scottish Opera]] and the [[Scottish Ballet]].
==Theatre background and history==
The present theatre’s location is Edinburgh’s longest continuous theatre site, for there has been a theatre in that location since 1830.  From being Dunedin Hall, the Royal Amphitheatre, Alhambra Music Hall, the Queen’s Theatre, [[Pablo Fanque]]'s Amphitheatre, and Newsome’s Circus, the site became the '''Empire Palace Theatre''', the first of the famous [[Moss Empires]]’ chain, opening on 7 November 1892.  Designed by the great British theatre architect, [[Frank Matcham]], (who built the [[London Coliseum]], among others) its décor was lavish, with elephants with Nubian riders, nymphs and cherubs in abundance on the plasterwork, and it seated 3000 people on four levels.
===1911 fire===
For the following twenty years all the top artists of the day played at the Empire Palace until, on 9 May 1911, there was a disastrous fire on stage. While all 3000 theatre goers escaped safely in about 2.5 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fire.org.uk/history-of-fire-safety.html|title=History of Fire Safety|website=fire.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were eleven backstage deaths and the death of a lion). Film of the aftermath of the fire is held by the National Library of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movingimage.nls.uk/film/1607 Theatre Fire in Edinburgh, National Library of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre reopened three months after the fire. 

===Popular performers===
Nevertheless, given the long term competition from the growth of film as a popular medium, the theatre had to be re-equipped to present bigger and more spectacular shows.  Reusing some of Matcham’s original design concepts, the theatre reopened on 1 October 1928 with the first production, the musical ''[[Show Boat]]''. Between 1928 and 1963 the Empire was a variety, musical and opera house, often including ice shows.  

Big names like [[Harry Lauder]], [[Charles Laughton]], [[Fats Waller]], [[Joe Loss]], and [[Laurel and Hardy]] appeared, while English comedians [[Max Wall]], [[Morecambe and Wise]] and [[Harry Worth]] established themselves at the Empire.

In addition to the music hall and popular entertainers who appeared at the Empire, the theatre became a principal venue of the Edinburgh International Festival between 1947 and 1963.  It was particularly associated with international ballet and, during the first Festival in 1947,  [[Margot Fonteyn]] danced in ''The Sleeping Beauty'', while in subsequent years, performances by the [[Old Vic]] theatre company, the [[Royal Ballet]] and the [[Royal Opera, London|Royal Opera]] were presented.

However, for nearly thirty years after 1963 the theatre became a bingo hall, only temporarily serving as a Festival venue.  In the early 1970s the venue shortened its name to simply the '''Empire Theatre''' and hosted live music events. Bands did not appear until after 11pm - once the bingo players had gone. [[Free (band)|Free]] (September 14, 1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghgigarchive.com/page9.htm |title=Empire/Festival Theatre |publisher=The Edinburgh Gig Archive |date= |accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Wishbone Ash]] (December 9, 1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wishboneash.co.uk/arctourdates1972 |title=Classic Wishbone Ash History |publisher=Wishboneash.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] (May 11, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alquin |url=http://www.focustheband.com/gighistory.htm |title=Focus The Band Of Thijs Van Leer |publisher=Focustheband.com |date= |accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the acts appearing. Finally, after its third major remodeling, the Empire Theatre reopened in June 1994 with a glass-fronted structure for the new entrance (created by Law &amp; Dunbar-Nasmith Architects), as the now-renamed ''Edinburgh Festival Theatre''. In 1997, the theatre manager and artistic director [[Stephen Barry]] was appointed to shape the rejuvenated venue's future.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Paul [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/09/guardianobituaries1 Stephen Barry (obituary)] ''The Guardian'' London, 9 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; With the restoration of the Empire Theatre’s former 1928 glory, plus a dramatic mix of art nouveau, beaux arts and neo-classicism, and including adequate acoustics, the new theatre serves the artistic needs of the community.
[[File:Festival Theatre Les Mis.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The theatre prior to a production of [[Les Misérables (musical)|''Les Misérables'']].]]
In the twenty-first century, the theatre has played host to a wide number of touring productions of [[West End theatre|West End]] shows, including [[Les Misérables (musical)|''Les Misérables'']]&lt;ref name="LesMis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/100358-les-miserables-announces-new-uk-tour-dates-and-casting-news-get-tickets/|title=Les Misérables announces new UK tour dates and casting news, get tickets|author=Angus, Craig|date=20 April 2018|publisher=The List UK|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[War Horse (play)|''War Horse'']].&lt;ref name="WH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2018/04/review-war-horse-festival-theatre/|title=Review – War Horse, Festival Theatre|author=Kennedy, John|publisher=The Edinburgh Reporter|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
The theatre is said to be haunted by a tall, dark stranger rumoured to be the famous illusionist [[Sigmund Neuberger]], a.k.a. The Great Lafayette, who was one of those who burned to death in the fire at the Empire in 1911.

'''Erwin Faber''' (21 July 1891 &amp;ndash; 4 May 1989) was a leading actor in [[Munich]] and later throughout [[Germany]], beginning after [[World War I]], and through the late-1970s, when he was still performing at the [[Residenz Theatre]] (The National Theatre of Bavaria).  Born in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], Faber remained in Germany during the [[Third Reich]], emerging afterwards as a prominent actor in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany).  He died in Munich in 1989, only two months after his last performance at the Residenztheater (the National Theatre of Bavaria), at age 97.

== Acting career ==
In addition to performing in dozens of dramas and films in Germany, working with the leading directors in post-World War I Germany, such as [[Max Reinhardt]], [[Otto Falckenberg]], and [[Erich Engel]], Faber also was chosen by [[Bertolt Brecht]] to play the leads in the first three staged plays of Brecht in Munich, beginning with ''[[Drums in the Night]]'' (''Trommeln in der Nacht'') at the avant-garde theatre, the Munich Kammerspiele in September 1922, followed by ''[[In The Jungle of Cities]]'' (''Im Dickicht der Städte'') at Munich's Residenz Theater in May 1923, and ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]]'' (''Leben Eduards des Zweiten von England'') directed by Brecht himself in his directing debut and featuring [[Oskar Homolka]], in March 1924.&lt;ref name="actingbrecht"&gt;"Acting Brecht: The Munich Years," by W. Stuart McDowell, in ''The Brecht Sourcebook'', Carol Martin, Henry Bial, editors (Routledge, 2000) p. 71&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Erwin Faber also played the lead in a film written by Brecht in 1923, ''[[Mysteries of a Barbershop]]'' (''Mysterien eines Friseursalons''), with leading comic and dramatic actors of Germany of that time: [[Karl Valentin]], Liesl Karlstadt, Blandine Ebinger, [[Max Schreck]], and Carola Neher.  The 16-minute improvised film is now considered one of the hundred most important films in history of [[German film]].&lt;ref name="actingbrecht" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'',  by David Culbert, (Louisiana State University, Carfax Publishing) March, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brechtvalentin"&gt;"A Brecht-Valentin Production: ''Mysteries of a Barbershop''", W. Stuart McDowell, ''Performing Arts Journal'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (Winter, 1977), pp. 2&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Faber also was cast by [[Ingmar Bergman]] for his film ''Life of the Marionettes'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ingmar Bergman, Master Filmmaker, Dies at 89 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/movies/30cnd-bergman.html | first = Mervyn | last = Rothstein | publisher = New York Times | date = 2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore''''' is a 1999 [[collage film]] by British contemporary artist [[Mark Leckey]].

==Background==
''Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore'' came out of a discussion between [[Gavin Brown (art dealer)|Gavin Brown]], Martin McGeown and Leckey. They were at a gallery private view in London, and Emma Dexter, then a curator at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA), talked to Leckey. He argued that the most exciting art form of the time was the music video, and intrigued, Dexter invited him to make a work demonstrating it.&lt;ref name=higgins2008&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Charlotte|title=I was shocked by the hatred|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/dec/03/mark-leckey-turnerprize/|website=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later first screened at the ICA.&lt;ref name=frieze2011&gt;[http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/mark-leckey/ Mark Beasly, ''Frieze'', Issue 136, January 2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228100254/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/mark-leckey/ |date=28 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title, Leckey said, was about the notion that "something as trite and throwaway and exploitative as a jeans manufacturer ([[Fiorucci]]) can be taken by a group of people and made into something totemic, and powerful, and life-affirming."&lt;ref name=higgins2008&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 Guardian article, Leckey admitted that he cried while working on the film.&lt;ref name=higgins2015&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore'' is collaged from tape footage from 70s, 80s and 90s underground dance scene in the UK, including portions of footage from the 1977 [[Tony Palmer]] film The Wigan Casino. It starts with the disco scene of the 1970s, touches upon the [[Northern soul]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s and climaxes with the rave scene of the 1990s; the mashup soundtrack Leckey created for the film follows the same temporal structure as a soundscape, with him occasionally interjecting dialogue. Notably, at one point, an animated element - a bird tattoo image - appears as if released from the hand of a dancer, then carried into the next shot finds its place on the arm of another of the film's nightclubbing subjects. The film follows a looping structure, bookending itself with a low frame rate [[time-lapse]] shot of clouds.

==Legacy==
Charlotte Higgins, writing for The Guardian, remarked that 'Fiorucci changed the game.'&lt;ref name=higgins2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Charlotte|title=How Mark Leckey became the artist of the YouTube generation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/mar/26/how-mark-leckey-became-the-artist-of-the-youtube-generation|website=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamie xx]] sampled dialogue from the film, including Leckey reciting the names of fashion brands, on "[[All Under One Roof Raving]]". 

In July 2018, Leckey's [[YouTube]] upload of Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore was temporarily taken down by [[FremantleMedia]], but was reactivated two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberger|first1=Alex|title=Mark Leckey's Cult Classic Video 'Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore' Removed from YouTube Following Copyright Claim [Updated] -ARTnews|url=http://artnews.com/2018/07/18/mark-leckeys-cult-classic-video-fiorucci-made-hardcore-removed-youtube-following-copyright-claim/|website=Artnews|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Gazette des Beaux-Arts''''' was a French art review, founded in 1859 by Édouard Houssaye, with [[Charles Blanc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Orton|author2=Griselda Pollock|title=Avant-Gardes and Partisans Reviewed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxENAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=14 July 2016|year=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4399-4|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its first chief editor. Assia Visson Rubinstein was chief editorial secretary under the direction of  George Wildenstein from 1936 until 1960. Her papers, which include all editions of the ''Gazette'' from this period, are intact at the [[Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne]] in [[Dorigny]]. The ''Gazette'' was a world reference work on art history for nearly 100 years - one other editor in chief, from 1955 to 1987, was [[Jean Adhémar]]. It was bought in 1928 by the Wildenstein family, whose last representative was [[Daniel Wildenstein]], its director from 1963 until his death in 2001. The magazine was published monthly and was headquartered in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazette des Beaux-Arts [France]|url=http://arts-search.com/journals21.htm|work=Arts: Search|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review closed in 2002.

'''Guy Ben-Ari''' (born 1984 in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]) is an Israeli painter living and working in [[New York City]].

== Biography ==
Ben-Ari received his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from [[Columbia University]]'s School of the Arts in 2011, and his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] with honors from [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 2009, where he received the Presser Award for Excellence in Painting.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}} In 2008, Ben-Ari was selected for the Exchange Program for Merit Students to study Painting at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]], [[University College London|UCL]], [[London]].{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

Ben-Ari's body of work focuses on the connection between [[Psychoanalytic theory]], [[Semiotics]] and the medium of painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voxpopuligallery.org/exhibitions/yes-to-burning-eyes/|title=Yes to Burning Eyes|last=|first=|date=2012|website=voxpopuligallery.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]’s notion that 'The word kills the thing'&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques (1977). Ecrits. A Selection. Trans. A. Sheridan. London, Tavistock. p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; by fixing its meaning, he uses an illustrative approach to examine the way metaphors, when taken literally, become dysfunctional. Ben-Ari is interested in the implications of using painting, a medium that rejects [[literal interpretation]], to analyze concepts that reject visual interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lmcc.net/person/guy-ben-ari/|title=Guy Ben-Ari|website=Lower Manhattan Cultural Council|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Ari's recent work uses painting as a framework to study elements of [[post-structuralism]] and psychoanalytic theory. Much of his work originates in [[jokes]] or [[illustration]]s of related concepts and situations, as he attempts to employ a literal strategy in an image, without collapsing into a mere illustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Artis Agenda|title=Guy Ben-Ari: Yes to Burning Eyes at Vox Populi Gallery, Philadelphia |url=http://www.artiscontemporary.org/agenda_detail.php?id=577|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aicf.org/event/guy-ben-ari-2/|title=Guy Ben-Ari, Out of Sight – Solo Exhibition|last=|first=|date=2013|work=America-Israel Cultural Foundation|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, Ben-Ari runs an arts cultural group with artist [[Leah Wolf]] called ''Meta Meta Meta'', to help support the arts in their community in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://patch.com/new-york/heights-dumbo/brooklyn-management-company-offers-dozen-artists-low-rent-dumbo-studios|title=Brooklyn Management Company Offers A Dozen Artists Low-Rent DUMBO Studios|date=2017-03-21|work=Brooklyn Heights-DUMBO, NY Patch|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben-Ari is a recent artist-in-residence at the Lower East Side Printshop, Triangle Arts in Brooklyn, New York and was a SIP Award recipient from the Robert Blackburn [[Printmaking]] Workshop Program at The Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Ben-Ari also worked as an [[Artist-in-residence|Artist-in-Residence]] at the [[Lower Manhattan Cultural Council]] Workspace Residency and at the NARS Foundation, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Triangle|title=Artist-In-Residence: Guy Ben-Ari|url=http://www.triangle-arts-association.org/post/137515913991/artist-in-residence-guy-ben-ari|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photograph of Artist Karen Wheeler.jpg|thumb|Karen Wheeler]]
'''Karen Sue Wheeler''' (born 1955 in [[Winfield, Kansas]]) is an American artist who was born with a neurodegenerative condition called [[spinal muscular atrophy]] which causes muscle wasting. She uses a technique called "layering" that resembles colored pencil. Each painting that she produces takes from 150–500 hours to complete.

== Childhood ==
Wheeler was born in 1955 in Winfield, Kansas, and is the middle of three children. Her parents were told she would not live beyond a year old.&lt;ref name="LVRJ Mar2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bornfeld|first=Steve|title=Karen Wheeler Doesn't Let Muscular Dystrophy Curtail Her Artistry|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/karen-wheeler-doesn-t-let-muscular-dystrophy-curtail-her-artistry-118975179.html|accessdate=1 July 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler says that she started creating art when she was 5, because she was unable to play outside.&lt;ref name="LVNV Jun2002"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bristol|first=Emily|title=Artist Overcomes Adversity With Love of Painting|url=http://www.viewnews.com/2002/VIEW-Jun-19-Wed-2002/anthem/18954660.html|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Neighborhood View|date=19 June 2002}}(dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;

== College ==
Wheeler attended [[Santa Ana College]] before transferring to [[California State University, Fullerton]], where she received a Master’s Degree in Art in 1981 with a 4.0 grade point average.&lt;ref name=2.&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyle|first=Michael|title=Henderson Artist to be Featured at Gallery During First Friday|url=http://www.lvrj.com/view/henderson-artist-to-be-featured-at-gallery-during-first-friday-132979818.html|accessdate=1 July 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal|date=1 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Wheeler has developed a sling-like device&lt;ref name="LVRJ Mar2011"/&gt; that she wears on her arm to assist her with wielding her tools, rather a brush, pencil or pen. She uses a small brush and very little pigment that creates a dry-brush effect called "layering" that resembles colored pencil. Each painting that she produces takes from 150–500 hours to complete.&lt;ref name=3.&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez|first=Pj|title=Art Provides Independence|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/archive/2006/jul/20/art-provides-independence/|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Weekly|date=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheeler served on the Board of Directors of [[Very Special Arts]] California from 1985 to 1992, and currently serves as an honorary board member. She was selected as Disabled Professional Woman of the Year by the Pilot Club of Southeast Los Angeles in 1990, and has been a Board member of the (Las) Vegas Artists Guild since 2003, serving two terms as President and was the Director of Vegas Artists Guild, and in charge of Shows until September 2012.&lt;ref name="LVRJ Mar2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LVNV Jun2002" /&gt;

In April 2012, Wheeler with business partner, William Schnell co-created GoHitYourself.com. They created the site to educate persons with disabilities on how to better their situations and to illuminate these situations for the able-bodied person. In 2014, Wheeler and Schnell rebranded and merged GoHitYourself.com with Wheeler's personal site where her amazing art is now profiled alongside her stories about living with a disability. The rebranded site is located at KarenWheeler.com.

== Works ==
Wheeler's early works are watercolor, but she has also used oil paints, acrylics, pencils and ink.  Her subject matter varies but she is known to hide a rose in most of her pieces which symbolizes herself.&lt;ref name="LVRJ Mar2011" /&gt;

'''''King Neptune''''' is a large [[bronze statue]] located in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] and sculpted by [[Paul DiPasquale]].  The statue depicts the [[Neptune (mythology)|mythological god Neptune]] and is located at the entrance of Neptune Park on the Virginia Beach boardwalk  on 31st Street.   This sculpture weighs 12 tons.&lt;ref name="TribLive"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://triblive.com/lifestyles/travel/8788027-74/virginia-park-aquarium#axzz3r9AS7XxW|title=Road Trip! Destination: Virginia Beach|last=Rex Rutkoski|date=22 August 2015|work=TribLive|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is listed as {{convert|24|ft}}&lt;ref name="TribLive"/&gt; or {{convert|34|ft}} &lt;ref name ="13news"/&gt; tall. The design consists of a 12-foot tall rock base surrounded by various fish, [[dolphin]]s, [[lobster]]s, and [[octopus]]es.  Above this base, the figure of Neptune begins, starting with his waist.  Neptune holds a [[trident]] in his right hand and rests his left hand on a [[loggerhead turtle]].

In 2003, the Neptune Festival requested submission designs for a statue. Cameron Kitchin, the Director of the Contemporary Arts Center of Virginia Beach asked DiPasquale to submit his design of a statue of King Neptune.  DiPasquale   sent the clay model to the Festival’s sculpture committee. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Upon arriving in the United States, the three pieces needed interior support before being reassembled. Due to exceeding its budget, the Chinese manufacturers inserted a weak metal to support the statue.  This material was cleared out and substituted by a stainless steel skeletal support.  According to DiPasquale, replacing the interior and reorganizing the individual pieces together required a month and a half of [[welding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maurer|first1=David|title=after Neptune arrived in Virginia Beach, it became a matter of ...Putting all the pieces together|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/lifestyles/after-neptune-arrived-in-virginia-beach-it-became-a-matter/article_6c394369-012c-5195-b612-3a4f30ae2ac0.html?mode=jqm|website=dailyprogress.com|publisher=The Daily Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the  7 foot [[maquette]] that served as a model for the sculpture was donated for display at the [[Cape Charles, Virginia|Cape Charles]] boardwalk.&lt;ref name ="13news"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/50978|title=Statue of Neptune|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5374">In [[mathematics]], a '''Lie groupoid''' is a [[groupoid]] where the set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ob}&lt;/math&gt; of [[object (category theory)|object]]s and the set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mor}&lt;/math&gt; of [[morphism]]s are both [[manifold]]s, the source and target operations

:&lt;math&gt;s,t : \operatorname{Mor} \to \operatorname{Ob} &lt;/math&gt;

are  [[submersion (mathematics)|submersion]]s, and all the [[category (mathematics)|category]] operations (source and target, composition, and identity-assigning map) are smooth.

A Lie groupoid can thus be thought of as a "many-object generalization" of a [[Lie group]], just as a groupoid is a many-object generalization of a [[group (mathematics)|group]].  Just as every Lie group has a [[Lie algebra]], every Lie groupoid has a [[Lie algebroid]].

==Examples==

*Any Lie group gives a Lie groupoid with one object, and conversely.  So, the theory of Lie groupoids includes the theory of Lie groups.
*Given any manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, there is a Lie groupoid called the pair groupoid, with &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; as the manifold of objects, and precisely one morphism from any object to any other.  In this Lie groupoid the manifold of morphisms is thus &lt;math&gt;M \times M&lt;/math&gt;.
*Given a Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acting on a manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, there is a Lie groupoid called the [[translation groupoid]] with one morphism for each triple &lt;math&gt;g \in G, x,y \in M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;gx = y&lt;/math&gt;.
*Any [[foliation]] gives a Lie groupoid.
*Any [[principal bundle]] &lt;math&gt;P\to M&lt;/math&gt; with structure group ''G'' gives a groupoid, namely &lt;math&gt;P\times P/G&lt;/math&gt; over ''M'', where ''G'' acts on the pairs componentwise.  Composition is defined via compatible representatives as in the pair groupoid.

==Morita Morphisms and Smooth Stacks==
{{see also|differentiable stack}}
Beside isomorphism of groupoids there is a more coarse notation of equivalence, the so-called Morita equivalence.  A quite general example is the Morita-morphism of the '''Čech groupoid''' which goes as follows.  Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and &lt;math&gt;\{U_\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; an open cover of ''M''.  Define &lt;math&gt;G_0:=\bigsqcup_\alpha U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; the disjoint union with the obvious submersion &lt;math&gt;p:G_0\to M&lt;/math&gt;.  In order to encode the structure of the manifold ''M'' define the set of morphisms &lt;math&gt;G_1:=\bigsqcup_{\alpha,\beta}U_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U_{\alpha\beta}=U_\alpha \cap U_\beta\subset M&lt;/math&gt;.  The source and target map are defined as the embeddings &lt;math&gt;s:U_{\alpha\beta}\to U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t:U_{\alpha\beta}\to U_\beta&lt;/math&gt;.  And multiplication is the obvious one if we read the &lt;math&gt;U_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; as subsets of ''M'' (compatible points in &lt;math&gt;U_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; actually are the same in ''M'' and also lie in &lt;math&gt;U_{\alpha\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;).

This Čech groupoid is in fact the [[pullback groupoid]] of  &lt;math&gt;M\Rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the trivial groupoid over ''M'', under ''p''.  That is what makes it Morita-morphism.

In order to get the notion of an [[equivalence relation]] we need to make the construction symmetric and show that it is also transitive.  In this sense we say that 2 groupoids &lt;math&gt;G_1\Rightarrow G_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_1\Rightarrow H_0&lt;/math&gt; are Morita equivalent iff there exists a third groupoid &lt;math&gt;K_1\Rightarrow K_0&lt;/math&gt; together with 2 Morita morphisms from ''G'' to ''K'' and ''H'' to ''K''.  Transitivity is an interesting construction in the category of [[groupoid principal bundles]] and left to the reader.

It arises the question of what is preserved under the Morita equivalence.  There are 2 obvious things, one the coarse quotient/ orbit space of the groupoid &lt;math&gt;G_0/G_1 = H_0/H_1&lt;/math&gt; and secondly the stabilizer groups &lt;math&gt;G_p\cong H_q&lt;/math&gt; for corresponding points &lt;math&gt;p\in G_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q\in H_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The further question of what is the structure of the coarse quotient space leads to the notion of a smooth stack.  We can expect the coarse quotient to be a smooth manifold if for example the stabilizer groups are trivial (as in the example of the Čech groupoid).  But if the stabilizer groups change we cannot expect a smooth manifold any longer.  The solution is to revert the problem and to define:

A '''smooth stack''' is a Morita-equivalence class of Lie groupoids.  The natural geometric objects living on the stack are the geometric objects on Lie groupoids invariant under Morita-equivalence.  As an example consider the Lie groupoid [[cohomology]].

===Examples===
*The notion of smooth stack is quite general, obviously all smooth manifolds are smooth stacks.  
*But also [[orbifold]]s are smooth stacks, namely (equivalence classes of) [[Étale morphism#Inverse function theorem|étale]] groupoids.
*Orbit spaces of foliations are another class of examples

{{Expand Japanese|美白|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Japanese lady shoulder in Tōkyō.jpg|thumb|right|Shoulder of a woman from [[Tokyo]], showing her pale skin tone]]
{{nihongo|'''''Bihaku'''''|美白}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term meaning "beautifully white" which was coined in the early 1900s with the emergence of [[skin whitening]] products and cosmetics. Even in ancient Japanese Haiku there have been numerous references to this.

== Summary ==
Although [[skin tone]] differs based on a person's [[Race (human classification)|racial background]], those with fair skin have difficulty maintaining{{clarify|date=September 2018}} skin tone due to melanin production. In Japan the [[Physical attractiveness|preference]] for skin that is white and free of blemishes has been documented since at least the [[Heian period]] (794-1185), as in books like ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Hitotsubashi University|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43294433|volume=30|number=2|year=1998|journal=Hitotsubashi Journal of Social Studies|title=THE USE OF RACE AND RACIAL PERCEPTIONS AMONG ASIANS AND BLACKS: THE CASE OF THE JAPANESE AND AFRICAN AMERICANS }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an old proverb {{nihongo|"white skin covers the seven flaws"|色の白いは七難隠す|iro no shiroi wa shichinan kakusu}} which refers to a white-skinned woman being beautiful even if her features are not attractive. 

The cultural fallout of [[Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan]] (1895–1945) has resulted in Taiwanese women becoming consumers of Japanese skin whitening products in the 20th century. [[Mainland China]] has also become a large market for ''bihaku'' products from companies like [[Shiseido]], [[Shu Uemura]] and [[SK-II]] in the 21st century. Further expansion into pan-Asian markets may be represented by [[Girls' Generation]] partnership with [[Dior]] in 2011 to advertise their lightening cream, appealing to [[Korean Wave]] culture consumers.&lt;ref name="Pan"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Beautiful White: An Illumination of Asian Skin-Whitening Culture|first=Elysia|last=Pan|date=April 2003|publisher=Duke University|pages=23, 27-30, 38, 50-52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bihaku products are highly popular among mature women. They are also popular with teenage girls and those in their twenties who desire to look like pop singers, such as [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], and are promoted in numerous youth fashion magazines such as ''[[Popteen]]'' and ''S Cawaii!''. Bihaku products are also prevalent and a key item in numerous youth subcultures such as [[gyaru]] and ageha girls. An opposition to the idea of fair skin beauty grew with the gyaru subculture called "[[ganguro]]" in the 1990s although died out by the end of the 2000s.

== Method ==
The popular method of ''bihaku'' is to use cosmetics that stop the production of melanin. Traditionally ''[[uguisu no fun]]'' was used to lighten and balance skin tone although today it is considered a luxury item. The most popular products often contain [[sake]] and [[rice bran]] which contain [[kojic acid]].

For skin whitening cosmetics for use by the public, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] has recognized a combination of [[active ingredient]]s. These are mainly [[arbutin]] and [[kojic acid]].&lt;ref name="Pan"/&gt; Other ingredients include [[Vitamin C]] derivatives, [[tranexamic acid]] and ten-odd other types. Many of these active ingredients work through inhibiting  [[catechol oxidase]]. Some types of [[BB cream]], VIORIS products are also said to have skin whitening effects which contributes to the popularity of the cream in Asian markets.

As for other methods of skin whitening, other decolorizing chemicals can be used. Aesthetic skin decolorizing surgeries can also be performed, but excessive cleansings can cause a number of problems, such as facial inflammation, but in the 2000s this is in decline. Historically, [[Uguisu no fun|the droppings]] of the {{nihongo|Japanese bush-warbler|鴬|uguisu}} have been used as an ingredient in face-washes for whitening skin.

Feminist literature is fiction or nonfiction which supports the [[Feminism|feminist]] goals of defining, establishing and defending equal [[Civil and political rights|civil, political, economic]] and [[social rights]] for women. It often identifies women's roles as unequal to those of men{{spaced ndash}}particularly as regards status, privilege and power{{spaced ndash}}and generally portrays the consequences to women, men, families, communities and societies as undesirable.

The following is a '''list of American feminist literature''' listed by year of first publication, then within the year alphabetically by title.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9594">Some of these '''horn techniques''' are not unique to the [[French horn|horn]], but are applicable to most or all wind instruments.''

== Stopped horn ==
This is the act of fully closing off the bell of the instrument with either the right hand or a special [[Mute (music)#Stop (stopping)|stopping mute]]. This results in producing a somewhat nasal sound. When required, in the sheet music the usual notation is a '+' above the note followed by a 'o' above notes that are to be played open. For longer stopped passages, the word  indicating a stopped horn is written out.

The pitch lowers gradually when the hand is placed in the bell and slowly moved inward.  When the bell is completely covered (stopped), the pitch falls to a half-step above the next lower [[Harmonic series (music)|partial]] (harmonic). For example, playing a middle C (F-horn, open) and gradually covering the bell into stopped horn, the pitch will lower a major 3rd to A{{music|flat}} (or 1/2 step above G, the next lower partial). However, playing a 3rd space C (F-horn, open) and repeating the stopped horn, the pitch will lower a half-step to a B-natural (or 1/2 step above B{{music|flat}}, the next lower partial).  The hand horn technique developed in the classical period, with music pieces requiring the use of covering the bell to various degrees to lower the pitch accordingly. [[Mozart]]'s [[Horn Concertos (Mozart)|four Horn Concertos]], [[Concert Rondo]] and Morceau de Concert were written with this technique in mind, as was the music both [[Beethoven]] and [[Brahms]] wrote for the horn. 

Some modern composers have incorrectly notated that the horn is to bend an open pitch upward to a stopped pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Norman del Mar, Anatomy of the Orchestra p244&lt;/ref&gt; This is impossible. The horn pitch can only be bent downward into a stopped pitch. It is believed that players play the next harmonic higher without realising and this has given rise to this erroneous belief.

There is also an effect that is occasionally called for, usually in French music, called "echo horn", "hand mute" or "''sons d'écho''" (see [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'') which is like stopped horn, but different in that the bell is not closed as tightly.  The player closes the hand enough so that the pitch drops 1/2 step, but, especially in the middle register, this is not closed as tightly as for stopped horn. Consequently, when playing echo horn, the player fingers one half step higher.

Also, the hand can be partially inserted into the bell in such a fashion as to lower the pitch of the horn one [[quarter tone]], an [[extended technique]] used in some modern compositions today.

== Handhorn technique ==
Before the advent of the valve horn, a player would increase the number of playable notes beyond the normal [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] by changing the position of his/her hand in the [[bell (wind instrument)|bell]]. It is possible to use a combination of stopping, hand-muting (3/4 stopping), and half-stopping (to correct notes that would otherwise be out of tune) to play almost every note of a mid-range [[chromatic scale]] on one fingering. Most modern pieces for hand-horn tend to spend more time in the higher ranges, as there are more notes that can be played naturally (without altering hand position and maintaining pure tone) above the 8th note of any harmonic series. The most well known natural hornist virtuoso who was in the classical period was [[Giovanni Punto]], which is said to have been able to play 'anything' on his natural horn

== Transposition ==
Many older pieces for horn were written for a horn not keyed in F as is standard today. As a result, a requirement for modern orchestra hornists is to be able to read music directly in these keys. This is most commonly done by [[transposition (music)|transposing]] the music on the fly into F. A reliable way to transpose is to liken the written notes (which rarely deviate from written C, D, E, F, G, and occasionally A) to their counterparts in the scale the F horn will be playing in.

Commonly seen transpositions include:

* '''B{{music|flat}} alto''' — up a [[perfect fourth]]
* '''A''' — up a [[major third]]
* '''G''' — up a [[major second]]
* '''E''' — down a [[minor second]]
* '''E{{music|flat}}''' — down a [[major second]] (used for horn on pitches with multiple sharps until Richard Strauss)
* '''D''' — down a [[minor third]]
* '''C''' — down a [[perfect fourth]]
* '''B{{music|flat}} basso''' — down a [[perfect fifth]]

Some less common transpositions include:
* '''A{{music|flat}} alto''' — up a [[minor third]] (used in Schubert`s 4th symphony, 2nd movement)
* '''F{{music|sharp}}''' — up a [[minor second]]
* '''D{{music|flat}}''' — down a [[major third]] (used in some works by [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]])
* '''B''' — down a [[tritone]] (used by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]])


It has been speculated that one of the reasons Brahms wrote for horn in the awkward key of B(♮) was to encourage the horn players to use the natural horn; he did not like the sound of the new valved horns and wrote all his horn parts playable for natural horn, same as [[Carl Maria von Weber]] did.

Sometimes it is unclear as to whether a piece should be transposed up or down (i.e. B{{music|flat}} alto versus B{{music|flat}} basso when only B{{music|flat}} is written). Various factors can be taken into account when choosing e.g. which direction keeps the music in the horn's normal range. Also the history of the composer can be used. For Haydn symphonies which include trumpet parts, the lower transposition for the horns is usually correct; otherwise, the high transposition is usually correct. Sometimes multiple pitches were used to get a greater number of available tones. This is especially true for works in minor keys to be able to play the minor third (e.g. [[Symphony_No._40_(Mozart)|Mozart Symphony Nr. 40]])

== Double and triple tonguing ==
Normal tonguing consists of interrupting the air stream by tapping the back of the front teeth with the tongue as said in the syllables 'da', 'ta', 'doo', or 'too'. Double tonguing consists of alternating between the 'ta' and the 'ka' sounds or between the 'da' and 'ga' sounds.  The tongue makes the same movement as if the player is repeatedly saying 'kitty' or 'ticket.'  Triple tonguing is most used for patterns of three notes and is made with the syllables 'ta-ta-ka', 'ta-ka-ta', or 'da-ga-da.'

== Lip trill ==

A lip trill is a rapid oscillation between neighboring harmonics - used primarily for whole-step trills from second-line G up approximately an octave.  Lip trills are possible both lower and higher, but much lower than E and the harmonics are too far apart for a whole step, and much higher and harmonics are too narrow. Many books give fingering charts for lip trills, but the double horn gives further options. In his book "The Horn", Barry Tuckwell also gives a fingering chart of possible 'faux' 1/2 step lip trills.

== Multiphonics ==
[[Multiphonics]] is the act of producing more than one pitch simultaneously on the horn. To do this, one note is produced as normal while another is sung. One of its earliest uses occurs in the [[Concertino for Horn and Orchestra (Weber)|Concertino for Horn and Orchestra]] by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] (Norman del Mar believed these chords to be impossible to play &lt;ref&gt;Norman Del Mar, Anatomy of the orchestra p260&lt;/ref&gt;).

Another kind of multiphonics can be achieved by simultaneously playing two neighbouring notes of the harmonic series.

== Circular breathing ==
Information on this subject can be found at the article on [[circular breathing]].

== Quick valve water emptying ==
Horns tend to fill with water. It may appear that all of the valve tubes will require disassembling. By holding the horn so the bell is up in the air, holding down the third valve and flipping the first and second while rotating the horn back to the normal position, all of the water in the valves is now in the third valve tubings.

== Fake high C ==
On some horns, depending on the type of valves fitted, a high F' (concert pitch) can sound out while pressing the first valve of the F side down halfway.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Fake high D ==
A high D can be obtained by pulling out completely the first tuning slide of the F-horn.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Slide lubrication ==
Normally expensive slide greases are used to lubricate the slides. Sometimes petroleum jelly (e.g. Vaseline) is used in lieu. This is not a recommended practice since the rotary valve oil can dissolve and wash the jelly into the valves. Anhydrous lanolin is considered a better alternative.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[Image:lottie-venne-rotary.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lottie Venne in a Rotary postcard, c. 1910]]
'''Lottie Venne''' (28 May 1852 – 16 July 1928) was a British comedian, actress and singer of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s, who enjoyed a theatre career spanning five decades.&lt;ref name=NLA/&gt; Venne began her stage career in [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]] before moving into [[farce]] and comedy.  She appeared in several works by each of [[F. C. Burnand]] and [[W. S. Gilbert]] and was often in plays with [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]] later in her career.

==Early life and career==
Born as Hannah Charlotte Venne, her first professional appearance came in 1867 as Miss Charbonnel in ''A Dream in Venice'' at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] in London, followed by two years touring in the provinces.  For part of this time, she joined Captain Disney Roebuck's touring company, where she met her future husband, [[Walter H. Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In London, in 1870, Venne played Susan Piper in ''A Bull in a China Shop'', a comedy by [[Charles Mathews]] at the [[Haymarket Theatre]].  At the same theatre, she appeared as Jemima in ''Rural Felicity'' by [[John Baldwin Buckstone]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Miss Lottie Venne. Comedy and Burlesque." ''The Times'', 17 July 1928, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1870s, she played many roles in [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]] such as [[Francis Talfourd]]'s ''Atalanta'' as [[Cupid]], ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' as Jonathan Wild (1871 on tour), ''Dr. Faust'' as Franz, ''Ixion'' as Cupid (1873), and ''Don Juan'' as Zerlina (1873 at the [[Alhambra Theatre]]).&lt;ref name=NLA&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page463147 "Death of Miss Lottie Venne; Half-century on London Stage",] ''The Argus'' Melbourne, Australia, 18 July 1928, accessed 17 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She played Polly Twinkle in ''La vie Parisienne'' in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000183/18720402/003/0002 "Easter Entertainments: Holborn"], ''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]'', 2 April 1872, accessed 1 November 2018, issue=14874, p. 2 {{subscription}} via [[British Newspaper Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], played in ''Christabel'', ''Zampa'', ''Lady Audley's Secret'' and others.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;Parker, John.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=AU82rXJXvMAC&amp;pg=PA829&amp;lpg=PA829&amp;dq=%22Walter+Fisher%22+venne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5-Gsdr7mSU&amp;sig=ntt3T4nQG4bq_7gz4-Y0b4naQXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L98ES4-JG8TSnAf4v6i2Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Walter%20Fisher%22%20venne&amp;f=false "Venne, Lottie"] in ''Who's Who in the Theatre'', pp. 829–31, Pitman, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Venne played the role of Zayda in the 1873 play ''[[The Happy Land]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]] (under the pseudonym F. Latour Tomline) and [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett]] at the Court Theatre, together with Fisher.  The same year, in the same house, she appeared in ''Playing with Fire''.  In 1874, she joined the company at the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], where she first played Lady Constance in ''The Field of the Cloth of Gold''.  She remained at that theatre for four years in burlesques and comedies, such as ''Nemesis'' by [[H. B. Farnie]], ''Loo and the Party Who Took Miss'', ''Intimidad'', ''Flamingo'', ''Cracked Heads'' (1876, a parody of Gilbert's ''[[Broken Hearts]]'') by Arthur Clements and Frederick Hay, ''The Lying Dutchman'', ''[[Princess Toto]]'' by Gilbert and [[Frederic Clay]], ''Champagne'', and as the Plaintiff in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' in 1877, opposite Fisher's Defendant.  Also at the Strand, she played Penelope, the bewildered housemaid, in [[Sydney Grundy]]'s comedy ''The Snowball'' and appeared in ''Our Club'' and ''The Baby''.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt;

[[File:LottieVenne1889.JPG|left|thumb|Venne in 1889]]
She built her popularity through a series of roles in works by [[F. C. Burnand]], including ''Dora and Diplunacy'', a burlesque of ''Diplomacy'' (in which she parodied [[Effie Bancroft]]), ''Family Ties'' and ''[[The Red Rover]]'' (a burlesque of Robertson's sentimental plays).&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; In 1879, at the [[Royalty Theatre]], she played Eliza in a revival of ''[[The Zoo]]'' by [[B. C. Stephenson]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]].&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt; The same year, she was particularly successful playing the title role in Burnand's farce ''Betsy'' at the [[Criterion Theatre]].  This was followed by comic roles such as Amy Jones in ''Crutch and Toothpick'' by [[G. R. Sims]] at the Royalty (1879), and by roles in ''[[Young Mrs. Winthrop (play)|Young Mrs. Winthrop]]'', and ''On Change''.  She also played the title role in ''Jane''.&lt;ref name=NLA/&gt; In 1880, she was Kitty Clark in ''The Little Mother'' at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], London.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt;

Venne appeared in the 1881 comedy ''Out of the Hunt'' at the [[Comedy Theatre]] with [[E. H. Sothern]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]'' 26 September 1881&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, she played Mrs. Pilate Pump in ''Blue and Buff'', Mrs. Delafield in ''Reclaimed'' and Gwendolyn Kingfisher in ''Dust''.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt; In 1882, she was Nettie Milsom in ''The Manager'' and starred as Mary Ledger, with [[Marion Terry]] and [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]], in G. W. Godfrey's comedy ''The Parvenu'' at the Court Theatre.

The building is now known as Harbor Lofts and MBH received a Gold Nugget Award for Award of Merit, Adaptive Reuse in 1997 for the conversion.

The Coffin Reddington Building, also in Rincon Hill, was built in 1937 as an office building/warehouse.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2004, MBH won the Residential Architect Award and the 2003 Gold Nugget Award for the [[North Beach Malt House]], an early 20th-century industrial concrete and steel building. MBH converted the inner structure to residential spaces but retained two of the original steel silos; the building's most prominent features. One silo is now used for a lobby/courtyard entry point and both are historical artifacts of the brewing process and preserve the building’s history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbharch.com/portfolio/portfolio.htm MBH Architects Official Website.

The '''Veveri Madonna''', also called the '''Madonna of Veveri''' ({{lang-cs| Madona z Veveří }}, {{lang-de| Madonna von Eichhorn }} ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/madonna-of-veveri?excludenudity=true&amp;mediatype=photography&amp;phrase=madonna%20of%20veveri&amp;sort=mostpopular Madona of Veveri - Getty images]&lt;/ref&gt; is an tempera painting by the unknown moravian, bohemian (or probably italian) (active in [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian lands]]) artist generally called [[Master of Vyšší Brod]]. The altarpiece was commissioned after 1344 by Margrave [[John Henry, Margrave of Moravia|John Henry of Luxembourg]] for the romanesque church of [[Assumption of Our Lady]], In the neighborhood of [[Veveří Castle|royal Veveří castle]] in [[Brno]], [[Moravia]], [[Czech Republic]].

The panel was one of the first Madonnas painted by the artist. [[Albert Kutal]] a Czech scholar called it "a truly rare and extraordinary work".&lt;ref&gt;FILIPOVÁ, Marta, The Construction of national identity in the historiography of Czech art.

== Composition ==
The painting is in [[tempera]] on [[pine wood]] panel, canvas-covered with gently [[pastiglia]] [[stucco]] relief decoration and of [[Gilding|additional gold metal slices]], measures 79,5&amp;nbsp;cm by 62,5&amp;nbsp;cm. Madonna, Mary is seen half-figure with the Child in her lap, holding the [[Christ Child]]. The latter's left hand is touching his mother's, while under the right hand holds a [[bird]] – [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]], (because of the thistle seeds the goldfinch often eats, in [[Christian symbolism]] the goldfinch is associated with [[Christ's Passion]] and his crown of thorns).  The Virgin Mary is [[Coronation|coronated]] by double crown on uncovered loose hair, without a veil. Some [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]]-[[Italian art|Italian]] traces notwithstanding, the painting shows a further step in the assimilation of Italian influences, which are adapted in an individually and stylistically balanced manner.

== Painting materials ==
Pigment analysis of Master of Vyšší Brod's masterpiece reveals the usual pigments of the high gothic period such as [[ferric oxide]] mixed with orpiment in the red drapery on top of the painting, [[Ultramarine|natural ultramarine]] mixed with lead white in the blue robe of Madonna (inside).

'''''Madonna of the Fish''''', known also as '''''Madonna with the Fish''''' is a painting by the [[High Renaissance]] master [[Raphael]]. 

[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] sits enthroned with the [[Jesus]] on her knee. On one side is [[St. Jerome]] kneeling by the Lion; he is holding a book. On the other side the archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] is presenting at the foot of the throne the young [[Tobias]], whom he formerly guided to the [[River Tigris]], and who bears the miraculous fish whose heart, liver and gall were to restore his father's sight, and drive the demons from his bride. Tobias with his fish was an early type of baptism. Raphael leading Tobias always expresses protection, and especially protection to the young. The picture is believed to have been painted around 1512-14 to commemorate the introduction of [[Book of Tobit]] to the canonical books of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. St. Jerome translated the Book of Tobit into [[Latin]], which explains his presence on the right of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;1912 review of ''Madonna and the Fish'' on {{cite web |url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles34/italian-pictures-5.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910003010/http://www.oldandsold.com/articles34/italian-pictures-5.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manfred Byron 1st edition.jpg|thumb|1817 [[first edition]], [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray, London]].]] [[Image:Cole Thomas Scene from -Manfred 1833.jpg|right|thumb|"Scene from ''Manfred''" by [[Thomas Cole]], 1833.]]
{{Italic title}}
'''''Manfred: A dramatic poem''''' is a [[closet drama]] written in 1816–1817 by [[Lord Byron]]. It contains [[supernatural]] elements, in keeping with the popularity of the [[ghost story]] in England at the time. It is a typical example of a [[Gothic fiction]].

Byron commenced this work in late 1816, only a few months after the famous ghost-story sessions with [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Mary Shelley]] that provided the initial impetus for ''[[Frankenstein]]''. The [[supernatural]] references are made clear throughout the poem.

''Manfred'' was adapted musically by [[Robert Schumann]] in 1852, in a composition entitled ''[[Manfred (Schumann)|Manfred: Dramatic Poem with Music in Three Parts]]'', and later by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] in his ''[[Manfred Symphony]]''. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was inspired by the poem's depiction of a super-human being to compose a piano score in 1872 based on it, "Manfred Meditation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.critical-theory.com/the-musical-equivalent-of-a-crime-in-the-moral-world-the-music-of-friedrich-nietzsche/|title=The Musical Equivalent of a "Crime in the Moral World," the Music of Friedrich Nietzsche|date=18 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Byron wrote this "metaphysical drama", as he called it, after his marriage to [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Annabella Millbanke]] failed because of a scandal due to charges of sexual improprieties and an incestuous affair between Byron and his half-sister, [[Augusta Leigh]]. Attacked by the press and ostracised by London society, Byron fled England for Switzerland in 1816 and never returned.  At the time, he  was living at the [[Villa Diodati]] in Switzerland.

Because ''Manfred'' was written immediately after this, and because it regards a main character tortured by his own sense of guilt for an unmentionable offence, some critics consider it to be autobiographical, or even confessional.&lt;ref&gt;"Manfred, George Gordon (Noel), Lord Byron – Introduction." Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism. Ed. Edna M. Hedblad Russel Whitaker. Vol. 109. Gale Cengage, 2002. eNotes.com. 2006. 25 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The unnamed but forbidden nature of Manfred's relationship to Astarte is believed to represent Byron's relationship with his half-sister Augusta.

Most of ''Manfred'' was written on a tour through the [[Bernese Alps]] in September 1816. The third act was rewritten in February 1817 since Byron was not happy with its first version.

==Plot==
'''Manfred''' is a [[Faust]]ian noble living in the [[Bernese Alps]]. Internally tortured by some mysterious guilt, which has to do with the death of his most beloved, '''Astarte''', he uses his mastery of language and spell-casting to summon '''seven spirits''', from whom he seeks forgetfulness. The spirits, who rule the various components of the [[wikt:corporeal|corporeal]] world, are unable to control past events and thus cannot grant Manfred's plea. For some time, [[destiny|fate]] prevents him from escaping his guilt through suicide.

At the end, Manfred dies, defying religious temptations of redemption from sin. Throughout the poem he succeeds in challenging all of the authoritative powers he faces, and chooses death over submitting to the powerful spirits. Manfred directs his final words to the '''Abbot''', remarking, "Old man! 'tis not so difficult to die". "The unconquerable individual to the end, Manfred gives his soul to neither heaven nor hell, only to death."&lt;ref name=Poetry/&gt; 

==Critique==
Published in June 1817, ''Manfred'' has as its [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] the famous phrase of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'': "There are more things in heaven and earth, [[Horatio (Hamlet)|Horatio]], than are dreamt of in your philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare-navigators.com/hamlet/H15.html#166|title=HAMLET, Act 1, Scene 5|website=shakespeare-navigators.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows heavy influence from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', which Byron most likely read in translation (although he claimed to have never read it).

''Manfred'' has as its theme defiant humanism, represented by the hero’s refusal to bow to supernatural authority.&lt;ref name=Poetry&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/lord-byron|title=Lord Byron (George Gordon)|date=28 June 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter L. Thorslev, Jr. notes that Manfred conceals behind a Gothic exterior the tender heart of the Hero of Sensibility; but as a rebel, like Satan, Cain, and Prometheus, he embodies Romantic self-assertion.&lt;ref&gt;Thorslev, Peter L. Jr., ''The Byronic Hero: Types and Prototypes'', (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In performance==
''Manfred'' was not originally intended for stage performance; it was written to be a dramatic poem or, as Byron called it, a "metaphysical" drama.
It has received much more attention on stage for its musical treatments by Tchaikovsky and Schumann than it has on its own dramatic terms. 
Nevertheless, ''Manfred'' was later famously played by [[Samuel Phelps]]. 

There are no recorded full stagings in Britain in the twentieth century, but readings are more popular, partly because of the difficulty of staging a play set in the Alps, partly because of the work's nature as a closet drama that was never actually intended for the stage in the first place. The exceptional size of the role of Manfred also makes the play difficult to cast. There was a production on [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1988, however, which starred [[Ronald Pickup]] as Manfred. A new production, adapted and directed by [[Pauline Harris]] with original music composed and performed by [[Olly Fox]] and starring [[Joseph Millson]] as Manfred, was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] on 8 January 2017 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of ''Manfred'''s completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b087qh9w|title=Manfred, Drama on 3 - BBC Radio 3|website=BBC|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manfred in literature==

The character Manfred was mentioned by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]] in his novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', where the Count declares: "No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting Manfred. I wish my life to be free and open."
Indeed, the Count of Monte Cristo is quite similar to Manfred, in that he wants to keep his past a secret, feels superior to social conventions, and is following an agenda that runs counter to the social mores.

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] mentions the poem in ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' when the narrator states, "I received countless millions and immediately gave them away for the benefit of humanity, at the same moment confessing before the crowd all my infamies, which, of course, were not mere infamies, but also contained within them a wealth of 'the lofty and the beautiful' of something Manfred-like" (Dostoyevsky, page 57. Bantam Books 2005)

On page 61 of ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]], Di Presso seems to refer (perhaps by accident) to Metzger as Manfred.

Manfred's oft-quoted speech from Act II Scene 1 which begins "Think'st thou existence doth depend on time?" is quoted on page 351 of ''[[The Masters of Solitude]]'' by [[Marvin Kaye]] and [[Parke Godwin]].

'In Memory of My Feelings', the poem by [[Frank O'Hara]], includes the line "Manfred climbs to my nape,/ speaks, but I do not hear him,/ I'm too blue."

In [[Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell]] by [[Susanna Clarke]], Byron is said to have written Manfred after meeting the magician Jonathan Strange and finding him most disagreeable. It is suggested that he wrote it because he was so disappointed with Strange that he created a magician more to his liking.

==Other references to Manfred==
In the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] comic opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' Manfred is referenced in Colonel Calverley's [[patter song]] "If you want a receipt for that popular mystery" (A Heavy Dragoon), listing one ingredient as "a little of Manfred but not very much of him".

[[Germany|German]] [[gothic metal]] band [[The Vision Bleak]] extensively quote from ''Manfred'' in their song "A Curse of the Grandest Kind", on their 2010 album ''[[Set Sail to Mystery]]''

Manfred Township in the southwestern corner of Lac qui Parle County in western Minnesota was named for the Byron poem.  The county was established in 1871 and Manfred Township in 1879, showing the immense popularity of the poem at that time.

Fox cancelled the show with 4 of the 13 episodes remaining unaired after heated meetings with Method Man &amp; Redman, who were not pleased with the show. The duo publicly criticized Fox several times after this.

[[Method Man]] was disappointed about the series for having a [[laugh track]] and Fox doing a bad job on editing. He had wanted it to be in the vein of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]],'' of which he is a fan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">The '''National Campaign for the Arts''' ('''NCA''') is a [[United Kingdom]] lobbying group campaigning for all the arts. Their [http://forthearts.org.uk website] states "We campaign for more public investment in the arts because we believe that the arts are for everyone and make everyone’s lives better."

The current Chair is the actor and director [[Samuel West]]. Other Board members include the visual artist [[Bob and Roberta Smith]], the writer and broadcaster [[A. L. Kennedy]] and Artistic Director of the [[Holland Festival]], [[Ruth Mackenzie]] CBE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forthearts.org.uk/who-we-are/our-board/ title=NCA Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==
The NCA publish the ''[http://forthearts.org.uk/publications/arts-index-england-2007-2014/ Arts Index]'', a bi-annual "health check for the arts". ''50p for Culture'' is a campaign which ranks Local Authorities by the amount of their investment in culture and encourages constituents to write to them in support or encouragement. ''Hearts for the Arts'' is an annual award that recognises excellence in Local Authority support for the arts.

The NCA came into being in 1985 through the merger of the National Lobby for the Arts (NLA) and British Arts Voice (BRAVO). It was established as a membership organization, receiving no government funding.

The NCA was initially funded by six organizations which represent professional artists: the [[Association of British Orchestras]]; [[British Actors' Equity Association]]; the [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union]] (BECTU); the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]]; the [[The Society of London Theatre|Society of West End Theatres]] and the [[Theatrical Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forthearts.org.uk/who-we-are/our-history/ title=NCA History]&lt;/ref&gt;

NCA is a charity and a company limited by guarantee, established to campaign with and on behalf of the public and the arts sector for more public funding and investment.

[[File:Seaside, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Seaside, Florida]]]]
'''New Urbanism''' is an [[urban design]] movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating [[Walkability|walkable]] neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/49f234rd|author=Boeing|title=LEED-ND and Livability Revisited|journal=Berkeley Planning Journal|date=2014|volume=27|pages=31–55|accessdate=2015-04-15|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of [[real estate development]], [[urban planning]], and municipal [[land-use]] strategies.

New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to [[World War II]]; it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design (TND) and [[transit-oriented development]] (TOD).&lt;ref&gt;Kelbaugh, Douglas S. 2002. Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited. Seattle: University of Washington Press. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Urbanism Principles|url = http://www.newurbanism.org/newurbanism/principles.html|website = www.newurbanism.org|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Celebration fl.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Market Street, [[Celebration, Florida]]]]

The organizing body for New Urbanism is the [https://www.cnu.org/ Congress for the New Urbanism], founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the ''Charter of the New Urbanism'', which begins:

{{quote|We advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population; communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car; cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions; urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, [[ecology]], and building practice.&lt;ref name="The Charter of the New Urbanism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=The Charter of the New Urbanism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New Urbanists support: [[regional planning]] for open space; context-appropriate [[architecture]] and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres;&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Planning, Funding and Delivering Social Infrastructure in Australia's Outer Suburban Growth Areas|journal=Urban Policy and Research|date=16 February 2016|doi=10.1080/08111146.2015.1099523|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/iESRIdipyg6q3MvIyPS3/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in [[suburban sprawl]]. The ''[[Charter of the New Urbanism]]'' also covers issues such as [[historic preservation]], safe streets, [[green building]], and the re-development of [[brownfield land]]. The ten [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]] also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches.

Architecturally, new urbanist developments are often accompanied by [[New Classical Architecture|New Classical]], [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], or [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] styles, although that is not always the case.

==Background==

[[File:Downtown baldwin park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|New Broad Street, [[Baldwin Park, Florida]]]]

Until the mid 20th century, cities were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods. For most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable, although with the development of [[public transport|mass transit]] the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines, allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as [[streetcar suburb]]s. But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies, attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car.&lt;ref&gt;Kunstler, James Howard. 1998. ''Home from nowhere: remaking our everyday world for the twenty-first Century.'' A Touchstone book. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster. p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, after World War II [[urban planner|urban planning]] largely centered around the use of municipal [[zoning]] ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development, and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing [[Middle class in the United States|middle class]]. The physical separation of where people live from where they work, shop and frequently spend their recreational time, together with low housing density, which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms, made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of [[automobile dependency]].

[[File:St petersburg florida downtown.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Beach Drive, [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]]]

This new system of development, with its rigorous separation of uses, arose after [[World War II]] and became known as "conventional suburban development"&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon and Shayne Vipond: "Gross Density and New Urbanism: Comparing Conventional and New Urbanist Suburbs in Markham, Ontario".  Journal of the American Planning Association, 1939-0130, Volume 71, Issue 1, 2005, pages 41–54&lt;/ref&gt; or pejoratively as [[urban sprawl]]. The majority of U.S. citizens now live in [[suburb]]an communities built in the last fifty years, and automobile use per capita has soared.

[[File:Post office in celebration.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Celebration, FL]] Post Office, designed by architect [[Michael Graves]]]]

Although New Urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later, a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the [[modernist]] planning techniques being put into practice. Social philosopher and historian [[Lewis Mumford]] criticized the "anti-urban" development of post-war America. ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]],'' written by [[Jane Jacobs]] in the early 1960s, called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects, large car-dependent thoroughfares, and segregated commercial centers that had become the "norm". The French architect [[François Spoerry]] has developed in the 60's the concept of "soft architecture" that he applied to [[Port Grimaud]], a new marina in south of France. The success of this project had a considerable influence and led to many new projects of soft architecture like [[Port Liberté]] in [[New Jersey]] or Le Plessis Robisson in France.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Rooted in these early dissenters, the ideas behind New Urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the "European" city proposed by architect [[Leon Krier]], and the [[pattern language]] theories of [[Christopher Alexander]]. The term "new urbanism" itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Barton |date=1985 |title=The New Urbanism as a Way of Life: The Relationship Between Inner City Revitalization in Canada and the Rise of the New Middle Class |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5NyySgAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22new+urbanism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1MYLVLCvMpecygTnioCQDw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA |accessdate=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meinig |first=Donald |date=1986 |title=The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k98OEM26HSAC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=%22new+urbanism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UMwLVPfZOZCcygTQm4CAAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20urbanism%22&amp;f=false |publisher=Yale University Press |page=255 |isbn=978-0-300-17394-9 |accessdate=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1991 |title=Urban Design Update: Newsletter of the Institute for Urban Design, Volumes 7–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8dUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22created+under+the+rubric+of+New+Urbanism%22&amp;dq=%22created+under+the+rubric+of+New+Urbanism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mc4LVOKkC5KNyATUt4DQCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA |publisher=Institute for Urban Design |accessdate=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the [[Local Government Commission (Sacramento, California)|Local Government Commission]], a private nonprofit group in [[Sacramento, California]], invited architects [[Peter Calthorpe]], Michael Corbett, [[Andrés Duany]], Elizabeth Moule, [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]], [[Stefanos Polyzoides]], and Daniel Solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning. Named the ''[[Ahwahnee Principles]]'' (after [[Yosemite National Park]]'s [[Ahwahnee Hotel]]), the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991, at its first Yosemite Conference for Local Elected Officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgc.org/about/ahwahnee/principles|title=Principles – Local Government Commission|work=Local Government Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calthorpe, Duany, Moule, Plater-Zyberk, Polyzoides, and Solomon founded the Chicago-based Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993. The CNU has grown to more than three thousand members, and is the leading international organization promoting New Urbanist design principles. It holds annual Congresses in various U.S. cities.

In 2009, co-founders Elizabeth Moule, Hank Dittmar, and Stefanos Polyzoides authored the Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between New Urbanism and sustainability. The Canons are "a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building, the making of community, and the conservation of our natural world". They promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions, the use of locally obtained materials, and in general, a "culture of permanence". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/sites/files/Canons.pdf  The Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625234557/http://www.cnu.org/sites/files/Canons.pdf |date=2014-06-25 }} |date=October 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

New Urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales. And while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant, New Urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning, architecture, and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Cozens, Paul Michael. 2008. New Urbanism, Crime and the Suburbs: A Review of the Evidence. Urban Policy and Research. 26(4):429–444.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
[[File:New Urbanism.jpg|thumb|New Urbanism]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Andrés Duany]] and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]], two of the founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops, front porches, and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] neighborhoods of [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. They and their colleagues observed patterns including the following:

[[File:Celebration fl park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A park in [[Celebration, Florida]]]]
[[File:Great King St., New Town.jpg|thumb|Great King St, New Town, Edinburgh]]

* The neighborhood has a discernible center. This is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner. A transit stop would be located at this center.
* Most of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center, an average of roughly {{convert|0.25|mi|km}}.
* There are a variety of dwelling types — usually houses, [[terraced house|rowhouse]]s, and [[apartment building|apartment]]s — so that younger and older people, [[Single (relationship)|single]]s and families, the poor and the wealthy may find places to live.
* At the edge of the neighborhood, there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household.
* A small ancillary building or [[garage apartment]] is permitted within the backyard of each house. It may be used as a rental unit or place to work (for example, an office or craft workshop).
* An elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home.
* There are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling — not more than a tenth of a mile away.
* Streets within the neighborhood form a connected network, which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination.
* The streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees. This slows traffic, creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles.
* Buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street, creating a well-defined outdoor room.
* Parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street. Parking is relegated to the rear of buildings, usually accessed by alleys.
* Certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings. These provide sites for community meetings, education, and religious or cultural activities.

==Terminology==

[[File:House in celebration.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A [[Mediterranean Revival]] house in [[Celebration, Florida]]]]

Several terms are viewed either as synonymous, included in, or overlapping with the New Urbanism. The terms Neotraditional Development&lt;ref&gt;http://facweb.arch.ohio-state.edu/jnasar/crpinfo/research/NeoTradJPER2003.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Traditional Neighborhood Development are often associated with the New Urbanism. These terms generally refer to complete New Towns or new neighborhoods, often built in traditional architectural styles, as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects. The term Traditional Urbanism has also been used to describe the New Urbanism by those who object to the "new" moniker. The term "Walkable Urbanism" was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor Christopher Leinberger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leinberger|first1=Christopher|title=The Option of Urbanism|date=2009|publisher=Island Press|location=District of Columbia|isbn=1-59726-137-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many debate whether [[Smart Growth]] and the New Urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two; overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements. Placemaking is another term that is often used to signify New Urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups. The term Transit-Oriented Development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent New Urbanist [[Peter Calthorpe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/409612/does-china-s-urbanization-spell-doom-or-salvation-peter-calthorpe-weighs-in/|title=Does China's Urbanization Spell Doom or Salvation? Peter Calthorpe Weighs In&amp;nbsp;... |work=ArchDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is heavily promoted by New Urbanists. The term [[Sustainable development]] is sometimes associated with the New Urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of New Urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s, however, this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the [[United Nations]] and [[Agenda 21]] to include [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] issues (e.g., [[developing country]]) that exceed the scope of [[land development]] intended to be addressed by the New Urbanism or [[Sustainable Urbanism]]. The term "livability" or "livable communities" was popular under the [[Obama administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.streetsblog.org/2011/05/04/president-obamas-transportation-bill-prioritizes-livability-high-speed-rail/|title=President Obama's Transportation Bill Prioritizes Livability, High-Speed Rail – Streetsblog USA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the [[Local Government Commission (Sacramento, California)|Local Government Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newpartners.org/about/about-the-event|title=About the Event|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023010313/http://www.newpartners.org/about/about-the-event|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:House in baldwin park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A [[Key West]] style house in [[Baldwin Park, Florida]]]]

Planning magazine discussed the proliferation of "urbanisms" in an article in 2011 titled "A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Jonathan|title=A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms|date=April 2014|volume=77|issue=4|pages=19–21|url=https://www.planning.org/planning/2011/apr/60urbanisms.htm|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several New Urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the New Urbanism including [[Sustainable Urbanism]] and Tactical Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2012/03/guide-tactical-urbanism/1387/|title=The Official Guide to Tactical Urbanism|work=CityLab}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of which Guerrilla Urbanism can be viewed as a subset). The term Tactical Urbanism was coined by Frenchman Michel de Certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by New Urbanist Mike Lydon and the co-authors of the Tactical Urbanism Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tactical-urbanism-citizen-projects-go-mainstream/|title=Tactical urbanism: Citizen projects go mainstream|date=1 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[Andres Duany]] authored a book that used the term Agrarian Urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of New Urbanist town design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Duany, Andres]] | title=Garden Cities: Theory &amp; Practice of Agrarian Urbanism | publisher=The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment | year=2011| isbn=1-906384-04-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 a group of New Urbanists led by CNU co-founder [[Andres Duany]] began a research project under the banner of Lean Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/03/why-andres-duany-so-focused-making-lean-urbanism-thing/8635/|title=Why Andrés Duany Is So Focused on Making 'Lean Urbanism' a Thing|work=CityLab}}&lt;/ref&gt; which purported to provide a bridge between Tactical Urbanism and the New Urbanism.

Other terms have surfaced in reaction to the New Urbanism intended to provide a contrast, alternative to, or a refinement of the New Urbanism. Some of these terms include Everyday Urbanism by Harvard Professor Margaret Crawford, John Chase, and John Kaliski,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chase, John | title=Everyday Urbanism| publisher=The Monacelli Press | year=1999| isbn=1-885254-81-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecological Urbanism]], and True Urbanism by architect Bernard Zyscovich. [[Landscape urbanism]] was popularized by Charles Waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the New Urbanism in his lectures at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehaffy|first1=Michael|title=The Landscape Urbanism: Sprawl in a Pretty Green Dress?|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/46262|website=Planetizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents'', edited by Andres Duany and Emily Talen, specifically addressed the tension between these two views of [[urbanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/L/Landscape-Urbanism-and-its-Discontents|title=Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents|work=New Society Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael E. Arth]] promotes what he describes as a variant of the New Urbanism called the [[New pedestrianism|New Pedestrianism]], which is intended to be more pedestrian-oriented and traces its origins to a 1929 [[planned community]] in [[Radburn, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="ArthMichael"&gt;Arth, Michael E. (2010). ''Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests'' Golden Apples Media, {{ISBN|978-0-912467-12-2}}. pp. 120–139, 363–386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

The primary organization promoting the New Urbanism in the United States is the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] (CNU). The Congress for the New Urbanism is the leading organization promoting walkable, mixed-use neighborhood development, sustainable communities and healthier living conditions.  CNU members promote the principles of CNU's Charter and the hallmarks of New Urbanism, including:

* Livable streets arranged in compact, walkable blocks.
* A range of housing choices to serve people of diverse ages and income levels.
* Schools, stores and other nearby destinations reachable by walking, bicycling or transit service.
* An affirming, human-scaled public realm where appropriately designed buildings define and enliven streets and other public spaces.

The CNU has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], with approximately one hundred attendees. By 2008 the Congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings.

The CNU began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the New England and Florida Chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnuflorida.org/|title=Home – Congress For The New Urbanism Florida Chapter|work=Congress For The New Urbanism Florida Chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more.  {{As of|2013}}, Canada hosts two full CNU Chapters, one in Ontario (CNU Ontario), and one in British Columbia (Cascadia) which also includes a portion of the north-west US states.

While the CNU has international participation in Canada, sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the Council for European Urbanism (CEU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceunet.org/|title=C.E.U. Council for European Urbanism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Movement for Israeli Urbanism (MIU) and the Australian Council for the New Urbanism.

By 2002 chapters of Students for the New Urbanism began appearing at universities including the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]], [[University of Georgia]], [[University of Notre Dame]], and the [[University of Miami]]. In 2003, a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th Congress in Washington, D.C. and began developing a "Manifesto of the Next Generation of New Urbanists". The [[Next Generation of New Urbanists]] held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the CNU in Chicago in 2004. The group has continued meeting annually {{As of|2014|lc=y}} with a focus on young professionals, students, new member issues, and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the New Urbanism and the CNU. Spinoff projects of the Next Generation of the New Urbanists include the Living Urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first [[Tactical Urbanism]] Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/|title=Tactical Urbanism Materials Guide – Your resource for getting TU Projects done in your community!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CNU has spawned publications and research groups. Publications include the ''New Urban News'' and the ''New Town Paper''. Research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the Form-Based Codes Institute, The National Charrette Institute and the Center for Applied Transect Studies.

In the [[United Kingdom]] New Urbanist and European urbanism principles are practised and taught by [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment]]. Other organisations promote New Urbanism as part of their remit, such as [[International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture &amp; Urbanism|INTBAU]], A Vision of Europe, and others.

The CNU and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with like-minded groups. Organizations under the banner of [[Smart Growth]] also often work with the Congress for the New Urbanism. In addition the CNU has formed partnerships on specific projects such as working with the [[United States Green Building Council]] and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] to develop the [[LEED for Neighborhood Development]] standards,&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt; and with the [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] to develop a [[Context Sensitive Solutions]] (CSS) Design manual.

==Film==

The New Urbanism Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newurbanismfilmfestival.com/|title=New Urbanism Film Festival|work=New Urbanism Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in 2013 and 2014 in Los Angeles to highlight films and short films about the New Urbanism and related topics. The 2011 film ''[[Urbanized]]'' by Gary Hustwit featured then CNU Board Chair Ellen Dunham-Jones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hustwit.com/about-urbanized/|title=About Urbanized|work=Gary Hustwit|access-date=2014-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023010411/http://www.hustwit.com/about-urbanized/|archive-date=2014-10-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other urban thinkers on the international story of urbanization including the New Urbanist efforts in the United States.

The 2004 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The End of Suburbia|The End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream]]'' argues that the depletion of oil will result in the demise of the sprawl-type development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endofsuburbia.com [http://www.endofsurburbia.com/ link to official website]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism]]'', a feature length 2008 documentary about urban designer [[Michael E.

==Criticism==
{{Globalize|date=February 2010}}
New Urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the [[political spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|title=From Garden City to Eco-urbanism: The quest for sustainable neighborhood development|journal=Sustainable Cities and Society|date=September 2015|doi=10.1016/j.scs.2015.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticized both for being a [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers.

Journalist [[Alex Marshall (Journalist)|Alex Marshall]] has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty, aspirational slogans.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Alex Marshall, "Building New Urbanism: Less Filling, But Not So Tasty", ''Builder Magazine'', 30 November 1999, p. ___. Print; archived on Marshall's web site, http://www.alexmarshall.org/2006/08/02/building-new-urbanism-less-filling-but-not-so-tasty/. Retrieved 1 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 article in [[Metropolis (architecture magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]], Marshall denounced New Urbanism as "a grand fraud".&lt;ref&gt;Alex Marshall, "Suburbs in Disguise", ''Metropolis Magazine'', July 1996, p. 70, republished as "New Urbanism" in Busch, Akiko, ed., ''Design is&amp;nbsp;... Words, Things, People, Buildings and Places'' (New York:Metropolis Books/Princeton Architectural Press, 2002), p. 272; and as "Suburbs in Disguise" on Marshall's web site, http://www.alexmarshall.org/2007/08/31/suburbs-in-disguise/, retrieved 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The attack continued in numerous articles, including an opinion column in the ''Washington Post'' in September of the same year,&lt;ref&gt;Alex Marshall, "Putting Some 'City' Back In the Suburbs", ''Washington Post'', 1 September 1996, p. C1, print, https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/growth/solutions/nokent.htm; retrieved 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Marshall's first book, [http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/marhow ''How Cities Work:  Suburbs, Sprawl, and the Roads Not Taken'']&lt;ref&gt;U. of Texas Press 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the New Urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, S. et al. (2004) A Decade of HOPE VI. The Urban Institute&lt;/ref&gt;  Independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments,&lt;ref&gt;Goetz, Edward G. (2003) Clearing the Way: Deconcentrating the Poor in Urban America, The Urban Institute Press: Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaskin, R.J., Joseph, M.L., Webber, H.S. (2007) The Theoretical Basis for Addressing Poverty Through Mixed-Income Development. Urban Affairs Review 42 (3): 369–409.&lt;/ref&gt; but the argument that New Urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, J. and K. Perrott (2009) Producing diversity in a new urbanism community. Town Planning Review 80 (3): 267–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parties have criticized the New Urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking, cycling, and public transport. The Charter of the New Urbanism states that "communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car".&lt;ref name="The Charter of the New Urbanism"/&gt; Some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of [[Car-free movement|car-free developments]].  Michael E Arth proposes [[new pedestrianism]] as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrian-only paths. Steve Melia proposes the idea of "filtered permeability" (see [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)]]) which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limiting the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevemelia.co.uk/ltt.htm "Neighbourhoods Should be Made Permeable for Walking and Cycling but not for Cars"], Steve Melia, Local Transport Today, January 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the New Urbanism's claimed environmental benefits, a rating system for neighborhood environmental design, [[LEED-ND]], was developed by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnu.org/leednd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174711/http://www.cnu.org/leednd |archivedate=2014-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to quantify the sustainability of New Urbanist neighborhood design.&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/getting-know-leed-neighborhood-development|title=Getting to know LEED: Neighborhood Development|date=1 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Urbanist and board member of CNU, [[Doug Farr]] has taken a step further and coined [[Sustainable Urbanism]], which combines New Urbanism and LEED-ND to create walkable, transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure.

New Urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned, large-scale development, "instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves".&lt;ref&gt;[http://p2pfoundation.net/Brief_History_of_P2P-Urbanism "A brief history of Peer-to-peer Urbanism"], Nikos Salingaros and Federico Mena-Quintero, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions.&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, J.

==Examples==
{{Main article|Examples of New Urbanism}}

===United States===

New Urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow. At least fourteen large-scale planning initiatives are based on the principles of linking transportation and land-use policies, and using the neighborhood as the fundamental building block of a region.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} [[Miami, Florida]], has adopted the most ambitious New Urbanist-based zoning code reform yet undertaken by a major U.S. city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/node/3166|title=Saving western Maryland before it's swallowed up|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than six hundred new towns, villages, and neighborhoods, following New Urbanist principles, have been planned or are currently under construction in the U.S. Hundreds of new, small-scale, urban and suburban infill projects are under way to reestablish walkable streets and blocks. In Maryland and several other states, New Urbanist principles are an integral part of ''[[smart growth]]'' legislation.

In the mid-1990s, the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) adopted the principles of the New Urbanism in its multibillion-dollar program to rebuild public housing projects nationwide. New Urbanists have planned and developed hundreds of projects in infill locations. Most were driven by the private sector, but many, including HUD projects, used public money.

====University Place in Memphis====

In 2010 University Place in Memphis became the second only [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) LEED certified neighborhood.  LEED ND (neighborhood development) standards integrates principles of smart growth, urbanism and green building  and were developed through a collaboration between USGBC, Congress for the New Urbanism, and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]].  University Place, developed by [[McCormack Baron Salazar]], is a 405-unit, 30-acre, mixed-income, mixed use, multigenerational, [[HOPE VI]] grant community that revitalized the severely distressed Lamar Terrace public housing site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multihousingnews.com/news/south/architecture-inc-celebrates-leed-nd-certification-of-university-place-in-memphis/1004034759.html  Architecture Inc. Celebrates LEED-ND Certification of University Place in Memphis], Multi Housing News, May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Cotton District====
[[The Cotton District]] in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], was the first New Urbanist development, begun in 1968 long before the New Urbanism movement was organized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tndtownpaper.com/Volume4/new_towns_cotton_district.htm] The Town Paper, Vol. 4, No. 1 — December 2001/ January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The District borders Mississippi State University, and consists mostly of residential rental units for college students along with restaurants, bars and retail. The Cotton District got its name because it is built in the vicinity of an old cotton mill.

====Seaside====
[[Seaside, Florida]], the first fully New Urbanist town, began development in 1981 on eighty acres (324,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of [[Florida Panhandle]] coastline. It was featured on the cover of the [[Atlantic Monthly]] in 1988, when only a few streets were completed, and has become internationally famous for its architecture, and the quality of its streets and public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamer|first1=David|title=Learning from the past: Historic Districts and the New Urbanism in the United States|journal=Planning Perspectives|date=2000|volume=15|issue=2|pages=107–122|doi=10.1080/026654300364047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaside is now a tourist destination and appeared in the 1998 movie ''[[The Truman Show]]''. Lots sold for $15,000 in the early 1980s, and slightly over a decade later, the price had escalated to about $200,000. Today, most lots sell for more than a million dollars, and some houses top $5&amp;nbsp;million.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

====Mueller Community====
The [[Mueller Community]] is located on the 700 acre site of the former [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]] in [[Austin, Texas]], which closed in 1999. Per the developer, the value of the Mueller development upon completion will be $1.3 billion, and will comprise 4.2 million square feet of non-residential development, 650,000 square feet of retail space, 4,600 homes, and 140 acres of open space. An estimated 10,000 permanent jobs within the development will have been created by the time it is complete. The Mueller Community also has more electric cars per capita than any other neighborhood in the United States – a fact partially attributable to an incentive program.

====Stapleton====
The site of the former [[Stapleton International Airport]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and [[Aurora, Colorado]], closed in 1995, is now being redeveloped by [[Forest City Enterprises]].&lt;ref name="LAT 2003-10-18"&gt;Vincent, Roger and Groves, Martha (October 18, 2003) [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/18/business/fi-playa18 "L.A.'s Urban Model"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved 12 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Stapleton is expected to be home to at least 30,000 residents, six schools and 2&amp;nbsp;million square feet (180,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of retail. Construction began in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandtech.org/ DSST Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-26-100-million_x.htm USA Today&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northfield Stapleton]], one of the development's major retail centers, recently opened.

====San Antonio====
In 1997 [[San Antonio, Texas]], as part of a new master plan, created new regulations called the Unified Development Code (UDC), largely influenced by New Urbanism. One feature of the UDC is six unique land development patterns that can be applied to certain districts: Conservation Development, Commercial Center Development, Office or Institutional Campus Development, Commercial Retrofit Development, Tradition Neighborhood Development, [[Transit Oriented Development]]. Each district has specific standards and design regulation. The six development patterns were created to reflect existing development patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Greenburg, Ellen, 2004. Codifying New Urbanism: How to Reform Municipal Land Development Regulations. American Planning Association PAS Report Number 526&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mountain House====
[[Mountain House, San Joaquin County, California|Mountain House]], one of the latest New Urbanist projects in the United States, is a new town located near [[Tracy, California]].  Construction started in 2001. Mountain House will consist of 12 villages, each with its own elementary school, park, and commercial area. In addition, a future [[train station]], transit center and bus system are planned for Mountain House.

====Mesa del Sol====
[[Mesa del Sol]], New Mexico—the largest New Urbanist project in the United States—was designed by architect [[Peter Calthorpe]], and is being developed by [[Forest City Enterprises]]. Mesa del Sol may take five decades to reach full build-out, at which time it should have 38,000 residential units, housing a population of 100,000; a {{convert|1400|acre|km2|adj=on}} industrial office park; four town centers; an urban center; and a [[downtown]] that would provide a [[twin towns and sister cities|twin city]] within [[Albuquerque]].

====I'On====
Located in [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina]], [[I'On]] is a traditional neighborhood development, mixed with a new urbanism  styled architecture, reflecting on the building designs of the nearby downtown areas of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Founded on April 30, 1995, I'On was designed by the town planning firms of Dover, Kohl &amp; Partners and [[Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company]], and currently holds over 750 single family homes. Features of the community include extensive sidewalks, shared [[public]] greens and parks, [[trails]] and a grid of narrow, [[traffic calming]] streets. Most homes are required to have a [[front porch]] of not less than eight feet (2.46&amp;nbsp;m) in depth. Floor heights of 10 feet (3.1&amp;nbsp;m), raised foundations and smaller lot sizes give the community a [[Urban density|dense]], vertical feel.

====Haile Plantation====
[[Haile Plantation, Florida]], is a 2,600 household ({{convert|1,700|acre|km2}}) development of regional impact southwest of the city of Gainesville, within Alachua County. Haile Village Center is a traditional neighborhood center within the development. It was originally started in 1978 and completed in 2007. In addition to the 2,600 homes the neighborhood consists of two merchant centers (one a New England narrow street village and the other a chain grocery strip mall). There are also two public elementary schools and an 18-hole golf course.

====Celebration, Florida====
In June 1996, the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]] unveiled its 5,000&amp;nbsp;acre (20&amp;nbsp;km²) town of [[Celebration, Florida|Celebration]], near Orlando, Florida. Celebration opened its downtown in October 1996, relying heavily on the experiences of Seaside, whose downtown was nearly complete. Disney shuns the label New Urbanism, calling Celebration simply a "town".

Celebration's Downtown has become one of the area's most popular tourist destinations making the community a showcase for New Urbanism as a prime example of the creation of a "sense of place".&lt;ref&gt;Celebration Business Alliance, Sept 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jersey City====
The construction of the [[Hudson Bergen Light Rail]] in [[Hudson County, New Jersey]] has spurred transit-oriented development. In [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], two projects are planned to transform [[brownfield]] sites, both of which have required remediation of [[toxic waste]] by previous owners. [[Bayfront, Jersey City|Bayfront]], once site of a [[Honeywell]] plant is a {{convert|100|acre|km2}} site on the [[Hackensack River]], and is nearby the planned West Campus of [[New Jersey City University]]. [[Canal Crossing, Jersey City|Canal Crossing]], named for the former [[Morris Canal]], was once partially owned by [[PPG Industries]], and is a {{convert|117|acre|km2}} site west of [[Liberty State Park]].

====Old York Village, Chesterfield Township, New Jersey====
The sparsely developed agricultural [[Chesterfield Township, New Jersey|Township of Chesterfield]] in [[New Jersey]] covers approximately {{convert|21.61|sqmi|km2}} and has made farmland preservation a priority since the 1970s.  Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than {{convert|7000|acre|km2}} of farmland through state and county programs and a township-wide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated "receiving area" known as Old York Village.  Old York Village is a neo-traditional, new urbanism town on {{convert|560|acre|km2}} incorporating a variety of housing types, neighborhood commercial facilities, a new elementary school, civic uses, and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village.  Construction began in the early 2000s and a significant percentage of the community is now complete. Old York Village was the winner of the American Planning Association National Outstanding Planning Award in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bF_sLhalru4J:www.clarkecatonhintz.com/news_62/cch.pdf+Old+York+Village+Chesterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShmUa4sV_i-RkZGv6VCfru69zqmyvd5QuPhmbvt5rknjP-2U5ceIqitHl7582Z5kNIPD4OgHwbRbyf1gybr7uRoLFeZNt2zwDdwkAHE8sIn0CrPSu1O0ENRX_hc9dHjNk6SxPjS&amp;sig=AHIEtbSNUnz4J_fonSY-LCM60WBGc0GLxw "Old York Village, Chesterfield Wins an American Planning Association Award for an Outstanding Project/ Program/ Tool"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesterfieldtwp.com/Smart%20Growth/smartgrowthpage.html "Old York Village Implementing Smart Growth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001092432/http://www.chesterfieldtwp.com/Smart%20Growth/smartgrowthpage.html |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesterfieldtwp.com/Smart%20Growth/Master%20Plan%20Amendment-May%2028,%202002.pdf "Master Plan Amendment: Township of Chesterfield"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Del Mar Station ====
[[Del Mar (Los Angeles Metro station)]], which won a Congress for the New Urbanism Charter Award in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/node/916#2003 "Charter Award Recipients"], Congress for the New Urbanism (accessed 8 April 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[transit-oriented development]] surrounding a prominent Metro Rail stop on the Gold Line, which connects Los Angeles and Pasadena. Located at the southern edge of downtown Pasadena, it serves as a gateway to the city with 347 apartments, out of which 15% are affordable units. Approximately 20,000 square feet of retail is linked with a network of public plazas, paseos and private courtyards. The 3.4-acre, $77 million project sits above a 1,200-car multi-level subterranean parking garage, with 600 spaces dedicated to transit. The light rail right of way, detailed as a public street, bisects the site.

Norfolk, VA, East Beach. designed and built in the style of traditional Atlantic coastal villages. The Master Plan for East Beach was developed in the style of “New Urbanism” by world renowned TND master planners Duany Plater-Zyberk.  Newly constructed homes reflect traditional classic detail and proportion of Tidewater Virginia homes, and are built with materials that will withstand the test of time and forces of Mother Nature and the Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbeachnorfolk.com/index.php|title=East Beach Norfolk – Luxury Condos, Villas, Waterfront Homes – A Simple Life on the Chesapeake Bay|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

New Urbanism is closely related to the [[Urban village]] movement in Europe. They both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning. In Europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than Modernist models. One well-publicized example is [[Poundbury]] in England, a suburban extension to the town of Dorchester, which was built on land owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] under the overview of [[Prince Charles]]. The original masterplan was designed by [[Leon Krier]]. A report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents, although the aspirations to reduce [[car dependency]] had not been successful. Rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people.&lt;ref name="poundbury"&gt;WATSON, G., BENTLEY, I., ROAF, S. and SMITH, P., 2004. Learning from Poundbury, Research for the West Dorset District Council and the Duchy of Cornwall. Oxford Brookes University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council for European Urbanism (CEU), formed in 2003, shares many of the same aims as the U.S.'s New Urbanists. CEU's Charter is a development of the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] Charter revised and reorganised to relate better to European conditions. An Australian organisation, Australian Council for New Urbanism has since 2001 run conferences and events to promote New Urbanism in that country. A [[New Zealand Urban Design Protocol]] was created by the Ministry for the Environment in 2005.

There are many developments around the world that follow New Urbanist principles to a greater or lesser extent:

====Europe====
*[[Le Plessis-Robinson]], a 21st-century example of [[New classical architecture|neo-traditionalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/57600|title=Le Plessis-Robinson: A Model for Smart Growth|work=Planetizen: The independent resource for people passionate about planning and related fields}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the south-west of Paris. This city is in the process of transforming itself, destroying old modern blocklike buildings and replacing them with traditional buildings and houses in one of the biggest worldwide projects with Val d'Europe.

====Australia====
Most new developments on the edges of Australia's major cities are master planned, often guided expressly by the principles of New Urbanism. The relationship between housing, activity centres, the transport network and key social infrastructure (sporting facilities, libraries, community centres etc.) is defined at structure planning stage.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;
*Tullimbar Village, NSW Australia, is a new development which follows the principles of New Urbanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tullimbar Village :: Wollongong NSW :: Contemporary Lifestyle Community|url = http://www.tullimbarvillage.com.au|website = www.tullimbarvillage.com.au|accessdate = 2015-05-29|first = Screen|last = Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}{{primary source inline|date=December 2017}}

Another important factor or principle of New Urbanism that guides Australia's major cities is how good their foot circulation seems to be which is guided by the wayfinding systems that are implemented. Kenneth B. Hall, Jr. and Gerald A. Porterfield said in their book, "Community by Design," the way to gain good circulation is to take some thoughtful consideration to things like wayfinding, sight lines, transition, visual clues, and reference points.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community by Design|last=Hall|first=Kenneth B.|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|others=Gerald A. Porterfield|year=2001|location=|pages=97|doi=10.1036/007141794X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulation design should work to create an interesting and informative system that utilizes subtle elements as well as technical ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; City of Port Philip, Australia,  is a good example of wayfinding where they have come up with a comprehensive pedestrian signage system, specifically for their local areas of St Kilda, South Melbourne and Port Melbourne.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoriawalks.org.au/wayfinding/|title=Case study - Wayfinding signage|website=www.victoriawalks.org.au|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.studiobinocular.com/2013/02/city-of-port-phillip-wayfinding/|title=City of Port Phillip: Wayfinding - Studio Binocular|date=2013-02-09|work=Studio Binocular|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's wayfinding system consists of 26 individually designed panels that are placed on some major streets such as St Kilda and St Kilda East, linking St Kilda Junction and Balaclava Station to the foreshore via Fitzroy, Carlisle and Acland Streets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; City of Port Philip also created directional signage systems that makes use of the already existing street furniture such as trash cans to help provide for 130 directional indicators across Port Melbourne.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">[[File:Milan - Pinacothèque de Brera - Cour intérieure.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in [[Milan]].]]
A '''pinacotheca''' ({{lang-la|pinacotheca}} borrowed from {{lang-el|πινακοθήκη}}, πίναξ "(painted) board, tablet" + θήκη "box, chest") was a picture gallery in either [[ancient Greece]] or [[ancient Rome]]. The name is specifically used for the building containing pictures which formed the left wing of the [[Propylaea]] on the [[Acropolis]] at [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. The Pinacotheca was located right by the [[temple of Athena Nike]]. Though [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (Bk. I., xxii. 6) speaks of the pictures "which time had not effaced," which seems to point to [[fresco painting]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}, the fact that there is no trace of preparation for [[stucco]] on the walls shows that the paintings were [[easel]] pictures ([[J. G. Frazer]], ''Pausanias's Description of Greece'', 1898, ii. 252). The Romans adopted the term for the room in a private house containing pictures, statues, and other works of art.

In the modern world the word is often used as a name for a public [[art gallery]] concentrating on paintings, mostly in Italy (as "Pinacoteca"), such as the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]] of the [[Vatican Museums]] (which is usually meant when the plain word is used), the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in Milan (more often "the Brera" informally), with others in [[Bologna]], [[Siena]], and [[Turin]]. In [[Brazil]], there is the [[Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo]]. In [[Paris]], the [[Pinacothèque de Paris]]. In [[Munich]] the three main galleries are called the [[Alte Pinakothek]] ([[old master]]s), [[Neue Pinakothek]] (19th century) and [[Pinakothek der Moderne]]. At Hallbergmoos, near Munich Airport, there was the Pinakothek Hallbergmoos (20th and 21st century) between 2010 and 2014.

==In literature==
[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' by John Everett Millais (1852) is part of the [[Tate Gallery]] collection. His painting influenced the image in both [[Laurence Olivier]]'s and [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s films of ''Hamlet''.]]
[[File:Ophelia (The Works, 1873).jpg|thumb|250px|Ophelia as appeared in ''The Works of Shakspere, with notes by Charles Knight'', ca. 1873]]

===Novels===
* Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], in the first chapter of his 1880 masterpiece ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', described a capricious young woman who committed suicide by throwing herself off a steep cliff into a river, simply to imitate Shakespeare's Ophelia. Dostoevsky concludes that "Even then, if the cliff, chosen and cherished from long ago, had not been so picturesque, if it had been merely a flat, prosaic bank, the suicide might not have taken place at all." Dostoevksy also depicts the heroine Grushenka as Ophelia, binding the two through the words "Woe is me!" in the chapter titled "The First Torment".
* ''[[Ophelia's Revenge]]'' (2003) by Rebecca Reisert is a retelling of ''Hamlet'' from Ophelia's point of view.
* ''[[Dating Hamlet]]'' (2002), by Lisa Fiedler, tells Ophelia's side of the play's story.
* In [[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1971) the protagonist, Miss Marple, continuously compares one of the suspects in the murder to Ophelia.
* Ophelia is mentioned several times in the novel ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' (1965), by [[Kurt Vonnegut]].
* In [[Jasper Fforde]]'s novel ''[[Something Rotten]]'' (2004) Ophelia tries to take over the play during Hamlet's excursion to the real world.
*''Ophelia'' by [[Lisa Klein]] tells the story of ''[[Hamlet]]'' from Ophelia's point of view.
* In [[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[Third Girl]]'' (1966) one character describes another character as an "unattractive Ophelia".
* In [[Joanna Briscoe]]'s novel ''You'' (2011), Ruth, one of the protagonist's youngest daughter (8), tries to be Ophelia by recreating her floating in the river while under the influence of psychedelic drugs.
* In [[Oscar Wilde]]'s novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890), Lord Henry Wotton tells Dorian that "Hetty [may be] floating at the present moment in some star-lit mill pond, with lovely waterlillies round her, like Ophelia ...", a reference to Ophelia's death.
* In John Lescroart’s 2013 novel ‘[[The Ophelia Cut]]’ character Moses McGuire’s daughter, Brittany, in response to her father’s concern that she has not built a lasting relationship with a man, says ‘I’m not some fragile Ophelia.’.

===Non-fiction===

*[[Mary Pipher]] alluded to Ophelia in the title of her nonfiction book ''Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls''. The book puts forth the thesis that modern American teenage girls are victimized, lost, and unsure of themselves, like Ophelia.

===Drama===
* Playwright [[Don Nigro]] explains Ophelia's madness in a first-person narrative by her in his 10-minute play ''Dead Men's Fingers''.
* In 2011 the Department of Theatre and Performance at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] invited director [[Katie Mitchell]] and [[Leo Warner]] of [[59 Productions]] to conceive and produce a video installation exploring the nature of 'truth in performance'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://59productions.co.uk/project/va_five_stages_of_truth|title=Five Truths - 59 Productions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking as its inspiration 5 of the most influential European theatre directors of the last century, the project examines how each of the practitioners would direct the actress playing [[Ophelia]] in the famous 'mad' scenes in [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Hamlet]]''. This multiscreen video installation, launched at the Chantiers Europe festival at the Theatre de la Ville in Paris on 4 June, and opened at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]] on 12 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801152028/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/f/five-truths|title=Five Truths - Victoria and Albert Museum|archivedate=1 August 2011|publisher=|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/f/five-truths}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In film and television ===

* In the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Tales from the Public Domain]]", the story of Hamlet is retold using Simpsons characters. The role of Ophelia is taken by Lisa who, upon seeing Hamlet (Bart) talking to a picture of his deceased father (Homer), claims "Nobody out-crazies Ophelia!" She then backs up her claim by jumping on a table, stepping in people's food and kicking over flowers before finally cartwheeling out a nearby window and into the moat, presumably to her death.
* In the opening montage of the 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'', [[Kirsten Dunst]]'s character is shown in her wedding dress, floating face up in a stream, reproducing the familiar image of the drowned Ophelia.
* In the 2005 film ''[[The Libertine (2004 film)|The Libertine]]'', [[Samantha Morton]] portrays aspirant actress Elizabeth Barry, who portrays Ophelia, and brings the house down.
* In ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', [[Morticia Addams|Morticia]]'s sister is named Ophelia: both sisters are played by [[Carolyn Jones]]. Ophelia is depicted with flowers in her hair, and often carrying flowers.
* In the second episode of the six-part television series ''[[Desperate Romantics]]'', Amy Manson poses as Ophelia. In the episode, she is acting as Elizabeth Sidal, who was a model for one of the brotherhood's founding members John Everett Millais.
* In the 1986 film ''[[Fire with Fire (1986 film)|Fire with Fire]]'', [[Virginia Madsen]] plays a Catholic schoolgirl enthralled with John Everett Millais' depiction of Ophelia which she saw in school.

'''Royal Persian Paintings: The Qajar Epoch 1783-1925''' was the first major exhibition of [[Persian art]] in [[Qajar]] era&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Royal Persian Paintings, The Qajar Epoch, 1785-1925|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/1206|website=Brooklyn|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took place from October 1998 to June 1999 at [[Brooklyn Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]]. The curator of the exhibition was [[Layla S.

'''Sacred dance''' is the use of [[dance]] in religious ceremonies and rituals, present in most religions throughout history and prehistory. Its connection with the body and fertility has caused it to be forbidden by some religions; for example, its acceptability in Christianity has varied widely. Dance has formed a major element of worship in Hindu temples with strictly formalized styles such as [[bharatanatyam]], requiring skilled dancers and temple musicians. In the 20th century, sacred dance has been revived by choreographers such as Bernhard Wosien as a means of developing community spirit.&lt;ref name="Gaston Gaston 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gaston | first=Anne-Marie (Anjali) | last2=Gaston | first2=Tony | title=Oxford Handbooks Online | chapter=Dance as a Way of Being Religious | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=1 February 2014 | doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195176674.013.010 | editor=Brown, Frank Burch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==

[[W. O. E. Oesterley]] proposed in 1923 that sacred dance had several purposes, the most important being to honour the supernatural powers; the other purposes were to "show off" before the powers; to unite the dancer with the supernatural power (such as with the [[ancient Greece|Greek]]&lt;ref name="Lawler 1947"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawler |first1=Lillian Brady |title=The Dance in Ancient Greece |journal=The Classical Journal |date=March 1947 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=343–349 |jstor=291645}}&lt;/ref&gt; goddesses [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]]); making the body suitable as a temporary dwelling-place for the deity, by dancing to unconsciousness in [[ecstatic dance]]; making crops grow, or helping or encouraging the deity to make them grow (as with "Ariadne's Dance"); consecrating a victim for sacrifice (as with the [[Israelites]] circling the altar, or the [[Sarawak]] Kayans circling a sacrificial pig); paying homage to the deity present for an initiation ceremony; helping warriors to victory in battle, and appeasing the spirits of the enemy killed in battle; averting the dangers associated with marriage, at a wedding ceremony; and at a funeral or mourning ceremony, purposes such as driving away the malevolent ghost of the dead person, or preventing the ghost from leaving the grave, or frightening off any evil spirits attracted by the corpse, or temporarily and invisibly bringing the dead person back to join in the dance, or simply honouring the dead person.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=22–30 and passim&lt;!--He structures rest of book around this set of purposes.--&gt;}}

Harriet Lihs in 2009 divided religious [[dance]] into dances of imitation, such as of animals thought to be [[Spirit guide|spirit messenger]]s, or of battles; "medicine dances", i.e. dances of healing, like the serpent dances in India used to prevent disease; commemorative dances, for events such as the [[winter solstice]]; and dances for spiritual connection, as in the whirling dance of the [[Whirling Dervish]]es withn Sufism.{{sfn|Lihs|2009|pp=6–7}} 

Laura Shannon in 2018 stated the purposes of contemporary sacred dance as practised at the [[Findhorn Foundation]] as "to be inclusive, mutually supportive, to connect with the earth, spirit and each other, and to become more whole." It was a means of channelling "healing energy" both for the dancers and for their families and communities, indeed for the whole world.&lt;ref name="Shannon 2018"/&gt;

Within religion, [[ecstatic dance]] is one of the ways in which [[religious ecstasy]] is produced.&lt;ref name="Ulland 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ulland | first=Dagfinn | title=Embodied Spirituality | journal=Archive for the Psychology of Religion | volume=34 | issue=1 | date=1 January 2012 | doi=10.1163/157361212x645340 | pages=83–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ancient times==
{{further|Ceremonial dance}}

Indigenous [[ceremonial dance]] rituals around the world appear to preserve forms that were widespread in ancient times. For example, processionals and circle dances seen in indigenous dance today were [[Dance in ancient Egypt|used in ancient Egypt]] and among the Hebrews.{{sfn|Lihs|2009|pp=7–8}} In ancient Egypt, dancers impersonated a deity such as the goddess [[Hathor]], taking on the deity's attributes and interpreting the divine world for those watching.&lt;ref name="Mark 2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mark |first1=Joshua J. |title=Music &amp; Dance in Ancient Egypt |url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/1075/music--dance-in-ancient-egypt/ |publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ancient Israel, [[King David]] danced "before the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;2 [[Samuel (bible)|Samuel]] 6:5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark 2017"/&gt; It is mentioned as something familiar, implying it was a common practice.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|p=37}} Sacred dance is described in the Bible by verbs meaning dancing, rotating, jumping, skipping, and whirling.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=44–53}} The dance was accompanied by hand-drums (tambourines), cymbals, flutes, pipes, lyres, harps, and lutes.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=52}}

The [[Hittites]] are shown in a sacred processional dance in a c. 1200 BC rock inscription at the sanctuary of [[Yazılıkaya]], near their city of [[Hattusa]], in [[Cappadocia]]. A group of men wearing conical hats and tip-tilted shoes, and a group of women, dance in a running step towards a group of named gods and goddesses.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|p=59}} 

In ancient Greece, sacred dance was widespread; indeed, it formed a part of almost all worship, and the gods [[Apollo]], [[Ares]], [[Dionysus]] and [[Pan (god)|Pan]] are all described as dancers, while other deities such as [[Artemis]] were described as dancing with their companions.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=64, 68}} 

The Hawaiian [[Hula]] dances to [[Pele (deity)|Pele]], the volcano goddess, survive, whereas European [[maypole dance]]s have lost their meaning as tree-worship and survive only as folk tradition.{{sfn|Lihs|2009|pp=7–8}} 

Lewis Farnell observed that sacred dance has an "extraordinary uniformity" among indigenous peoples all over the world, something that he found so striking that it suggested either "belief in an ultimately identical tradition, or, perhaps more reasonably, the psychologic theory that ... [humans] at the same stage of development respond with the same ... religious act to the same stimuli" from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farnell |first1=Lewis Richard |authorlink1=Lewis Richard Farnell |title=The Evolution of Religion {{!}} An Anthropological Study |date=2009 |origyear=2005 |publisher=Cornell University Library |isbn=978-1112156984 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oesterley suggested that these stimuli to sacred dance were people's response to supernatural power, and "the obtaining of food."{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=2–3}}

===Christianity===

Some Christian traditions make use of [[Liturgical dance|liturgical]] or [[worship dance]], but it has long been controversial within the church.&lt;ref name="Mark 2017"/&gt; It has been supported, sometimes fervently, by both priests and Christian scholars; and opposed, sometimes stridently, by others who for example wrote some 157 tracts against dance between 1685 and 1963. The early church was largely in favour of dance, as in the 2nd Century ''[[Acts of John]]'' which states that "Grace danceth. I would pipe: dance ye all. The whole world on high hath part in our dancing."{{sfn|Lihs|2009|pp=14–16}} [[Circle dance]] is used, in its more meditative form, in worship within religious traditions including the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;"We ended with a circle dance." "A short session of circle dance was one of the activities on offer..."{{cite web |url=http://www.st-james-piccadilly.org/sermons/SJPAnnualRpt2006-2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214192607/http://www.st-james-piccadilly.org/sermons/SJPAnnualRpt2006-2007.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...we were able to testify our love to the lord using circle dance and hymn singing."[http://www.new-church-lifeline.org.uk/archive/year2001/may2001.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shiloah 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shiloah |first=Amnon |title=Music in the World of Islam: A Socio-Cultural Study |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6gwlvp61s4C&amp;pg=PA143 |year=2001 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=0-8143-2970-5 |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern Greece and southern Bulgaria, in the annual celebrations for [[Constantine the Great|Saint Constantine]] and [[Helena (Empress)|Saint Helen]], dancers perform the [[Anastenaria]], a [[fire-walking]] ritual, as the climax of three days of processions, music, dancing, and animal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Xygalatas, Dimitris |title=Firewalking and the Brain: The Physiology of High-Arousal Rituals |editor=Joseph Bulbulia, Richard Sosis, Erica Harris, Russell Genet, Cheryl Genet, and Karen Wyman |work=Evolution of Religion: Studies, Theories, and Critiques |publisher=Collins Foundation Press |date=2007 |pages=189-195 |url=http://www.academia.edu/577136/Fire-walking_and_the_Brain_The_Physiology_of_High-Arousal_Rituals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Xygalatas, Dimitris |date=2011 |title=Ethnography, Historiography, and the Making of History in the Tradition of the Anastenaria |journal=History and Anthropology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=57-74 |doi=10.1080/02757206.2011.546855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Danforth, Loring M. |title=Firewalking and Religious Healing: The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1989 |isbn=978-0691028538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and Sufism===

Dance is unusual within Islam, but circle dance is used in the Islamic [[Haḍra]] dances.&lt;ref name="Shiloah 2001"/&gt; In the tradition of the [[Mevlevi Order]] founded by [[Rumi]], ecstatic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erzen |first1=Jale |title=The Dervishes Dance -- The Sacred Ritual of Love |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.7523862.0006.007 |journal=Contemporary Aesthetics |volume=6 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufi whirling]] is practised by devotees as a form of active meditation within the [[Sema|Sama]] (worship ceremony).&lt;ref name="MOA sema"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm |title=The Sema of the Mevlevi |publisher=Mevlevi Order of America |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121221021339/http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm |archivedate=21 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Sufi practices including ecstatic dance and the reciting of religious poetry were a focus for political resistance in Iran, reportedly "demoniz[ed]" by [[Shi'a]] clerics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scolieri |first1=Paul |title=Introduction  Global/Mobile:  Re-orienting Dance and Migration Studies |journal=Dance Research Journal |date=2008 |volume=40 |issue=2 (Winter) |page=XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syncretic===

The syncretic [[Afro-American religion|Afro-American religious tradition]] [[Candomblé]], practiced mainly in [[Brazil]], makes use of music and ecstatic dance in which worshippers become possessed by their own tutelary deities, [[Orisha]]s.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/candomble/ataglance/glance.shtml "Religions - Candomblé: Candomblé at glance"].

==Modern==

Choreographers starting with [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Ruth St. Denis]] and her husband [[Ted Shawn]], and [[Martha Graham]] developed [[contemporary dance]] early in the 20th century, often using elements of sacred dance and fusing them with other genres. Later choreographers also made use of themes from the bible.&lt;ref name=SDG&gt;{{cite web |title=About Sacred Dance |url=http://sacreddanceguild.org/about/about-sacred-dance/ |publisher=Sacred Dance Guild |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clemente 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Clemente | first=Karen | title=The Sacred or the Profane: The Challenge of Modern Dance in Religious Educational Settings | journal=Journal of Dance Education | volume=8 | issue=2 | year=2008 | doi=10.1080/15290824.2008.10387360 | pages=62–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mysticism|mystic]] and spiritual teacher [[George Gurdjieff]] collected or authored a series of sacred dances, known as [[Gurdjieff movements]], and taught them to his students as part of what he considered the work of ''self observation'' and ''self study''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction |url=http://gurdjieff-dances.com/eng/ |publisher=Gurdjieff Dances |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dances of Universal Peace]], created by North American Sufis, use dancing, Sufi whirling, and singing of sacred phrases from different religions to raise consciousness and promote peace between diverse religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About The Dances of Universal Peace |url=https://www.dancesofuniversalpeace.org/about.shtm |publisher=Dances of Universal Peace |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lihs|2009|p=17}}

From 1976, the ballet master and choreographer {{ill|Bernhard Wosien|de}} introduced [[circle dance]] at the [[Findhorn Foundation]] in Scotland. He used both traditional dances and his own choreography to develop "group awareness".{{sfn|Watts|2006|pp=6–10}} Wosien's approach was taken up by Anna Barton, both at Findhorn and across Europe in the 1980s, and this style of sacred dance spread around the world.&lt;ref name="Shannon 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shannon |first1=Laura |title=Sacred Dance, Armenian Dance |url=https://www.findhorn.org/blog/sacred-dance-in-findhorn/ |publisher=[[Findhorn Foundation]] |accessdate=3 November 2018 |date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

The '''Semperoper''' is the [[opera house]] of the '''Sächsische Staatsoper Dresden''' (Saxon State Opera) and the [[concert hall]] of the [[Staatskapelle Dresden]] (Saxon State Orchestra). It is also home to the Semperoper Ballett. The building is located near the [[Elbe]] River in the historic centre of [[Dresden]], Germany.

The opera house was originally built by the architect [[Gottfried Semper]] in 1841. After a devastating fire in 1869, the opera house was rebuilt, partly again by Semper, and completed in 1878. The opera house has a long history of premieres, including major works by [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]].

==History==
[[File:Erstes Opernhaus Sempers ca1850 1860.jpg|thumb|left|The first opera house around 1850]]

The first opera house at the location of today's Semperoper was built by the architect [[Gottfried Semper]]. It opened on 13 April 1841 with an opera&lt;!-- Der Freischütz? --&gt; by [[Carl Maria von Weber]]. The building style itself is debated among many, as it has features that appear in three styles: early [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]], with [[Corinthian style]] pillars typical of Greek [[Neoclassical architecture|classical revival]]. Perhaps the most suitable label for this style would be [[eclecticism]], where influences from many styles are used, a practice most common during this period.&lt;ref name="Loeffler" &gt;Fritz Löffler: ''Das alte Dresden – Geschichte seiner Bauten''. 16th ed. Leipzig: Seemann, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-86502-000-0}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the opera building, Semper's first, was regarded as one of the most beautiful European opera houses.

[[File:Dresden Hoftheater J C A Richter.jpg|thumb|Interior of the first opera house in 1841]]
[[File:Dresda Semperoper.jpg|thumb|upright|Semperoper with the Theatre Square]]
Following a devastating fire in 1869, the citizens of Dresden immediately set about rebuilding their opera house. They demanded that Gottfried Semper do the reconstruction, even though he was then in exile because of his involvement in the [[May Uprising in Dresden|May 1849 uprising in Dresden]]. The architect had his son, Manfred Semper, build the second opera house using his plans. Completed in 1878, it was built in [[Neo-Renaissance]] style. During the construction period, performances were held at the ''Gewerbehaussaal'', which opened in 1870.&lt;ref name="Loeffler" /&gt;

The building is considered to be a prime example of "Dresden [[Neo-baroque|Baroque]]" [[architecture]]. It is situated on the Theatre Square in central Dresden on the bank of the Elbe River. On top of the portal there is a Panther [[quadriga]] with a statue of [[Dionysos]]. The interior was created by architects of the time, such as [[Johannes Schilling]]. Monuments on the portal depict artists, such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Sophocles]], [[Molière]] and [[Euripides]]. The building also features work by [[Ernst Rietschel]] and [[Ernst Julius Hähnel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Dresden Semperoper | url=http://mostlyopera.blogspot.com/2008/10/dresden-semperoper.html| publisher=Mostly Opera | date= | accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-war years, the Semperoper premiered many of the works of [[Richard Strauss]].

In 1945, during the last months of World War II, the building was largely destroyed again, this time by the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] and subsequent [[firestorm]], leaving only the exterior shell standing. Exactly 40 years later, on 13 February 1985, the opera's reconstruction was completed. It was rebuilt to be almost identical to its appearance before the war, but with the benefit of new stage machinery and an accompanying modern rear service building .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Dresden Sights and Views – Semper Opera House – | url=http://www.sights-and-culture.com/Germany/dresden-semper-opera.html| publisher=sights-and-culture.com | date= | accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Semperoper reopened with the opera that was performed just before the building's destruction in 1945, Carl Maria von Weber's ''[[Der Freischütz]]''. When the Elbe flooded in 2002, the building suffered heavy water damage. With substantial help from around the world, it reopened in December of that year.

==Present-day administration and operations==
[[File:Opernsaal der Semperoper in Dresden.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Interior of the Semperoper today]]
Today, the orchestra for most operas is the [[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]]. The [[Generalmusikdirektor]] (GMD) of the Semperoper is normally a different person from that of the Staatskapelle when it presents concerts. Exceptions have been [[Karl Böhm]], [[Hans Vonk (conductor)|Hans Vonk]], and [[Fabio Luisi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/arts/music/05fabio.html|title=Saxon State Opera's Music Director Quits|work=The New York Times|author=Daniel J. Wakin|date=4 February 2010|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have held both positions. Whilst the Semperoper does not have a GMD as of 2015, the current chief conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden is [[Christian Thielemann]], as of the 2012/13 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.staatskapelle-dresden.de/staatskapelle/christian-thielemann|title=Christian Thielemann Chefdirigent ab 2012|publisher=[[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]]|date=9 October 2009|accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current ''Intendant'' (General Manager) of the company is Wolfgang Rothe.

[[File:Voer_Kirke_(Rougsø)_Vest.JPG|thumb|Stilt tower with three arches of Voer Kirke, [[Norddjurs Kommune|Northern Djursland]], [[Denmark|DK]]]]
The '''Stilt tower''', in Danish "styltetårn", is a special type of Medieval church tower, concentrated in [[Djursland]] peninsula and neighbouring regions of [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Jutland]].

In this type, only the upper storey with the bells has four walls. The lower parts of such a tower are formed by one or three high arches. With one arch, the lower part of the tower, which is connected to the western gable of the [[nave (architecture)|nave]], is only open to the west. With three arches, the lower part is a high open hall.

Very few ''stilt towers'' were built after Gothic age, if 20th century constructions with a box for the bells on high pilars are kept out of regard. And very few stilt towers were built in the Middle Ages in distant regions, where the term is unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9431">'''Technology transfer''', also called '''transfer of technology''' ('''TOT'''), is the process of transferring (disseminating) [[technology]] from the places and [[ingroups and outgroups|ingroups]] of its origination to wider distribution among more people and places. It occurs along various axes: among [[universities]], from universities to businesses, from large businesses to smaller ones, from [[government]]s to businesses, across [[border]]s, both formally and informally, and both openly and surreptitiously. Often it occurs by concerted effort to share skills, knowledge, technologies, methods of manufacturing, samples of manufacturing, and facilities among [[government]]s or [[University|universities]] and other institutions to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can then further develop and exploit the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials, or services. It is closely related to (and may arguably be considered a subset of) [[knowledge transfer]]. Horizontal transfer is the movement of technologies from one area to another. At present{{when|date=July 2014}} transfer of technology (TOT) is primarily horizontal. Vertical transfer occurs when technologies are moved from applied research centers to research and development departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grosse|first=Robert|title=international Technology Transfer in Services|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=1996|volume=27|page=782|jstor=155512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology transfer is promoted at conferences organized by such groups as the [[Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation]] and the Association of University Technology Managers, and at "challenge" competitions by organizations such as the [[Center for Advancing Innovation]] in Maryland. Local venture capital organizations such as the Mid-Atlantic Venture Association (MAVA) also sponsor conferences at which  investors assess the potential for commercialization of technology.

[[Technology brokering|Technology brokers]] are people who discovered how to bridge the emergent worlds and apply scientific concepts or processes to new situations or circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Hargadon, Andrew. [http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3613.html ''Harvard Business School Working Knowledge for Business Leaders''], August 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  A related term, used almost synonymously, is "technology [[valorisation]]". While conceptually the practice has been utilized for many years (in ancient times, [[Archimedes]] was notable for applying science to practical problems), the present-day volume of research, combined with high-profile failures at [[Xerox PARC]] and elsewhere{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, has led to a focus on the process itself.

Whereas technology transfer can involve the dissemination of [[high tech|highly complex technology]] from capital-intensive origins to low-capital recipients (and can involve aspects of dependency and fragility of systems), it also can involve [[appropriate technology]], not necessarily high-tech or expensive, that is better disseminated, yielding [[robustness]] and [[autonomy|independence]] of systems.

==Transfer process==
Many companies, universities and governmental organizations now have an Office of Technology Transfer (TTO, also known as "Tech Transfer" or "TechXfer") dedicated to identifying research which has potential commercial interest and strategies for how to exploit it.  For instance, a research result may be of scientific and commercial interest, but [[patent]]s are normally only issued for practical processes, and so someone—not necessarily the researchers—must come up with a specific practical process.&lt;ref&gt;Miron-Shatz, T., Shatz, I., Becker, S., Patel, J., &amp; Eysenbach, G. (2014). [http://itamarshatz.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Promoting-Business-and-Entrepreneurial-Awareness-in-Health-Care-Professionals.pdf "Promoting business and entrepreneurial awareness in health care professionals: lessons from venture capital panels at medicine 2.0 conferences"]. Journal of Medical Internet Research, 16(8), e184.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another consideration is commercial value; for example, while there are many ways to accomplish [[nuclear fusion]], the ones of commercial value are those that generate more energy than they require to operate.

The process to commercially exploit research varies widely.  It can involve licensing agreements or setting up joint ventures and partnerships to share both the risks and rewards of bringing new technologies to market.  Other corporate vehicles, e.g. spin-outs, are used where the host organization does not have the necessary will, resources or skills to develop a new technology.  Often these approaches are associated with raising of [[venture capital]] (VC) as a means of funding the development process, a practice more common in the [[United States]] than in the [[European Union]], which has a more conservative approach to VC funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/invest-in-research/monitoring/statistical01_en.htm EU Report on EU/global comparisons in the commercialisation of new technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Research spin-off]] companies are a popular vehicle of commercialisation in [[Canada]], where the rate of licensing of Canadian university research remains far below that of the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/eng/h_00011.html State of The Nation 2008 - Canada's Science, Technology and Innovation System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology transfer offices may work on behalf of research institutions, governments and even large multinationals.  Where start-ups and spin-outs are the clients, commercial fees are sometimes waived in lieu of an equity stake in the business.  As a result of the potential complexity of the technology transfer process, technology transfer organizations are often multidisciplinary, including economists, engineers, lawyers, marketers and scientists. The dynamics of the technology transfer process has attracted attention in its own right, and there are several dedicated societies and journals.

There has been a marked increase in technology transfer intermediaries specialized in their field since 1980, stimulated in large part by the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] and equivalent legislation in other countries, which provided additional incentives for research exploitation.

== Drawbacks ==

Despite incentives to move research into production, the practical aspects are sometimes difficult to perform in practice.  Using DoD Technology Readiness Levels as a criterion (for example), research tends to focus on TRL (technology readiness level) 1–3 while readiness for production tends to focus on TRL 6–7 or higher.  Bridging TRL-3 to TRL-6 has proven to be difficult in some organizations.  Attempting to rush research (prototypes) into production (fully tested under diverse conditions, reliable, maintainable, etc.) tends to be more costly and time-consuming than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08467sp.pdf|title= Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ambassadors''''' (1533) is a painting by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. Also known as ''[[Jean de Dinteville]] and [[Georges de Selve]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors |title=Hans Holbein the Younger The Ambassadors NG1314 National Gallery, London |website=www.nationalgallery.org.uk |access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was created in the [[Tudor period]], in the same year [[Elizabeth I]] was born. As well as being a double [[portrait]], the painting contains a [[still life]] of several meticulously rendered objects, the meaning of which is the cause of much debate. It also incorporates a much-cited example of [[anamorphosis]] in painting. It is part of the collection at the [[National Gallery]] in London.

==Description==
Although a [[Germany|German]]-born artist who spent most of his time in England, Holbein displayed the influence of [[Early Netherlandish painter]]s in this work. This influence can be noted most outwardly in the use of [[oil paint]], the use of which for [[panel painting]]s had been developed a century before in  Early Netherlandish painting. What is most "Flemish" of Holbein's use of [[oil painting|oils]] is his use of the medium to render meticulous details that are mainly symbolic: as [[Jan van Eyck]] and the [[Master of Flémalle]] used extensive imagery to link their subjects to divinity, Holbein used symbols to link his figures to show  the same things on the table.
[[File:Holbein carpet with large medallions 16th century Central Anatolia.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Holbein carpet]] with large medallions, of a type similar to that of the painting, 16th century, Central [[Anatolia]]]]

Among the clues to the figures' explorative associations are a selection of scientific instruments including two globes (one [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]] and one [[Celestial sphere|celestial]]), a [[shepherd's dial]], a [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], a [[torquetum]], and a [[sundial|polyhedral sundial]],&lt;ref name="instrument_ref"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dekker|Lippincott|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various textiles including the floor mosaic, based on a design from Westminster Abbey (the [[Cosmati]] pavement, before the High Altar), and the carpet on the upper shelf, which is most notably oriental, an example of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]]. The choice for the inclusion of the two figures can furthermore be seen as symbolic. The figure on the left is in secular attire while the figure on the right is dressed in clerical clothes. Their flanking of the table, which displays open books, symbols of religious knowledge and even a symbolic link to the [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus|Virgin]].
[[File:Map ambassadors.jpg|thumb|The Ambassador's globe (detail)]]

In contrast, other scholars have suggested the painting contains overtones of religious strife. The conflicts between secular and religious authorities are here represented by [[Jean de Dinteville]], a landowner, and [[Georges de Selve]], the Bishop of [[Lavaur, Tarn|Lavaur]]. The commonly accepted symbol of discord, a lute with a broken string, is included next to a hymnbook in [[Martin Luther| Martin Luther's]] translation, suggesting strife between scholars and the clergy.&lt;ref name="Mamiya, 675"&gt;Mamiya, 675&lt;/ref&gt;

The terrestrial globe on the lower shelf repeats a portion of a cartographically imaginative map created in possibly 1530 and of unknown origin.  The map is referred to as the Ambassadors' Globe due to its popularly known appearance in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The work has been described as "one of the most staggeringly impressive portraits in Renaissance art."&lt;ref&gt;Welton, J. in Farthing, S. ed, (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anamorphic skull===
[[File:Holbein Skull.jpg|thumb|The anamorphic skull as restored in 1998]]
The most notable and famous of Holbein's symbols in the work, however, is the distorted [[human skull|skull]] which is placed in the bottom center of the composition. The skull, rendered in [[anamorphic projection|anamorphic perspective]], another invention of the Early [[Renaissance]], is meant to be a visual puzzle as the viewer must approach the painting from high on the right side, or low on the left side, to see the form as an accurate rendering of a human skull. While the skull is evidently intended as a ''[[vanitas]]'' or ''[[memento mori]]'', it is unclear why Holbein gave it such prominence in this painting. One possibility is that this painting represents three levels: the heavens (as portrayed by the [[astrolabe]] and other objects on the upper shelf), the living world (as evidenced by books and a musical instrument on the lower shelf), and death (signified by the skull). It has also been hypothesized that the painting is meant to hang in a stairwell, so that persons walking up the stairs and passing the painting on their left would be startled by the appearance of the skull. A further possibility is that Holbein simply wished to show off his ability with the technique in order to secure future commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-ana2.htm |title=Anamorphosis |publisher=World Wide Words |date=2011-11-26 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists often incorporated skulls as a reminder of mortality. Holbein may have intended the skulls (one as a gray slash and the other as a medallion on Jean de Dinteville's hat) and the [[crucifix]] in the upper left corner to encourage contemplation of one's impending death and the resurrection.&lt;ref name="Mamiya, 675"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
Before the publication of Mary F. S. Hervey's ''Holbein's Ambassadors: The Picture and the Men'' in 1900, the identity of the two figures in the picture had long been a subject of intense debate. In 1890, [[Sidney Colvin]] was the first to propose the figure on the left as [[Jean de Dinteville]], Seigneur of [[Polisy]] (1504–1555), French ambassador to the court of Henry VIII for most of 1533. Shortly afterwards, the cleaning of the picture revealed that his seat of Polisy is one of only four French places marked on the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, 139–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hervey identified the man on the right as [[Georges de Selve]] (1508/09–1541), [[Bishop of Lavaur]], after tracing the painting's history back to a seventeenth-century manuscript. According to art historian John Rowlands, de Selve is not wearing episcopal robes because he was not consecrated until 1534.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; De Selve is known from two of de Dinteville's letters to his brother [[François de Dinteville]], [[Bishop of Auxerre]], to have visited London in the spring of 1533. On 23 May, Jean de Dinteville wrote: "Monsieur de Lavaur did me the honour of coming to see me, which was no small pleasure to me. There is no need for the ''grand maître'' to hear anything of it". The ''grand maître'' in question was [[Anne de Montmorency]], the [[Marshal of France]], a reference that has led some analysts to conclude that de Selve's mission was a secret one; but there is no other evidence to corroborate the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Foister, Roy, &amp; Wyld, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, the ambassador wrote to his brother again, saying: "Monsieur de Lavaur came to see me, but has gone away again".&lt;ref&gt;Foister, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ambassadors Lutherian Psalms.jpg|thumb|Lutheran Psalmbook in ''The Ambassadors'']]

Hervey's identification of the sitters has remained the standard one, affirmed in extended studies of the painting by Foister, Roy, and Wyld (1997), Zwingenberger (1999), and North (2004), who concludes that "the general coherence of the evidence assembled by Hervey is very satisfying"; however, North also notes that, despite Hervey's research, "[R]ival speculation did not stop at once and is still not entirely dead".&lt;ref&gt;North, 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Giles Hudson, for example, has argued that the man on the right is not de Selve, but Jean's brother François, Bishop of Auxerre, a noted patron of the arts with a known interest in mathematical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;See Hudson, 201–205.&lt;/ref&gt; The identification finds support in the earliest manuscript in which the painting is mentioned, a 1589 inventory of the Chateau of Polisy, discovered by Riccardo Famiglietti. However, scholars have argued that this identification of 1589 was incorrect. John North, for example, remarks that "[T]his was a natural enough supposition to be made by a person with limited local knowledge, since the two brothers lived on the family estates together at the end of their lives, but it is almost certainly mistaken".&lt;ref&gt;North, 7; see also, Foister, Roy, &amp; Wyld, 102, ''n''1.&lt;/ref&gt; He points to a letter François de Dinteville wrote to Jean on 28 March 1533, in which he talks of an imminent meeting with the [[Pope]] and makes no mention of visiting London. Unlike the man on the right of the picture, François was older than Jean de Dinteville. The inscription on the man on the right's book is "AETAT/IS SV Æ 25" (his age is 25); that on de Dinteville's dagger is "AET. SV Æ/ 29" (he is 29).&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

North's book analyzes the painting and shows it to be representing [[Good Friday]] through various clues on the instruments.&lt;ref name=instrument_ref /&gt;

==References in popular culture==
In the fifth episode of ''[[Hunted (2012 TV series)|Hunted]]'', the painting is said to have been commissioned by British merchants who felt restricted by government. Their companies evolved into five multinationals concentrating their power and wealth as they undermine the public sector.

In the 2014 film ''[[Calvary (2014 film)|Calvary]]'', [[Dylan Moran]]'s character urinates on the painting.

This was the second of three [[published]] collections of fairy tales by popular children’s author, [[Mary de Morgan|Mary De Morgan]].

==Plot summary==
The [[fairy tale]] opens with a wealthy [[King]] and Queen who lived happily. The Queen was prideful and disdained the [[fairies]], and so when she had a baby girl named Joan, the vengeful fairies stole the young child's heart. Joan grew up to be the most beautiful girl in the land, but loved nobody. In the neighboring [[country]], there lived a Prince named Michael – the most gracious man of all. He came across a picture of Joan in an old [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]’s tower, but the wizard warned him to avoid Joan. Regardless of the wizard's warning, Michael wished to marry Joan. Even though Prince Michael's love for Joan grew, he was curious and so disguised himself as a beggar in order to discover what was wrong with the [[Princess]]; he soon found she was cold-hearted and ruthless. He spoke to the Queen and learned about her missing heart. He told her he would retrieve Joan's heart, and if he failed to return in seven years, Joan could marry someone else. The wizard learned of these plans and gave Michael a special piece of glass. If he followed the blood-red star through the glass, he would be led to Joan’s heart.

Michael traveled for ages, across land and water. His boat eventually drifted to a land which housed a castle he could not enter. Beside the castle there was an old man and a snake. The old man offered to show Michael the way into the castle, if Michael consented to be his slave until the snake hatched its eggs; Michael agreed. Years and years passed and Michael became angry because the eggs never hatched. He attempted to destroy the eggs but was not successful. As he cried, his tears fell upon them and the shells cracked open. Michael found his way into the [[castle]], and vowed to accept nothing else but the heart of his beloved. A fairy of many disguises encouraged Michael to eat enchanted food, but he was never fooled, since he could see who she really was through his piece of glass. Finally, the fairy gave him the heart of Joan along with some magical words to repeat when seeing her. When Michael returned he was mistakenly imprisoned, but as soon as he saw the Princess through the bars of his cell, he repeated the words, and the heart in his hand fluttered into Joan’s chest. She immediately recognized Michael, insisted they get married, and kissed him in front of all to see. They were wed and the people were happy. “For now we are sure of a good King,” the people said. “See, he has already shown what he can do. Surely no one else could ever have found the heart of Princess Joan.” &lt;ref&gt;De Morgan, Mary. “The Heart of Princess Joan.” ''The Necklace of Princess Fiorimonde and Other Stories.'' Edinburgh: R.&amp;R. Clark, 1880. 79-130. David Edwards and Josephine Paolucci, Comp.

==Themes==
Although De Morgan’s stories, including “The Heart of Princess Joan,” have a folk-like feel, they are original and recorded in a style similar to that of [[Hans Christian Andersen]].&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Humphrey and Mari Prichard. ''The Oxford Companion to Children’s Literature.''Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, James. “The Golden Harp: Mary De Morgan’s Centrality in Victorian Fairy-Tale Literature.” ''Children’s Literature'' 33 (2005): 224-236. ''Project Muse.'' Johns Hopkins University Press. 4 Feb. 2013. http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/childrens_literature/v033/33.1fowler.html. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;   This might be due to the fact that these stories were told to children before their final form was decided on and then published.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, James. “The Golden Harp: Mary De Morgan’s Centrality in Victorian Fairy-Tale Literature.” ''Children’s Literature'' 33 (2005): 224-236. ''Project Muse.'' Johns Hopkins University Press. 4 Feb. 2013. http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/childrens_literature/v033/33.1fowler.html. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cott, Jonathan, ed. “Mary De Morgan.” ''Beyond the Looking Glass: Novels, Stories &amp; Poetry from the Victorian Era.'' New York: Stonehill Publishing, 1973. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;   This story, in particular, draws on the themes of enduring love and personal sacrifice, which are manifested by the hero, Prince Michael; these are reoccurring themes in De Morgan’s stories.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, James. “The Golden Harp: Mary De Morgan’s Centrality in Victorian Fairy-Tale Literature.” ''Children’s Literature'' 33 (2005): 224-236. ''Project Muse.'' Johns Hopkins University Press. 4 Feb. 2013. http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/childrens_literature/v033/33.1fowler.html. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although De Morgan’s fairy tales usually comment on [[Victorian era|Victorian]] culture, of which she was a part, there is a lack of scholarly discussion about such parallels in “The Heart of Princess Joan.”&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, James. “The Golden Harp: Mary De Morgan’s Centrality in Victorian Fairy-Tale Literature.” ''Children’s Literature'' 33 (2005): 224-236. ''Project Muse.'' Johns Hopkins University Press. 4 Feb. 2013. http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/childrens_literature/v033/33.1fowler.html. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; De Morgan’s stories are also said to “question the value of wealth and power.”&lt;ref&gt;Lurie, Alison, ed. “Mary De Morgan.” 445. ''The Oxford Book of Modern Fairy Tales''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; This is clearly seen in “The Heart of Princess Joan” when Prince Michael is tempted by the sumptuous appearance of the Yellow Fairy’s castle, which in truth, turns out to be as hideous and grotesque as the fairy herself.&lt;ref&gt;De Morgan, Mary. “The Heart of Princess Joan.” ''The Necklace of Princess Fiorimonde and Other Stories.'' Edinburgh: R.&amp;R. Clark, 1880. David Edwards and Josephine Paolucci, Comp. ‘‘The Project Gutenberg.’’ 25 Feb. 2012., https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38976/38976-h/38976-h.htm#front.1 Feb 2013. 117-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq''''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/explore-the-collection/overview/rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn/objects#/SK-C-5,1 ''Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035544/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/explore-the-collection/overview/rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn/objects#/SK-C-5,1 |date=2014-11-29 }} at rijksmuseum.nl. The original Dutch: ''Schutters van wijk II onder leiding van kapitein Frans Banninck Cocq''&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''''The Shooting Company of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch''''', but commonly referred to as '''''The Night Watch''''' ({{lang-nl|De Nachtwacht}}), is a 1642 painting by [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]]. It is in the collection of the [[Amsterdam Museum]] but is prominently displayed in the [[Rijksmuseum]] as the best known painting in its collection. ''The Night Watch'' is one of the most famous [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s.

The painting is famous for three things: its colossal size ({{convert|363|x|437|cm|ft|abbr=on}}), the dramatic use of light and shadow ([[tenebrism]]) and the perception of motion in what would have traditionally been a static military group portrait.  The painting was completed in 1642, at the peak of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]]. It depicts the eponymous [[Schutterij|company]] moving out, led by Captain [[Frans Banning Cocq]] (dressed in black, with a red [[sash]]) and his lieutenant, [[Willem van Ruytenburch]] (dressed in yellow, with a white sash). With effective use of sunlight and shade, Rembrandt leads the eye to the three most important characters among the crowd: the two gentlemen in the centre (from whom the painting gets its original title), and the woman in the centre-left background carrying a chicken. Behind them, the company's colours are carried by the ensign, Jan Visscher Cornelissen.  The figures are almost life-size.

Rembrandt has displayed the traditional emblem of the arquebusiers in a natural way, with the woman in the background carrying the main symbols. She is a kind of mascot herself; the claws of a dead chicken on her belt represent the ''clauweniers'' ([[arquebusiers]]), the pistol behind the chicken represents clover and she is holding the militia's goblet. The man in front of her is wearing a helmet with an oak leaf, a traditional motif of the arquebusiers. The dead chicken is also meant to represent a defeated adversary. The colour yellow is often associated with victory.

==Alterations to original==
[[File:Nachtwacht-kopie-van-voor-1712.jpg|thumb|350px|18th century copy with indication of the areas cut down in 1715.]]

For much of its existence, the painting was coated with a dark varnish, which gave the incorrect impression that it depicted a night scene, leading to the name by which it is now commonly known. This varnish was removed only in the 1940s.

In 1715, upon its removal from the ''[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]'' to the Amsterdam Town Hall, the painting was trimmed on all four sides. This was done, presumably, to fit the painting between two columns and was a common practice before the 19th century. This alteration resulted in the loss of two characters on the left side of the painting, the top of the arch, the balustrade, and the edge of the step. This balustrade and step were key visual tools used by Rembrandt to give the painting a forward motion. A 17th-century copy of the painting by Gerrit Lundens at the [[National Gallery, London]] shows the original composition.&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/gerrit-lundens-after-rembrandt-the-company-of-captain-banning-cocq-the-nightwatch |title=The Company of Captain Banning Cocq ('The Nightwatch') |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission==
The painting was commissioned (around 1639) by Captain Banning Cocq and seventeen members of his ''Kloveniers'' ([[schutterij|civic militia guards]]).&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Meijer Jr “De Amsterdamsche Schutters-stukken in en buiten het nieuwe Rijksmuseum,” In: Oud Holland 2, no. 4 (1886): 198–21 Translated in English by Tom van der Molen [http://www.jhna.org/index.php/past-issues/volume-5-issue-1/190-the-amsterdam-civic-guard-2]&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen names appear on a shield, painted circa 1715, in the centre right background, as the hired drummer was added to the painting for free.&lt;ref name="identity"&gt;{{cite news| title=Rembrandt's Night Watch Unravelled: Identity of All the Militiamen Are Finally Revealed |url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=29632|work=ArtDaily |date= 14 March 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 34 characters appear in the painting. Rembrandt was paid 1,600 [[guilders]] for the painting (each person paid one hundred), a large sum at the time. This was one of a series of seven similar paintings of the militiamen ({{lang-nl|[[Schuttersstuk]]}}) commissioned during that time from various artists.

The painting was commissioned to hang in the banquet hall of the newly built ''Kloveniersdoelen'' (Musketeers' Meeting Hall) in Amsterdam. Some have suggested that the occasion for Rembrandt's commission and the series of other commissions given to other artists was the visit of the [[France|French]] queen, [[Marie de Medici]], in 1638. Even though she was escaping from her exile from France ordered by her son [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], the queen's arrival was met with great pageantry.

There is some academic discussion as to where Rembrandt actually executed the painting.  It is too large to have been completed in his studio in his house (modern address Jodenbreestraat 4, 1011 NK Amsterdam).  Scholars are divided.  In city records of the period he applied to build a "summer kitchen" on the back of his house.  The dimensions of this structure would have accommodated the painting over the three years it took him to paint it.  Another candidate is in an adjacent church and a third possibility is actually on site.&lt;ref&gt;Discussion with docent staff at the Rembrandt Huis Museum October 7th, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:August Jernberg - Treppenhuis - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Night Watch'' as it hung in the Trippenhuis in 1885, by [[August Jernberg]]]]
''The Night Watch'' first hung in the ''Groote Zaal'' (Great Hall) or Amsterdam's ''Kloveniersdoelen''. This structure currently houses the Doelen Hotel. In 1715, the painting was moved to the Amsterdam Town Hall, for which it was altered. When Napoleon occupied the Netherlands, the Town Hall became the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Palace on the Dam]] and the magistrates moved the painting to the ''[[Trippenhuis]]'' of the family Trip. Napoleon ordered it returned, but after the occupation ended in 1813, the painting again moved to the ''Trippenhuis'', which now housed the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Dutch Academy of Sciences]].  It remained there until it moved to the new ''Rijksmuseum'' when its building was finished in 1885.

[[File:Night watch rolled 1939.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''Night Watch'' rolled around a cylinder inside a crate. The canvas would be stored in this condition throughout World War II.]]
The painting was removed from the museum in September 1939, at the onset of [[World War II]].  The canvas was detached from its frame and rolled around a cylinder.  The rolled painting was stored for four years in a special safe that was built to protect many works of art in the underground caves of Maastricht, Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maastrichtunderground.nl/eng/for_groups/tours_for_groups|website=Maastricht Underground|title=De Kluis - national World War II treasure room|accessdate=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war, the canvas was re-mounted, restored, and returned to its rightful place in the Rijksmuseum.

On 11 December 2003, ''The Night Watch'' was moved to a temporary location, due to a major refurbishment of the Rijksmuseum. The painting was detached from its frame, wrapped in stain-free paper, put into a wooden frame which was put into two sleeves, driven on a cart to its new destination, hoisted, and brought into its new home through a special slit.

While the refurbishment took place, ''The Night Watch'' could be viewed in its temporary location in the ''Philipsvleugel'' of the Rijksmuseum. When the refurbishment was finished in April 2013, the painting was returned to its original place in the ''Nachtwachtzaal'' (''Room of the Night Watch'').

==Vandalism and restoration==
[[File:Beschadigde 'Nachtwacht' na restauratie geheel hersteld Weeknummer, 76-23 - Open Beelden - 43032.ogv|thumb|[[Newsreel]] of the [[Painting restoration|restoration]] in 1975]]

On 13 January 1911, a jobless shoemaker and former Navy chef slashed the painting with a shoemaker's knife protesting his inability to find work.&lt;ref&gt;"Rembrant's 'The Night Watch' slashed" The New York Times, 15 September 1975 p.41 https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/15/archives/rembrandts-the-night-watch-slashed-a-rembrandt-cut-by-knifewielder.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Art attack: Famous Works vandalised" BBC News, 08 October 2012. www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19869154&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 14 September 1975 the work was attacked with a bread knife by an unemployed school teacher, Wilhelmus de Rijk, resulting in several large zig-zagged slashes up to 12 inches long. With a history of mental illness he claimed he, "did it for the Lord" and that he, "was ordered to do it."&lt;ref&gt;"Rembrant's 'The Night Watch' slashed" The New York Times, 15 September 1975 p.41 https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/15/archives/rembrandts-the-night-watch-slashed-a-rembrandt-cut-by-knifewielder.html&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was successfully restored after four years, but some evidence of the damage is still visible up close. The man was never charged and he committed suicide in April 1976.

On 6 April 1990, an escaped psychiatric patient sprayed acid onto the painting with a concealed pump bottle.&lt;ref&gt;"Art attack: Famous Works vandalised" BBC News, 08 October 2012. www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19869154&lt;/ref&gt; Security guards intervened stopping the man and quickly sprayed water onto the canvas.

On 16 October 2018, the museum announced that from July 2019 it would begin a new multi-year restoration of the painting while it remained on public view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|first=Kate|last=Connolly|title=Watching paint dry: public get chance to see classic artwork restored|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/16/the-night-watch-rembrandt-painting-to-be-restored-under-worlds-gaze|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|issue=53542|page=31|date=2018-10-17|accessdate=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
* [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] refers to this work in his essay, "[[:fr:L’Œil et l’esprit|Eye and Mind]]". He writes that "[t]he spatiality of the captain lies at the meeting of two lines of sight that are incompossible with one another. Everyone with eyes has at some time or other witnessed this play of shadows, or something like it, and has been made by it to see a space and the things included therein."
* The work has inspired musical works in both the classical and rock traditions, including the second movement of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|7th Symphony]] and [[Ayreon]]'s "The Shooting Company of Captain Frans B. Cocq" from ''[[Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer]]''. In [[King Crimson]]'s song "The Night Watch", from the band's 1974 album ''[[Starless and Bible Black]]'', lyricist [[Richard Palmer-James]] muses on the painting to capture a key period in Dutch history, when, after a long period of "Spanish Wars", the merchants and other members of the bourgeoisie can turn their lives inward and focus on the tangible results of their lives’ efforts.  The song adopts a number of perspectives, including the primary subjects, the artist himself, and a modern viewer of the painting, and paints a mini-portrait of the emergence of the modern upper-middle class and the consumerist culture.  However, the song presents this portrait with a deft touch, and while not fully approving, is sympathetic in tone.
* [[Alexander Korda]]'s 1936 biographical film ''[[Rembrandt (1936 film)|Rembrandt]]'' depicts the painting, shown in error in its truncated form, as a failure at its completion, perceived as lampooning its outraged subjects.
* In [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s 1982 film, [[Passion (1982 film)|''Passion'']], ''The Night Watch'' is reenacted with live actors in an opening shot. Godard explicitly compares his film to Rembrandt's painting, describing them both as "full of holes and badly-filled spaces". He instructs the viewer not to focus on the overall composition, but to approach his film as one would a Rembrandt and "focus on the faces".
* ''The Night Watch'' is a major plot device in the [[eponymous]] 1995 film, ''[[Night Watch (1995 film)|Night Watch]]'', which focuses on the painting's theft.
* ''The Night Watch'' is parodied on the British cover of [[Terry Pratchett| Terry Pratchett's]] 2002 [[Night Watch (Discworld)|book]] by the same name.  The cover illustrator, [[Paul Kidby]], pays tribute to his predecessor [[Josh Kirby]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeggs.com/items/38306.html Night Watch (Terry Pratchett) Easter Egg – Night Watch Cover]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A912593 BBC – h2g2 – Paul Kidby – Discworld Illustrator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/index.php/Book:Night_Watch Book: Night Watch – Discworld &amp; Terry Pratchett Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt; by placing him in the picture, in the position where Rembrandt is said to have painted himself. A copy of the original painting appears on the back cover of the book.
* ''The Night Watch'' is the subject of a 2007 film by director [[Peter Greenaway]] called ''[[Nightwatching]]'', in which the film posits a conspiracy within the musketeer regiment of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch, and suggests that Rembrandt may have immortalized a conspiracy theory using subtle allegory in his group portrait of the regiment, subverting what was to have been a highly prestigious commission for both painter and subject. His 2008 film ''[[Rembrandt's J'Accuse]]'' is a sequel or follow-on, and covers the same idea, using extremely detailed analysis of the compositional elements in the painting; in this Greenaway describes ''The Night Watch'' as (currently) the fourth most famous painting in the Western world, after the [[Mona Lisa]], the [[Last Supper]] and the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]].
* In 2006. ''The Night Watch'' inspired the literary work ''[[A Ronda da Noite]]'' by the famous Portuguese writer [[Agustina Bessa Luís]].
* The painting appears in episode 3 of season 2 of Netflix's ''Sense8''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/04/watch-the-trailer-for-netflixs-sense8-season-2.html|title=The Sense8 Season-Two Trailer Is an Action-Packed Lecture on Rembrandt|last=McHenry|first=Jackson|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New LED illumination==
On 26 October 2011, the Rijksmuseum unveiled new, sustainable [[LED lighting]] for ''The Night Watch''.  With new technology, it is the first time LED lighting has been able to render the fine nuances of the painting's complex color palette.

The new illumination uses LED lights with a [[color temperature]] of 3,200&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]], similar to warm-white light sources like [[Halogen lamp|tungsten halogen]]. It has a color rendering index of over 90, which makes it suitable for the illumination of artifacts such as ''The Night Watch''. Using the new LED lighting, the museum saves 80% on energy and offers the painting a safer environment because of the absence of UV radiation and heat.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Other representations==
[[File:Nachtwacht-in-3D.jpg|thumb|The sculptures of ''The Night Watch'' in 3D at the ''Rembrandtplein'' in [[Amsterdam]] in 2006–2009]]
* Russian artist Alexander Taratynov created a bronze-cast representation of the famous painting that was displayed in Amsterdam's [[Rembrandtplein]] from 2006 through 2009. After displays in other locations, the sculptures returned in 2012 and are now permanently installed in front of [[Louis Royer]]'s 1852 cast iron statue of Rembrandt.&lt;ref name="NW3d"&gt;{{cite web| title=About NW3D| url=http://www.nightwatch3d.com/information.htm| publisher=nightwatch3d.com| work=Niveau| date=Spring 2004| accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The only full-sized replica in the Western world is displayed by the [[Canajoharie Library &amp; Art Gallery]], in [[Canajoharie (village), New York|Canajoharie, New York]], donated to the library in the early 20th century by the library's founder, Bartlett Arkell.
* The Rijksmuseum's [[flashmob]] 'Our Heroes are Back' recreated ''The Night Watch'' in an unsuspecting shopping mall in [[Breda]], [[Netherlands]] – published on 1 April 2013 on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6W2ZMpsxhg YouTube]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Onze helden zijn terug!| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6W2ZMpsxhg| publisher=youtube.com| work=Rijksmuseum| date=1 Apr 2013| accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Nightwatch by Rembrandt is also replicated in Delft blue at Royal Delft in the Netherlands. This version consists of 480 tiles. Two painters of the manufacture worked simultaneously from the left and right end of the frame, and they met at the center to complete the grand piece. After finishing, both painters recognized that they had a more difficult job as they only  used black, to paint The Nightwatch. They used the traditional cobalt oxide color adding water to make the lighter shades. Once it was fired at 1200 degrees Celsius, the black material turns into blue. It seems that this version of the Nightwatch, was bought by an unknown buyer and then given to the museum on loan to display to the public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10226">'''''Auðunar þáttr vestfirska''''' ('''''The Tale of Auðun of the West Fjords''''') is a short tale (or [[þáttr]]) preserved in three distinct versions as part of the saga of [[Harald III of Norway]] (reigned 1047–66, a.k.a. Haraldr inn harðráði Sigurðsson), as the saga is told in the manuscripts [[Morkinskinna]], [[Flateyjarbók]], and several others. Widely translated and anthologised, it is admired for its beautifully simple account&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn Jones, in the introduction to his ''Eirik the Red and Other Icelandic Sagas'', Oxford, 1961, which includes it, calls it "so seeming-simple, . . . the best of all Icelandic ''þættir'' and one of the most flawless short stories ever written" (p. xv).&lt;/ref&gt; of a poor Icelander from the [[Westfjords]], the harshest region of the country, who decides to take a polar bear as a present to [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] (reigned 1047-74/76, a.k.a. Sveinn Úlfsson). Auðun sticks to his task despite having to pass through the court of Haraldr, who is continually at odds with Sweyn, and proceeds on a pilgrimage to Rome. Auðun's mixture of determination, audacity and humility leads him to gain the respect of both kings, and through him their respect for one another increases also.

Although ostensibly historical, the work is more plausibly to be seen as 'a historified folktale'.&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Ciklamini,  "''Exempla'' in an Old Norse Historiographic Mold", ''Neophilologus'', 81.1 (1997), 71-87, {{doi|10.1023/A:1004216615263}}, at p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Map of Auðun's Travels in Auðun's Tale.png|thumb|Map detailing Auðun's course of travel in Auðun's Tale, beginning and ending in Iceland.]]

Auðun of the Westfjords is a poor man working for his relative Þorstein. A Norwegian ship arrives and Auðun aids the captain Þórir with advice and sells goods for him. In return, Þórir grants Auðun passage, and Auðun makes financial arrangements to support his mother for three years. Auðun then travels to Greenland, where he meets a hunter named Eirik and buys a polar bear from him with the remainder of his money. The hunter warns Auðun about spending his entire fortune on the bear, but Auðun does not heed his warning.

Next Auðun travels to Norway and meets [[Harald III of Norway|King Haraldr]] at a feast. The king asks if Auðun will sell or give him the bear, and Auðun replies that he intends to give it as a gift to [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Sweyn of Denmark]], with whom King Haraldr happens to be at war. Haraldr chastises Auðun for wanting to give a gift to his enemy, but instead of harming Auðun, grants him passage.

By the time Auðun crosses into Denmark, he has run out of provisions for himself and his bear, and a king's steward named Aki offers him help on the condition that he receives ownership of half the bear in return. Auðun is forced to accept and the two men seek audience with the king. King Sweyn banishes Aki for interfering with Auðun's gift-giving, and invites Auðun to stay with him.

After some time, Auðun asks King Sweyn leave to go on [[pilgrimage]] to Rome. The king gives him money and other pilgrims to accompany him and asks him to return to him when he is done.

Auðun successfully completes his pilgrimage, but becomes ill during his return. He arrives back in Denmark, bald and almost completely unrecognizable. King Sweyn's retainers laugh at him, but the king responds by saying that he has provided for his soul more than they have. He gives Auðun new clothes and offers him to stay as his cupbearer. Auðun replies he cannot stay and must return to Iceland, since the three-year period he set money aside to provide for his mother is nearly up. Upon parting, the king gives him a ship, a bag full of silver, and an arm ring, saying that he should only give the ring to a high-ranking person if he needs to repay a debt.

After departing, Auðun travels back to Norway and relates his experiences with King Sweyn to King Haraldr, from his acceptance of the bear to funding his pilgrimage to Rome and hospitality. Auðun describes his gifts from King Sweyn, and with each item, King Haraldr says he would have done the same for Auðun, except the bag of silver. Auðun then comes to the ring, and gives it to King Haraldr, since he owes him for granting him passage to complete his journey. The king accepts the ring, and gives Auðun a sword and cloak before he departs.

Auðun returns to Iceland and has good fortune for the rest of his life there.

==Themes==

Auðun's Tale is driven largely by Auðun's luck. William Ian Miller explains the etymology of Auðun's name, tracing the elements back to vinr, meaning 'friend' and auð, meaning 'luck, good fortune, fate'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Audun and the Polar Bear: Luck, Law, and Largesse in a Medieval Tale of Risky Business|last = Miller|first = William, Ian|publisher = Brill|year = 2014|isbn = 9789004271937|location = Leiden; Boston|pages = 71–72|url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wimiller/audunmiller8.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150608090531/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wimiller/audunmiller8.pdf|archive-date = 2015-06-08|orig-year = 2008}} (Link to gratis copy, without index, from author's personal webpage.)&lt;/ref&gt; Miller further connects the root of auð to the vað in vaðmál, the woven cloth used as a type of currency in medieval Iceland, and to the spinning and weaving of fate by the [[Norns]]. Thus, Miller argues, Auðun is inherently lucky and the course of his story "exists in embryo in his name."&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:73&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller rejects scholars' two main theories of Auðun's motives for his behavior: that he is either a holy fool or acting solely out of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:85&lt;/ref&gt; According to Miller, Auðun's actions are too carefully thought-out for him to be naive, and interprets the purpose of Aki's character as a demonstration that Auðun is not acting out of pure self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:85&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Miller suggests that Auðun's actions are driven by a combination of self-interest tempered with sincere, noble intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:85-86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gift|Gift-giving]] and exchange are central to Auðun's Tale. Members of Old Norse society exchanged gifts with each other as a means for establishing and cementing social bonds. A gift normally carried with it an obligation to give a gift in return.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2008:30&lt;/ref&gt; Auðun's Tale explores the implications of gift exchange between social peers of similar standing, between lower and higher standing (such as Auðun and King Haraldr and King Sweyn), and between humans and God (Auðun going on pilgrimage to Rome). Edward G. Fichtner sees the story representing Auðun's coming of age "by his learning how to participate in the exchange of gifts in his culture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fichtner |first=Edward G. |date=Summer 1979 |title=Gift Exchange and Initiation in the "Auðunar þáttr vestfirzka" |journal=Scandinavian Studies |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=249–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Wheat Field''''' is a series of oil paintings executed by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]. All of them depict the view Van Gogh had from the window of his bedroom on the top floor of the asylum: a field enclosed by stone walls just beneath his window and excluded from normal life by the rear wall of the asylum grounds; beyond this enclosure farm land, accompanied by olive groves and vineyards, ran up to the hills at the foot of the mountain range called [[Alpilles|Les Alpilles]].

From May 1889 to May 1890, Van Gogh recorded this view in changing settings: after a storm, with a reaper in the field, with fresh wheat raising in autumn and with flowers in the spring. This is one of Van Gogh's major series from Saint-Rémy, comprising wonderful works such as the ''Wheat Field at Sunrise'' in the Kröller-Müller Museum.  Van Gogh included the ''Enclosed Field with Rising Sun'' (F737) made in December 1889 in his [[The Display at Les XX 1890|Display at Les XX 1890]] in Brussels.

Van Gogh worked on a group of paintings "The Wheat Field" that he could see from his cell at Saint-Paul Hospital.  From the studio room he could see a field of wheat, enclosed by a wall.  Beyond that were the mountains from Arles.  During his stay at the asylum he made about twelve paintings of the view of the enclosed wheat field and distant mountains.&lt;ref name="PMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/82820.html?mulR=32251%7c1 |title=Rain |year=2011 |work=Collections |publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May Van Gogh wrote to Theo, "Through the iron-barred window I see a square field of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective like Van Goyen, above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=104 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone wall, like a picture frame, helped to display the changing colors of the wheat field.&lt;ref name="Fell40"/&gt;

==Spring and summer, 1889==
The [[Kröller-Müller Museum]]'s ''Enclosed Wheat Field with Rising Sun'' was painted in May 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20106.596/Enclosed-wheat-field-with-rising-sun |title=Enclosed Wheat Field with Rising Sun  |year= |work=Collection |publisher=[[Kröller-Müller Museum]] |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh used the rising sun above fields of wheat to represent its life giving energy.&lt;ref name="Fell40"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Gardens | author=Fell, D | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location=United Kingdom | year=2001 | page=40 | isbn=0-7432-0233-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QssD77mFRkkC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Green Wheat Field'' was painted in June 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/179/Green-Wheat-Field.html |title=Green Wheat Field |year=2011 |work=Saint-Rémy |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh had a tender feeling about green wheat, likening it to that of a baby:  "Young wheat has something inexpressibly pure and tender about it, which awakens the same emotion as the expression of a sleeping baby."  Towards the end of his life he regarded his most delicate works, a young wheat field with the rising sun or a blooming orchard, as his "babies."&lt;ref name="Lubin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Stranger on the Earth: A Psychological Biography of Vincent van Gogh | author=Lubin, A | publisher=De Capo Press | location=United States | year=1996 | origyear=1972 | page=17 | isbn=0-306-80726-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHVwceHVI5cC&amp;pg=PR17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh describes ''Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Rémy,'' also made in June, as a view taken in the hills seen from his bedroom window: "In the foreground, a field of wheat ruined and hurled to the ground by a storm. A boundary wall and beyond the grey foliage of a few olive trees, some huts and the hills. Then at the top of the canvas a great white and grey cloud floating in the azure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/594.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, c. 9 June 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June Van Gogh painted ''Wheat Field with Reaper and Sun''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20101.173/Wheat-field-with-reaper-and-sun |title=Wheat Field with Reaper and Sun | year= | work=Collection |publisher=Kröller-Müller Museum | accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he described as "a wheat field, very yellow and very light, perhaps the lightest canvas I have done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/596.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 25 June 1889  | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July he painted Kröller-Müller Museum's ''Landscape with Wheat Sheaves and Rising Moon''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20107.656/Landscape-with-wheat-sheaves-and-rising-moon |title=Landscape with Wheat Sheaves and Rising Moon |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Kröller-Müller Museum |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he describes as "a moonrise over the same field as the sketch in Gauguin's letter, but in it some stacks take the place of the wheat.

''Enclosed Field with Ploughman'' was made in August 1889, which is held in a private collection (F625).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/108/Enclosed-Field-with-Ploughman.html |title=Enclosed Field with Ploughman |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two complementary fall paintings==

The ''Wheat Field with a Reaper'' was started in the summer before a bout of illness and completed in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/604.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 5 or 6 September 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here Van Gogh depicts a reaper in a sun-drenched wheat field. Referring to a Biblical metaphor, Van Gogh wrote of the meaning of this painting, "In this reaper – a vague figure laboring like the devil in the terrible heat to finish his task – I saw an image of death, in the sense that the wheat being reaped represented mankind... But there is nothing sad in this death, it takes place in broad daylight, under a sun that bathes everything in a fine, golden light."&lt;ref name="VGM WF with Reaper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2935&amp;lang=en |title=Wheat Field with Reaper |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enclosed Field with Peasant'' was painted over several days in October, working just outside the hospital. It accurately reflects the topography of the walled wheat field with the peaks of the Alpilles in the background.  Van Gogh's brushwork brings life to this picture of furrowed soil and craggy mountains.  At the center, a peasant carries a bundle of straw, a symbol of the cycles of life.  Van Gogh described this painting as a pendant to ''The Reaper'', which resides at the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]], both in vivid complementary colors of yellow and blue-violet.&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-saint-r%C3%A9my-enclosed-field-peasant-gogh-vincent-van |title=Landscape at Saint-Rémy (Enclosed Field with Peasant) |year=2010 |work=Collection |publisher= |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both he considers harsh studies, but instead of being almost entirely yellow like ''The Reaper'', the "picture is almost entirely violet. Broken violet and neutral tints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/610.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, c. 8 October 1889  | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall and winter, 1889==

In September Van Gogh worked on ''Wheat Field behind Saint-Paul Hospital with a Reaper.'' Intending to paint a pure sulfur yellow, he wrote to [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] that he had taken up the "devil of a question of yellow".  He explained to his brother Theo, "I see in this reaper – an undefined figure, struggling in the intense heat like the devil to finish his work – I see him as an image of death in the sense that the humans are the corn that is being cut down. So it is, if you will, the opposite of the sowing that I tried earlier. But this death is not sad, it takes place in bright light with a sun that covers everything with a light like pure gold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collection-online.museum-folkwang.de/eMuseumPlus?service=direct/1/ResultLightboxView/result.t1.collection_lightbox.$TspTitleImageLink.link&amp;sp=10&amp;sp=Scollection&amp;sp=SfieldValue&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=3&amp;sp=Slightbox_4x5&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=Sdetail&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=F&amp;sp=T&amp;sp=5 |title=Wheat Field behind Saint-Paul Hospital with a Reaper |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Museum Folkwang |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rain'' also called ''Enclosed Wheat Field in the Rain'' is unique to Van Gogh's work in the South. He represented falling rain by diagonal lines of paint.  The style is reminiscent of Japanese prints, but the effect is stylistically personal to Van Gogh.&lt;ref name="PMA"/&gt;

In December Van Gogh made ''Wheat Field with a Rising Sun,'' held in a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/109/Enclosed-Field-with-Rising-Sun.html |title=Enclosed Field with a Rising Sun |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work, started in late November, shows a sunrise above a field of young wheat in the complementary colors of yellow-green and purple.  Deep furrows run towards the enclosed wall behind which is a row of purple hills. The sun is surrounded by a large yellow halo.  Van Gogh sough to "express calmness, great peace."  Further, he expresses "without making direct reference to the actual [[Christ's Agony at Gethsemane|Gethsemane]]... and there is no need to portray figures from the [[Sermon on the Mount]] in order to express a comforting and gentle motif."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/B21.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Emile Bernard, Saint-Rémy, c. 20 November 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the six canvases he selected for the exhibit at Les Vingt [XX] in Brussels in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Vincent van Gogh: Between Earth and Heaven: The Landscapes  |author1=van Gogh, V |author2=Blotkamp, C |author-link2=Carel Blotkamp |author3=Zimmer, N | year=2009 | page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The ''Wheat Field with Cypresses'' paintings were made when Van Gogh was able to leave the asylum. Van Gogh had a fondness for cypresses and wheat fields of which he wrote: "Only I have no news to tell you, for the days are all the same, I have no ideas, except to think that a field of wheat or a cypress well worth the trouble of looking at closeup."&lt;ref name="Edwards102"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=102 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo of a work he began in June, ''[[Wheat Field with Cypresses]]'': "I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of [[Scotch plaid]]; the former painted with a thick impasto . . . and the wheat field in the sun, which represents the extreme heat, very thick too." Van Gogh who regarded this landscape as one of his "best" summer paintings made two additional oil paintings very similar in composition that fall.  One of the two is in a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/wheat_field_with_cypresses_vincent_van_gogh/objectview.aspx?collID=11&amp;OID=110000977 |title=Wheat Field with Cypresses |year=2000–2011 |work= |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[National Gallery]] ''A Wheat Field, with Cypresses'' painting was made in September&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-a-wheatfield-with-cypresses |title=A Wheat Field, with Cypresses |year= |work=Collection, Vincent van Gogh |publisher=National Gallery, London |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which author H.W. Janson describes: "the field is like a stormy sea; the trees spring flamelike from the ground; and the hills and clouds heave with the same surge of motion.  Every stroke stands out boldly in a long ribbon of strong, unmixed color."&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Basic History of Art | author=H. W. Janson | publisher=Harry N. Abrams | location=New York | year=1971 | chapter=The Modern World | page=308 | isbn=0-13-389296-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also another version of ''Wheat Fields with Cypresses'' made in September with a blue-green sky, reportedly held at the [[Tate Gallery]] in London (F743).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/748/Wheat-Field-with-Cypresses.html |title=Wheat Field with Cypresses |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other wheat field paintings===
Van Gogh describes the ripening ''Green Wheat Field with Cypresses'' painted in June: "a field of wheat turning yellow, surrounded by blackberry bushes and green shrubs. At the end of the field there is a little house with a tall somber cypress which stands out against the far-off hills with their violet-like and bluish tones, and against a sky the color of forget-me-nots with pink streaks, whose pure hues form a contrast with the scorched ears, which are already heavy, and have the warm tones of a bread crust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/W12.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Wilhelmina van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 16 June 1889 | editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits (funded in part by U.S. Department of Education, Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October van Gogh made ''Enclosed Wheat Field with Ploughman.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/enclosed-field-with-ploughman-35481 |title=Enclosed Wheat Field with Ploughman |year= |work=Collections |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wheat Fields in a Mountainous Landscape,'' also titled ''Meadow in the Mountains'' was painted in Late November - early December 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20100.443/Wheat-fields-in-a-mountainous-landscape |title=Wheat Fields in a Mountainous Landscape |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Kröller-Müller Museum |accessdate=March 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722231544/http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20100.443/Wheat-fields-in-a-mountainous-landscape |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trench art''' is any decorative item made by soldiers, prisoners of war, or civilians where the manufacture is directly linked to armed conflict or its consequences. It offers an insight not only to their feelings and emotions about the war, but also their surroundings and the materials they had available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armymuseum.co.nz/whats-on/world-war-one-centenary/personal-treasures-wwi-trench-art/|title=Personal Treasures: WWI Trench Art|website=New Zealand Army Museum|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not limited to the World Wars, the history of trench art spans conflicts from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] to the present day. Although the practice flourished during World War I, the term 'trench art' is also used to describe souvenirs manufactured by service personnel during World War II. Some items manufactured by soldiers, prisoners of war or civilians during earlier conflicts have been retrospectively described as trench art.

== Categorisation ==
There are four broad categories of trench art:

===Items made by soldiers===
{{multiple image
 | footer = Two [[chestnut]] leaves, engraved by a French soldier with the names of his children "Andrée" and "Eléonore" while waiting in the trenches.
 | image1 = "Andrée".jpg
 | image2 = "Eléonore".jpg
 }}
There is much evidence to prove that some trench art was made in the trenches, by soldiers, during war.

In ''With a Machine Gun to Cambrai'', [[George Coppard]] tells of pressing his uniform buttons into the clay floor of his trench, then pouring molten lead from shrapnel into the impressions to cast replicas of the regimental crest.{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Chalk carvings were also popular, with contemporary postcards showing carvings in the rocky outcrops of [[Dugout (military)|dug-outs]].{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Many smaller items such as rings and knives were made by soldiers either in front line or support trenches, especially in quieter parts of the line.{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Wounded soldiers were encouraged to work at crafts as part of their recuperation, with embroidery and simple forms of woodwork being common. Again from ''With a Machine Gun to Cambrai'', George Coppard recalls that, while recuperating from wounds at a private house in [[Birkenhead]], "one kind old lady brought a supply of coloured silks and canvas and instructed us in the art of [[embroidery]]. A sampler which I produced under her guidance so pleased her that she had it framed for me."

An example of therapeutic embroidery during World War I is the work of British military in Egypt, who were photographed sewing and embroidering for Syrian refugees. There was also the Bradford Khaki Handicrafts Club, which was funded in Bradford, UK, in 1918, to provide occupational therapy and employment for men returning from the trenches in France|url=https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/organisations-and-movements/charities/bradford-khaki-handicrafts-club.

===Items made by POWs and internees===
The second category consists of items made by prisoners of war and interned civilians.

[[Prisoners of war|POWs]] had good reasons to make decorative objects: free time and limited resources. Much POW work was therefore done with the express intention of trading the finished article for food, money or other privileges.

Reference to POW work is made in the recollections of A B Baker, W.A.A.C., contained in the book ''Everyman at War'', published by Purdom in 1930:
"Part of my work had to do with prisoners quartered in a camp near to our own. Those Germans were friendly men. They were clever with their hands, and would give me little carvings which they had made."

===Items made by civilians===

The third category is items made by civilians, which mainly means civilians in and around the conflict zone, but would also include items made by sweethearts at home.

In 1914, the US set up the [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]], headed by [[Herbert Hoover]]. It shipped staple foodstuffs, mainly flour, in the printed cotton flour sacks typical of the period. As thanks, the Belgians would embroider and paint in the designs, elaborating them with dates and flags and send them back to the US. Examples of these are now in the [[Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum|Herbert Hoover Museum]], but some were sold to soldiers in Paris or given as gifts.

Civilians in France, in the zones occupied by troops, were quick to exploit a new market. Embroidered [[postcard]]s were produced in what quickly became a [[cottage industry]], with civilians buying the surrounds and embroidering a panel of gauze. These postcards depicted regimental crests or patriotic flags and national symbols in abundance, and millions were produced over the course of the war.

At war's end, when civilians began to reclaim their shattered communities, a new market appeared in the form of pilgrims and tourists. Over the ensuing twenty years mountains of discarded debris, shell casings, and castoff equipment were slowly recycled, with mass-produced town crest motifs being stuck onto bullets, shell casings, fuse caps, and other [[wikt:paraphernalia|paraphernalia]] to be sold to tourists.

===Commercial items===
The fourth category is purely commercial production. After the war, [[tonne]]s of surplus materials were sold by the government and converted to souvenirs of the conflict.

Ship breaking, particularly if the ship had been involved in significant events such as the [[Battle of Jutland]], resulted in much of the wood from the ship being turned into miniature barrels, letter racks, and boxes, with small brass plaques attached announcing, for example, "Made of [[teak]] from HMS ''Shipsname'', which fought at the Battle of Jutland".

'''''Vicky Cristina Barcelona''''' is a 2008 [[Romance film|romantic]] [[comedy-drama]] film written and directed by [[Woody Allen]]. The plot centers on two American women, Vicky and Cristina, who spend a summer in [[Barcelona]], where they meet an artist, Juan Antonio, who is attracted to both of them while still enamored of his mentally and emotionally unstable ex-wife María Elena. The film was shot in Spain in Barcelona, [[Avilés]] and [[Oviedo]], and was Allen's fourth consecutive film shot outside the United States.

The film premiered at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]], then received a rolling worldwide general release that started on August 15, 2008, in the United States, and continued in various countries until its June 2009 release in Japan. The film was nominated for four [[Golden Globe Award]]s, including nominations for Bardem, Hall and Cruz for Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, and won the award for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]]. Cruz won both the [[Academy Award]] and [[BAFTA Award]] for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Altogether, the film won 25 out of 56 nominations.

==Plot==
Vicky and Cristina visit Barcelona for the summer, staying with Vicky's distant relative Judy and her husband Mark. While the two are great friends, Vicky is practical and traditional in her approach to love and commitment and is engaged to the reliable Doug, whereas Cristina imagines herself to be a nonconformist, spontaneous but unsure of what she wants from life or love.

At an art exhibition, Cristina is intrigued by artist Juan Antonio, who Judy says has suffered a violent relationship with his ex-wife. Later, he brazenly approaches the two women to invite them to join him right away for the weekend in the city of [[Oviedo]], in a small plane he flies himself, for sight-seeing, fine eating and drinking, and hopefully, lovemaking. Cristina is won over by the offer almost at once, but Vicky is unimpressed and reluctant; she, however, eventually decides to accompany her friend anyway, mainly to watch over her.

At the end of their first day, Vicky refuses to join Juan Antonio in his hotel room, citing her fidelity to Doug, but Cristina accepts his invitation immediately. Before the lovemaking starts, Cristina suddenly falls ill with digestive complaints, and is put to bed, with food poisoning. Vicky and Juan Antonio proceed to spend the weekend together alone while they wait for Cristina to recuperate. Vicky gradually changes her opinion of Juan Antonio as he tells her about his tumultuous relationship with his former wife, María Elena. Vicky accompanies him to visit his father, an old poet, and then becomes deeply moved by a Spanish guitar performance later that evening. She finally succumbs to Juan Antonio's advances as they walk through a grove of trees in the dark. The next day, with Cristina recovered, the three of them fly back to Barcelona.

Feeling guilty, Vicky does not mention the incident to Cristina, and the two begin to grow apart. Vicky starts throwing herself into her studies while Cristina and Juan Antonio take up a relationship. Cristina then moves in with Juan Antonio and begins to discover more about his past. After learning that María Elena attempted to kill herself, Juan Antonio takes her to his home, where Cristina already lives. After some defiance, the two women grow fond of each other. Cristina realizes that the ex-spouses are still in love, and María Elena suggests that Cristina may be the element that can give balance and stability to their relationship. All three become romantically involved with one another.

In the meantime, Vicky is joined in Spain by an enthusiastic Doug and the two get married. When Cristina describes her new life with Juan Antonio to Vicky, Vicky becomes secretly jealous, and after a few other awkward moments, she realizes she is unsatisfied in her married life and is still attracted to Juan Antonio. Learning that Judy is similarly unhappy in her marriage, she confides to her, and Judy, who sees her younger self in Vicky, decides to bring Juan Antonio and Vicky together. Meanwhile, Cristina becomes restless and at some point decides to leave Juan Antonio and María Elena; without her, their relationship quickly falls apart again.

As the summer winds to a close, Judy arranges for Juan Antonio and Vicky to meet at a party. Juan Antonio begs Vicky to meet him again privately before leaving Spain, which she finally accepts, lying to Doug in the process. At his home, Juan Antonio seduces and wins Vicky over again, but they are interrupted by María Elena who bursts in with a gun, firing wildly as Juan Antonio tries to calm her. Vicky gets shot in the hand in the process, and leaves, shouting they are insane and she could never live like this. She confesses the entire story to Cristina, who never realized how Vicky felt about Juan Antonio, and wishes she could have helped her. Doug, Vicky and Cristina return to the United States; Doug never learns what truly happened, Vicky goes back to her married life, and Cristina is back where she started, still unsure of what she wants from life or love.

Spanish actor Joan Pera, who dubbed Allen's voice in his previous films, makes a [[cameo appearance]].&lt;ref&gt;(2007-04-12).

Retrieved 2010-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
In 2007, controversy arose in [[Catalonia]] (Spain) because the film was partially funded with public money; Barcelona's city hall provided one million [[euro]] and the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] (Government of Catalonia) half a million, or ten percent of the film's budget.&lt;ref name="budget"/&gt;

This was the third time Johansson and Allen worked together, following ''[[Match Point]]'' (2005) and ''[[Scoop (2006 film)|Scoop]]'' (2006). This also marked the second time Johansson and Hall worked together, the first time being in ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006).

The film featured several paintings by Catalan artist Agustí Puig.

==Critical reception==

===Box office===
{{As of|2009|July}}, the film grossed $96 million worldwide; in relation to its $15&amp;nbsp;million budget,&lt;ref name="budget"/&gt; it is one of Allen's most profitable films.&lt;ref&gt;{{mojo title|id=vickycristinabarcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
''Vicky Cristina Barcelona'' garnered the best reviews Allen received since his [[Academy Award]]-nominated 2005 film ''[[Match Point]]'' (also starring Johansson), particularly for Cruz's performance, earning a rating of 81% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref name="rtvicky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vicky_cristina_barcelona/ |title=Vick Cristina Barcelona |accessdate=2009-07-06|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Tobias wrote in ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' that it was "a witty and ambiguous movie that's simultaneously intoxicating and suffused with sadness and doubt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/cinema/vicky_cristina_barcelona|title=Vicky Cristina Barcelona|publisher=Onion AV Club|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Roeper]] suggested that Cruz should receive an [[Academy Award]] nomination for her role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=5843|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080828024322/http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=5843|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 28, 2008|title=Ebert &amp; Roeper - Vicky Cristina Barcelona|publisher=Buena Vista TV|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' praised the film as "the work of a confident and mature artist", referring to Allen.&lt;ref name="LaSalleSFChronicle"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/15/DD62124RD6.DTL |title= Movie review: 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' |author= Mick LaSalle | authorlink = Mick LaSalle |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= August 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote "Although ''Vicky Cristina'' trips along winningly, carried by the beauty of its locations and stars &amp;mdash; and all the gauzy romanticism those enchanted places and people imply &amp;mdash; it reverberates with implacable melancholy, a sense of loss."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/movies/15barc.html The Portrait of Two Ladies], a review from ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] ended his review of the film with "The movie has neither the sardonic heft of [[Max Ophüls]]'s ''[[La Ronde (1950 film)|La Ronde]]'' nor the emotional precision of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'', two films that also dance the change-partners [[gavotte]]. But ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona'' is so engaging so much of the time that it feels like a modest rejuvenation: evidence that a summer in Spain can do wonders for a writer-director who may not have outlived his prime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1833089,00.html Woody Allen's Barcelona Summer of Love].

See it for beautiful locales, an ambivalent look at human relationships and a clutch of great performances, especially from Cruz."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=136045 Vicky Cristina Barcelona] by Ian Freer of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
