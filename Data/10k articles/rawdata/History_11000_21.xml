'''Alexander Forbes''' (1778–1862) was a 19th-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] merchant, explorer, and author. His book ''California: A History of Upper and Lower California'', published in 1839, is perhaps the first full account in [[English language|English]] of [[California]].&lt;ref name="oieahc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oieahc.wm.edu/conferences/11thannual/images.htm | title=Images | work=OIEAHC 11th Annual Conference | publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture | accessdate=2013-04-21 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802042428/http://oieahc.wm.edu/conferences/11thannual/images.htm | archivedate=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the brother of distinguished Scottish physician [[John Forbes (physician)|Sir John Forbes]].&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/19th_Century/forbes/forbes_biog.html |title=Agnew RAL.

Forbes grew up in the counties of [[Banffshire]] and [[Aberdeenshire]]. At some point, he emigrated to [[Tepic]], [[Mexico]], where he made his living as a merchant. He is also recorded as having been the British [[consul]] to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Resolution of the Legislature of Michigan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PLcTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA1|series=Report no. 16|date=29 January 1850|publisher=State Legislature of Michigan|page=1|chapter=Eustace Barron and William and Alex. Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time here that he wrote his book. One of the remarkable aspects of the book is that Forbes wrote it without ever having visited California at the time.&lt;ref name="oieahc"/&gt;

At the time Forbes was writing, California was a province of [[Mexico]]. Forbes drew upon the accounts of California's [[Franciscan]] Padres to inform his work, as well as other agents, including southern California cattleman and landowner [[Abel Stearns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lapl.org/central/californiana.html | title=Californiana at the Los Angeles Public Library | publisher=Los Angeles Public Library | accessdate=2008-01-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131203856/http://www.lapl.org/central/californiana.html| archivedate= 31 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work contains extensive descriptions of Mexican California, including accounts of California's agriculture and its landscape. Forbes advocated that the [[United Kingdom]] take control of California, and suggested that the territory might be ceded to the UK in return for forgiving Mexico's debt to the [[British government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tshaonline.org/publications/journals/shq/online/v018/n3/article_1.html | title=The Early Sentiment For The Annexation Of California: An Account Of The Growth Of American Interest In California, 1835-1846 Iii | first=Robert Glass | last=Cleland | journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly Online | volume=18 | issue=3 |date=January 1915 | accessdate=2013-04-20 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123015316/http://www.tshaonline.org/publications/journals/shq/online/v018/n3/article_1.html | archivedate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Barron, Forbes &amp; Co., which was composed of Forbes, [[Eustace Barron]] (who served as consul before him), and the British vice-consul to California, [[James Alexander Forbes (1805-1881)|James Alexander Forbes]] (no relation), purchased the [[New Almaden]] [[mercury (element)|quicksilver]] mines from [[Andrés Castillero]], which proved to be extremely profitable. However, another man, [[José de los Reyes Berreyesa]], also lay claim to the mine on the basis that it lay on land given to him in a [[land grant]] by the Mexican governor of Alta California. Furthermore, [[Justo Larias]] also claimed ownership, and the United States government even stepped in to claim that the mine lay on public land. A complex legal case involving Mexican laws and the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "one of the most remarkable civil trials in this or any other country",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Commander of All Lincoln's Armies: A Life of General Henry W.

Andres Castillero]]'' eventually reached the [[United States Supreme Court]] whereupon it was finally
decided in 1862 that, the mine was on the Larias grant, and that the furnaces and improvements of the company below the hill were on the Berreyessa grant. The company bought into these two titles and then sold the entire operation in 1864 to the [[Quicksilver Mining Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of San José and Surroundings: With Biographical Sketches of Early Settlers | first=Frederic | last=Hall | publisher=A.L.

Forbes, however, had moved to [[London]] in 1848 to stay with his brother. They retired to [[Whitchurch-on-Thames]] in 1859 after his brother suffered a series of strokes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; Forbes died in 1862 at the age of 84.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7084">'''Anaximenes of [[Lampsacus]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|æ|k|ˈ|s|ɪ|m|ə|ˌ|n|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀναξιμένης ὁ Λαμψακηνός}}; {{circa|380}}{{snd}}320 BC) was a [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[rhetoric]]ian and historian.

==Rhetorical works==
Anaximenes was a pupil of [[Zoilus]]&lt;ref name=OCD&gt;D.A. Russell, "Anaximenes (2)," ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., rev., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and, like his teacher, wrote a work on [[Homer]]. As a rhetorician, he was a determined opponent of [[Isocrates]] and his school.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Anaximenes of Lampsacus|display=Anaximenes|volume=1|page=944}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is generally regarded as the author of the ''[[Rhetoric to Alexander]]'', an ''Art of Rhetoric'' included in the traditional [[Corpus Aristotelicum|corpus]] of [[Aristotle]]'s works.  [[Quintilian]] seems to refer to this work under Anaximenes' name in ''Institutio Oratoria'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082137/http://honeyl.public.iastate.edu/quintilian/3/chapter4.html#9 3.4.9], as the Italian Renaissance philologist [[Piero Vettori]] first recognized.  This attribution has, however, been disputed by some scholars.

The [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdyFQ4a9HOMC&amp;pg=PR58#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false hypothesis] to Isocrates' ''Helen'' mentions that Anaximenes, too, had written a ''Helen'', "though it is more a defense speech (''apologia'') than an [[encomium]]," and concludes that he was "the man who has written about Helen" to whom Isocrates refers (Isoc. ''Helen'' 14).  [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|Jebb]] entertained the possibility that this work survives in the form of the ''[[Encomium of Helen]]'' ascribed to [[Gorgias]]: "It appears not improbable that Anaximenes may have been the real author of the work ascribed to Gorgias."&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Jebb, ''The Attic Orators'', London, 1893, vol. II, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=hsLNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 6.18.6]), Anaximenes was "the first who practised the art of speaking [[Extemporaneous speaking|extemporaneously]]."  He also worked as a [[Logographer (legal)|logographer]], having written the speech prosecuting [[Phryne]] according to Diodorus Periegetes (quoted by [[Athenaeus]] [http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus13c.html#591 XIII.591e]).  The "ethical" fragments preserved in [[Stobaeus]]' ''Florilegium'' may represent "some philosophical book."&lt;ref name=Mahaffy/&gt;

==Historical works==
Anaximenes wrote a history of Greece in twelve books, stretching from the gods' origins to the death of [[Epaminondas]] at the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]] (''Hellenica'', {{lang-grc|Πρῶται ἱστορίαι}}), and a history of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] (''Philippica'').  He was a favorite of [[Alexander the Great]], whom he accompanied in his Persian campaigns,&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; and wrote a third historical work on Alexander (however, Pausanias [https://books.google.com/books?id=hsLNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 6.18.6] expresses doubt about his authorship of an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] on Alexander).  He was one of the eight exemplary historiographers included in the [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandrian]] canon.

[[Didymus Chalcenterus|Didymus]] reports that the work transmitted as speech 11 of [[Demosthenes]] (''Against the Letter of Philip'') could be found in almost identical form in Book 7 of Anaximenes' ''Philippica'', and many scholars regard the work as a historiographic composition by Anaximenes.&lt;ref name=Sealey&gt;[[Raphael Sealey]], ''Demosthenes in His Time'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1993, pp. 239f.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Letter of Philip'' (speech 12) to which speech 11 seems to respond may also be by Anaximenes, or it may be an authentic letter by Philip, perhaps written with the aid of his advisers.&lt;ref name="Sealey"/&gt; The more ambitious theory of Wilhelm Nitsche, which assigned to Anaximenes a larger part of the Demosthenic corpus (speeches 10-13 and 25, letters 1-4, proems), can be rejected.&lt;ref name=Jacoby&gt;Jacoby, commentary on Anaximenes in ''FGrHist''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaximenes was hostile to [[Theopompus]], whom he sought to discredit with a libelous parody, ''Trikaranos'', published in Theopompus' style and under his name, attacking Athens, Sparta, and Thebes.&lt;ref name=Mahaffy&gt;[[John Pentland Mahaffy|J.P. Mahaffy]], ''The Prose Writers from Isocrates to Aristotle'', London, 1904, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iArl6eYqCNsC&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 38]-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] criticizes Anaximenes, together with Theopompus and [[Ephorus]], for the "rhetorical effects and grand [[Periodic sentence|periods]]" these historians implausibly gave to men in the midst of urgent battlefield circumstances (''Praecepta gerendae reipublicae'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Praecepta_gerendae_reipublicae*.html#T803b 803b]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2321">'''Anushirvan ibn Khalid ibn Muhammad Kashani''' ({{lang-fa|انوشیروان بن خالد بن محمد کاشانی}}), also known as '''Abu Nasr Sharaf al-Din''', was a [[Persian people|Persian]] statesman and historian, who served as the vizier of the [[Seljuq Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

Anushirvan was born in 1066/7 at [[Ray, Iran|Ray]]; he belonged to a [[Twelver Shia]] family which had origins in [[Kashan]]. He was a treasurer and head of the Seljuq military during the reign of Sultan [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I]]. Anushirvan was later succeeded by  Shams al-Mulk Uthman as head of the Seljuq military. After this, Anushirvan went to [[Baghdad]], where he later became head of the Seljuq military once again. He was shortly appointed by [[Mahmud II of Great Seljuq|Mahmud II]] as his vizier in 1127, and remained in that office until 1128. Anushirvan served as the vizier of the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Mustarshid]] from 1132 to 1134, and then briefly as the vizier of the new Seljuq Sultan [[Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud]] from 1135 to 1136. Anushirvan later died between 1137 and 1139.

'''The Archaeology Awards''' is an annual awards ceremony celebrating achievements in the field of [[archaeology]].

== Summary ==
The Archaeology Awards was founded by the British magazine ''[[Current Archaeology]]'', with the first ceremony hosted by [[Francis Pryor]], and attended by leading figures from the archaeology world, taking place in Cardiff, 2009.  The ceremony itself was incorporated into the Archaeology Festival held at [[Cardiff University]], with speakers including television broadcaster and historian, [[Bettany Hughes]], who lectured on [[Helen of Troy]].  The awards were supported by [[English Heritage]],&lt;ref name=bigger&gt;Biggar Archaeology News (December 2010), http://www.biggararchaeology.org.uk/news24_311210.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Digging The Dirt (28 March 2010), http://www.diggingthedirt.com/2010/03/28/presentation-of-heritage-research-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ever ceremony saw a generally positive reaction from the British archaeological community, including David Connelly of the British Archaeological Jobs Resource and Bryan Ward-Perkins of Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Archaeology'', Issue 229 (April 2009), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported in the press of many counties with nominated projects.  As one article noted, 'Conesby moat... was shortlisted for a prestigious award with Current Archaeology...  As part of their Archaeology Festival 2009 in Cardiff, the first-ever Current Archaeology Awards took place, with Conesby moat just one of five finalists in its category.'&lt;ref&gt;North Lincolnshire Council (February 2009), http://www.northlincs.gov.uk/NorthLincs/News/PressReleases/PreviousPressReleases/February2009/Localarchaeologyresearchprojectgainsnationalacclaim.htm {{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main prizes are awarded in the following five categories: The Jeffrey May Award (for best new article by a new writer for ''Current Archaeology'' or ''Current World Archaeology''); Book of the Year; Research Project of the Year; Rescue Dig of the Year; and Archaeologist of the Year.

The Jeffrey May Award is named in honour of the late head of archaeology at the [[University of Nottingham]] and major contributor to ''Current Archaeology'', 'who oversaw a decade's work at Dragonby in Lincolnshire'.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;Jeffrey May Obituary, ''The Times Online'' (August 2006) http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article614672.ece&lt;/ref&gt;  His obituary in ''The Times'' notes that 'He followed the principle that the aim of archaeology was not to solve problems for one’s own satisfaction or to impress colleagues, but to provide accurate information about the past for the enlightenment of all.'&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;

The 2010 ceremony, brought in conjunction with the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]], was hosted by ''[[Current World Archaeology]]'' columnist [[Brian Fagan]] of the [[University of California]], with support from the Ermine Street Guard.  2010 also saw the scope broadened to incorporate awards from other major archaeological organisations, representing work from amateur to academic and professional endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Archaeology'', Issue 242 (May 2010), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  This included the Awards for the Presentation of Heritage Research, sponsored by English Heritage, [[Historic Scotland]], [[Cadw]], the Royal Archaeology Institute and government bodies from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  Nominees for the 'Rescue Dig of the Year' included two Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) projects: 'This [[Wooden O]]: Discovering Shakespeare’s First Theatre' and 'Water-power in Medieval Greenwich'.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of London Archaeology (February 2010) http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/English/News/Current/CAawards.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010071602/http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/English/News/Current/CAawards.htm# |date=2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The category was won by 'The Staffordshire Hoard'.

The 'Staffordshire Hoard' team's win was featured in an article by the [[Art Fund]].  On accepting the prize, Dr Kevin Leahy stated: 'This was very much a joint award, to be shared by the many people and organisations who had worked hard on the project.'&lt;ref&gt;'Staffordshire Hoard Team wins Current Archaeology Award', ''The Art Fund'' (March 2010) http://www.artfund.org/staffordshire_hoard/news_and_events/30/staffordshire_hoard_team_wins_current_archaeology_award&lt;/ref&gt;  As reported by the Birmingham News Room, Birmingham City Council Cabinet Member for Leisure, Culture and Sport, Cllr Martin Mullaney, 'congratulated the Staffordshire Hoard team after it scooped a top archaeology award'.&lt;ref&gt;''Birmingham News Room'' (March 2010), http://birminghamnewsroom.com/?p=7907&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 ceremony was held at the [[British Museum]], on Saturday 26 February.&lt;ref name="bigger"/&gt;  In January 2011, it was reported by the ''York Press'' that local team 'On-Site Archaeology' had been nominated in the 'Rescue Dig of the Year' category.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hayes, 'On-Site Archaeology {{sic|shorlisted}} for Rescue Dig Of The Year award', ''York Press'' (6 Jan 2011), http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/features/history/8774352.Archaeology_acclaim_for_mass_grave_find_in_Fishergate__York/&lt;/ref&gt;  Other nominees in the category included the 'Lanton Quarry' site, excavated by Archaeological Research Services LTD.&lt;ref&gt;News, Archaeological Research Services LTD (December 2010), http://www.archaeologicalresearchservices.com/news/news.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707160250/http://www.archaeologicalresearchservices.com/news/news.htm# |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nominees in the Book of the Year category included ''European Influence on Celtic Art'' by Lloyd Laing and ''The Planning of Roman Roads and Walls in Northern England'' by John Poulter.

The '''Battle of Hingakaka''' (sometimes ''Hiringakaka'') was fought between two Maori armies, an allied southern North Island army and a Tainui alliance army, near [[Ohaupo]] in the [[Waikato]] in the late 18th or early 19th centuries, and was reputedly "the largest battle ever fought on New Zealand soil".&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford companion to New Zealand military history'', p. 653.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early New Zealand historian Percy Smith placed the battle at about 1780, basing the date purely on tribal genealogies, but evidence from Maori oral histories from warriors who fought in the battle and were still alive well into European times suggests that 1780 is far too early. The Ngati Whatua chief [[Murupaenga|Te Murupaenga]], who led his warriors into action in the battle, was judged by Samuel Marsden to be about 50 when he saw him in 1820. A date of 1780 would make him about 10 - far too young. Other Ngati Whatua sources correlated the date as two years before the attack on the Boyd, making the date 1807.&lt;ref name=Kelly2002-287&gt;Kelly 2002, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Mana whenua traditions based on accounts from Ngati Maniapoto, Ngati Te Kanawa and Ngati Paretekawa traditional sources, they place the battle in or around the 1790-91 period. 

The battle was fought between groups comprising many smaller allied [[hapu]] and [[iwi]]. The attackers, a force of 7,000 to 10,000 warriors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/mcnelly/dbr/lists/Maori.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318164816/http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/mcnelly/dbr/lists/Maori.htm |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; led by a [[Ngāti Toa]] chief [[Pikauterangi]], from the [[Marokopa]] district of the lower North Island, invaded the [[Waipa District]], to restore honour. He was aggrieved over the poor distribution of the [[Arripis trutta|kahawai]] fish harvest, according to [[Pei Te Hurinui Jones]]. This led to the killing of all members of the [[Ngati Apakura]], who were one of the hapu hosting the fish feast. Other accounts say that Pikauterangi took the biggest fish for himself and he was seized and ducked to the point where he nearly drowned. In vengeance he killed Ngati Apakura, cooked their bodies and distributed them for eating amongst Ngati Kauwhata and Ngati Raukawa.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2002, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''take'', or cause, happened about three years before the battle. During this time Pikauterangi travelled around the lower North Island collecting a large force. He raised about 4,000 men from the Wellington region and a further 3,000 from the East Coast tribes of [[Ngati Porou]] and [[Ngati Kahungunu]]. This was combined with a separate force of [[Te Ati Awa]], [[Ngati Ruanui]] and tribes from the [[Whanganui]] who had already been in battle with [[Ngati Maniapoto]]. 

In response, the Waikato-Maniapoto alliance made preparations to establish a series of warning systems stretching from Kakepuku Maunga (Mountain) to Taupiri Maunga (Mountain) to alert the Waikato-Maniapoto forces of impending invasion, and a battle strategy to  repel and defeat  the invading forces of Pikauterangi,  and constructed a series of "Pa Pahu"  (Pa equipped with Warning devices) commencing with 
* Mangatoatoa Pa, on the [[Puniu River]] just below the Kakepuku Maunga, the assembly point for Waikato-Maniapoto  to confer the "Te Kawau Maro" strategy (a battle strategy, (a Maniapoto fighting strategy based on the "swoop of the Cormorant"), and 
* Waiari Pa, on the Mangapiko Stream, and 
* Nukuhau Pa, on the banks of the Waikato River near the Narrows, and
* Maniapoto Pa, in the Gordonton district, and finally
* Taupiri Pa at Taupiri, on the Banks of the Waikato River, 
When alerted by Ngati Maniapoto of impending attack or invasion by external forces the Mangatoatoa Pa alarm was sounded, which carried to Waiari Pa, whose alarm was then sounded which was heard by Nukuhau (Pa), who sounded its alarm that was heard by Maniapoto (Pa), which sounded its alarm, to be heard by Taupiri and all of Waikato. In consequence, Waikato-Maniapoto would meet at Mangatoatoa as previously planned. 

Pikauterangi's forces combined at [[Otorohanga]] &lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2002, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; in preparation for the attack on the [[Ngāti Maniapoto]] and the [[Waikato (iwi)|Waikato]] tribes who had allied with [[Ngati Whatua]] and Hauraki hapu.

The invaders were first spotted by Wahanui, a Maniapoto chief, just south of Otorohanga. He sent runners to the "Pa Pahu" at Mangatoato to raise the alarm, and warn the Waikato-Maniapoto defense forces of the impending attack.  

The day before the battle the two armies drew up before each other. The combined Whatua-Haurakia and Waikato-Maniapoto forces, realising their numbers were far fewer at about 1,600 (some sources say 3,000), arranged bunches of feathers on top of fern to simulate the head feathers of warriors held in reserve, while other chiefs made war-like speeches in the fern to imaginary warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2002, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing to draw the invading force into ambush, the Waikato defenders chose [[Te Mangeo]] ridge line just south of [[Lake Ngaroto]] (and west of where the old [[Ngaroto railway station|Ngaroto]] railway station was later)&lt;ref name="Kelly2002-287" /&gt; to launch their battle strategy "Te Kawau Maro".

[[Te Rauangaanga]], [[Te Wherowhero]]'s father, placed his army on the high ground at the end of a narrow ridge in three groups. The invading force assembled at the foot of the spur (possibly near where the railway line is now). Huahua's Maniapoto forces initiated the "Whewhera" strategy of Te Kawau Maro in a spearhead attack, by charging down the hill into the centre of the invading force. The defenders reeled back, allowing the attackers to envelop them. The second group of the defending forces then rushed down the hill to hit the confused army of Pikauterangi in the flank. The turning point came when Pikauterangi was felled by a blow from Te Rauangaanga. In a panic the invaders tried to retreat along a narrow gap between the ridge and the lake but were ambushed by Tiriwa's men who had been waiting in the bush along the ridge. The Ngāti Toa were forced into the swamplands along the lake margin; some tried to swim the lake but were killed by patrols waiting on the far side.

Many thousands died in the attack. Pei Jones of [[Tainui]] says that 16,000 warriors are said to have taken part. Combatants included Waikato-Maniapoto, Ngāti Toa and Ngāti Raukawa. Ngati Raukawa alone are said to have lost 1,600 warriors in battle, including two chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2002, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Others came from [[Taranaki region|Taranaki]], from [[Kaipara Harbour|Kaipara]] in Northland, and as far east as [[Bay of Plenty]] and [[Hawke's Bay]]. So many chiefs died in the battle that it is known as ''Hingakaka'' (the fall of parrots), an echo of the traditional mass parrot hunt.

The sacred carving [[Te Uenuku]] was lost in the carnage, and not recovered until 1906.

Sources differ on the date of the battle, ranging from 1790,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/te-wherowhero-potatau-or-potatau-i/1 "Te Wherowhero"], 1966 ''An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand''&lt;/ref&gt; to "about 1803"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teawamutuinfo.com/acatalog/Waipa_Heritage_Trail.html Waipa Heritage Trail]&lt;/ref&gt; and "about 1807"&lt;ref&gt;"From Tāmaki-makau-rau to Auckland", R.C.J. Stone, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; - with the latter now seeming the most likely.

==Aftermath==

The victorious Tainui warriors considered following up their decisive victory with a campaign against the tribes that had made war on them. However the [[tohunga]] of the Ngati Whatua had a bad dream in which he saw Ngapuhi launching an attack on the Kaipara in their absence. Ngati Whatua returned to their home land and defeated an attempted invasion by Ngapuhi. Other Tainui wanted to continue the war especially against Ngati Raukawa who were seriously weakened and retreated to [[Maungatautari]]. Waikato had had enough of fighting for the meantime but in 1810 set out down the west coast on a raid. At [[Rangikaiwaka]] on the coast they met a force of Ngati Tama and a Ngati Haua chief, Taiporutu, was killed. As a result of this another Waikato-Maniapoto war party set out to gain utu to punish Ngati Tama. The avenging warriors were ambushed and defeated by Ngati Tama and their chief Raparapa.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2002, p. 295-286.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 1819-20, during the Ngati Toa migration southwards after being evicted from Kawhia by Waikato-Maniapoto after the Te Arawi battle, Te Apihae Te Kawau, of Ngati Whatua, Kukutai, of Ngati Tipa (Waikato), and Peehi Tukorehu, of Ngati Paretekawa (Maniapoto), embarked with some 4-500 distinguished warriors on the "Amio Whenua" expedition to seek retribution or utu from the tribes who had sought to invade their ancestral Tribal homelands in the Waipa and Waikato territories during the Hingakaka battle of 1791. After encircling the land from Waikato and Maungatautari to Te Arawa and Tuhoe, and through the Tai Rawhiti district to Te Mahia, then on to Wairarpapa and across to Manawatu and Whanganui, the "ope taua" (war party) was eventually  besieged at Pukerangiora Pa,  on the banks of the Waitara River, Taranaki.  A large Waikato-Maniapoto force under Te Wherowhero, Te Hiakai, Mama, and others was raised to break the siege and free the "Amio Whenua Ope Taua" (Amio Whenua War Party), and after being defeated in the battle of Motunui on their way to Pukerangiora with Te Rauparaha and Ngati Toa who were sheltering at Okoki with Te Atiawa and others at the time, they all returned to there homelands at Waikato and Waipa. 

This led to further conflict  and was the immediate background to the Ngati Toa forming alliances with Ngati Tama and Ngati Mutanga in the great Ngati Toa upheaval of 1821-22. This attack in turn led to further attacks and counterattacks, building to a climax in 1831 when a large Waikato contingent alleged to be about 4,000 warriors carried out a brutal and sustained campaign over several years led by the great Waikato warrior Te Wherowhero. When women and children attempted to flee the Pukerangiora pa they were mercilessly slaughtered and eaten. When the men emerged in a weakened state many of them jumped the cliff to avoid the Waikato warrior. The victims were tracked down and killed anyway. Te Wherowhero killed 150 prisoners with his favourite greenstone [[Mere (weapon)|mere]], only stopping when his arm swelled up from overuse, The Ngati Maniapoto Chief Tukorehu showed no mercy to the Pukerangiora people, the same people who saved his life and his war party 10 years earlier, placing the heads of the Pa's Chiefs, Whatitiri and Pekapeka on poles in front of the wharenui that housed him a decade before, this evil act was well known to all the other tribes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1781">In the year 616 an anonymous scholar extended [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]] to an Easter table covering the years 532 up to and including 721.   Dionysius' table was published in 525 and only a century later accepted by the church of Rome, which from the third century up till then had given preference to go on using her own, relatively inadequate, Easter tables.   From about the middle of the seventh century all controversy between Alexandria and Rome as to the correct date of Easter ceased, as both churches were now using identical tables.   

In the year 725 [[Bede#Scientific writings|Bede]] (Latin name Beda Venerabilis) published a new extension of Dionysius’ Easter table to a great '''Easter cycle''', which is periodic in its entirety and in which consequently not only the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Paschal full moon]] but also the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Easter Sunday]] is periodic. Bede’s Easter cycle contains lunar cycles (of 19 years) as well as solar cycles (of 28 years), and therefore it has a period of 532 years. In the [[Byzantine empire]] thanks to the Paschal cycle of [[Annianus of Alexandria]] at all times the churches were acquainted with the correct date of the next Easter Sunday. It is Beda Venerabilis’ Easter cycle by means of which also the churches in the part of Europe outside the Byzantine empire got that possibility.

In [[historical linguistics]], a '''chain shift''' is a set of [[sound changes]] in which the change in pronunciation of one [[speech sound]] (typically, a [[phoneme]]) is linked to, and presumably causes, the change in pronunciation of other sounds as well.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Robert|chapter=Historical linguistics: The study of language change|title=Contemporary Linguistics An Introduction|editors=W. O'Grady, J. Archibald, M. Aronoff, J. Rees-Miller|publisher=Bedford St. Martin|year=2001|pages=287–346|isbn=0-312-24738-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sounds involved in a chain shift can be ordered into a "chain" in such a way that after the change is complete, each phoneme ends up sounding like what the phoneme before it in the chain sounded like ''before'' the change.{{specify|date=February 2017|reason=This does seem to happen sometimes, but I can't find a source suggesting it is necessarily true.}} The changes making up a chain shift, interpreted as rules of [[phonology]], are in what is termed ''[[counterfeeding order]]''.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}

A well-known example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which was a chain shift that affected all of the [[long vowel]]s in [[Middle English]].&lt;ref name="Fromkin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Rodman|first2=Robert|title=An Introduction to Language|publisher=Harcourt Brace|year=1993|pages=326–327|isbn=0-03-054983-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes to the [[front vowel]]s may be summarized as follows:

: {{IPA|a}} → {{IPA|e:}} → {{IPA|i:}} → {{IPA|aɪ}}

A '''drag chain''' or '''pull chain''' is a chain shift in which the phoneme at the "leading" edge of the chain changes first.&lt;ref name="Łubowicz"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2011|last=Łubowicz|first=Anna|title=Chain shifts|encyclopedia=The Blackwell Companion to Phonology|doi=10.1002/9781444335262.wbctp0073}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example above, the chain shift would be a pull chain if {{IPA|/i:/}} changed to {{IPA|/aɪ/}} first, opening up a space at the position of {{IPA|[i]}}, which {{IPA|/e:/}} then moved to fill. A '''push chain''' is a chain shift in which the phoneme at the "end" of the chain moves first: in this example, if {{IPA|/a/}} moved toward {{IPA|[e]}}, a "crowding" effect would be created and {{IPA|/e:/}} would thus move toward {{IPA|[i]}}, and so forth.&lt;ref name="Łubowicz"/&gt; It is not known which phonemes changed first during the Great Vowel Shift; many scholars believe the [[high vowel]]s such as {{IPA|/i:/}} started the shift, but some suggest that the [[low vowel]]s, such as {{IPA|/a/}}, may have shifted first.&lt;ref name="Winkler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Elizabeth Grace|title=Understanding Language|location=London|publisher=Continuum|year=2007|page=187|isbn=0-8264-84824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{Inline audio|section}}
During the Great Vowel Shift in the 15th and 16th centuries, all of the long vowels of Middle English, which correspond to [[tense vowel]]s in Modern English, shifted pronunciation. The changes can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fromkin"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Great Vowel Shift
|-
! rowspan="2" | Front vowels
| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|eː}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close front unrounded vowel.ogg|i:}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|En-us-I.ogg|aɪ}}
|-
| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Open-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|ɛ:}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close front unrounded vowel.ogg|i:}} ''or'' {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|eː}}
|-
! rowspan="2" | Back vowels
| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Open-mid back rounded vowel.ogg|ɔː}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid back rounded vowel.ogg|oː}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close back rounded vowel.ogg|uː}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|En-us-ow.ogg|aʊ}}
|-
| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Open front unrounded vowel.ogg|a}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|eː}}
|}

Most vowels shifted to a higher [[place of articulation]], so that the pronunciation of ''geese'' changed from {{IPA|/ge:s/}} to {{IPA|/giːs/}} and ''broken'' from {{IPA|/brɔːken/}} to {{IPA|/broːkən/}}. The high vowels {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} became [[diphthongs]] (for example, ''mice'' changed from {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ME-mice.ogg|/miːs/}} to {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ModE-mice01.ogg|/maɪs/}}), and the low back vowel {{IPA|/a/}} was [[Fronted (phonetics)|fronted]], causing ''name'' to change from {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ME-name.ogg|/na:mə/}} to {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ModE-name.ogg|/neɪm/}}.&lt;ref name="Fromkin"/&gt;

The Great Vowel Shift occurred over centuries, and not all [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English  were affected in the same ways. For example, some speakers in [[Scotland]] still pronounce ''house'' similarly to its sound in Middle English before the shift, as {{IPA|[hus]}}.&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt;

A chain shift may affect only one [[regional dialect]] of a language, or it may begin in a particular regional dialect and then expand beyond the region in which it originated. A number of recent regional chain shifts have occurred in English.  Perhaps the most well-known is the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]], which is largely confined to the "[[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]]" region of the United States.  Other examples in North America are the [[California vowel shift]], [[Southern American English|Southern vowel shift]] (in the [[Southern United States]]) and the [[Canadian Shift]].  In England, the [[Cockney]] vowel shift among working-class Londoners is familiar from its prominence in plays such as [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s [[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]] (and the related musical [[My Fair Lady]]):{{cn|date=February 2017}}
: {{IPA|iː}} → {{IPA|ei}} → {{IPA|ai}} → {{IPA|ɔi}} → {{IPA|oi}}

Many chain shifts are [[vowel shift]]s, because many sets of vowels are naturally arranged on a multi-value scale (e.g. [[vowel height]] or frontness).  However, chain shifts can also occur in consonants. A famous example of such a shift is the well-known First Germanic Sound Shift or [[Grimm's Law]], in which the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] [[stop consonant]]s became [[fricative]]s, the plain [[voiced]] stops became voiceless, and the [[breathy voice]]d stops became plain voiced:
: {{IPA|bʱ}} → {{IPA|b}} → {{IPA|p}} → {{IPA|f}}
: {{IPA|dʱ}} → {{IPA|d}} → {{IPA|t}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiceless dental fricative.ogg|θ}}
: {{IPA|ɡʱ}} → {{IPA|ɡ}} → {{IPA|k}} → {{IPA|h,x}}

Another is the [[High German consonant shift]] which separated [[Old High German]] from other [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic dialects]] such as [[Old English]], [[Old Frisian]], and [[Old Saxon]]:
:{| class="wikitable"
| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiced alveolar plosive.ogg|d}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiceless alveolar plosive.ogg|t}} → {{IPA|ts}}, {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiceless alveolar sibilant.ogg|s}}
|-
| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiced velar stop.ogg|g}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiceless velar plosive.ogg|k}} → {{IPA|kx}}, {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiceless velar fricative.ogg|x}}
|-
| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiced bilabial plosive.ogg|b}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiceless bilabial plosive.ogg|p}} → {{IPA|pf}}, {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiceless labiodental fricative.ogg|f}}
|}

The Romance languages to the north and west of central Italy (e.g. [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and various northern Italian languages) are known for a set of chain shifts collectively termed ''[[lenition]]'', which affected [[stop consonant]]s between vowels:
: {{IPA|pp}} → {{IPA|p}} → {{IPA|b}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiced bilabial fricative.ogg|β}}, {{IPA|v}}
: {{IPA|tt}} → {{IPA|t}} → {{IPA|d}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiced dental fricative.ogg|ð}} (or vanishes)
: {{IPA|kk}} → {{IPA|k}} → {{IPA|ɡ}} → {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Voiced velar fricative.ogg|ɣ}}, {{IPA|j}} (or vanishes)
In this case, each sound became weaker (or more "lenited").

==Synchronic shifts==

It is also possible for chain shifts to occur synchronically, within the [[phonology]] of a language as it exists at a single point in time.&lt;ref name="Kirchner"&gt;Kirchner, Robert. (1996). Synchronic chain shifts in Optimality Theory. ''Linguistic Inquiry'', ''27'', 341-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nzebi language|Nzebi]] (or Njebi), a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of [[Gabon]], has the following chain shift, triggered morphophonologically by certain tense/aspect suffixes:

{|
| {{IPA|a}} || → || {{IPA|ɛ}} || → || {{IPA|e}} || → || {{IPA|i}}
|-
|             ||     ||              ||     || {{IPA|ə}} || → || {{IPA|i}}
|-
|             ||     || {{IPA|ɔ}} || → || {{IPA|o}} || → || {{IPA|u}}
|}

Examples follow:&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Malcolm. (1968). Notes on Nzebi (Gabon). ''Journal of African Languages'', ''7'',101-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|
! Underlying form !! Chain-shifted form
|-
| {{IPA|sal}} "to work" || {{IPA|sal-i}} → {{IPA|sɛli}}
|-
| {{IPA|βɛɛd}} "to give" || {{IPA|βɛɛd-i}} → {{IPA|βeedi}}
|-
| {{IPA|bet}} "to carry" || {{IPA|bet-i}} → {{IPA|biti}}
|-
| {{IPA|bis}} "to refuse" || {{IPA|bis-i}} → {{IPA|bisi}}
|-
| {{IPA|kolən}} "to go down" || {{IPA|kolən-i}} → {{IPA|kulini}}
|-
| {{IPA|tɔɔd}} "to arrive" || {{IPA|tɔɔd-i}} → {{IPA|toodi}}
|-
| {{IPA|suɛm}} "to hide oneself" || {{IPA|suɛm-i}} → {{IPA|suemi}}
|}

Another example of a chain from Bedouin Hijazi Arabic involves vowel raising and deletion:&lt;ref name="Kirchner" /&gt;

{|
| {{IPA|a}} || → || {{IPA|i}} || → || ''deletion''
|}

In nonfinal open syllables, {{IPA|/a/}} raises to {{IPA|/i/}} while {{IPA|/i/}} in the same position is deleted.

Synchronic chain shifts may be circular. An example of this is [[Amoy dialect|Xiamen tone]] or [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese tone]] [[sandhi]]:&lt;ref name="Kirchner" /&gt;{{rp|fn 348}}{{better source|date=February 2017|reason=This is just a passing mention in a footnote.}}

{|
| 53 || → || 44 || → || 22 || → || 21 || → || 53
|}

The contour tones are lowered to a lower tone, and the lowest tone (21) circles back to the highest tone (53).

Synchronic chain shifts are an example of the theoretical problem of [[phonological opacity]]. Although easily accounted for in a derivational rule-based phonology, its analysis in standard parallel [[Optimality Theory]] is problematic.&lt;ref name="Kirchner" /&gt;

'''Diana Mary Mitchell''' ({{nee|'''Coates'''}}; 16 November 1932 – 8 January 2016) was a Zimbabwean political activist and writer, who was an outspoken critic of the governments of [[Ian Smith]] and [[Robert Mugabe]].

Mitchell was born in [[Harare|Salisbury]], the capital of [[Southern Rhodesia]]. Her father, Elliott Coates, was a merchant navy officer and her mother, Mary Peck, was an actress. Her parents' marriage ended in 1932, and she lived with foster parents during World War II while her mother worked in a munitions factory. She was educated at Eveline Girls High School in [[Bulawayo]], and later at the [[University of Cape Town]] in South Africa, where she studied history and the [[Shona language]]. She married hydraulic engineer Brian Mitchell in 1956, and they had three children.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Julia|title=Diana Mitchell obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/08/diana-mitchell-obituary|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=The Guardian|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell's political activism began in 1966, when she campaigned to save a nursery school which was bulldozed by the government. The campaign later expanded to a broader one to improve education for black children. In 1968, she was involved with the [[Centre Party (Rhodesia)|Centre Party]]; although she ran as an independent candidate in the [[Rhodesian general election, 1974|1974 elections]] and for the National Unifying Force (NUF) in the [[Rhodesian general election, 1977|1977 elections]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

After Smith's 1970 declaration of Rhodesia as a republic, Mitchell was involved with arranging negotiations between Smith's [[Rhodesian Front]] and militant nationalists. Working with journalists Robert Cary and [[Willie Musarurwa]], she compiled and published a definitive biographical compilation of leaders in the nationalist movement, '' African Nationalist Leaders in Rhodesia: Who's Who''. Although delighted at Zimbabwe's eventual independence under terms acceptable to the international community in 1980, Mitchell was critical of the Mugabe government's suppression of the media and political opposition. She and her husband moved to Britain in 2003. Brian died in 2010.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

In 2011, Mitchell's extensive collection of political clippings and papers were donated to the [[Hoover Institution]], which opened them for public access, and to the University of Cape Town.&lt;ref name="hoover"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoover opens papers of Zimbabwean political activist Diana Mitchell|url=http://www.hoover.org/news/hoover-opens-papers-zimbabwean-political-activist-diana-mitchell|publisher=Hoover Institution|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goose Lake meteorite''' is a [[meteorite]] that was found at [[Goose Lake (Oregon-California)|Goose Lake]] in the United States by two [[hunter]]s from [[Oakland, California]] on October 13, 1938.

In 1939 it was acquired by the [[United States National Museum]]. From 1939 until January 14, 1941 it was on exhibition at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] before moving to [[Washington, D.C.]]. It was placed on display in the National Museum's meteorite hall until that hall was closed in the 1950s. Today, the meteorite is on display at the [[National Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Goose Lake Meteorite on Exhibit |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_9047|work=41402|publisher= [[Smithsonian Institution Archives]]|accessdate=26 May 2012|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[Impact crater|crater]] was left on the ground where it was found, thus meaning that the velocity of the meteorite's impact was minimal.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=C. Sharp|first2=C. P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">'''Henri Fazy''' (January 31, 1842, [[Berne]] – December 22, 1920, [[Geneva]]) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[politician]] and [[historian]].

==Biography==
He was a member of a family which at the date of the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] (1685) came from [[Dauphiné]] to Geneva to seek protection for religious reasons. The most prominent member of the family was the Radical statesman James Fazy, his great uncle, whose biography he wrote in 1887.

Henri Fazy studied at Geneva for his doctorate in philosophy and law, became a member of the Genevese cantonal parliament in 1868, and was member of the cantonal executive from 1897 until his death. He was a Radical in politics, but of a more moderate type than his great uncle, and founded a Radical group opposed to the more extreme section which his great uncle led. Carteret, the successor of James Fazy as leader of the latter, died in 1889, and henceforward Henri Fazy played a more and more prominent part in Radical Genevese politics. As a member of the [[canton of Geneva]]'s executive, Fazy had charge of the department of finances, and was much criticised by [[Gustave Ador]], the leader of the Democrats or Whigs. In 1880 his proposal to separate church and state in Geneva was rejected by the people, but was finally accepted by them in 1907. He was a member of the [[National Council (Switzerland)|Swiss Conseil National]] from 1896 to 1899, and from 1902 onwards. After the Radical defeat of 1918, Fazy was the only member of his party who was not turned out of office, but he became more and more conservative as time went on.
[[File:Tomb of Henri Fazy, Kings Cemetery, Geneva.jpg|right|thumb|Tomb of Henri Fazy, Cimetière des Rois, Geneva.]]
For many years, Fazy was the [[archivist]] of Geneva, and also professor of Swiss history at the [[University of Geneva]] (1896-9 and from 1902).

==Writing==
As professor of Swiss history, he wrote much on the history of Geneva. Among his works are:
*''Life of James Fazy'' (1887)
*''Constitutions de Genève'' (1890)
*''L'Alliance de 1584 entre Berne, Zurich et Genève'' (1891)
*''Les Suisses et la Neutralité de Savoie'' (1895)
*''La Guerre du Pays de Gex et l'Occupation genevoise, 1589-1601'' (1897)
*''Histoire de Genève a l'Epoque de l'Escalade, 1589-1601'' (1902)
*''Genève et Charles Emmanuel'' (1909)
He published many papers in the ''Proceedings'' of the Institut National Genevois.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31805">'''Henri Joseph Stahl''' (also known as '''Henric''', '''Enric''', or '''Henry Stahl'''; April 29, 1877 – February 18, 1942) was a [[Romania]]n [[Stenography|stenographer]], [[Graphology|graphologist]], historian and fiction writer. Born to educated immigrant parents, he was a friend and disciple of [[Nicolae Iorga]], doyen of modern Romanian historiography. Much of his work in the field resulted in a monographic and [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservationist]] study of his native [[Bucharest]], which was published by Iorga in 1910.

Stahl created an original system of a stenography, which worked as one of the basic Romanian stenography standards, and, as resident expert at the [[National Archives of Romania|National Archives]], set up the Romanian school of graphology and [[paleography]]. The author of humorous stories and memoirs, he also contributed the novel ''Un român în lună'' ("A Romanian on the Moon"), seen as one of the pioneering works in [[Romanian science fiction]].

In addition to his scholarly and literary work, Stahl worked as a stenographer for public institutions, which allowed him to witness significant events in Romanian political history, and was a distinguished veteran of World War I. Stahl was the father of sociologist [[Henri H. Stahl]] and of novelist [[Henriette Yvonne Stahl]], as well as the stepfather of [[Șerban Voinea]], a political thinker and militant of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]].

==Biography==

===Origins and early life===
Henri Stahl was the son of an [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] and lexicographer, Joseph "Iosif" Stahl (1820–1890), described in sources as "a cross between an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] man and a Swiss woman",&lt;ref name="mi40"&gt;Ioanid, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the Stahls' genealogy, as a [[Bavarians|Bavarian]] baron.&lt;ref&gt;Bălaj, p. 24. See also Mihăilescu, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; According to Henriette Yvonne Stahl, her grandfather was originally active in the [[Kingdom of Greece]], in service to [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]], before being taken prisoner by the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="l-lb24"&gt;Bălaj, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; He owed his relocation to [[Wallachia]] (an autonomous subject of the Ottomans) to the intercession of [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]], who employed him as a ''[[Dragoman]]'' of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Bălaj, p. 24; Ioanid, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, his second wife, Irma Niard, known in Romanian as ''Irina Stahl'',&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul Bucurescilor'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; was from a [[Normandy|Normand]] family, the orphaned daughter of a prize-winning painter.&lt;ref name="l-lb24"/&gt; From Joseph's earlier marriage, Henri had a half-sister, Ana "Nety" Stahl (1853–1929).&lt;ref&gt;Bălaj, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stahls lived in Wallachia, and later in [[United Principalities|unified Romania]], as pedagogues and owners of a boarding school (although Irma never learned Romanian).&lt;ref name="l-lb24"/&gt; By the time of Henri's birth, Joseph had had a lengthy career in publishing, with phrasebooks for German, French or Romanian, beginning with the 1853 ''Kleine Walachische Sprachlehre''.&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', pp. 336–337, 810. See also Bălaj, pp. 24–25; Ioanid, p. 40; Stahl, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Bucharest, Henri was himself a polyglot and a student of history. He enlisted at the [[University of Bucharest|city's university]], where he became one of Iorga's star students and fervent followers.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Mircea Ioanid, "he made himself famous with his modest but fruitful activities in the public sphere, but most of all though his cultural pioneering".&lt;ref name="mi40"/&gt; A graduate of the Faculty of Letters, Stahl invented a method for Romanian stenography, which was based on [[Duployan shorthand]].&lt;ref name="la&amp;al335"&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined its rules in a 1900 textbook: ''Metoda pentru a stenografia cu alfabetul latin pentru uzul studenților, ziariștilor și tuturor celor care au de scris repede'' ("A Method for Stenography in the Latin Alphabet, Useful to Students, Journalists and All Those Who Have to Write Fast").&lt;ref name="la&amp;alxv335"&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', pp. XV, 335&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Stahl had been employed as a reviewer-stenographer by the [[Parliament of Romania]].&lt;ref name="la&amp;al335"/&gt;

Around 1900, Stahl was in France, where he published a guide to the Duployan method and a [[stenotype]] how-to: ''La machine à écrire—machine à stenographier''.&lt;ref name="la&amp;al335"/&gt; He fell deeply in love with a Blanche-Alexandrine Francis Boeuve, who taught at her mother's school in Bucharest. She was three years his senior,&lt;ref name="l-lb25"&gt;Bălaj, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; had worked as a seamstress,&lt;ref name="arhexil"&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212949/http://www.arhivaexilului.ro/ro/fise-biografice/docs/voinea-serban.html "Voinea Șerban"], entry in ''Geografia exilului românesc'', [[Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and Memory of the Romanian Exile]]; retrieved July 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and had [[History of the Jews in France|French Jewish]] origins.&lt;ref name="anro&amp;evr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Niculescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Romani-si-evrei-in-exilul-romanesc*articleID_4819-articles_details.html "Români și evrei în exilul românesc"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 133, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; From a previous relationship, Blanche had a six-year-old son, Gaston.&lt;ref name="l-lb25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arhexil"/&gt;

The affair angered Irma Stahl, who sacked Blanche after she let known that she carried Stahl's child.&lt;ref name="l-lb25"/&gt; Moving in with her sister in [[Saint-Avold]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], she gave birth to a daughter, Henriette. The forceful separation and Henriette's health problems as an infant led Stahl to contemplate suicide; Irma Stahl eventually yielded to his threats, allowing mother and daughter to return and live with her in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Bălaj, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Henri legally married Blanche in 1901.&lt;ref name="arhexil"/&gt; The couple soon had another son, Henri H. Stahl. Blanche became an expert in [[touch typing]], and, after her move to Romania, wrote several textbooks of her own.&lt;ref name="la&amp;alxv335"/&gt; By then, Henri was experimenting with political and humorous writing. In 1901, he became a contributor to [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]'s satirical sheet, ''[[Moftul Român]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; He was an imitator of Caragiale, and, according to Iorga, was one of the best, fitted with a "tender understanding of things".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; Having acquired a first-hand understanding of the emerging Romanian trends in public speaking, Stahl also published a September 1906 notice on the "style of Romanian orators" in the [[Blaj]] review ''Revista Politică și Literară''.&lt;ref&gt;Ileana Ghemeș, "Aplicări ale direcțiunii naționale în ''Revista Politică și Literară'' de la Blaj, în 1906", in ''Annales Universitatis Apulensis. Series Philologica'', Vol. 6, 2005, pp. 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oral historian and science fiction author===
In 1903, Stahl was working for the Chancellery of the [[Senate of Romania|Romanian Senate]] and was teacher at his mother and wife's boarding school on Brutus Street (where he also resided).&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul Bucurescilor'', pp. 6, 149, 228, 359, 410&lt;/ref&gt; Stahl resumed his close contacts with Iorga: Iorga regularly visited Stahl's home and office, where he freely dictated his books for Stahl to write down.&lt;ref&gt;Ioanid, p. 40; Stahl, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Stahl also joined the staff of Iorga's summer school in [[Vălenii de Munte]], where, in 1908, he was teaching stenography courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cătălin Fudulu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/dosare-declasificate-nicolae-iorga-sub-lupa-sigurantei-ii-4904721/ "Dosare declasificate. Nicolae Iorga sub lupa Siguranței (II)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', September 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's academic press of Vălenii put out his 1909 ''Curs complect de stenografie cu vocale'' ("Complete Course of Stenography, Vowels Included").&lt;ref name="la&amp;alxv335"/&gt; Also that year, he put out a French-language introduction to French and German stenography, [[Lithography|lithographed]] in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="la&amp;al335"/&gt;

In addition to such contributions, Stahl preserved a passion for [[oral history]] and the [[history of Bucharest]]. He walked through the city, made notes of its interesting features, created [[Stone rubbing|stone rubs]] from old inscriptions, and interviewed senior citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; His son Henri Jr, who followed him on such excursions, recalls: "He had the special gift of being able to converse with simple people, old and young alike, winning them over with his own matching simplicity, addressing them in their own language, in the very spirit of their mentality."&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; As literary critic [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]] notes, Stahl and Iorga were both conservative adversaries of 20th-century modernization, who disliked popular culture and feared the growth of the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]''.&lt;ref name="dcmrău"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/rau-de-bucuresti-2985587/ "Rău de București"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', March 19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Henri Jr also sees his father as a disciple of Iorga's traditionalist doctrine, or ''[[Sămănătorul|Sămănătorism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp. 15, 16, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, Stahl returned to fiction writing, producing ''Un român în lună'', the [[found manuscript]] of space exploration: a newspaperman chances upon a mysterious text, which turns out to be the stenographic account of a Romanian voyage to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, pp. 33, 34, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Stahl described his novel as more of a "popular treatise in astronomy", a "well-written" and accessible illustration of scientific facts.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1915 review of the novel, [[Mihail Sevastos]] of ''[[Viața Românească]]'' noted: "Mr. Stahl imagined himself a [[Camille Flammarion|Flammarion]] of the Romanians".&lt;ref name="rd.s303"&gt;[[Mihail Sevastos|Rd. S.]], p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; According to philologist Petru Iamandi, the book's "rather obvious [[positivism]]" is balanced by "enthusiasm" and "funny remarks", but "the lack of a genuine conflict [is] the main shortcoming of Stahl's book".&lt;ref&gt;Petru Iamandi, "Romanian SF in the Latter Half of the 19th Century and the First Half of the 20th Century", in ''Analele Universității Dunărea de Jos din Galați'', Nr. 1-1/2013 (''Actele Conferinței Internaționale Lexic Comun – Lexic Specializat''), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1998 by cultural journalist [[Cristian Tudor Popescu]], ''Un român în lună'' can indeed be considered important for the emergence of [[Romanian science fiction]], but it is also "negligent" and "inferior" to its Western models, from [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to [[Jules Verne]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; The unique element, Popescu suggests, is the explorer's motivation: he has left Earth out of [[misanthropy]] and disgust for politicking, but also for a belief in human transcendence (an "[[Omega Point]]", according to Popescu).&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, pp. 36–37, 39–41&lt;/ref&gt; Sevastos pointed out that Stahl's "social criticism" was of the "aggressive" kind, quoting a passage in which the narrator reads Iorga's initials, "dear as they will once be to all Romanians", into the lunar surface.&lt;ref name="rd.s303"/&gt;

Stahl considered publishing the work, and showed it to Iorga for a critical opinion. He met Iorga's opposition, who asked him "to forget the moon and stars" and write a new book using the style around the first chapter, in which Stahl depicts life in turn-of-the-century Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Manolescu, pp. 231–233&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Stahl's literary debut was in 1910 with ''Bucureștii ce se duc'' ("Vanishing Bucharest"), serialized in Iorga's ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'' journal,&lt;ref name="dcmrău"/&gt; then bound together as a volume issued in Vălenii.&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 335; Țurlea, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga later described Stahl, alongside [[Ion Agârbiceanu]], [[Romulus Cioflec]] and [[Dumitru C. Moruzi]], as ''Neamul Românesc''{{'}}s leading prose writer.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is feted for its colorful depictions of Bucharesters at the beginning of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Câlția, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ISTORIE.-Henri-STAHL-Bucurestii-ce-se-duc*articleID_8310-articles_details.html "Henri Stahl, ''Bucureştii ce se duc''"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 171, May–June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; but also for outlining the conservative thesis favored at ''Neamul Românesc''. Stahl sees modern Bucharest as a playing ground for handmaidens and their aroused admirers, riddled with "moronic" pastimes such as binge drinking and visits to the City Morgue.&lt;ref name="dcmrău"/&gt; Stahl also protests against the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Haussmannian renovation]] of downtown Bucharest, and proposes that all condemned buildings be photographed and inventoried for historical reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudor Mavrodin, [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr-32008-4318.html "Orașul care a fost. Colțuri dintr-un București personal"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 934, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Stahl followed up with humorous [[Sketch story|sketch stories]]: ''Dela manevre'' ("From the Maneuvers"), printed by Iorga in 1912, and the 1915 ''Macabre și viceversa'' ("Macabre Ones and Vice Versa").&lt;ref name="la&amp;alxv335"/&gt; He did eventually publish his science fiction novel: first in 1913, serialized in [[Victor Anestin]]'s ''[[Știință și Tehnică|Ziarul Călătoriilor]]'' magazine, then as a single volume in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Manolescu, pp. 232–233; Popescu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter popular edition, produced at the Bucharest Institute of Graphic Arts, the "astronomical novel" was illustrated by [[Stoica D.]] and [[Ary Murnu]].&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 335; Rd. S., p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; At an unknown later date, Stahl also produced a volume of ''Schițe parlamentare'' ("Parliamentary Sketches"), with models of oratory, samples of ignominious behavior, and memoirs of parliamentary disputes.&lt;ref name="schițe"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Schite-parlamentare-ale-lui-Henri-Stahl*articleID_10128-articles_details.html "''Schițe parlamentare'' ale lui Henri Stahl"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 206, February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
During the early 1910s, Stahl made visits to the Romanian communities of [[Austria-Hungary]], and in particular to those of [[Transylvania]] and [[Partium]]. Under Germanic influence, Transylvanian Romanian intellectuals had devised their own shorthand system, codified by Vasile Vlaicu.&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 776&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stahl was contracted by [[Romanian National Party]] leaders to record their February 1911 meeting with the constituents of [[Arad County (former)|Arad]], [[Békés County (former)|Békés]] and [[Csanád County|Csanád]] counties, which doubled as a protest against [[Magyarization]] policies and for [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradin, pp. 140–141, 144–145, 146–153&lt;/ref&gt; Stahl was enthusiastic about the events, and contrasted the enthusiasm and sincerity of Transylvanians with the politicking of his Bucharest employers.&lt;ref&gt;Bradin, pp. 146, 148, 149–153&lt;/ref&gt; He left notes on the "natural bond between the people and the leaders", and found the Partium peasants to be exceptionally polite, as well as "fair, intelligent, and proud".&lt;ref&gt;Bradin, pp. 148–149, 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Stahl was drafted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]] in 1916, when Romania entered World War I as an enemy of Austria-Hungary. He was a reserve lieutenant in the 6th (Mihai Viteazu) Regiment.&lt;ref name="hhs17"&gt;Stahl, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He saw action during the early stages of the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Campaign]], but was badly wounded in the trenches during the battles of September 1916.&lt;ref name="pț66"&gt;Țurlea, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Losing consciousness, he was dragged away and rescued by his peasant batman,&lt;ref name="hhs17"/&gt; and was under treatment at Gerota hospital when Iorga dedicated him an encomium in ''Neamul Românesc'' (September 23, 1916).&lt;ref name="pț66"/&gt; He was a convalescent in [[Ploiești]] when the [[Central Powers]] [[Battle of Bucharest|occupied southern Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Țurlea, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving his children and wife behind, Stahl escaped to [[Moldavia]], where the Romanian government authorities resided. During 1917, he resumed his collaboration with Iorga, who was putting out in [[Iași]], the provisional capital, a new review called ''[[Drum Drept]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed his work as stenographer, and followed Romanian parliamentarians on their refuge to Russia's [[Kherson Governorate]]. He was caught there by the [[October Revolution]], and witnessed the mounting tensions between anticommunist Romanians and [[Rumcherod]] officials.&lt;ref name="noteulit6"&gt;"Note românești. Cu parlamentarii în U.R.S.S.", in ''[[Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 9/1942, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Blanche and the Stahl children lived in occupied Bucharest, and were helped to survive by their peasant acquaintances, through contraband goods.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Stahl eventually returned to the occupied capital after the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Romanian armistice]] (April 1918), and had to watch resentfully as the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] embarked on a campaign of hasty requisitions.&lt;ref&gt;George Florescu, "Germania și germanii în ''Memoriile'' lui N. Iorga (1917-1918) (II)", in ''Zargidava. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. VIII, 2009, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Stahl resumed his work in parliament after the [[First Armistice at Compiègne|German capitulation of November]]. During the late 1910s and early 1920s, he was vice president of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Deputies' Assembly]] corps of stenographers, in which capacity he taught free lessons in stenography to university students.&lt;ref&gt;"Cronica bucureșteană", in ''Cultura Poporului'', Nr. 39/1923&lt;/ref&gt; For that purpose, he issued a 1919 ''Curs de stenografie parlamentară'' ("Parliamentary Stenography Course").&lt;ref name="la&amp;alxv335"/&gt; In interwar [[Greater Romania]], Stahl expanded the focus of his investigations and interviews, with trips to mountain localities such as [[Breaza]] and [[Covasna]],&lt;ref name="hhs17"/&gt; and resumed his literary work, in the eclectic newspaper ''[[Cuget Românesc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; ''Un român în lună'' went through a second edition in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Manolescu, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final decades===
Both of Stahl's male heirs were involved in social sciences. Known to the world as ''Șerban Voinea'' (a pseudonym he first used in 1919), Gaston became a Romanian citizen in 1929.&lt;ref name="arhexil"/&gt; He was a [[Theoretician (Marxism)|Marxist theoretician]], seen by Ioanid as one of "worldwide value" and a "classic of Romanian sociology",&lt;ref name="mi41"&gt;Ioanid, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; whose semi-legal activities in the [[Socialist Party of Romania]] resulted in prosecution at the ''[[Dealul Spirii Trial]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Living abroad during much of the 1920s, he was a graduate of several academic institutions, including the [[École supérieure de journalisme de Paris|Free College of Social Sciences]].&lt;ref name="arhexil"/&gt; Returning to Romania in the 1930s, Voinea primarily worked as a radio journalist, and was the theoretical voice of the [[Reformism|reformist]] and pro-Western [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="arhexil"/&gt; Henri Jr was himself a student of Iorga, but not a follower, and alienated Iorga when he stated his preference for [[rural sociology]] over history.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; As a researcher, he brought up empirical evidence which supported some of Iorga's core theses, but criticized his attempts to silence other opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp. 15–17, 22–23, 45, 83–84, 164–165, 180&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with financial difficulties for much of his life, he supplemented his income by working in stenography, which he had learned from his father.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Capcanele istoriei. Elita intelectuală românească între 1930 și 1950'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2012, p. 35.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-3533-4}}; Stahl, pp. 21–22, 30–31, 110–111, 166, 201&lt;/ref&gt;

To her father's despair, Henriette had a troubled childhood, and shunned academic life in favor of sheer experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Bălaj, pp. 25–28&lt;/ref&gt; She was, by contemporary accounts, an extraordinarily beautiful woman.&lt;ref name="cmhysstele"&gt;{{ro icon}} Clara Mărgineanu, [http://jurnalul.ro/cultura/arte-vizuale/henriette-yvonne-stahl-printre-stele-norocoase-538571.html# "Henriette Yvonne Stahl, printre stele norocoase"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', March 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the [[Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography|Bucharest School of Drama]], but enjoyed most acclaim as a writer. Her father encouraged her, submitting her debut novel ''Voica'' to a literary contest in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Bianca Burța-Cernat, [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr-62008-4545.html "Din secolul trecut..."], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 949, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; From 1931 to 1944, Henriette was married to the poet-translator [[Ion Vinea]], and notoriously shared his passion for hard drugs, which inspired her to write violently modernist novels.&lt;ref&gt;Tudor Crețu, "Opiaceele Henriettei Yvonne Stahl", in ''[[Dilemateca]]'', Nr. 80, January 2013, pp. 8–12&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1925, Stahl's expertise in graphology was harnessed by the [[National Archives of Romania]] and its Superior School of Archivists and Paleographers.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, pp. 24, 25. See also Stahl, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Stahl's work for those years includes a 1926 textbook of graphology. It was positively reviewed at the time by the social scientist [[Mihai Ralea]], according to whom "given [Stahl's] technical expertise, nobody would have been better suited for the task than him". The textbook notably included writing samples "from virtually all of modern Romania's personalities", alongside character sketches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mihai Ralea]], "Recenzii. H. Stahl, ''Grafologia''", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 11/1926, pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; He had also published, in 1925, the war-themed volume of sketches called ''Spion'' ("A Spy"), praised by Ralea for its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mihai Ralea]], "Recenzii. H. Stahl, ''Spion''", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 9/1925, pp. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition of ''Bucureștii ce se duc'' came out in 1935 at E. Marvan Publishers, illustrated with 175 photographs taken by Stahl himself.&lt;ref name="dcmrău"/&gt; Stahl published in 1936 his own contribution in the field of paleography: a textbook for [[Old Church Slavonic]], in collaboration with the Slavist Damian P. Bogdan.&lt;ref&gt;"Comunicate și Circulări Ministeriale. Ministerul Culturii Naționale și al Cultelor. Rapoarte privitoare la ocuparea catedrelor la Universități", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 154/1942, pp. 5532–5533. See also Stahl, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the Archivists' School in 1938, when [[Aurel Sacerdoțeanu]] took over as Director, but was still considered one of the school's prime experts, and honored by Sacerdoțeanu as the founder of Romanian graphology.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, pp. 25, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Stahl died in February 1942. This occurred during the Nazi-allied dictatorship of [[Ion Antonescu]] (to which his son Voinea was structurally opposed),&lt;ref name="arhexil"/&gt; while the Stahl children had come under official investigation, to decide whether the [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|racial laws]] applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;Mihăilescu, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The stenographer-historian was buried in Bucharest's [[Bellu cemetery]], the [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]] section.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], Bucharest, 1972, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; His death is recorded in the diary of a marginalized politician, [[Constantin Argetoianu]], right after news of [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|General Wavell]]'s injury: "Death of Henri Stahl, the known stenographer. Stahl was also a remarkable writer and a very decent man. We bury with him another piece of our past, the past of old folks..."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Constantin Argetoianu]], Stelian Neagoe, [http://jurnalul.ro/istorie-politica/din-insemnarile-zilnice-ale-lui-constantin-argetoianu-ep-39-561765.html "Din însemnările zilnice ale lui Constantin Argetoianu (ep. 39)"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', December 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Stahl's book of World War I memoirs, titled ''Cu Parlamentul în U.R.S.S.'' ("With the Parliament in the USSR"), was issued later that month, at the height of Romania's involvement in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|anti-Soviet war]].&lt;ref name="noteulit6"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Upon the end of the war, Stahl's two male heirs wrote Romania's first course in [[Marxist sociology]].&lt;ref name="mi40"/&gt; Voinea became ambassador of Romania in [[Bern]], but fell out with the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] and defected to the West. He worked for the [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|French Radio and Television Broadcasting]] and was active within the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]].&lt;ref name="arhexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anro&amp;evr"/&gt; The other Stahls remained in Romania. Henriette's relation to Voinea resulted in the [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censoring]] of her novels, and she was banned from publishing for some 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bălaj, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; She was protected from imprisonment by her ten-year-long affair with [[Petru Dumitriu]], the official communist poet. When Dumitriu himself defected in 1960, Henriette was detained for several months and made to confess that she had been Dumitriu's [[ghostwriter]].&lt;ref name="cmhysstele"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bălaj, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mvbproza"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marian Victor Buciu, [http://www.romlit.ro/proza_henriettei_yvonne_stahl "Proza Henriettei Yvonne Stahl"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 7/2008&lt;/ref&gt; She was later released, and continued to publish, in both Romania and her native France, until well into her seventies; she died in 1984.&lt;ref name="cmhysstele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mvbproza"/&gt;

Harassed by [[Securitate]] agents&lt;ref&gt;Mihăilescu, pp. 36–37, 41&lt;/ref&gt; and prevented from publishing until the 1960s (during which interval he had to work in [[Systematization (Romania)|systematization]]), Henri H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29245">The '''[[Portuguese language]]''' developed in the Western Iberian Peninsula from [[Latin]] spoken by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers and colonists starting in the 3rd century BC. Old Portuguese, also known as [[Galician-Portuguese]], began to diverge from other [[Romance languages]] after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and the [[Germanic people|Germanic]] invasions, also known as [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]] in the 5th century and started appearing in written documents around the 9th century. By the 13th century, [[Galician-Portuguese]] had become a mature language with its own literature and began to split into two languages. However, the debate of whether Galician and Portuguese are nowadays varieties of the same language, much like American English or British English, is still present. In all aspects—[[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexicon]] and [[syntax]]—Portuguese is essentially the result of an organic evolution of [[Vulgar Latin]] with some influences from other languages, namely the native [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]] and [[Lusitanian language|Lusitanian]] languages spoken prior to the Roman domination.

==Social history==

===Romanization===
{{further|Vulgar Latin}}

Arriving on the Iberian Peninsula in 218 BC, the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] brought with them [[Latin language|Latin]], from which all Romance languages descend. The language was spread by arriving Roman soldiers, settlers and merchants, who built Roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous civilizations. Later, the inhabitants of the cities of [[Lusitania]] and the rest of Romanized Iberia were recognized as citizens of Rome.

Roman control of the western part of Hispania was not consolidated until the campaigns of Augustus in 26 BC. Although the western territories to the south of the Tagus River were only conquered after the victory of Licinius Crassus in the year 93 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm Detailed map of the Pre-Roman Peoples of Iberia (around 200 BC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006160601/http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm |date=2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only an estimated four hundred words of the native languages&lt;ref&gt;[[Portuguese vocabulary]]&lt;/ref&gt; persist in modern Portuguese. After 200 years of wars first with the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the Eastern part of the peninsula, and then the local inhabitants, emperor [[Augustus]] conquered the whole peninsula, which was named [[Hispania]]. He then divided it into three [[Roman province|provinces]], [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], [[Hispania Baetica]], and [[Lusitania]], the latter of which included most of modern Portugal. In the 3rd century, emperor [[Diocletian]] split Tarraconensis into three, creating the adjacent province of [[Gallaecia]], which geographically enclosed the remaining part of Portugal, and modern-day [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (in the northwestern region of Spain).

===Iberian Romance===
{{main|Iberian Romance languages|Galician-Portuguese}}

Between AD 409 and 711, as the Roman Empire was collapsing, the Iberian Peninsula was [[Migration Period|invaded by peoples of Germanic origin]], known by the Romans as [[Barbarians]]. The Barbarians (mainly [[Suevi]] and [[Visigoths]]) largely absorbed the Roman culture and language of the peninsula; however, since the Roman schools and administration were closed and Europe entered the [[Early Middle Ages]], the Vulgar Latin language of ordinary people was left free to evolve on its own and the uniformity of the language across the Iberian Peninsula broke down. In the north-western part of the Peninsula (today's Northern Portugal and Galicia), Vulgar Latin began gaining a growing number of local characteristics, leading to the formation of what linguists today call Galician-Portuguese. The [[Germanic languages]] influenced [[Galician-Portuguese]] by introducing words often linked to the military like ''guerra'' ([[war]]) or ''laverca'' ([[lark]]), placenames such as ([[Resende (disambiguation)|Resende]]), animals like ''ganso'' ([[goose]]), ''texugo'' ([[badger]]), human feelings such as ''orgulho'' ([[pride]]), verbs like ''brigar'' (to [[fight]]), suffixes like ''reguengo'' ([[royal domain]]) and everyday objects such as ''frasco'' ([[flask (disambiguation)|flask]]).

From 711, with the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was adopted as the administrative language in the conquered regions. However, much of the population continued to speak the Latin-derived Romance dialects, called collectively by modern linguists [[Mozarabic]]. The main effect of the Arabic influence was lexical. Modern Portuguese has between 400 up to as much as 800 words of Arabic origin&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GJSeK3bYGy8C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=menos+de+mil+palavras+em+%C3%A1rabes+na+l%C3%ADngua+portuguesa&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ztliUp_QLc6VhQes54DIBg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=menos%20de%20mil%20palavras%20em%20%C3%A1rabes%20na%20l%C3%ADngua%20portuguesa&amp;f=false A língua portuguesa nos seus percursos multiculturais p.39]&lt;/ref&gt; (many were absorbed indirectly through Mozarabic) especially relating to food, agriculture and the crafts, which have no cognates in other Romance languages except in Spanish from which in fact, Portuguese borrowed many of its Arabic-derived words. The Arabic influence is also visible in placenames, especially in the southern provinces, such as the [[Algarve]], [[Alfama]] and [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]].
However, there are no Arabic loan words in the lexicon related to human feelings or emotions; those are all of [[Latin]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin.

The oldest surviving records containing written Galician-Portuguese are documents from the 9th century. In these official documents, bits of Galician-Portuguese found its way into texts that were written in Latin. Today, this phase is known as "Proto-Portuguese" simply because the earliest of these documents are from the former [[County of Portugal]], although Portuguese and Galician were still a single language. This period lasted until the 12th century.

===The lyric period===

What modern scholars call ''Galician-Portuguese'' was originally the native language of the medieval [[Kingdom of Galicia]], which was founded in 410 and included the northern part of present-day [[Portugal]]. It appears to have also been used regularly in other Christian kingdoms of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as the language for [[Lyrics|lyric]] song. It was employed by poets from throughout the non-Basque medieval Christian kingdoms of the peninsula; including [[Kingdom of León|Leonese]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]], [[Aragon]]ese and [[Catalonia|Catalan]]. It is also the language used in the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]''. These songs were traditionally attributed to [[Alfonso X]], a Castilian king, though more recent work shows that they must have been composed in collaboration with many translators, poets and musicians.

===The divergence of Galician-Portuguese===
Portugal was formally recognized as an independent kingdom in 1143 by the [[Kingdom of León]], into which Galicia was incorporated at the time, with [[Alfonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]] as its first king. In 1290, King [[Denis of Portugal|Diniz]] created the first Portuguese University in Lisbon (the ''Estudo Geral'') and decreed that the language of the Portuguese, then simply called the "Vulgar language" (i.e. [[Vulgar Latin]]) should be used in preference to [[Latin]] and known as the "Portuguese language". In 1296, Portuguese was adopted by the Royal Chancellary and was used not only in poetry but also when writing law and in notaries. In the first period of "Old Portuguese" (from 12th to the 14th century), the language came gradually to be used in official documents. With the political separation of the County of Portugal from Galicia, Galician-Portuguese lost its unity and slowly became two increasingly distinct languages. This growing difference accelerated when Galicia became part of Castile and Galician was increasingly influenced by Castilian. Meanwhile, the southern variant of Galician-Portuguese became the modern Portuguese language within the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and its empire.

==Standardization during the Renaissance==
{{See also|Portuguese vocabulary}}
The end of "Old Portuguese" was marked by the publication of the ''Cancioneiro Geral'' by [[Garcia de Resende]], in 1516.

"Modern Portuguese" developed from the early 16th century to the present. During the [[Renaissance]], scholars and writers borrowed many words from [[classical Latin]] (learned words borrowed from Latin also came from [[Renaissance Latin]]) and [[ancient Greek]], which increased the complexity of the Portuguese [[lexicon]]. Most literate Portuguese speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Portuguese.{{cn|date=March 2017}} As with most European [[vernacular language]]s, the standardization of the Portuguese language was propelled by the development of the [[printing press]]. In 1536 [[Fernão de Oliveira]] published his ''Grammatica da lingoagem portuguesa'' in Lisbon, the first [[Portuguese grammar]].&lt;ref name="BN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/369/1/ficha-obra-gramatica.html|website=Tesouros impressos da Biblioteca Nacional|title=Grammatica da lingoagem Portuguesa de Fernão de Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Portuguese: A linguistic introduction|last = Azevedo|first = Milton M.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-521-80515-5|location = Cambridge|page = 13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tWk6gpv8ep0C&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of this heterodox Dominican priest, philologist and mariner was soon followed. In 1540, [[João de Barros]] crown officer published his ''Gramática da Língua Portuguesa'' along with moral dialogues and basics of the Catholic Church to help teaching young aristocrats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RHBN"&gt;Cantarino, Nelson. ''O idioma nosso de cada dia'', in: Revista de História da Biblioteca Nacional, ano 1, nº 8, fev/mar 2006 (Seção: Documento Por Dentro da Biblioteca) – [http://www.revistadehistoria.com.br/v2/home/?go=detalhe&amp;id=941 Texto parcial] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121208183539/http://www.revistadehistoria.com.br/v2/home/?go=detalhe&amp;id=941 |date=2012-12-08 }}, sítio obtido em 31 de janeiro de 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This second work, illustrated with woodcuts, is considered the world's first printed illustrated [[text book]].&lt;ref name="RHBN"/&gt;

===Expansion during the age of discovery===
{{See also|Portuguese vocabulary}}
The second period of Old Portuguese covers the time from the 14th to the 16th centuries and is marked by the Portuguese discoveries of the 15th and 16th centuries. In that time, colonisers, traders and missionaries spread the Portuguese language to many regions in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[The Americas]]. Today most Portuguese speakers live in Brazil, the biggest former colony of Portugal. By the mid-16th century, Portuguese had become a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in Asia and Africa, used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and Europeans of all nationalities. In Ceylon (modern [[Sri Lanka]]) several kings became fluent speakers of Portuguese, and nobles often took Portuguese names. The spread of the language was helped by its association with the [[Catholic]] [[missionary]] efforts, which led to its being called ''Cristão'' ("[[Christianity|Christian]]") in many places. The ''[[Nippo Jisho]]'', a Japanese–Portuguese dictionary written in 1603, was a product of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary activity in [[Japan]]. The language continued to be popular in parts of Asia until the 19th century, despite the severe measures taken by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] to abolish it in Ceylon and [[Indonesia]].

Some Portuguese-speaking Christian communities in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] preserved their language even after they were isolated from Portugal. The language has largely changed in these communities and has evolved through the centuries into several [[Portuguese Creole|Portuguese creoles]]. Also, a considerable number of words of Portuguese origin are found in [[Tetum]], the national language of [[East Timor]], such as ''lee'' "[[reading (activity)|to read]]" (from ''ler''), ''aprende'' "[[learning|to learn]]" (from ''aprender'') and ''tenke'' "to have to" (from ''tem que''). Portuguese words entered the lexicons of many other languages, such as ''pan'' "[[bread]]" (from ''pão'') in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (see [[Japanese words of Portuguese origin]]), ''sepatu'' "[[shoe]]" (from ''sapato'') in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], ''keju'' "[[cheese]]" (from ''queijo'') in [[Malay language|Malay]] and ''meza'' "[[Table (furniture)|table]]" (from ''mesa'') in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].  Due to the vast expanse of the [[Portuguese Empire]], there are also numerous words that entered English (see: [[List of English words of Portuguese origin]]) such as ''albino'', ''[[baroque]]'', ''mosquito'', ''potato'', ''savvy'' and ''zebra''.

== Historical sound changes ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Portuguese language]] --&gt;
{{unreferencedsection|date=September 2017}}
Both in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and in [[syntax]], Portuguese represents an organic transformation of [[Latin]] without the direct intervention of any foreign language. The sounds, grammatical forms, and syntactical types, with a few exceptions, are derived from Latin, and almost 80% of its vocabulary is still derived from the language of Rome. Some of the changes began during the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], others took place later. A few words remained virtually unchanged, like ''carro'', ''taberna'' ("tavern"), or even returned to a form close to the original, such as ''coxa'' ("thigh") – in this case, however, only the spelling looks identical: Latin ⟨''x''⟩ and Portuguese ⟨''x''⟩ designate two completely different sounds, {{IPA|[ks]}} and {{IPA|[ʃ]}} respectively.

Learned [[Latinism]]s were formed in the late Middle Ages, due to the use of [[Church Latin]] by the [[Catholic Church]], and during the [[Renaissance]], when [[Classical antiquity]] in general, and [[Classical Latin|Literary Latin]] in particular, enjoyed great prestige. Thus, for example, Latin ''aurum'', which had originated ''ouro'' ("gold") and ''dourado'' ("golden"), was re-introduced as the adjective ''áureo'' ("golden"). In the same way, ''locālem'' ("place"), which had evolved to ''lugar'', was later reintroduced as the more erudite ''local''. Many erudite [[Greek language|Greek]] words and combining elements were also introduced or reintroduced in this way. Because of this, many Latin words are still familiar to Portuguese speakers.

The letter ⟨''v''⟩ was the vowel we know today as ⟨''u''⟩, and ⟨''c''⟩ was always pronounced {{IPA|[k]}}, so ''centum'' was originally pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkentũ]}}. Later Latinisms are marked with (L).
===Palatalization===
[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] of voiceless stops—the consonants {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[t]}} assimilated with the high vowels {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[i]}}, and with the semivowel {{IPA|[j]}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} 
* ''centum'' &gt; {{IPA|[tj]}}''ento'' &gt; {{IPA|[ts]}}''ento'' &gt; {{IPA|[s]}}''ento'' (hundred){{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} 
* ''facere'' &gt; ''fa''{{IPA|[tj]}}''ere'' &gt; ''fa''{{IPA|[ts]}}''er'' &gt; ''fa''{{IPA|[dz]}}''er'' &gt; ''fa''{{IPA|[z]}}''er'' (to do)
A more ancient evolution was 
* ''fortiam'' &gt; ''for''{{IPA|[ts]}}''a'' &gt; ''for''{{IPA|[s]}}''a'' (strength)
===Voicing===
[[Phonation|Voicing]]—some consonants did not disappear but rather evolved with voiceless stops becoming voiced stops and voiced stops becoming voiced fricatives in certain positions, a common type of [[Assimilation (linguistics)|sound change]]:

* ''mūtum'' &gt; ''mudo'' (mute)
* ''lacum'' &gt; ''lago'' (lake)
* ''locustam'' &gt; ''lagosta'' (lobster)
===Lenition===
[[Lenition (linguistics)|Lenition]]—consonant clusters, especially long (geminate) consonants, were simplified:
* ''guttam'' &gt; ''gota'' (drop)
* ''quatturo'' &gt; ''quatro'' (four)
* ''peccāre'' &gt; ''pecar'' (to sin)

Phoneme [b] evolved as [v]. The {{IPA|/v/}} phoneme was generally derived either (1) from an allophone of Latin {{IPA|/b/}} between vowels or (2) from the Latin phoneme corresponding to the letter ⟨v⟩ (pronounced {{IPA|[w]}} in Classical Latin, but later [[Fortition|fortified]] to the status of a [[fricative consonant]] in Vulgar Latin). 

*''habēre'' &gt; ''haver''
* ''fabam'' &gt; ''fava'' (broad bean)
*''amābam/amābat'' &gt; ''amava''
*''līber, lībri'' &gt; ''livro''
*''parabola'' &gt; ''palavra''

===Elision===
[[Elision]]—the consonants {{IPA|[l]}} and {{IPA|[n]}} of [[Vulgar Latin]] were deleted between vowels, after which sometimes the vowels around them coalesced, or an epenthetic semivowel was introduced between them. Original geminates {{IPA|[ll]}}, {{IPA|[nn]}} persisted, later becoming single {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[n]}}.
* ''dolōrem'' &gt; ''door'' &gt; ''dor'' (pain); (L) ''doloroso'' (painful)
* ''bonum'' &gt; ''bõo'' &gt; ''bom'' (good)
* ''ānellum'' &gt; ''ãelo'' &gt; ''elo'' (bond); (L) ''anel'' (ring)
* ''salīre'' &gt; ''sair'' (to get out)
* ''cōlāre'' &gt; ''coar'' (sift)
* ''notulam'' &gt; ''nódoa'' (stain)
* ''catēnam'' &gt; ''cadeia'' (jail, chain); (L) ''cadena'' (jail, chain) (more erudite)

===Palatalization===
[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] of liquids and nasals—the consonants {{IPA|[l]}} and {{IPA|[n]}} assimilated with the semivowel {{IPA|[j]}}, producing the palatals ''lh'' {{IPA|[ʎ]}} and ''nh'' {{IPA|[ɲ]}}: 
* ''mulierem'' &gt; ''mulher'' (woman)
* ''iūnium'' &gt; ''junho'' (June)

===Nasalization===
In medieval [[Galician-Portuguese]], {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} between vowels or at the end of a syllable became the velar nasal phoneme {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, leading to regressive nasalization of the preceding vowel as a secondary phonetic effect.&lt;ref name="jmms"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ruc.udc.es/dspace/handle/2183/2595|title=Existe rima de vogal aberta com vogal fechada na poesia trovadoresca galego-portuguesa|first=José Martinho|last=Montero Santalha|year=2002|journal=Revista Galega de Filoloxía|volume=3|pages=107-143|issn=1576-2661|publisher=Universidade da Coruña}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consonant was then at a later stage lost or modified in Portuguese, although it was retained in [[Galician language|Galician]] in some words (e.g. modern ''unha'' ({{IPA|/uŋa/}}) identical in pronunciation to medieval ''hũa'').

This change produced one of the most striking phonological differences between Portuguese and Spanish. The history of nasal vowels in hiatus with a previous or following vowel is complex, depending on the identity of the two vowels and the position of the stress.

1. If the vowels were near each other, they collapsed into a single vowel (nasal or oral, according to the nasality of the stressed vowel):
* ''bonum'' &gt; ''bõo'' &gt; ''bom'' (good ''masc.'')
* ''calentem'' &gt; ''caẽte'' &gt; ''quente'' (hot)
* ''ganātum'' &gt; ''gãado'' &gt; ''gado'' (cattle)
* ''lānam'' &gt; ''lãa'' &gt; ''lã'' (wool)

2. Otherwise, if the second vowel was more closed, the result was usually a nasal diphthong:
* ''manum'' &gt; ''mão'' (hand)
* ''canem'' &gt; ''cães'' (dogs)

3. If the second vowel was more open, or as open, nasalization was lost:
* ''lūnam'' &gt; ''lũa'' &gt; ''lua'' (moon). Exception: ''ūnam'' &gt; ''ũa'' &gt; ''uma'' (one)
* ''bonam'' &gt; ''bõa'' &gt; ''boa'' (good ''fem.'')
* ''plēnum'' &gt; ''chẽo'' &gt; ''cheio'' (full); (L) ''pleno'' (full)

4. If the first vowel was {{IPA|[i]}}, however, nasalization evolved to a [[palatal nasal]] consonant, inserted between the two vowels:
* ''vīnum'' &gt; ''vĩo'' &gt; ''vinho'' (wine)
* ''rēgīnam'' &gt; ''*ragina'' &gt; ''raĩa'' &gt; rainha (queen)

Progressive [[nasalization]]—The spread of nasalization forward from a nasal consonant, especially {{IPA|[m]}}. 
* ''mātrem'' &gt; ''made'' &gt; ''mai'' &gt; ''mãe'' (mother)
* ''meam'' &gt; ''mia'' &gt; ''mĩa'' &gt; ''minha'' (my ''fem.''); but compare ''meum'' &gt; ''meu'' (my ''masc.'')
* ''ad noctem'' &gt; ''anoite'' &gt; ''ãote'' &gt; ''ontem'' {{IPA|[ˈõtẽĩ]}} (yesterday).

===Epenthesis===
[[Epenthesis]]—the insertion of a sound to break up a combination of vowels which was difficult to pronounce: 
* ''harēnam'' &gt; ''arẽa'' &gt; ''areia'' (sand); (L) ''arena'' (arena)
* ''gallīnam'' &gt; ''galĩa'' &gt; ''galinha'' (chicken)
* ''vīnum'' &gt; ''vĩo'' &gt; ''vinho'' (wine)

Examples such as the former two have been used by some authors to argue that the digraph ''nh'' was a nasal approximant in medieval Portuguese, and thus its pronunciation {{IPA|[j̃]}} in most dialects of Brazil and São Tomé and Príncipe is the original one.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Mattos e Silva, ''O Português arcaico – fonologia'', Contexto, 1991, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissimilation===
[[Dissimilation]]—Modification of a sound by the influence of neighbouring sounds; similar became different over time, so as to ease pronunciation.

1. Between vowels:
* ''locustam'' &gt; ''lagosta'' (lobster)
* ''campanam'' &gt; ''campãa'' &gt; ''campa'' (tomb)

2. Between consonants:
* ''memorāre'' &gt; ''nembrar'' &gt; ''lembrar'' (to remember); (L) ''memorizar'' (to memorize)
* ''animam'' &gt; ''alma'' (soul); (L) ''animado'' (animated)
* ''locālem'' &gt; ''logar'' &gt; ''lugar''; (L) ''local'' (place)

===Metathesis===
[[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]]—a sound change that alters the order of phonemes in a word. 
Semi-vowel metathesis: 
* ''prīmārium'' &gt; ''primeiro'' (first); (L) ''primário'' (primary)
Consonant metathesis in {{IPA|[l]}} and {{IPA|[ɾ]}}: 
* ''tenebrās'' &gt; ''tẽevras'' &gt; ''trevas'' (darkness); this was rare in Portuguese; (L) ''tenebroso'' (dark)
Vowel metathesis: 
* ''genuculum'' &gt; ''*genoclo'' &gt; ''gẽolho'' &gt; ''joelho'' (knee)

===Medieval sound changes===
{{unreferenced|date=September 2017}}
[[Old Portuguese]] had seven sibilants: [[lamino-alveolar]] affricates {{IPA|/ts/}} (⟨''c''⟩ before ⟨''e/i''⟩, ⟨''ç''⟩ elsewhere) and {{IPA|/dz/}} (⟨''z''⟩); [[apico-alveolar]] fricatives {{IPA|/s/}} (⟨''s''⟩, or ⟨''ss''⟩ between vowels) and {{IPA|/z/}} (⟨''s''⟩ between vowels); [[palato-alveolar]] fricatives {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (⟨''x''⟩) and {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, earlier {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (⟨''j''⟩, also ⟨''g''⟩ before ⟨''e/i''⟩); and [[palato-alveolar]] affricate {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (⟨''ch''⟩). This system was identical to the system of [[Old Spanish]], and Portuguese followed the same path as Old Spanish in deaffricating the sibilants {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/dz/}} into lamino-alveolar fricatives that still remained distinct from the apico-alveolar consonants. This produced a system of six fricatives and one affricate, which is still maintained in small parts of northeast Portuguese province of [[Trás-os-Montes Province|Trás-os-Montes]] and in the adjacent [[Mirandese language]]; but in most places, these seven sounds have been reduced to four.

Everywhere except in the above-mentioned parts of Trás-os-Montes, the lamino-alveolar and apico-alveolar fricatives merged. (This appears to have happened no earlier than the seventeenth century, on the evidence of the spelling system used by [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] to represent [[Middle Vietnamese]]). In northern Portugal and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], they became apico-alveolars (as in the central and northern peninsular Spanish pronunciation of {{IPA|/s/}}). In most of Brazil, they became lamino-alveolar consonants (as in the English pronunciation of {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}). In central and southern Portugal (and in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and surrounding areas, due to the relocation of the Portuguese nobility in the early 1800s), they merged as lamino-alveolars before vowels, but as palato-alveolar {{IPA|/ʃ ʒ/}} elsewhere. Meanwhile, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} eventually lost its affrication and merged with {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, although {{IPA|/tʃ/}} is maintained throughout Trás-os-Montes.

It appears that the sound written ⟨''v''⟩ was at one point during the medieval period pronounced as a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[β]}}. Subsequently, it either changed into a labiodental fricative {{IPA|[v]}} (as in central and southern Portugal, and hence in Brazil), or merged into {{IPA|/b/}} (as in northern Portugal and Galicia, similarly to modern Spanish). Also similarly to modern Spanish, the voiced stops {{IPA|/b d ɡ/}} eventually became pronounced as fricatives {{IPA|[β ð ɣ]}} between vowels and after consonants, other than in the clusters {{IPA|/nd/ /ld/ /nɡ/ /mb/}} (the nasals were presumably still pronounced in these clusters, rather than simply reflected as a nasal vowel). However, this change happened after the colonization of Brazil, and never affected [[Brazilian Portuguese]].

Final unstressed {{IPA|/a/}} was subsequently raised to {{IPA|/ɐ/}}. Final {{IPA|/o/}} was eventually raised to {{IPA|/u/}} in both Portugal and Brazil, but independently. Final unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} was likewise raised to {{IPA|/i/}} in Brazil, but shifted to {{IPA|/ɨ/}} in Portugal (now barely pronounced). In Portugal (but not in Brazil), these changes have come to affect almost all unstressed instances of {{IPA|/a/ /o/ /e/}}; but not {{IPA|/ou/}} (which now appears as {{IPA|/o/}}), nor the former sequences {{IPA|/aa/}} {{IPA|/ee/}} {{IPA|/oo/}} (which now appear as {{IPA|/a/ /ɛ/ /ɔ/}} respectively), nor in syllables closed by stop consonants (e.g. in ''secção'' "section", ''optar'' "to choose"). Hence in Portugal ''pesar'' "to weigh" {{IPA|/pɨzaɾ/}} but ''pregar'' "to preach" {{IPA|/prɛɡaɾ/}} (former ''preegar'' &lt; ''praedicāre''); ''morar'' "to live" {{IPA|/muɾaɾ/}}, but ''corado'' "blushing" {{IPA|/kɔɾadu/}} (former ''coorado'' &lt; ''colōrātum''), ''roubar'' "to rob" {{IPA|/ʁobaɾ/}}. (In Brazil these appear as {{IPA|/pezax/, /preɡax/, /moɾax/, /koɾadu/, /xo(u)bax/}}.) Recently in Rio de Janeiro (and rapidly spreading to other parts of Brazil), {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} have been affricated to {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} before {{IPA|/i/}}, including {{IPA|/i/}} from unstressed {{IPA|/e/}}.

Old Portuguese had a large number of occurrences of hiatus (two vowels next to each other with no consonant in between), as a result of the loss of Latin {{IPA|/l n d ɡ/}} between vowels. In the transition to modern Portuguese, these were resolved in a complex but largely regular fashion, either remaining, compressing into a single vowel, turning into a diphthong, or gaining an epenthetic consonant such as {{IPA|/v/}} or {{IPA|/ɲ/}}; see above.

Portuguese traditionally had two alveolar rhotic consonants, a flap {{IPA|/ɾ/}} and trill {{IPA|/r/}}, as in Spanish. In most areas of Portugal the trill {{IPA|/r/}} has passed into a uvular fricative {{IPA|/ʁ/}}. In most parts of Brazil, however, {{IPA|/r/}} has become an ''unvoiced'' fricative {{IPA|/x/}} (variously {{IPA|[x χ h]}}), and all instances of {{IPA|/ɾ/}} not preceding a vowel have been likewise affected. (When final, this sound is sometimes not pronounced at all.)

{{IPA|/l/}} at the end of a syllable became heavily [[velarized]] {{IPA|/ɫ/}} in Portuguese. This still remains in Portugal, but in Brazil has progressed further, merging into {{IPA|/w/}}.

The ethos of the Book Fair was "to mark the new and expanding phase in the growth of radical ideas and concepts, and their expression in literature, politics, music, art and social life."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Enisuoh, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VfdpdZ9DwH0C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=%22international+book+fair+of+radical+black+and+third+world+books%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n9EUr7mK5J&amp;sig=sF6-qZHeUYlmbSbOkykK-qjuSbE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwB2oVChMIudDj_ZWYyAIVQT8aCh0JQAl1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22international%20book%20fair%20of%20radical%20black%20and%20third%20world%20books%22&amp;f=false "International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books"], in [[Alison Donnell]], ''Companion to Contemporary Black British Culture'', Routledge, 2002, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea for an annual book fair was mooted in discussions after an event at the [[Commonwealth Institute]] in 1979 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding by [[Jessica Huntley (publisher)|Jessica Huntley]] and Eric Huntley of [[Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications]]; described as a "cultural extravaganza", it featured a variety of performers, poets, drummers, dancers and musicians, including [[Misty in Roots]], [[Keith Waithe]], [[Cecil Rajendra]], [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]] and others. Its success demonstrated "the potential for an event on this scale taking place in different parts of London and the UK on a regular basis", and the suggestion of an annual book fair was later developed and eventually implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Andrews, ''Doing Nothing is Not An Option: The Radical Lives of Eric &amp; Jessica Huntley'', Middlesex, England: Krik Krak, 2014, pp. 141–142. {{ISBN|978-1-908415-02-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Bunce and Paul Field, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t_0pBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=international+book+fair+of+radical+black+and+third+world+books+april&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hMlp3CIaz7&amp;sig=M3uflsKBxvNfTrNHSGq9GB4XgOE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CJABEOgBMBdqFQoTCPDe-9LUmcgCFUg4GgodvtMOZw#v=onepage&amp;q=international%20book%20fair%20of%20radical%20black%20and%20third%20world%20books%20april&amp;f=false ''Darcus Howe: A Political Biography''], [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], 2015, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books was established by [[Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications]], [[New Beacon Books]] and the [[Race Today]] collective in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Heiba Lamara, [http://www.racecard.org.uk/history/deep-roots-a-story-of-black-british-publishing/ "Deep Roots – a story of Black British Publishing"], Racecard, 10 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of being a "meeting of the continents for writers, publishers, distributors, booksellers, artists, musicians, film makers, and the people who inspire and consume their creative productions".&lt;ref name=Meeting /&gt; The joint directors were [[John La Rose]] and Jessica Huntley until 1984, after which La Rose continued as sole director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgepadmoreinstitute.org/John%20La%20Rose "John La Rose"], George Padmore Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linton Kwesi Johnson, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/04/guardianobituaries.socialexclusion "John La Rose" (obituary)], ''The Guardian'', 4 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Book Fair was opened at [[Islington Town Hall]] on Thursday, 1 April 1982, by [[C. L. R. James]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent years saw other literary figures make the opening address, including [[Edward Kamau Brathwaite]] (1984),&lt;ref&gt;''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wole Soyinka]] (1985),&lt;ref&gt;"The Nkomati Years", in ''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] (1987),&lt;ref&gt;''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, pp. 277, 302–03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wml93dC12FQC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22international+book+fair+of+radical+black+and+third+world+books%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ilWmTMc5nC&amp;sig=ocSalO3hRI934LT2M3liXGK2kBA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwDGoVChMIrqCOy9WZyAIVxQgaCh1a_g03#v=onepage&amp;q=%22international%20book%20fair%20of%20radical%20black%20and%20third%20world%20books%22&amp;f=false ''Moving the Centre: The Struggle for Cultural Freedoms''], James Currey Publishers, 1993, pp. 109, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdul Alkalimat]] (1988),&lt;ref&gt;''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, pp. 340–341.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farrukh Dhondy]] (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Farrukh Dhondy, "A Satanic Sermon", in ''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, pp. 384–387.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jayne Cortez]] (1990),&lt;ref&gt;"Opening Address given by Jayne Cortez at the 9th International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books, at the Camden Centre on Thursday March 22nd 1990", ''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, pp. 421–422.&lt;/ref&gt; John La Rose (1991),&lt;ref&gt;''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, pp. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Busby]] (1993),&lt;ref&gt;"Address of Margaret Busby to the opening of the 11th International Book Fair on Thursday March 25th 1993", ''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, pp. 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pearl Connor]] (1995).&lt;ref&gt;"Pearl Connor-Mogotsi", ''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Book Fair week in 1982 was attended by some 6,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Alleyne, [http://humanhacker.net/?p=81 "Remembering Jhohn La Rose (1927–2006)"], Human Hacker, 7 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Topics covered in the forums included a discussion in 1982, with Jessica Huntley as presenter, on "Racist and fascist attacks on Black, left-wing and community booksellers and other institutions in Britain",&lt;ref&gt;"Programme of Events", ''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; or, in 1984, a forum entitled "Migrant Struggles in Britain and Europe", chaired by [[Darcus Howe]].&lt;ref name=Thomas /&gt;

Those who attended the Book Fair came from the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Central America, the US, as well as the UK and other parts of Europe, not only to exhibit, order and distribute books but to take part in the accompanying programme of events that, alongside political discussion, showcased different cultural presentations including poetry and prose readings, drama, music and film.&lt;ref name=Catalogue /&gt; The many notable participants over the years included [[John Agard]], [[Ama Ata Aidoo]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[May Ayim]], [[Imruh Bakari]], [[Biyi Bandele]], [[Amiri Baraka]], [[James Berry (poet)|James Berry]], [[Valerie Bloom]], [[Jean Binta Breeze]], [[Yvonne Brewster]], [[Dennis Brutus]], [[Robert Chrisman]], [[Merle Collins]], [[Carolyn Cooper]], [[Fred D'Aguiar]], [[Melvin Edwards]], [[Nuruddin Farah]], [[Edouard Glissant]], [[Lorna Goodison]], [[Roy A.

In February 1997, a decision was taken by the Director and the Organising Committee of the Book Fair not to continue with it in its then form, proposing instead other future events in the Book Fair tradition, including the development of the [[George Padmore Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;"Statement: The International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books", ''A Meeting of the Continents'', 2005, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9695">{{Periods in English History}}
The '''Interregnum'''  was the period between the [[execution of Charles I]] on 30 January 1649 and the arrival of his son [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in London on 29 May 1660 which marked the start of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. During the Interregnum England was under various forms of republican government (see [[Commonwealth of England]]; this article describes other facets of the Interregnum).

==Politics==
{{main|Commonwealth of England}}
The politics of the period were dominated by the wishes of the ''[[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s'' (Senior Officers) of the [[New Model Army]] and their civilian supporters. They encouraged (or at least tolerated) several republican regimes.

From 1649 until 1653 executive powers lay with [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]], while legislative functions were carried out by the [[Rump Parliament]].

In 1653 the Grandees, with [[Oliver Cromwell]] in the lead, dismissed the Rump, and replaced it with a Nominated Assembly (nicknamed the Parliament of Saints and [[Barebone's Parliament]]) made up of 140 nominees, 129 from England, five from Scotland and six from Ireland. It proved to be as difficult for the executive to work with this parliament as it had with the Rump, so, after sitting for five months, members friendly to the Grandees engendered its dissolution on 12 December 1653.

The ''[[Instrument of Government]]'' was adopted on 15 December 1653 and the pre-eminent ''Grandee'' [[Oliver Cromwell]] was installed as [[Lord Protector]] on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/240140/Instrument-of-Government|title=Instrument of Government|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Instrument of Government'' granted [[executive power]] to the [[Lord Protector]]. Although this post was elective, not hereditary, it was to be held for life. It also required the calling of triennial [[Parliament]]s, with each sitting for at least five months.

In January 1655, Cromwell dissolved the [[first Protectorate Parliament]], ushering in a period of [[Military dictatorship|military rule]] by the [[Rule of the Major-Generals|Major Generals]].

The ''Instrument of Government'' was replaced in May 1657 by England's second, and last, codified [[constitution]], the [[Humble Petition and Advice]]. However Oliver Cromwell died the next year and  his nominated successor as Lord Protector, his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]], proved unable to govern effectively as various political parties strove to gain power.

[[The Protectorate]] came to an end in May 1659 when the Grandees recalled the Rump Parliament, which authorised a [[Committee of Safety (England)|Committee of Safety]] to replace Richard's [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]]. This ushered in a period of unstable government, which did not come to an end until February 1660 when General [[George Monck]], the English military governor of Scotland, marched to London at the head of his troops, and oversaw the [[Restoration (England)|restoration of the monarchy]] under Charles II.

==Life during the Interregnum==
After the Parliamentarian victory in the Civil War, the [[Puritan]] views of the majority of Parliament and its supporters began to be imposed on the rest of the country. The Puritans advocated an austere lifestyle and restricted what they saw as the excesses of the previous regime. Most prominently, holidays such as Christmas and Easter were suppressed.{{sfn|Durston|1985}} Pastimes such as the theatre and gambling were also banned. However, some forms of art that were thought to be "virtuous", such as opera, were encouraged. These changes are often credited to [[Oliver Cromwell]], though they were introduced by the Commonwealth Parliament; and Cromwell, when he came to power, was a liberalising influence.&lt;ref&gt;''Cromwell, Our Chief of Men'' by [[Lady Antonia Fraser]], {{ISBN|0-7538-1331-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jews in England==
{{Main|Resettlement of the Jews in England}}

[[Rabbi]] [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] met Oliver Cromwell in 1655 in order to discuss the admission of Jews into England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olivercromwell.org/jews.htm "Cromwell and the Jews"], The Oliver Cromwell Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell did not agree to all the rights that Ben Israel requested, but the opening of Jewish [[synagogues]] and [[burial ground]]s was tolerated under Cromwell's Protectorate. The Jewish faith was still not practised openly in England, since Cromwell's move had been controversial and many in England were still hostile toward Jews. Life for [[Jews in England]] improved in that they could no longer be [[prosecute]]d if caught worshipping, yet [[discrimination]] continued.

== Radicals vs conservatives ==
Parliament had, to a large degree, encouraged the radical political groups which emerged when the usual social controls broke down during the [[English Civil War]]. It had also unwittingly established a new political force when it set up the [[New Model Army]]. Not surprisingly, all these groups had their own hopes for the new Commonwealth.

=== Levellers ===
Led by [[John Lilburne]], [[Levellers]] drew their main support from London and the Army. In the [[Agreement of the People]], 1649, they asked for a more representative and accountable parliament, to meet every two years; a reform of law so it would be available to and fair to all; and religious toleration. They wanted a more [[democracy|democratic]] society, although their proposed franchise did not extend to women or to the lowest orders of society.

Levellers saw the Rump as little better than the monarchy it had replaced, and they showed their displeasure in demonstrations, pamphlets and mutinies. While their numbers did not pose a serious threat to the government, they scared the Rump into action and a [[Treasons Act 1649|Treasons Act]] was passed against them in 1649.

=== Diggers ===
Led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]], [[Diggers]] wanted an even more equal society than the Levellers. They advocated a lifestyle that bore many similarities to later understandings of [[communism]] and [[anarchism]], with communal ownership of land, and absolute equality for males and females in law and education. They existed in only very small numbers and faced a very strong opposition, even from the Levellers.

=== Religious sects ===
{{see also|Religion during the Interregnum}}

The breakdown of religious uniformity and incomplete [[Presbyterian]] Settlement of 1646 enabled independent churches to flourish. The main sects (''see also [[English Dissenters]]'') were [[Baptists]], who advocated adult re[[baptism]]; [[Ranters]], who claimed that sin did not exist for the "chosen ones"; and [[Fifth Monarchy Men]], who opposed all "earthly" governments, believing they must prepare for God's kingdom on earth by establishing a "government of saints".

Despite greater toleration, extreme sects were opposed by the upper classes as they were seen as a threat to social order and property rights.
[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] were also excluded from the toleration applied to the other groups.

=== Conservatives ===
Conservatives were still dominant in both [[central government]] and [[local government]]. In the former, the Rump was anxious not to offend the traditional ruling class whose support it needed for survival, so it opposed radical ideas. In the latter, that ruling class dominated through the influence of traditional regional gentry.

==Historical analysis==
The Interregnum was a relatively short but important period in the history of the British Isles. It saw a number of political experiments without any stable form of government emerging, largely due to the wide diversity in religious and political groups that had been allowed to flourish after the regicide of Charles I.

The [[Puritan]] movement had evolved as a rejection of both real and perceived "Catholicisation" of the [[Church of England]].  When the Church of England was quickly [[Established church#Disestablishment|disestablished]] by the Commonwealth Government, the question of what church to establish became a hotly debated subject. In the end, it was impossible to make all the political factions happy. During the Interregnum, Oliver Cromwell lost much of the support he had gained during the Civil War. [[Edward Sexby]], previously a supporter of Cromwell's, felt disenfranchised by Cromwell's failure to abolish the [[aristocracy]]. In 1657, [[Silius Titus]] called for Cromwell's assassination in a co-authored pamphlet ''[[Killing No Murder]]'' under the pseudonym of William Allen. Sexby was captured when he returned to England and attempted to carry out the assassination described in Colonel Titus' book. Cromwell coerced Sexby into confessing authorship of the pamphlet and then imprisoned him in the [[Tower of London]], where Sexby was driven to insanity, dying there less than a year later.

High taxes required by the large [[standing army]], kept due to the constant threats of Scottish and Irish rebellion, added to public resentment of Cromwell.

The '''Jordan Archaeological Museum''' is located in the [[Amman Citadel]] of [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]. Built in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitjordan.com/default.aspx?tabid=113 Visit Jordan information].&lt;/ref&gt; it presents artifacts from [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites in Jordan, dating from prehistoric times to the 15th century. The collections are arranged in chronological order and include items of everyday life such as flint, glass, metal and pottery objects, as well as more artistic items such as jewelry and statues. The museum also includes a coin collection.

The museum formerly housed some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], including the only [[copper scroll]], which are now on display in the newly established [[The Jordan Museum|Jordan Museum]], along with the [[Ain Ghazal]] statues, which are among the oldest statues ever made by human civilization..&lt;ref&gt;[http://jordanmuseum.jo/en].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum was established in 1951 on top of the [[Amman Citadel]] in the heart of [[Amman]]. Another branch of the museum was established in [[East Jerusalem]] which was under Jordanian rule prior to the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}  Once [[Israeli-occupied territories|East Jerusalem fell to Israel]] in 1967, the museum lost all of its collection in the Jerusalem branch including most of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

==Location==
[[File:Amman BW 2.JPG|thumb|left|ruins of the Roman Temple of Hercules on Citadel Hill]]
The museum is located in the [[Amman Citadel]] in [[Amman]], one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world.  Two historic sites are nearby on top of the hill, the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Temple of [[Hercules]] that dates back to the 2nd century, and an [[Umayyad]] palace that dates back to the 8th century. Prior to 1967, the museum had a branch in [[East Jerusalem]].

[[File:Amman BW 10.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Dead Sea]] Scrolls]]

[[File:La Marine-Pacini-140.png|thumb|A French squadron forming the line of battle circa 1840. Drawing by [[Antoine Morel-Fatio]].]]
[[File:Nicholas Pocock - The Battle of Copenhagen, 2 April 1801.jpg|thumb|British and Danish ships in line of battle at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)]]]]

In [[naval warfare]], the '''line of battle''' is a [[Military tactic|tactic]] in which a [[naval fleet]] of ships forms a line end to end.  Its first use is [[#Development|disputed]], variously claimed for dates ranging from 1502 to 1652, with line-of-battle tactics in widespread use by 1675.

Compared with prior naval tactics, in which two opposing ships closed on one another for individual combat, the line of battle has the advantage that each ship in the line can fire its [[broadside]] without fear of hitting a friendly ship. Therefore, in a given period, the fleet can fire more shots.

Another advantage is that a relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concentration of fire on that part. The other fleet can avoid this by maneuvering in a line itself, with a result typical for sea battle since 1675: two fleets sail alongside one another or on the opposite [[Tack (sailing)#Position|tack]].

A ship powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be called a '''[[ship of the line]]''' (of battle) or '''line of battle ship''', which was shortened to become the word ''[[battleship]]''.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"battleship" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 4 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Slag bij Öland - Battle of Öland in 1676 (Romeyn de Hooghe).jpg|thumb|right|A contemporary depiction of the [[battle of Öland]] between an allied Danish-Dutch fleet under [[Cornelis Tromp]] and the Swedish navy. The Swedish ships are arranged in a battle line in the early stages, but they quickly become disorganized and suffer a humiliating defeat. Copper engraving by [[Romeyn de Hooghe]], 1676.]]

The first recorded mention of the use of a line of battle tactic is attested from 1500. The ''Instructions'' provided in 1500 by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean suggests its use predated the written instructions. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, ''The Art of War at Sea'', Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, [[Fernão de Oliveira]], recognized that at sea, the Portuguese "fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses...". He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pt/books?id=yqNj5BlEMtcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=galleons+portuguese+armada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_Y4EvmGkAB&amp;sig=lpdYoeNfaTJA69Jf1vKyX6QKRM8&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iIEtVZylGOKR7Aa22IHACQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=galleons%20portuguese%20armada&amp;f=false] ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of Warfare: The Triumph of the West'' - Geoffrey Parker, pp. 125-130, Cambridge University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

A line-of-battle tactic had been used by the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|Fourth Portuguese India Armada]] in the [[Battle of Calicut (1502)|Battle of Calicut]], under [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1502, near [[Zamorin|Malabar]] against a Muslim fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, ''The Military Revolution'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest recorded deliberate use is also documented in the [[First Battle of Cannanore]] between the [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|Third Portuguese India Armada]] under [[João da Nova]] and the naval forces of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], earlier in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Marinha.pt, 2009, ''[http://www.marinha.pt/pt/amarinha/historia/combatesnavais/pages/cananor31dedezembrode1501a2dejaneirode1502.aspx site Cananor - 31 de Dezembro de 1501 a 2 de Janeiro de 1502]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another early, but different form of this strategy, was used in 1507 by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] at the entrance to the [[Persian Gulf]], in the first [[Capture of Ormuz (1507)|conquest of Ormuz]]. Albuquerque commanded a fleet of six carracks manned by 460 men, and entered Ormuz Bay, being surrounded by 250 warships and a 20.000 men army on land, Albuquerque made his small fleet (but powerful in its artillery) circle like a carrousel, but in a line end-to-end, and destroyed most of the ships that surrounded his squad. He then proceeded to capture Ormuz.

While it is well documented  that [[Maarten Tromp]] first used it in the [[Action of 18 September 1639]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Prud’homme van Reine, ''Schittering en Schandaal. Dubbelbiografie van Maerten en  Cornelis Tromp', 2001, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; some have disputed this.&lt;ref name=gutenburg16695 /&gt; One of the first precise written instructions in any language adopting the formation were contained in the English Navy's Fighting Instructions, written by Admiral [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] and published in 1653.&lt;ref name=gutenburg16695&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16695 Fighting Instructions, 1530-1816] Sir Julian Stafford Corbett, Publications Of The Navy Records Society Vol. XXIX.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual captains on both sides of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] appear to have experimented with the technique in 1652, possibly including Blake at the [[Battle of Goodwin Sands]].&lt;ref name=gutenburg16695 /&gt;

From the mid-16th century the [[cannon]] gradually became the most important weapon in naval warfare, replacing boarding actions as the decisive factor in combat. At the same time, the natural tendency in the design of [[galleon]]s was for longer ships with lower castles, which meant faster, more stable vessels. These newer warships could mount more cannons along the sides of their decks, concentrating their firepower along their broadside.

Until the mid-17th century, the tactics of a fleet were often to "charge" the enemy, firing [[chase gun|bow chaser]] cannon, which did not deploy the broadside to its best effect. These new vessels required new tactics, and "since&amp;nbsp;... almost all the artillery is found upon the sides of a ship of war, hence it is the beam that must necessarily and always be turned toward the enemy. On the other hand, it is necessary that the sight of the latter must never be interrupted by a friendly ship. Only one formation allows the ships of the same fleet to satisfy fully these conditions. That formation is the line ahead [column]. This line, therefore, is imposed as the only order of battle, and consequently as the basis of all fleet tactics."&lt;ref&gt;Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660–1783'', pp. 115–116, quoting Chabaud-Arnault&lt;/ref&gt;

The line-of-battle tactic favored very large ships that could sail steadily and maintain their place in the line in the face of heavy fire. The change toward the line of battle also depended on an increased disciplining of society and the demands of powerful centralized government to keep permanent fleets led by a corps of professional officers. These officers were better able to manage and communicate between the ships they commanded than the merchant crews that often comprised large parts of a navy's force. The new type of warfare that developed during the [[early modern period]] was marked by a successively stricter organization. Battle formations became standardized, based on mathematically calculated ideal models. The increased power of states at the expense of individual landowners led to increasingly larger armies and navies.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (1993), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective use==
The line of battle was marked by tactical ridigity and often resulted in indecisive engagements. Fleet commanders sometimes met with greater success by altering or abandoning the line of battle outright by breaking the enemy line and moving through it (e.g. [[Four Days Battle]], [[Battle of Schooneveld]], [[Battle of Trafalgar]]), by trying to cut off and isolate part of the enemy's line while concentrating a stronger force on it (e.g. [[Battle of Texel]], [[Battle of the Saintes]]), or by trying to "double up" the enemy's ships (e.g. [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Battle of Beachy Head]]). 

==Weaknesses==
The main problem with the line of battle was that when the fleets are of similar size, naval actions using it were generally indecisive. The French in particular were adept at gunnery and would generally take the [[leeward]] position to enable their fleet to retire downwind while continuing to fire [[chain-shot]] at long range to bring down masts. Eventually so many vessels in a line would be damaged that they would be forced to retire for repairs while the French took few casualties and very little damage themselves. 

==Doubling==
If the opposing fleets were of similar size, a portion of the line might be overwhelmed by focused gunfire of the entire enemy line by '''doubling'''. Ships breaking through the enemy line would act in concert with others remaining on the original side to simultaneously engage both sides of a portion of the enemy fleet while the broadsides of the remainder of the enemy line were unable to engage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keegan |first=John |authorlink =John Keegan |title =The Price of Admiralty |publisher =Viking |volume = |edition = |date =1989 |location =New York |page =277 |isbn =0-670-81416-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age of steam==

For a period in the late 19th century, naval tactics became chaotic as [[ironclad warship]]s were introduced. One school of thought held that ironclads were effectively invulnerable to gunfire, so ramming became a popular method of attack, such as at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] and the [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)|Battle of the Yalu River]]. Another held that naval battles would only be decided by an assault on an enemy fleet in port. Ships built according to these doctrines tended to mount a handful of guns which could fire ahead or all-round, rather than broadside. The fleets of these periods tended to use the line of battle less.

However, as ramming fell out of fashion, the logic of the line of battle returned; used in the [[Battle of Tsushima]] of 1905, the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 and finally in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] in 1944.

During World War II the development of [[aircraft carrier]]s meant that gun engagements were no longer decisive. This meant there was no rationale for using a line-of-battle formation. In modern naval warfare, a [[Carrier battle group|battlegroup]] generally deploys with the highest-value units in the centre, accompanied closely by anti-aircraft escorts, with a number of anti-submarine escorts surrounding the formation at a distance of tens of miles.

Vanderkindere was born in [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek]] into a wealthy middle-class family. His father, Albert Vanderkindere, was a [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal]] politician. Albert had been a member of the provincial assembly of the [[province of Brabant]] from 1844 to 1850 and from 1854 to his death in 1859, and was mayor of Molenbeek from 1842 to 1848, and then of [[Ukkel]], where the family moved, from 1854.

Léon Vanderkindere was a professor at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]], a member of the [[Royal Academy (Belgium)|Royal Academy]]. Like his father he was active in Liberal politics and served as mayor of Ukkel from 1900 until his death in 1906. A square and a street in Ukkel are named for him.

'''Mary Daggett Lake''' (1880-1955) was an American historian, botanist, and educator instrumental in documenting early North Texas settlers and promoting the appreciation and use of native Texas plants. A [[Fort Worth, Texas]] civic leader, she led the [[garden club]] movement in Texas, wrote numerous columns for state and local newspapers, and was instrumental in the creation of the [[Fort Worth Botanic Garden]], the oldest [[botanical garden]] in Texas.

== Early life ==
Mary Sabina Daggett was born November 11, 1880 in Fort Worth, Texas to Ephraim Merrill "Bud" and Laura Alice Palmer Daggett.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mary Daggett Lake: Fort Worth History from Its Beginnings|last=Quevreaux|first=Anne|publisher=[The author]|year=1997|isbn=|location=Fort Worth, Tex.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's father, a cowboy and trail driver-turned-cattleman,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Trail drivers of Texas : interesting sketches of early cowboys and their experiences on the range and on the trail during the days that tried men's souls, true narratives related by real cowpunchers and men who fathered the cattle industry in Texas|last=Hunter|first=J.

== Local historian ==
A dedicated genealogist, Mary Daggett Lake was a member of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] and [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]]. She conducted extensive research into the history of North Texas, especially Fort Worth and the nearby settlements of Bird's Fort, [[Grapevine, Texas|Grapevine Springs]], [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], and [[Fort Belknap (Texas)|Fort Belknap]]. She wrote a series of articles on [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]]'s first settlers, based on interviews and written accounts from surviving family members, which ran in the [[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] from 1926 to 1938.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was also the historical research chairman of the 1936 [[Texas Centennial Exposition|Texas Centennial]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mary Daggett Lake was a charter member of [[The Woman's Club of Fort Worth]] establishing its Texana library in 1932.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Woman's Club of Fort Worth, 1923-1973|last=Mullins|first=Marion Day|publisher=|year=1973|isbn=|location=|pages=|oclc=1160192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botanist and educator ==
Mary Daggett Lake studied botany at Cottey College and worked for twelve years in the private [[herbarium]] of Dr. Albert Ruth,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which is now part of the [[Botanical Research Institute of Texas]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brit.org/acquisitions|title=Growth of the BRIT Herbarium Collections|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a charter member of the Fort Worth Garden Club, an officer in the National Council of State Garden Club Federations, and elected president of the Texas Federation of Garden Clubs in 1938. She was a 28-year member of the Fort Worth Park Board and editor of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram's gardening page from 1937 to 1955.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With Eula Whitehouse, she co-wrote the "Wildflowers of Texas" column in the Texas Almanac.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From 1933-1955, Mary Daggett Lake was the educational director of the Garden Center of Fort Worth, now called the Fort Worth Botanic Garden, providing gardening and nature instruction for children and adults.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She organized conferences at state colleges and universities on [[soil conservation]] and the benefits of [[Native plant gardening|native plants]] before [[World War II]]; during wartime she promoted [[Victory garden|gardening as a patriotic duty]] and the propagation of native fruit- and nut-bearing plants to bolster the limited food supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1996, the Fort Worth Garden Club library was renamed the Mary Daggett Lake Library,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and a [[Texas Historical Marker]] in her honor was placed at the Fort Worth Botanic Garden in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1AN9_Mary_Daggett_Lake|title=Texas Historical Marker: Mary Daggett Lake|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other publications ==
In 1926, Mary Daggett Lake wrote ''The'' ''Legend of the [[Bluebonnet (plant)|Bluebonnet]]'', a short book on the [[folklore]] of the [[state flower]] of Texas. She also wrote ''Have You Ever Been to Texas in the Spring''?, the official song of the Texas Federation of Garden Clubs, and ''Pioneer Mother'', the official song of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Death ==
Mary Daggett Lake suffered a [[stroke]] at the Fort Worth Woman's Club on January 7, 1955 and died on March 1, 1955.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Fort Worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/105349778|title=FindAGrave: Mary Daggett Lake|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postmodern international relations''' is an approach that has been part of [[international relations]] scholarship since the 1980s. Although there are various strands of thinking, a key element to [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] theories is a distrust of any account of human life which claims to have direct access to the [[truth]]. Postmodern [[international relations theory]] critiques theories like [[Marxism]] that provide an overarching [[metanarrative]] to history. Key postmodern thinkers include [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Derrida]].{{sfn|Baylis|Smith|2005|pp=285–287}}

A criticism made of postmodern approaches to international relations is that they place too much emphasis on theoretical notions and are generally not concerned with the [[empirical evidence]].{{sfn|Baylis|Smith|2005|p=287}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">'''Prehistoric demography''' is the study of the [[demography]] of [[human]] and [[hominid]] populations from the origin of hominids about 6,000,000 years ago through the origin of [[anatomically modern humans]] about 200,000 years ago, to the beginning of the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]] about 10,000 years ago.  

==Hominid population estimates==

It is estimated that the average life span of hominids on the [[Africa]]n [[savanna]] between 4,000,000 and 200,000 years ago was 20 years.  This means that the population would be completely renewed about five times per century, {{citation needed|date=October 2015}} assuming that infant mortality has already been accounted for.  It is further estimated that the population of hominids in Africa fluctuated between 10,000 and 100,000 individuals, thus averaging about 50,000 individuals.  Roughly multiplying 40,000 centuries by 50,000 to 500,000 individuals per century, yields a total of 2 billion to 20 billion hominids, or an average estimate of about 10 billion hominids that lived during that approximately 4,000,000 year time span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Angela |last=Piero |first2=Alberto |last2=Piero |year=1993 |title=The Extraordinary Story of Human Origins |publisher=Prometheus Books |page=194 |isbn=1615928375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bagrat''' ({{lang-ka|ბაგრატი}}) (8 May 1776 – 8 May 1841) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] royal prince (''[[batonishvili]]'') of the [[Bagrationi|House of Bagrationi]] and an author. A son of King [[George XII of Georgia]], Bagrat occupied important administrative posts in the last years of the Georgian monarchy, after whose abolition by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1801 he entered the imperial civil service. He was known in Russia as the ''[[tsarevich]]'' '''Bagrat Georgievich Gruzinsky''' ({{lang-ru|Баграт Георгиевич Грузи́нский}}). He is the author of works in the [[History of Georgia (country)|history of Georgia]], [[veterinary medicine]] and economics. Bagrat is the forefather of the surviving descendants of the last kings of Georgia.

==Life in Georgia==
Bagrat was born in [[Tbilisi]] into the family of Crown Prince George, the future king [[George XII]], and his first wife [[Ketevan Andronikashvili|Ketevan]] née [[Andronikashvili]]. In 1790, Bagrat, then aged 14, received a princely domain in the [[Ksani]] valley after his reigning grandfather, [[Erekle II]], dispossessed the defiant Kvenipneveli dynasty of the [[duchy of Ksani]], dividing it into three parts. Other parts of the duchy were granted to Bagrat's elder brother [[Ioann of Georgia|Ioann]] and uncle [[Iulon, son of Heraclius II of Georgia|Iulon]]. In addition, during the reign of his father George XII (1798–1801), Bagrat received [[Kakheti]] in possession. Around the same time, he became involved in a dynastic feud among the numerous posterity of Erekle II and George XII. In November 1800, Bagrat was one of the commanders of a combined Russo-Georgian force that defeated the joint invasion by the [[Avar Khanate|Avar khan]] Umma and Bagrat's own paternal half-uncle [[Prince Alexander of Georgia|Alexander]] on the banks of the [[Iori River|Iori]] in Kakheti.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gvosdev|2000|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Russia==
After George XII's death in 1800, the arrival of the Russian rule brought the Bagrationi rule to an end. The members of the Georgian royal family were deprived of their estates and deported to Russia proper. Unlike many of his royal relatives, Bagrat did not take arms against the Russian regime and, in 1803, accepted his exile in [[Moscow]], which he left the day before the city's occupation by the French troops in 1812, and then in [[St. Petersburg]], where he would live until his death. He was made a [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] of the Russian tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] in 1818 and became a [[Privy Councillor]] and [[Governing Senate|Senator]] of the empire in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gvosdev|2000|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life in Russia, Bagrat composed a continuation of the Georgian history written by his brother [[David, son of George XII of Georgia|David]], covering the period from the middle of the 18th century to the 1840s. He also compiled a list of Georgians fighting in the Russian ranks against [[Napoleonic France]] in 1812. He also authored memoirs and the first Georgian-language book in veterinary medicine, published in St. Petersburg in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ხანთაძე|1977|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

In [[sociology]] and  [[cultural studies]], '''reappropriation''' or '''reclamation''' is the [[culture|cultural]] process by which a group reclaims terms or artifacts that were previously used in a way disparaging of that group.&lt;ref name="Slurs"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.langsci.2010.11.005 | last1 = Croom | first1 = A.M. | year = 2011 | title = Slurs | url = | journal = Language Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages =343–358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The term ''reappropriation'' is an extension of the term ''appropriation'' or ''[[cultural appropriation]]'' used in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and  [[cultural studies]] to describe the reabsorbing of [[subculture|subcultural]] styles and forms, or those from other cultures, into mass culture through a process of commodification: the mass-marketing of alternate lifestyles, practices, and artifacts.{{citation needed |date=November 2015}}

== Definition ==
{{Anchor|Linguistic reappropriation or reclaiming}} &lt;!-- old name; please keep to avoid breaking old in-links --&gt;

A ''reclaimed'' or ''reappropriated'' word is a word that was at one time [[pejorative]] but has been brought back into acceptable usage, usually starting within the communities that experienced [[oppression]] under that word but sometimes also among the general populace as well.&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt;{{verification failed|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--the source doesn't discuss terms reclaimed or reappropriated at all!!--&gt; (The term "reclaimed word" more often implies usage by a member of the group that is referred.)

That can have wider implications in the fields of [[discourse]] and has been described in terms of personal or sociopolitical empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Godrej|first=Farah|title=Spaces for Counter-Narratives: The Phenomenology of Reclamation|url=http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|work=Paper prepared for the Midwest Political Science Association Meeting|publisher=University of Indiana|accessdate=July 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025220344/http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|archivedate=2005-10-25|format=PDF|date=April 3, 2003}} Citing Patricia Hill Collins, ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment''  (New York: Routledge, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaiming or reappropriating a word involves re-evaluating a term that is or was, in the dominant culture, used to by a majority to oppress various [[minority group|minorities]] of the same culture,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} such as "[[queer]]", once seen as pejorative but now reclaimed and used as a self-reference by some.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2014 |title=queer |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.qrd.org/qrd/misc/text/queers.read.this|title=Queers Read This |author=Queer Nation |date=June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaimed words differ from general reclamation outside of language because of their deliberately provocative nature. In addition to neutral or acceptable connotations, reclaimed words often acquire positive meaning within the circles of the informed.&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt; Outside the community, such transitions are rare. As such, the use of these terms by outside parties is usually viewed as strongly derogatory. For some terms, even "reclaimed" usage by members of the community concerned is a subject of controversy; for example, there is considerable debate within the transgender community over attempts to reclaim the term "tranny", usually applied offensively to [[trans women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 1 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/tranny-and-subversivism-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-1/ |last=Cedar |date=November 10, 2008 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 2 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/tranny-cis-women-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-2/ |last=Cedar |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tranny |publisher=Queer Today |url=http://queertoday.com/profiles/blogs/tranny-1 |first=Mark Daniel |last=Snyder |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715135223/http://queertoday.com/profiles/blogs/tranny-1 |archivedate=July 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and sexuality===
There are many recent English-language examples of some linguistic reappropriation in the areas of [[human sexuality]], [[gender role]]s, [[sexual orientation]], etc. Among these are:

* ''[[Dyke (lesbian)|Dyke]]''{{thin space}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=press_pr_dykesonbikes_071405|title=Trademark Office says no to Dykes on Bikes|publisher=National Center for Lesbian Rights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718090612/http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=press_pr_dykesonbikes_071405|archivedate=2011-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
However, the phenomenon is much older, especially in politics and religion.

In England, for example, [[Cavalier]] was a derogatory nickname reappropriated as self-identification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|short=1 |author=Anonymous |wstitle=Cavalier |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Roundhead]], a Royalists derisory term for the supporters of the Parliamentary cause, is not (it was a punishable offence in the [[New Model Army]] to call a fellow soldier a roundhead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Worden |first=Blair |year=2009 |title=The English Civil Wars 1640–1660|location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |page=2 |isbn=0-14-100694-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tory]]'' (orig. from Middle Irish word for "pursued man" ''[[Tóraidhe]]'' ), ''[[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]'' (from "whiggamore" (See the [[Whiggamore Raid]])) and ''[[Suffragette]]'' are other British examples.

In the American colonies, British officers used [[Yankee]], from a term used by the British to refer to Dutch pirates, as a derogatory term against colonists. British soldiers created the early versions of the song ''[[Yankee Doodle]]'', as a criticism of the uncultured colonists, but during the Revolution, as the colonists began to reappropriate the label ''yankee'' as a point of pride, they likewise reappropriated the song, altering verses, and turning it into a patriotic anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/11/05/dude_etymology_of_the_word_is_traced_to_doodle_as_in_yankee_doodle_dandy.html|title = Mystery Solved: The Etymology of Dude|date = 5 Nov 2013|accessdate = 10 Aug 2015|website = Slate|publisher = The Slate Group,|last = Okrent|first = Arika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1850s in the United States, a secretive political party was derisively dubbed the [[Know Nothing]] party, based on their penchant for saying "I know nothing" when asked for details by outsiders; this became the common name for the party. It eventually became a popular name, sufficiently so that consumer products like tea, candy, and even a freighter were branded with the name.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Gienapp. "Salmon P. Chase, Nativism, and the Formation of the Republican Party in Ohio", pp. 22, 24. ''Ohio History'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
One of the older examples of successful reclaiming is the term ''Jesuit'' to refer to members of the [[Society of Jesus]]. This was originally a derogatory term referring to people who too readily invoked the name of [[Jesus]] in their politics,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} but which members of the Society adopted over time for themselves, so that the word came to refer exclusively to them, and generally in a positive or neutral sense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pollen |first=John Hungerford |author-link=John Hungerford Pollen (Jesuit) |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=The Society of Jesus |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Society_of_Jesus |access-date=30 November 2016 |year=1913 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |volume=14 |location=New York, NY |isbn= |oclc= |pages= }}&lt;!--{{cite wikisource |class= |last1=Pollen |first1=John Hungerford |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= |trans_title= |plaintitle= |wslink= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1913 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |location=New York, NY |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |at= |wspage= |chapter= |plainchapter= |quote= }}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; even though the term "Jesuitical" is derived from the Society of Jesus and is used to mean things like: manipulative, conspiring, treacherous, capable of intellectually justifying anything by convoluted reasoning.&lt;ref name="Peschier2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peschier|first=D.|title=Nineteenth-Century Anti-Catholic Discourses: The Case of Charlotte Brontë|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iV2CDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;vq=Jesuitical&amp;dq=Jesuitical&amp;pg=PA49#q=Jesuitical|date=21 June 2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-230-50502-5|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevenson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=Angus|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA940&amp;dq=Jesuitical&amp;pg=PA940#q=Jesuitical|date=19 August 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|page=940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aikio"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aikio|first1=Annukka|last2=Vornanen|first2=Rauni|title=Uusi sivistyssanakirja|date=1982|publisher=Otava|ref=Aikio|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="March1906"&gt;{{cite book|last=March|first=Francis Andrew|title=A Thesaurus Dictionary of the English Language Designed to Suggest Immediately Any Desired Word Needed to Express Exactly a Given Idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QUxAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Jesuitical%22&amp;pg=PA1089#q=%22Jesuitical%22|year=1906|publisher=Historical Publishing Company|location=Philadelphia, PA|page=1089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example can be found in the origins of [[Methodism]]; early members were originally mocked for their "methodical" and rule-driven religious devotion, founder [[John Wesley]] embraced the term for his movement.&lt;ref name="Atkins-2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Atkins |first=Martyn |url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/static/deepeningdiscipleship/discipleshipandmethodistsmatkins.pdf |title=Discipleship... and the people called Methodists |publisher=The Methodist Church in Britain |date=2010 |page=9 |format=pdf |asin=B006OA0XRU |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315234625/http://methodist.org.uk/static/deepeningdiscipleship/discipleshipandmethodistsmatkins.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-15 |quote=...to be a ‘Methodist’ was originally a term of ridicule because of the zeal and rigour with which they pursued a life of holiness and sought to be the best disciples of Christ they could.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] were termed ''Quakers'' as an epithet, but took up the term themselves.

===Race, ethnicity, and nationality===
To a lesser extent, and more controversially among the groups referred to, many racial, ethnic, and class terms have been reappropriated:

* ''[[Nigga]]'' or ''[[nigger]]'' by [[African Americans]]&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy-2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Randall  |title=Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VgVzXgUxFB4C&amp;pg=PR17 |accessdate=16 January 2018 |date=18 December 2008 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-307-53891-8 |page=xvii |oclc=838223786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18409">A '''reception statute''' is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent by which the new nation adopts, or receives, the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] before its independence to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, as well as the [[precedent]]s originating from it, as the default law because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state.

All [[US states]] have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the [[common law]] by judicial opinion, but there is [[Reception statute#United States|a special case of partial reception for Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reception of English common law into new colonies and adoption of common law on decolonization==
In ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] described the process by which [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] followed English colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them [[terra nullius|desert and uncultivated]], and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by [[conquest (military)|conquest]], or ceded to us by [[treaty|treaties]]. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force.... But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the [[List of British monarchs|king]] may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the law of God, as in the case of an infidel country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, if an "uninhabited" or "infidel" territory is colonised by Britain, the English law automatically applies in the territory from the moment of colonisation, but if the colonised territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively, a form of [[indirect rule]]) until it is formally superseded by the English law by [[Royal Prerogative]], subjected to the [[Westminster Parliament]].

As colonies gained independence from Britain, the newly-independent countries usually adopted [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] [[precedent]] as of the date of independence as the default law to carry forward into the new nation, to the extent that was not explicitly rejected by the founding documents or government.

In some cases, the carry-forward was simply understood, with no express provision in either the new independence constitution or legislation. In other cases, the new legislature preferred to state redundantly but safely that [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] had been received during the colonial period. Examples of both patterns are described below.

== United States ==
After the 1776 [[American Revolution]], one of the first legislative acts undertaken by each of the newly-independent states was to adopt a "reception statute" that gave legal effect to the existing body of [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] to the extent that the legislation or the [[constitution]] had not explicitly rejected English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Michigan High Court Ruling Offers Positive Guidance on Challenges to Tort Reform Laws | last1 = Lammi | first1 = Glenn G. | last2 = Chang | first2 = James | date = December 17, 2004 | journal = Legal Backgrounder | publisher = [[Washington Legal Foundation]] | volume = 19 | issue = 46 | issn=1056-3059|url = http://www.wlf.org/upload/121704LBChang.pdf | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states enacted reception statutes as legislative statutes, but other states received the English common law by provisions of their constitution or by court decision. British traditions such as the [[monarchy]] were rejected by the [[US Constitution]], but many English common law traditions such as [[habeas corpus]], [[jury trials]], and various other [[civil liberties]] were adopted in the United States. Significant elements of English common law prior to 1776 still remain in effect in many jurisdictions in the United States because they have never been rejected by American courts or legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Milestones! 200 Years of American Law: Milestones in Our Legal History''. By Jethro Koller Lieberman. Published by West, 1976. Original from the University of California. Digitized Jun 11, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-519881-2}}, p. 16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=i_2wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the New York Constitution of 1777&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ny01.htm New York Constitution of 1777] via Avalon Project at [[Yale]] Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; provides that:
{{quote|[S]uch parts of the common law of England, and of the statute law of England and Great Britain, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together did form the law of the said colony on the 19th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, shall be and continue the law of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make concerning the same.}}

[[Alexander Hamilton]] emphasized in the [[Federalist Papers]] that the New York constitutional provision expressly made the common law subject "to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa84.htm Federalist 84] (1788).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when reception was effected by a constitution, the common law was still subject to alteration by a legislature's statute.

The [[Northwest Ordinance]], which was approved by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1787, guaranteed "judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law." [[Nathan Dane]], the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, viewed that provision as a default mechanism if federal or territorial statutes were silent about a particular matter. Hr wrote that if "a statute makes an offence, and is silent as to the mode of trial, it shall be by jury, according to the course of the common law."&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Dane, 6 ''General Abridgment and Digest of American Law'' §182, art. 5, 230 (Cummings, Hilliard &amp; Co. 1823).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the provision operated as a reception statute, giving legal authority to the established common law in the vast territories in which no states had yet been established.

Over time, as new states were formed from federal territories, the territorial reception statutes became obsolete and were re-enacted as state law. For example, a reception statute enacted by legislation in the state of Washington states, "The common law, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Washington nor incompatible with the institutions and condition of society in this state, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of this state."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington'', [http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/9th/case/9835154&amp;exact=1 271 F.3d 835] (9th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, the common law was eventually incorporated into the legal systems of every state (except for the [[law of Louisiana]] for which some areas of law were received as [[common law]] and others were adopted from French and Spanish sources).

Certain anomalies exist within certain US states because of the effective branching of the law in different directions. For example, the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] adopted the [[English common law]] upon becoming independent but before [[England]] abolished [[trial by combat]]. Thus, it has been argued that the right to request trial by combat theoretically still exists in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/trial-by-combat-in-the-united-states-2013-11&lt;/ref&gt; at least as far as a [[form of action]] under which the common law had authorized trial by combat would be available in Virginia.

==Canada==
The Canadian colonies received the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] and English statutes under Blackstone's principles for the establishment of the legal system of a new colony. In five of the ten Canadian provinces, English law was received automatically, under the principle of a settled colony inheriting English law. In the other provinces and in the three territories, reception was governed by reception statutes. The reception of English law occurred long before Canada became fully independent and so reception statutes in Canada were not part of the decolonisation process.

When Canada achieved formal independence with the passage of the [[Canada Act 1982]], no reception statutes were necessary for the decolonialisation process.  English law had already been received in all the various Canadian provinces and territories by legislation and judicial decisions over the previous two centuries.

=== Atlantic provinces ===
In the four Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador), the reception of English law was automatic, under the principle set out by Blackstone relating to settled colonies. British colonists were considered to have brought English common law and the applicable English statutes with them and so no reception statute was necessary.

The reception date for New Brunswick is 1660, for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island 1758, and for Newfoundland and Labrador 1825.

=== Quebec ===
Quebec was settled as a French colony and originally operated under the French civil law system by using the ''Coûtume de Paris''. Upon the transfer of the colony to British control, the British government issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which imposed English common law on the colony under the principle set out in Blackstone relating to captured colonies. However, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]], which restored the French civil law for matters of private law (matters such as contracts, property, and successions (wills)) but kept the English common law as the basis for public law in the colony, notably the criminal law.

With the passage of the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]] in 1866, Quebec's civil law became entirely statute-based and used the civil law system for matters within provincial jurisdiction.

Public law in Quebec continues to have its origin in the common law, but even then, civil law plays a strong role. If federal legislation requires interpretation, judges must look to the Civil Code of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific (1976), [1977] 2 S.C.R 1054; St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 63, [2001] 4 FC 289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontario ===
The territory now forming Ontario was originally part of Quebec and so was under the civil law. When Quebec was divided into the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the first Act passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada was to adopt the law of England for all purposes, replacing the civil law.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to repeal certain parts of an Act passed in the Fourteenth Year of His Majesty's Reign, intituled an Act for making more effectual Provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec in North America;  and to introduce the English Law, as the Rule of Decision in all matters of controversy relative to Property and Civil Rights'', S.U.C. 1792 (32 Geo. III), c. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; That statute adopted both the English common law and English statute law. The foundation for the operation of the common law in Ontario traces back to that reception statute.

=== North-West Territories, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta ===
The new Dominion of Canada acquired the territories of  [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1870. Those territories were considered to have been settled by British colonists and so the reception of English law was automatic. However, the long history of control by the Hudson's Bay Company caused some uncertainty as to the date of reception. To resolve the uncertainty, various statutes were passed to set the date of reception to July 15, 1870, the date of the transfer of those two territories to Canada. The Province of Manitoba set that date for the reception of English law for matters coming within provincial jurisdiction. The Legislature of the North-West Territories passed an ordinance, adopting the same date for matters coming within territorial jurisdiction.

The federal Parliament eventually enacted a provision adopting that date for all matters in the North-West Territories.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/NWT.pdf The North-West Territories Act]'', R.S.C.1885, c. 50, s. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; That provision was carried forward in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan when they were created by the [[Alberta Act]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/aa_1905.html Alberta Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 3, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Saskatchewan Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/SK%20Act.pdf Saskatchewan Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 42, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same provision is the basis for the reception date of English law in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.

=== British Columbia ===
British Columbia was considered to be a settled colony and so received English law automatically, under the principle set out by Blackstone.

==Hong Kong==

Hong Kong was ceded (in case of the [[New Territories]], leased) to the United Kingdom by [[Qing dynasty]] of China by a series of treaties, starting with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842. As a ceded or leased territory with its own set of laws, the [[Great Qing Legal Code]] remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the late 19th century, a Chinese man convicted of [[murder]] would be executed by [[decapitation]], but an Englishman convicted of the same crime would be sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. It was not until 1971, nearly six decades after the fall of the Qing dynasty, that the of the Qing Code was completely abolished in Hong Kong. Even then, some vestiges of it remain. For example, before the Marriage Reform Ordinance 1970 (Cap. 178) came into force on 7 October 1971, a man could practice [[polygamy]] by virtue of the Qing Code. The courts still refer to the Qing Code on the inheritance rights of surviving [[concubinage|concubines]] married before 1971 and that of their children.

When Hong Kong was handed over to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997, Hong Kong retained the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] in a reception statute in Chapter I, Article 8, of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html |title=Chapter I, Section 8 of Hong Kong Basic Law |publisher=Basiclaw.gov.hk |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.}}

==Republic of Ireland==

The 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] stated that pre-existing laws would remain in force except if repugnant to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 73 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] does likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article50_1|title=Constitution of Ireland|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 50.1 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither explicitly stated whether that meant only the statute law or, more broadly, the common law and [[equity (law)|equity]] as well. The [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] has generally taken the broader view.&lt;ref name="Keane2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keane|first=Ronan|title=Equity and the Law of Trusts in the Republic of Ireland|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=16 July 2016|year=2011|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667021|pages=22–23, sec.2.39|chapter=The Historical Background}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other British colonies==
The pattern was repeated in many other former British colonies as they gained independence from the United Kingdom. [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Belize]] and various Caribbean and African nations have adopted English common law by reception statutes although they do not inevitably continue to copy English common law; later cases can often draw on decisions in other common law jurisdictions. The colony of [[New South Wales]] formally received the English common law in 1828, and each of the other Australian colonies received the common law of New South Wales upon its founding.

{{main|Conservation-restoration}}
[[File:Art Restoration, Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration, Boston.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of painting and frame restoration – before and after]]

'''Restoration''' is a process that attempts to return [[cultural heritage]] to some previous state that the restorer imagines was the "original". This was commonly done in the past. However, in the late 20th century a separate concept of [[conservation-restoration]] was developed that is more concerned with preserving the work of art for the future, and less with making it look pristine. Restoration is controversial, since it often involves some irreversible change to the original material of the artwork with the goal of making it "look good." The attitude that has developed in recent years with the development of conservation is to attempt to make all restoration reversible.
 
==Techniques==
[[File:Carroll Wales, Art Restorer, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration- Boston.jpg|thumbnail|Restoration of [[Kariye Camii]], Istanbul, 1957]]
Art conservation can involve the cleaning and stabilization of art work. Ideally, any process used is reversible, departures from that ideal not being undertaken lightly. Cleaning is not a reversible process and can sometimes be controversial due to fears that cleaning would damage a piece, or on the grounds that damage or residue forms part of the history of a given piece and should not be modified. [[Michelangelo]]'s [[David (Michelangelo)|statue of David]] has undergone two cleanings to remove dirt that had accumulated on the statue's surface.

Art restoration is vital to the survival of classical paintings and is part of the scientific application of chemistry.  It often involves research to determine the original colors and materials of a work.

===Watercolor on fresco===
The use of watercolor paints to inpaint damages on fresco is an example of a technique utilized to achieve almost complete reversibility. This is the technique used in the 20 year [[Conservation-restoration of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper|restoration of Da Vinci's ''The Last Supper'']] in Milan. One of the most popular inpainting techniques used today is the Tinted Varnish Treatment. This process is done once the piece is fully cleaned and varnished. This last step in the restoration process is to then go into spots where original paint may be missing, or where patched holes and other irregularities may lie. The restorer then goes in with tinted varnish over the top of the non-tinted varnish. This gives the illusion that the spots have been "re-painted", while in fact it is just a spot of tinted varnish. Most commonly "stippling" is used while using tinted varnish, in order for light to reflect similar to paint. This is done by using tiny dots in a row for variance.

===Painting with light===

In 2014, Harvard Art Museums exhibited murals by [[Mark Rothko]] from 1961 and 1962 which had faded due to their original display in a dining room.  It restored the works to their original appearance by digitally projecting light carefully calibrated at each pixel from a photograph of the original colors, which made up the difference between the current and original appearance without damaging the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014-06-03|accessdate=2015-06-07|url=http://www.gizmag.com/rothko-harvard-murals/32374/|title=Harvard uses projection technology to shine new light on faded Rothko murals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/about/press/mark-rothko%E2%80%99s-harvard-murals-feature-harvard-art-museums%E2%80%99-inaugural-special-exhibition&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Die Stille Hilfe für Kriegsgefangene und Internierte''' (English: "Silent assistance for prisoners of war and interned persons"), abbreviated '''''Stille Hilfe''''', is a relief organization for arrested, condemned and fugitive [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, similar to the veterans' association [[HIAG]], set up by [[County of Isenburg|Helene Elisabeth Princess von Isenburg]] (1900–1974) in 1951. The organisation has come under criticism for its encouragement and support of Neo-Nazis. The organization has garnered a reputation for being shrouded in secrecy and thus remains a source of speculation.&lt;ref name=sof/&gt;

==History==
Operating covertly since 1946, the organization that later became publicly active as "Stille Hilfe", aided the escape of hunted Nazi fugitives, particularly to South America. Thus [[Adolf Eichmann]], [[Johann von Leers]], [[Walter Rauff]] and [[Josef Mengele]] could escape to [[Argentina]].

==Establishment==
After the main exponents of the later association had already long formed an active network, it was decided a non-profit association should be formed primarily to facilitate a donations campaign. On 7 October 1951 the founders' meeting was held in [[Munich]] and on 15 November 1951 the organization was entered in the register of associations in the Upper Bavarian city [[Wolfratshausen]]. The first president, Helene Elizabeth, Princess von Isenburg was chosen because of her good contacts in the aristocracy and conservative upper middle-class circles as well as the Catholic Church. Founding members of the committee included church representatives Theophil Worm and Johannes Neuhäusler, as well as high-ranking former functionaries of the Nazi state such as the former ''[[SS-Standartenführer]]'' and head of department in the Central Reich Security Office ([[RSHA]]), Wilhelm Spengler, and [[SS-Obersturmbannführer]] Heinrich Malz, who was the personal adviser of [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]].

==Objectives and activity in the mid-1950s==

Helene Elisabeth, Princess von Isenburg explained its objectives in this way: "From the start of its efforts‚ the Stille Hilfe sought to take care of, above all, the serious needs of the prisoners of war and those interned completely without rights. Later their welfare service was active for those accused and arrested as a result of the war trials, whether in the prisons of the victors or in German penal institutions".

From the beginning of the [[Nuremberg Trials]], the group sought to influence public opinion to prevent the death penalty. In press campaigns, personal and open letters and petitions, the war criminals were usually represented as innocent victims–pure command-receivers, irreproachable and often also having a blind faith in the Führer–who would have to suffer bitter injustice by [[victor's justice]].

Because Princess von Isenburg was particularly devoted to the war criminals condemned to death in Landsberg prison, she was affectionately known as "Mother of the Landsbergers" in order to let "Stille Hilfe" be seen primarily as a charitable organisation.

The legal assistance for arrested war criminals was first organised by the attorney Rudolf Aschenauer (1913–1983), who also formulated and submitted requests for grace and revisions. The organisation paid vacation, dismissal and Christmas benefit to the prisoners and also supported their families. They were not only limited to humanitarian activities but also pursued a past-ideological and revisionist objective.

Princess Isenburg, a strict Catholic, tirelessly pleaded the criminals' cause in conservative circles and with high-ranking church representatives (even up to the Pope). Johannes Neuhäusler (1888–1973) in particular, who not only had suffered detention/imprisonment by the [[Gestapo]], but also had been held by the Nazis in the [[Dachau concentration camp]] as a special prisoner, was most effective in public opinion, even among western Allied officials. The motives of the bishops lay probably less in a conscious ideological identification with the war criminals, but rather in the effort regarding reconciliation with the German past and the start of the new post-war society in [[West Germany]]. Neuhäusler explained that he wanted to repay "the bad with good". The further connections of Princess Isenburg and Aschenauer led particularly to former SS organisations such as Gauleiterkreis under [[Werner Naumann]], which was already partly formed in Allied prisoner-of-war camps. Princess Isenburg initiated a whole series of organisations as "The working group for the rescue of the Landsberger prisoners", who were essentially financed by the churches.

==Activities since the 1950s== 
The churches to a large extent withdrew support with the end of the main Nuremberg Trials and the release of the time-serving Nazi war criminals from Landsberg prison in 1958.

In the following decades Stille Hilfe worked somewhat in secret with [[Holocaust denial|revisionist]] organizations and prominent protagonists of the "Auschwitzlüge" (Auschwitz lie) like [[Thies Christophersen]] and [[Manfred Roeder]] and co-operated with relevant foreign organizations and personalities e.g. ([[Florentine Rost van Tonningen]], [[Léon Degrelle]]). By a not insignificant number of inheritances and by regular donations, the organization controls considerable funds. Since Stille Hilfe does not publish end-of-year figures, one can only estimate the influx of capital; however, perhaps donations (not including inheritances) were annually circa €60,000 to €80,000, at least to the end of the 1990s.

Stille Hilfe supported the condemned in the Düsseldorfer [[Majdanek]] trials, the former [[Female guards in Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp guard]] [[Hildegard Lächert]] ("bloody Brygida") and later [[Klaus Barbie]], [[Erich Priebke]] and [[Josef Schwammberger]], who from 1942 to 1944 was commander of German labour camps in occupied Poland, involved in the massacres of [[Przemyśl]] and [[Rozwadów]]. Whether they were involved in the release of [[Herbert Kappler]] from a prison in Rome in 1977 is not clarified. Chairmen after Princess Isenburg (until 1959) were to 1992 the former [[League of German Girls|Bund Deutscher Mädel]] leaders Gertrude Herr and Adelheid Klug.

They have been led since 1992 by Horst Janzen. The organisation today has approximately 40 members with decreasing numbers. At the same time however contacts were reinforced with "Hilfsorganisation für nationale politische Gefangene und deren Angehörige" (relief organization for national political prisoners) (HNG), so continuity may be secured.

Based until 1976 in Bremen Osterholz, since 1989 in [[Rotenburg an der Wümme]], since 1992 in [[Wuppertal]]. In 1993–94 it caused a political debate in the [[German Bundestag|Bundestag]] over its [[non-profit]] status as a revisionistic right-wing extremist association and was submitted to an examination by the fiscal authorities. In the Bundesfinanzhof (Federal Finance Court) it was decided in November 1999 to deny Stille Hilfe non-profit, i.e. charitable, status.

[[File:Margaret and Gudrun Himmler.jpg|thumb|Leading member [[Gudrun Burwitz]] (''right'') with her mother at the International Military Tribunal trial of war criminals at Nuremberg, 1945]]

For years they had a prominent symbol: [[Gudrun Burwitz]], the daughter of [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Known to her father as "Püppi", she was an idol to Stille Hilfe and their affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/christine_toomey/article503184.ece| title=Grief encounter| publisher=The Times|date =November 14, 2004 | location=London | first=Christine | last=Toomey | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At meetings such as Ulrichsbergtreffen in [[Austria]] she appeared at the same time as a star and an authority. Burwitz campaigned intensively in the last few years{{when?|date=November 2018}} for accused Nazis. This particularly showed up in the case of [[Anton Malloth]], who had lived undisturbed for about 40 years in [[Meran]]. He was proven guilty for his acts as a supervisor in the Gestapo-prison "Kleine Festung Theresienstadt", which was part of the larger [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=sof&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-sins-of-my-father-1068013.html The sins of my father] The Independent. 1 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Malloth was convicted by the district court of Munich for murder and attempted murder and sentenced to life imprisonment after the public prosecutor's office in Munich had taken over the procedure of the public prosecutor's office in [[Dortmund]], which for many years had hijacked the procedure. From 1988 to 2000, Malloth lived in [[Pullach]] near Munich. Gudrun Burwitz was instructed by Stille Hilfe to rent a comfortable room for him in a home for the aged, which was built on a lot formerly owned by [[Rudolf Hess]]. In common with the secretive nature of the organisation, Burwitz did not give press interviews.&lt;ref name=sof/&gt;

At the end of the 1990s it became public that the social welfare assistance administration (and thus the German taxpayers) had in large part taken over the considerable running costs of the home where Malloth was staying. This, along with the participation of Gudrun Burwitz, resulted in substantial public criticism.

Although firmly rooted in the [[neo-Nazi]] fringe, it developed amicable relations with conservative West German politicians, such as CDU Bundestag Parliamentary leader [[Alfred Dregger]], who praised the efforts of Stille Hilfe in 1989.&lt;ref name=tbr&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin A.|last=Lee|title=[[The Beast Reawakens]]|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, a Stille Hilfe representative attended the graveside ceremony in [[Kassel]] of [[Michael Kühnen]], the prominent Neo-Nazi leader who died of [[HIV]]-related complications. Stille Hilfe laid a wreath that bore the SS motto "Michael Kühnen – his honour is loyalty."&lt;ref name=tbr/&gt;

The organisation has come under criticism for its encouragement and support of neo-Nazis. This has included legal aid for those facing prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article588988.ece| title=Katrin's choice: how do I tell my son about great-uncle Heinrich. . .?| publisher=The Times|date =November 11, 2005 | location=London | first=Roger | last=Boyes | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also supports a [[Protestant]] old people's home in [[Pullach]], near [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=oph&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Wingeate Pike|title=Spaniards in the Holocaust|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stoicism''' is a school of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] founded by [[Zeno of Citium]] in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. While [[Stoic physics]] are largely drawn from the teachings of the philosopher [[Heraclitus]], they are heavily influenced by certain teachings of [[Socrates]]. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.

The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the only good" for human beings, and that external things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves, but have value as "material for virtue to act upon".  Alongside [[Aristotelian ethics]], the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to Western [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Matthew. "[http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30059463/sharpe-stoicvirtue-2013.pdf Stoic Virtue Ethics]." ''Handbook of Virtue Ethics'', 2013, 28–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called ''[[prohairesis]]'') that is "in accord with nature". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars. ''Stoicism'', 2006, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.

Many Stoics—such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Epictetus]]—emphasized that because "virtue is sufficient for [[Philosophy of happiness|happiness]]", a [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm", though the phrase does not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stoicism flourished throughout the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Roman Greece|Greek]] world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance]] ([[Neostoicism]]) and in the contemporary era ([[modern Stoicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Lawrence C.|author-link=Lawrence C. Becker|title=A New Stoicism|date=2001|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400822447|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbqFt3RPsuQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Stoic comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''stōïkos'', meaning "of the stoa [portico, or porch]". This, in turn, refers to the [[Stoa Poikile]], or "Painted Stoa," in Athens, where the influential Stoic [[Zeno of Citium]] taught.&lt;ref name="etymologymerriam"&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stoic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=D.|title=Kant's Theory of Emotion: Emotional Universalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62WCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|date=1 April 2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-49810-6|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laymen's terms stoicism is sometimes referred to as "suffering in silence", and the ethics associated with that.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Hua‐Hie. "Can attitudes of stoicism and cautiousness explain observed age‐related variation in levels of self‐rated pain, mood disturbance and functional interference in chronic pain patients?." European Journal of Pain 10.5 (2006): 399–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic tenets==
{{rquote|right|Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood, and that of statuary bronze, so the subject-matter of the art of living is each person's own life.|Epictetus|''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' 1.15.2, Robin Hard revised translation}}

The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, consisting of formal [[logic]], [[monism|monistic]] [[physics]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.

Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (''[[logos]]''). A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' that is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy,'' p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy,"&lt;ref name="Russell1"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy'', p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; and to accept even slaves as "equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature".&lt;ref name="Russell5"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy'', p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoic ethic espouses a [[determinism|deterministic]] perspective; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue, [[Cleanthes]] once opined that the wicked man is "like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,"&lt;ref name="Russell1" /&gt; thus positing a "completely autonomous" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is "a rigidly deterministic single whole".  This viewpoint was later described as "[[Classical Pantheism]]" (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]).&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antisthenes Pio-Clementino Inv288.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Antisthenes]], founder of the Cynic school of philosophy]]

Stoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=These Were the Greeks|last=Amos|first=H.|publisher=Dufour Editions|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8023-1275-4|location=Chester Springs|oclc=9048254}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where, in the words of [[Gilbert Murray]] "nearly all the [[diadochi|successors of Alexander]] [...] professed themselves Stoics."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Murray, ''The Stoic Philosophy'' (1915), p. 25. In Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'' (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 301&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] taught philosophy at the Stoa Poikile ("Painted Porch"), from which his philosophy got its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Becker | first = Lawrence | title = A History of Western Ethics | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-415-96825-6 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other schools of philosophy, such as the [[Epicureans]], Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space, which was a [[colonnade]] overlooking the central gathering place of Athens, the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]].

Zeno's ideas developed from those of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], whose founding father, [[Antisthenes]], had been a disciple of [[Socrates]]. Zeno's most influential follower was [[Chrysippus]], who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism. Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe, over which one has no direct control.

[[File:Seneca-berlinantikensammlung-1.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Seneca]] 
Scholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases:
* Early Stoa, from the founding of the school by Zeno to [[Antipater of Tarsus|Antipater]].
* Middle Stoa, including [[Panaetius]] and [[Posidonius]].
* Late Stoa, including [[Gaius Musonius Rufus|Musonius Rufus]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]].

No complete work by any Stoic philosopher survives from the first two phases of Stoicism. Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survive.&lt;ref&gt;A.A.Long, ''Hellenistic Philosophy'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic==
{{Main|Stoic logic}}
===Propositional logic===
[[Diodorus Cronus]], who was one of Zeno's teachers, is considered the philosopher who first introduced and developed an approach to logic now known as [[propositional logic]], which is based on statements or propositions, rather than terms, making it very different from Aristotle's [[term logic]]. Later, [[Chrysippus]] developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system, Stoic Syllogistic, which was considered a rival to Aristotle's Syllogistic (see [[Syllogism]]). New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic. [[Susanne Bobzien]] wrote, "The many close similarities between Chrysippus' philosophical logic and that of [[Gottlob Frege]] are especially striking."&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ ''Ancient Logic''] by [[Susanne Bobzien]]. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobzien also notes that "Chrysippus wrote over 300 books on logic, on virtually any topic logic today concerns itself with, including [[speech act]] theory, sentence analysis, singular and plural expressions, types of [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], [[Indexicality|indexicals]], [[Existential quantification|existential propositions]], [[Logical connective|sentential connectives]], [[negation]]s, [[Logical disjunction|disjunctions]], [[Conditional proof|conditionals]], [[logical consequence]], [[validity (logic)|valid argument]] forms, [[Deductive reasoning|theory of deduction]], propositional logic, [[modal logic]], [[tense logic]], [[epistemic logic]], [[Supposition theory|logic of suppositions]], [[Imperative logic|logic of imperatives]], ambiguity and logical [[paradox]]es."&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

===Categories===
{{Main article|Stoic categories}}

The Stoics held that all [[being]] (ὄντα) – though not all things (τινά) – is [[Matter|material]]. They accepted the distinction between [[Abstract and concrete]] bodies, but rejected [[Aristotle]]'s belief that purely [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] being exists. Thus, they accepted [[Anaxagoras]]' idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.

They held that there were four [[Stoic categories|categories]].
* '''[[Substance theory|substance]] (ὑποκείμενον)'''
::The primary matter, formless substance, (''ousia'') that things are made of
* '''[[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (ποιόν)'''
::The way matter is organized to form an individual object; in Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (''pneuma'': air or breath), which informs the matter
*'''somehow disposed (πως ἔχον)'''
::Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture{{Rquote|right|Make for yourself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to you, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell yourself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object that is presented to you in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole.|Marcus Aurelius|''[[Meditations]]'', iii. 11}}
*'''Somehow disposed in relation to something (πρός τί πως ἔχον)'''
::Characteristics related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects

===Epistemology===
The Stoics propounded that [[knowledge]] can be attained through the use of [[reason]]. [[Truth]] can be distinguished from [[fallacy]]—even if, in practice, only an approximation can be made. According to the Stoics, the [[sense]]s constantly receive sensations: pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the [[mind]], where they leave an impression in the [[imagination]] (phantasia) (an impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diogenes Laërtius | author-link = Diogenes Laërtius | year = 2000 | title = Lives of eminent philosophers | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, MA}} VII.49&lt;/ref&gt;

The mind has the ability to judge (συγκατάθεσις, ''synkatathesis'')—approve or reject—an impression, enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false. Some impressions can be assented to immediately, but others can only achieve varying degrees of hesitant approval, which can be labeled [[belief]] or opinion (''[[doxa]]''). It is only through reason that we gain clear comprehension and conviction (''[[katalepsis]]''). [[Certain]] and true knowledge (''[[episteme]]''), achievable by the Stoic sage, can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one's peers and the collective judgment of humankind.

==Metaphysics==
The first philosophers to explicitly describe [[Nominalism|nominalist]] arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics, theology and cosmology==
{{main article|Stoic physics}}
{{See also|De Mundo}}
According to the Stoics, the [[Universe]] is a material, reasoning substance, known as God or [[Nature]], which the Stoics divided into two classes, the active and the passive. The passive substance is matter, which "lies sluggish, a substance ready for any use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion".&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', lxv. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The active substance, which can be called [[Destiny|Fate]] or Universal Reason (''Logos''), is an intelligent [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] or primordial fire, which acts on the passive matter:
{{quote|The universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul; it is this same world's guiding principle, operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality that embraces all existence; then the foreordained might and necessity of the future; then fire and the principle of aether; then those elements whose natural state is one of flux and transition, such as water, earth, and air; then the sun, the moon, the stars; and the universal existence in which all things are contained.|sign=Chrysippus|source=in Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', i. 39}}

Everything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs. The [[soul]]s of humans and animals are emanations from this primordial Fire, and are, likewise, subject to Fate:

{{quote|Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things that exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the structure of the web.|sign=Marcus Aurelius|source=''[[Meditations]]'', iv. 40}}

Individual souls are perishable by nature, and can be "transmuted and diffused, assuming a fiery nature by being received into the ''seminal reason'' ("[[logos spermatikos]]") of the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', iv. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe, it follows that the goal of life is to live according to Reason, that is, to live a life according to [[Natural law|Nature]].

Stoic theology is a [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] and [[naturalistic pantheism]]: God is never fully transcendent but always [[Immanence|immanent]], and identified with [[Nature]]. [[Abrahamic religions]] personalize God as a world-creating entity, but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe; according to Stoic [[cosmology]], which is very similar to the [[Hindu cosmology|Hindu conception of existence]], there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the [[space]] and [[Universe]] have neither start nor end, rather they are cyclical. The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed ("[[Ekpyrosis|ekpyrōsis]]", ''conflagration'') and [[Palingenesis|re-created again]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lapidge]], ''Stoic Cosmology'', in: John M. Rist, ''The Stoics'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1978, pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes. Stoicism considers all [[existence]] as cyclic, the cosmos as eternally self-creating and self-destroying (see also [[Eternal return]]).

Stoicism, just like [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe.&lt;ref name="ferg" /&gt; According to the Stoics, the ''[[logos]]'' was the active [[reason]] or ''[[anima mundi]]'' pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal reason'' ("[[logos spermatikos]]"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos'', which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and virtues&lt;!--linked from 'Zeno of Citium' and 'Oikeiôsis'--&gt;==
The ancient Stoics are often misunderstood because the terms they used pertained to different concepts in the past than they do today. The word "stoic" has come to mean "unemotional" or indifferent to pain because Stoic ethics taught freedom from "passion" by following "reason". The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute "[[asceticism|askēsis]]" that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graver | first = Margaret | title = Stoicism and Emotion | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | location = Chicago | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-226-30558-5 |oclc=430497127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logic, reflection, and concentration were the methods of such self-discipline.

Borrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself; in wisdom and self-control. Stoic ethics stressed the rule: "Follow where reason leads." {{citationneeded|date=June 2017}} One must therefore strive to be free of the [[Stoic passions|passions]], bearing in mind that the ancient meaning of "passion" was "anguish" or "suffering",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/passion |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Passion |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, "passively" reacting to external events, which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word. A distinction was made between ''pathos'' (plural ''pathe'') which is normally translated as ''passion'', ''propathos'' or instinctive reaction (e.g., turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger) and ''eupathos'', which is the mark of the Stoic sage (''sophos''). The ''eupatheia'' are feelings that result from correct judgment in the same way that passions result from incorrect judgment.

The idea was to be free of [[suffering]] through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|ἀπάθεια}}; literally, "without passion") or [[Inner peace|peace of mind]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Seddon | first = Keith | title = Epictetus' Handbook and the Tablet of Cebes | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-415-32451-9 |page=217 |oclc=469313282}}&lt;/ref&gt; where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense—being [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] or having "clear judgment" and the maintenance of [[equanimity]] in the face of life's highs and lows.

For the Stoics, reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature—the logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. Living according to reason and virtue, they held, is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people.

The four [[cardinal virtues]] (''[[Arete (moral virtue)|aretai]]'') of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of [[Plato]] (''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' IV. 426–435):
* [[Wisdom]] (σοφία "''sophia''")
* [[Courage]] (ανδρεία "''andreia''")
* [[Justice]] (δικαιοσύνη "''dikaiosyne''")
* [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] (σωφροσύνη ''"[[sophrosyne]]''")

Following Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and [[evil]] are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then is the practice of Stoic philosophy: to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature.

The Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.&lt;ref name="marietta153"&gt;Don E. Marietta, (1998), ''Introduction to ancient philosophy'', pp. 153–54. Sharpe&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s self-consistency (''constantia'') as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cato's suicide in Plutarch AV Zadorojnyi|publisher=The Classical Quarterly|year=2007|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0009838807000195|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===The doctrine of "things indifferent"===
{{main article|Apatheia}}
{{see also|Eudaimonia}}
In philosophical terms, things that are indifferent are outside the application of [[Moral absolutism|moral law]]—that is without tendency to either promote or obstruct moral ends. Actions neither required nor forbidden by the moral law, or that do not affect [[morality]], are called morally indifferent. The doctrine of things indifferent ({{lang|grc|ἀδιάφορα}}, ''[[adiaphora]]'') arose in the Stoic school as a [[corollary]] of its diametric opposition of virtue and vice ({{lang|grc|καθήκοντα}} ''[[kathekon]]'', "convenient actions", or actions in accordance with nature; and ἁμαρτήματα ''hamartemata'', mistakes). As a result of this [[dichotomy]], a large class of objects were left unassigned and thus regarded as indifferent.

Eventually three sub-classes of "things indifferent" developed: things to prefer because they assist life according to nature; things to avoid because they hinder it; and things indifferent in the narrower sense. The principle of ''adiaphora'' was also common to the Cynics. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] revived the doctrine of things indifferent during the [[Renaissance]].

===Spiritual exercise===
[[File:L'Image et le Pouvoir - Buste cuirassé de Marc Aurèle agé - 3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Marcus Aurelius]], the Stoic Roman emperor]]
Philosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims, it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or "[[asceticism|askēsis]]"). Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included [[History of logic#Stoics|logic]], [[Socratic dialogue]] and [[Introspection|self-dialogue]], [[Mortality salience|contemplation of death]], training attention to remain in the present moment (similar to some forms of [[Buddhist meditation]]), and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder.

In his ''[[Meditations]]'', Marcus Aurelius defines several such practices. For example, in Book II.I:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of the ignorance of real good and ill... I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prior to Aurelius, Epictetus in his ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]],'' distinguished between three types of act: judgment, desire, and inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, A.I. (1995) ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'', in ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', Hadot, P. Oxford Blackwells, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; According to French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]], Epictetus identifies these three acts with logic, physics and ethics respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1992) ''La Citadelle intérieure. Introduction aux Pensées de Marc Aurèle''. Paris, Fayard, pp. 106–15&lt;/ref&gt; Hadot writes that in the ''Meditations'', "Each maxim develops either one of these very characteristic ''topoi'' [i.e., acts], or two of them or three of them."&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1987) ''Exercices spirituels et philosophie antique''. Paris, 2nd ed., p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Mac Suibhne has described the practices of spiritual exercises as influencing those of [[reflective practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mac Suibhne, S.|year=2009|title='Wrestle to be the man philosophy wished to make you': Marcus Aurelius, reflective practitioner|journal=Reflective Practice|volume=10|issue=4|pages=429–36|doi=10.1080/14623940903138266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson's ''The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy'' details at length parallels between Stoic spiritual exercises and modern [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoics were also known for consolatory orations, which were part of the ''[[consolatio]]'' literary tradition.  Three such [[Seneca's Consolations|consolations]] by Seneca have survived.

==Social philosophy==
A distinctive feature of Stoicism is its [[cosmopolitanism]]: All people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should live in brotherly love and readily help one another according to the Stoics. In the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'', [[Epictetus]] comments on man's relationship with the world: "Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, whereof the city political is only a copy."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii. 5. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment echoes that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said, "I am not an [[Athens, Greece|Athenian]] or a [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]], but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i. 9. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

They held that external differences such as rank and wealth are of no importance in social relationships. Instead, they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco-Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as [[Cato the Younger]] and Epictetus.

In particular, they were noted for their urging of [[clemency]] toward [[slave]]s. Seneca exhorted, "Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 47|''Moral letters to Lucilius'', Letter 47: ''On master and slave'']], 10, circa AD 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Christianity==

[[Image:Justus Lipsius.png|right|thumb|[[Justus Lipsius]], founder of Neostoicism]]
In his introduction to the 1964 [[Penguin Classics]] edition of ''Meditations'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact Stoicism had on Christianity. He claimed the author of the Fourth Gospel declared Christ to be the Logos, which "had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In St. Ambrose of Milan's ''Duties'', "The voice is the voice of a Christian bishop, but the precepts are those of [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3401.htm|title=On the Duties of the Clergy|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=26 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding what he called "the Divine Spirit", Stanisforth wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated—in the Christian as in the Stoic mind—with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.&lt;ref name="Marcus Aurelius 1964 25"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the [[Trinity]], Staniforth wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Again in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.&lt;ref name="Marcus Aurelius 1964 25"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Paul of Tarsus|apostle Paul]] met with Stoics during his stay in Athens, reported in {{bibleverse||Acts|17:16–18|NKJV}}. In his [[Pauline epistles|letters]], Paul reflected heavily from his knowledge of Stoic philosophy, using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new [[Gentile]] converts in their understanding of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Kee, Howard and Franklin W. Young, ''Understanding The New Testament'', Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, Prentice Hall, Inc. 1958, p. 208. {{ISBN|978-0139365911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoic influence can also be seen in the works of [[St. Ambrose]], [[Marcus Minucius Felix]], and [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Stoicism Encyclopædia Britannica. Stoicism. §''Stoic elements in Pauline and patristic thought'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fathers of the Church]] regarded Stoicism as a "pagan philosophy";&lt;ref name="Agathias"&gt;[[Agathias]]. ''Histories,'' 2.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=David |first=Sedley |editor=E. Craig |encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |title=Ancient philosophy |url=http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/A130 |accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; nonetheless, early Christian writers employed some of the central philosophical concepts of Stoicism. Examples include the terms "logos", "[[virtue]]", "[[Spirit]]", and "[[conscience]]".&lt;ref name="ferg"&gt;Ferguson, Everett. ''Backgrounds of Early Christianity''. 2003, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; But the parallels go well beyond the sharing and borrowing of terminology. Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world, a belief in human kinship with Nature or God, a sense of the innate depravity—or "persistent evil"—of humankind,&lt;ref name="ferg" /&gt; and the futility and temporary nature of worldly possessions and attachments. Both encourage ''Ascesis'' with respect to the passions and inferior emotions such as lust, and envy, so that the higher possibilities of one's humanity can be awakened and developed.

Stoic writings such as ''[[Meditations]]'' by [[Marcus Aurelius]] have been highly regarded by many Christians throughout the centuries. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church]] accept the Stoic ideal of [[Apatheia|dispassion]] to this day.

Middle and Roman Stoics taught that sex is just within marriage, for unitive and procreative purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;Musonius Rufus.

[[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose of Milan]] was known for applying Stoic philosophy to his theology.

==Modern usage==
The word "stoic" commonly refers to someone indifferent to pain, pleasure, grief, or joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buildthefire.com/modern-stoicism/|title=Modern Stoicism {{!}} Build The Fire|date=9 February 2016|website=Build The Fire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern usage as "person who represses feelings or endures patiently" was first cited in 1579 as a [[noun]], and 1596 as an [[adjective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=stoic |title=Online Etymology Dictionary&amp;nbsp;– Stoic |accessdate=2006-09-02|last=Harper |first=Douglas |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the term "[[Epicureanism|Epicurean]]", the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's'' entry on Stoicism notes, "the sense of the English adjective 'stoical' is not utterly misleading with regard to its philosophical origins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;nbsp;– Stoicism |accessdate=2006-09-02 |last=Baltzly |first=Dirk |date=13 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seal Berlin 1280.png|thumb|upright|Seal of the city of [[Berlin]] (1280), showing the [[Brandenburg]] coat of arms flanked by two [[bear (heraldry)|bears]]]]

In [[heraldry]], '''supporters''', sometimes referred to as ''attendants'', are figures or objects usually placed on either side of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and depicted holding it up.

Early forms of supporters are found in medieval seals. However, unlike the [[coronet]] or [[helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] and [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], supporters were not part of early medieval heraldry. As part of the heraldic [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement]], they first become fashionable towards the end of the 15th century, but even in the 17th century were not necessarily part of the full heraldic [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] (being absent, for example, in ''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' of 1605).

The figures used as supporters may be based on real or imaginary animals, human figures, and in rare cases plants or other inanimate objects, such as the [[pillars of Hercules]] of the [[coat of arms of Spain]]. Often, as in other elements of heraldry, these can have local significance, such as the [[fisherman]] and the [[tin mine]]r granted to [[Cornwall County Council]], or a historical link; such as the lion of [[England]] and unicorn of [[Scotland]] in the two variations of the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom]]. The arms of nutritionist [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|John Boyd-Orr]] use two 'garbs' ([[wheat]] [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheave]]s) as supporters; the arms of {{USS|Donald Cook|DDG-75|6}}, [[missile]]s; the arms of the state of [[Rio Grande do Norte]] in [[Brazil]], [[tree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Rio_Grande_do_Norte|title=Rio Grande do Norte - Brasão de Rio Grande do Norte (coat of arms, crest)|author=|date=|website=www.ngw.nl|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grapheme|Letter]]s of the [[alphabet]] are used as supporters in the arms of [[Valencia]], Spain. Human supporters can also be [[Allegorical sculpture|allegorical figures]], or, more rarely, specifically named individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/br-sc-bl.html|title=Flags of the World — Blumenau, Santa Catarina(Brazil)|author=|date=|website=fotw.net|accessdate=18 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725143342/http://www.fotw.net/flags/br-sc-bl.html|archivedate=25 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is usually one supporter on each side of the shield, though there are some examples of single supporters placed behind the shield, such as the [[Reichsadler|imperial eagle]] of the [[coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[Coat of arms of the Republic of the Congo|arms of the Congo]] provide an extremely unusual example of two supporters issuing from behind the shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/afr/cg-nat.htm|title=Heraldry of the world - Congo_(Brazzaville)|author=|date=|website=www.ngw.nl|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While such single supporters are generally eagles&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Perth_and_Kinross Perth &amp; Kinross District Council] (Scotland) at Heraldry of the World&lt;/ref&gt; with one or two heads, there are other examples, including the [[cathedra]] in the case of some Canadian [[cathedral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=582&amp;ProjectElementID=2051|title=Saint Paul's Cathedral [Civil Institution]|first=The Office of the Secretary to the Governor|last=General|date=|website=archive.gg.ca|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme and even rarer, the Scottish chief [[Clan Dundas|Dundas of that Ilk]] had three supporters: two conventional red lions and the whole supported by a salamander.  The [[coat of arms of Iceland]] even has four supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Iceland Iceland] at Heraldry of the World&lt;/ref&gt;

The context of the application of supporters may vary, although entitlement may be considered conditioned by grant of a type of [[augmentation of honour]] by admission in [[orders of chivalry]] or by [[heraldic authorities]], such as in the case of traditional [[British heraldry]].

==Attitude==
{{main|Attitude (heraldry)}}
Animal supporters are, by default, as close to [[rampant]] as possible, if the nature of the supporter allows it (this does not need to be mentioned in the [[blazon]]), though there are some blazoned exceptions.  An example of whales 'non-rampant' is the arms of the Dutch municipality of [[Coat of arms of Zaanstad|Zaanstad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Zaanstad Zaanstad] at Heraldry of the World&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional development and entitlement==
{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
Older writers trace origins of supporters to their usages in tournaments, where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection, and guarded by their servants or pages disguised in fanciful attire. However, medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons.

===France===
In [[Kingdom of France|France]], writers made a distinctive difference on the subject of supporters, giving the name of ''Supports'' to animals, real or imaginary, thus employed; while human figures or angels similarly used are called ''Tenants'' (i.e. 'holders'). Trees and other inanimate objects which are sometimes used are called ''Soutiens''. 

===New Zealand===

===United Kingdom===
Originally, in England, supporters were regarded as little more than mere decorative and artistic appendages.

In the [[United Kingdom]], supporters are typically an example of special royal favour, granted at the behest of the sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Charles Boutell]] and [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]]|title=English Heraldry|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger|isbn=0-7661-4917-X|pages=238|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hereditary supporters are normally limited to [[hereditary peer]]s, certain members of the [[Royal Family]], and to some chiefs of [[Scottish clan]]s.  Non-hereditary supporters are granted to [[life peer]]s, Knights and Ladies of the [[Order of the Garter]] and [[Order of the Thistle]], Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]], [[Order of St Michael and St George]], [[Royal Victorian Order]] and [[Order of the British Empire]], and Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross of the [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]].  [[Knight banneret|Knights banneret]] were also granted non-hereditary supporters, but no such knight has been created since the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

&lt;!--'''Теневиль''' — чукотский оленевод, живший в тундре близ населенного пункта Усть-Белая (ок. 1890—1943? гг.). Примерно в 1927-28 года он самостоятельно изобрел письменность для чукотского языка. До сего дня неясно, было ли письмо Теневиля идеографическим или словесно-слоговым. Многие исследователи этого письма отмечали абстрактный характер его знаков, что могло косвенно свидетельствовать о продуманности данной системы письма.--&gt;
'''Tenevil''' ({{lang-ru|Теневиль}}) (ca. 1890–1943?) was a [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] [[Reindeer herding#Reindeer husbandry|reindeer herder]], living in the tundra near the settlement of [[Ust-Belaya]] in Russian province of [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]]. Around 1927 or 1928 he independently invented a writing system for the [[Chukchi language]]. It has never been established with certainty whether the symbols in this writing system were [[ideograms]]/[[pictograms]] or whether the system was [[logogram]]-based. Researchers have noted the abstract character of the symbols, which may be an indirect evidence that this writing system is entirely Tenevil's invention.

&lt;!--Чукотское письмо было обнаружено в 1930 г. советской экспедицией и описано известным путешественником, писателем и полярным исследователем В. Г. [[Богораз-Тан | Богораз-Таном]] (1865—1936). Чукотское письмо не имело широкого распространения и использовалось в пределах только одного стойбища. Кроме самого Теневиля, этим письмом владел его сын, с которым первый обменивался посланиями во время выпаса оленей. Теневиль наносил свои знаки на доски, кости, моржовые клыки и конфетные обёртки.--&gt;
Tenevil's writing system was first described by the Russian ethnographer and writer [[Waldemar Bogoras]] in 1930. The writing system was never widely known: it was used entirely within Tenevil's family encampment. Apart from Tenevil himself, the writing system was used by his son, with whom he exchanged messages during shifts away at the reindeer pastures. Tenevil wrote his symbols on boards, bones, walrus tusks, and candy wrappers.

&lt;!--Чукотское письмо — уникальное явление и представляет определенный ин¬терес при рассмотрении проблем зарождения письменных традиций у народов, находящихся на догосударственных этапах своего развития.
Чукотское письмо — самое северное из всех, где-либо разработанных ко¬ренной народностью при минимальном влиянии извне.--&gt;
This writing system is a unique phenomenon, and has wider significance to the research into the origins of writing traditions in the cultures in the pre-state stage of development. Tenevil's Chukchi writing system is the most northerly of all such systems to be developed by indigenous people with minimal outside influence.

&lt;!--Не решен вопрос об источниках и прототипах письма Теневиля. Принимая во внимание изолированность Чукотки от основных региональных цивилизаций, это письмо можно рассматривать как местное явление, усугубленное творческой инициативой гения-одиночки. Не исключено влияние на чукотское письмо рисунков на шаманских бубнах. Само слово ''письмо'' ('''''кэликэл''''') в чукотском (луораветланском) языке имеет тунгусо-маньчжурские парал¬лели.--&gt;
The sources and prototype of the Tenevil writing system are unknown. Taking into consideration the isolation of Chukotka from the regional centres of civilization, it could be considered a localized creative initiative of a lone genius. It is possible the writing system is influenced by the decorations on [[shaman]]s' drums. The word ''writing'' ('''''kelikel''''') in the [[Chukchi language]] has [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] parallels.

&lt;!--В 1945 году художник-искусствовед [[И. Лавров]] посетил верховье [[Анадырь | Анадыри]]. где некогда жил Теневиль. Там и был обнаружен «архив Теневиля» — ящик, занесённый снегом, в котором хранились памятники чукотского письма.Теневиль разработал и особые знаки для чисел на основе двадцатиричной системы счисления, характерной для чукотского языка. Учёные насчитывают около 1000 основных элементов чукотской письменности.--&gt;
In 1945 the artist and art historian [[I. Lavrov]] visited the upper reaches of the [[Anadyr River]] where Tenevil had lived. There he discovered the "Tenevil archive": a box, buried in the snow, containing relics of Tenevil's writing. Tenevil also developed symbols for numerals, using the base 20 counting system of the Chukchi language. About 1000 basic elements of the Tenevil writing system have been identified.

&lt;!--Известный чукотский писатель [[Юрий Рытхэу]] посвятил Теневилю роман «Сон в начале тумана», 1969 год.--&gt;
The Chukchi writer [[Yuri Rytkheu]] dedicated his 1969 novel ''[http://conversationalreading.com/a-dream-in-polar-fog-by-yuri-rytkheu A Dream in Polar Fog]'' to Tenevil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7449">[[File:Toma1.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Page from Thomas' [[Historia Salonitana]]]]
'''Thomas the Archdeacon''' ({{lang-la|Thomas Archidiaconus}}; {{lang-it|Tommaso Arcidiacono}}; {{lang-hr|Toma Arhiđakon}}; c. 1200 – 8 May 1268), also known as '''Thomas of Split''' ({{lang-la|Thomas Spalatensis}}), was a [[Roman Catholic]] cleric, historian and chronicler from [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. He is often referred to as one of the greatest sources in the historiography of Croatian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radoslav Katičić]]: "Toma Arhiđakon i njegovo djelo" in Toma Arhiđakon: Historia Salonitana, Split, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
What is known about Thomas' life comes from his work, ''[[Historia Salonitana]]''. He speaks of his life in the third person and very briefly, in the style of medieval literature genres. Thomas was born in Split at the beginning of the 13th century. It is not known whether he was of noble or common birth, but he represented the elite Roman culture that had survived from before the Slav migration, and he had a negative view of Slavs, often mistakenly conflating them in his chronicle with the Goths.&lt;ref name=Fine&gt;Fine (Jr), John V. A. (2006). ''When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans: A Study of Identity in Pre-Nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the Medieval and Early-Modern Periods.'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably educated at the [[cathedral school]] in Split. Around 1222 he was sent to study at the [[University of Bologna]]. There he perfected skills (under, among others, [[Accursius]]) in law, rhetoric, gramathic and notary (''ars dictandi'' and ars ''notaria'').&lt;ref&gt;Katičić: "Toma Arhiđakon i njegovo djelo", 2007, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] in [[Bologna]], a remarkable event which he mentioned in his work, describing the person of Saint Francis.&lt;ref&gt;Eodem anno in die assumptionis dei genitricis, cum essem Bononie in studio, uidi sanctum Franciscum predicantem in platea ante palatium publicum, ubi tota pene civitas convenerat. Fuit autem exordium sermonis eius: angeli, homines, demones. De his enim tribus spiritibus rationalibus ita bene et discrete proposuit, ut multis litteratis, qui aderant, fieret admirationi non modice sermo hominis ydiote; nec tamen ipse modum predicantis tenuit, sed quasi concionantis. Tota uero uerborum eius discurrebat materies ad extinguendas inimicitias et ad pacis federa reformanda. Sordidus erat habitus, persona contemtibilis, et facies indecora. Sed tantum deus uerbis illius contulit efficatiam, ut multe tribus nobilium, inter quas antiquarum inimicitarium furor immanis multa sanguinis effusione fuerat debachatus, ad pacis consilium reducenteretur. Erga ipsum uero  tam magna erat reuerentia hominum et deutio, ut uiri et mulieres in eum cateruatim  ruerent, satagentes vel fimbriam eius tangere , aut aliquid de paniculis eius auferre. [[Historia Salonitana]], p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon returning to his hometown of Split he advanced fast in church hierarchy. He became notary official (ca. 1227), then (1230) the archdeacon (head of the body of [[canon (priest)|canons]]). He described [[Mongol]] siege of Split (1242), Mongol customs and homeland, thus creating the first ethnological writings in local historiography.&lt;ref&gt;James Ross Sweeney: "Thomas of Spalato and the Mongols: a Thirteenth Century Dalmatian Views of Mongol Customs." ''Florilegium'' 4 (1982): 156 – 183.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1243 a body of canons chose Thomas to be archbishop of Split, however due to his views on Church autonomy in Split, commoners rebelled against him. Fearing for his life, he never occupied that function, and in the end resigned the honor. Because of that, in his work he wrote about future archbishops with bitterness. He died in Split on May 8, 1268. Today, his grave lies in the Church of St. Francis.&lt;ref&gt;On his tombstone are engraved the following words: Doctrinam, Christe, docet archidiaconus iste; Thomas, hanc tenuit, moribus et docuit; Mundum sperne, fuge viciu(m), carnem preme, luge; pro vite fruge, lubrica lucra fuge. Spalatemque dedit ortu(m), quo vita recedit. Dum mors succedit vite, mea gl(ori)a cedit. Hic me vermis edit, sic iuri mortis obedit; corpus quod ledit , a(n)i(m)amque qui sibi credit. A. D. MCCLXVIII. mense madii octavo die intrante. Tomislav Raukar: ''Hrvatsko srednjovjekovlje'' Zagreb, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==

Thomas was a stern advocate of [[medieval commune]] movement in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. He wrote about Croatian nobles (and Hungarian kings in his time) in the hinterland of the city with great animosity, because they tried to crush the autonomy of the city. And conversely, he treated fairly those who respected the commune autonomy (Croatian kings, and later, Hungarian kings in the 12th century). In 1239 he organized new („latin“) administration in Split, bringing Gargane de Ascindis from [[Ancona]], as the new [[Podestà]].&lt;ref&gt;Katičić: "Toma arhiđakon i njegovo djelo", 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an advocate of Church autonomy within the city (in accordance with official Roman Church teaching) which excluded commoners and citizens from interfering in Church business (such as the election of the archbishop).

== Work ==

Thomas' only work is the ''Historia Salonitana'', the history of the archibishops of [[Salona]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]] written in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;The work is available in several translations (Croatian, Russian etc.) The English translation is available from 2006: Thomae Archidiaconi Spalatensis / Archdeacon Thomas of Split, Historia Salonitanorum atque Spalatinorum pontificum / History of the bishops of Salona and Split. Latin text by Olga Perić, edited, translated and annotated by Damir Karbić, Mirjana Matijević-Sokol and James Ross Sweeney. Budapest; New York: Central European University Press, 2006, (Central European medieval texts, vol. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; The work itself is combining three medieval history genres – ''historia'', ''chronica'' and ''memoriale''. Eventually, his work outgrows the narrow theme of archbishops, and becomes an outstanding literary achievement which encompasses the whole of the Croatian medieval period up to the 13th century. Because of Thomas' original research in the archbisphoric's archive in Split, he brings facts and news from documents today unknown to contemporary historians. His work is therefore not only of great literally value, but also of historical value for [[Croatia]]n history.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Franjo Rački]]: Ocjena starijih izvora za hrvatsku i srbsku poviest srednjega vieka" ''Književnik'' I (1864) 358 – 388.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8588">'''Walter Bruyninckx''' (pronounced Brer-ninks; born 27 August 1932) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] jazz [[discography|discographer]], musicologist, jazz historian, author, and journalist.&lt;ref name="Obsession article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Notes review, 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Epperson" /&gt;

== Career highlights ==
While living in [[Mechelen]], [[Belgium]], in 1948, Bruyninckx co-founded a jazz club there while working as a newspaper journalist.  He later worked for [[UNICEF]]. After a serious car accident in 1965 in India, and during a period of convalescence in 1966, Bruyninckx developed a strong interest in jazz discography.  After conferring with discographer [[Albert McCarthy]] and major record collectors, Bruyninckx published ''50 Years of Recorded Jazz, 1917–1967'' — which included blues, gospel, and ragtime covers.  His work was supported by a larger group of volunteers.

For his third edition — ''70 Years of Recorded Jazz'' — Bruyninckx published 35 volumes of genre-specific discographies, initially for the Japanese market, of which 5 volumes covered progressive jazz ([[Jazz fusion|fusion]], [[free Jazz]], [[third stream]]), 4 volumes covered singers, 12 volumes covered swing and dance bands, 6 volumes covered traditional jazz, 6 volumes covered modern jazz ([[bebop]], [[hard bop]], [[West Coast jazz|West Coast]]), and 2 volumes covered modern jazz big bands.&lt;ref name="Barry Kernfield, Notes" /&gt;

=== Duration of discography project ===
Bruyninckx's discography is the longest running comprehensive jazz discography project.  Other long standing discography projects include those of [[The Jazz Discography|Tom Lord]], based in the [[Vancouver]] area of [[British Columbia, Canada]] (active {{Cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1992|02|01}}}} years — since 1992) and Erik Raben of Denmark (active {{Cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1989|02|01}}}} years — since 1989), and [[Jørgen Grunnet Jepsen]] ([[:de:Jørgen Grunnet Jepsen|de]]) of Denmark (died 1981).  Bruyninckx announced that he would stop after the 2007 edition, but left it open whether the publication would continue by someone else, namely his sons Lucien and Dominique Truffandier.

'''William Stener "Will" Ferguson''' (born October 12, 1964) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] travel writer and novelist best known for his humorous observations on Canadian [[History of Canada|history]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]].

His success as a writer can be attributed to an innate ability to view Canada much the same way an outsider would, as described in his debut book, ''Why I Hate Canadians''. Ferguson was born fourth of six children in the former fur trading post of [[Fort Vermilion, Alberta]], approximately 800&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Edmonton]]. His parents split up when he was six years old, during a brief interlude in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]. At the age of 16, he quit school and moved to [[Saskatoon]], [[Dauphin, Manitoba|Dauphin]], and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]].

Ferguson is also an outspoken critic of the [[monarchy of Canada]], both publicly and in his books. He is quoted in the media when the monarchy issue is being debated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadian-republic.ca/telegraph_journal_10_05_02.htm St.John Telegraph-Journal - ''Jubilee tour sparks debate'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadian-republic.ca/pdf_files/Royal%20Flush.pdf New Canadian Magazine - ''Royal Flush - Should we ditch the monarchy?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalusa.com/columnists/marsden/marsden_014.htm Marsden, Rachel PoliticalUSA.com - ''Defining a Nation'']&lt;/ref&gt; He also profiles [[Secessionist movements of Canada|Canadian secessionist and independence movements]] (such as the "[[Republic of Madawaska]]") in his book ''Beauty Tips from Moose Jaw'' (2004).

== Personal life ==
He completed his high school education at Lindsay Thurber Comprehensive High School (L.T.C.H.S.) in Red Deer, and was awarded the Alexander Rutherford Scholarships in all available categories.  He then joined the Canadian government funded programs [[Katimavik]] and [[Canada World Youth]]. The latter program sent him to [[Ecuador]] in South America, as described in his book ''Why I Hate Canadians''. He studied film production and screenwriting at [[York University]] in Toronto, graduating with a B.F.A. (Special Honours) in 1990.

He currently resides in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], with his wife and two sons. His older brother, [[Ian Ferguson (writer)|Ian Ferguson]], also won the Stephen Leacock Medal, for ''Village of the Small Houses'' in 2004. Another brother, Sean Ferguson, is currently the dean of music at McGill University.

Ferguson joined the [[JET Programme]] in the early 1990s, and lived in [[Kyushu]], Japan for five years [[English language learning and teaching|teaching English]]. He married Terumi in [[Kumamoto]], Japan in 1995. After coming back from Japan he experienced a severe reverse [[culture shock]], which became the basis for his first book ''Why I Hate Canadians''. He details his experiences hitchhiking across Japan in ''Hokkaido Highway Blues'', later retitled ''Hitching Rides with Buddha''.

==Awards and honours==
Ferguson was a runner-up for the 1999 [[Edna Staebler Award]] for [[Creative Non-Fiction]] for ''I Was a Teenage Katima Victim: A Canadian Odyssey''.&lt;ref name="wlu99"&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140606164212/https://www.wlu.ca/page.php?grp_id=2529&amp;p=11314 ''Wilfrid Laurier University''] 1999: Michael Poole, (retrieved 11/17/2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson has won the [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]] three times: first for ''Generica'' (later renamed ''Happiness'') in 2002, then for ''Beauty Tips from Moose Jaw'' in 2005 and for his travel memoir ''Beyond Belfast'' in 2010.

Ferguson won the 2012 [[Giller Prize]] for ''419: A Novel'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/books/article/1280103--will-ferguson-takes-giller-prize-for-novel-419 Will Ferguson takes Giller Prize for novel 419] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227223357/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/books/article/1280103--will-ferguson-takes-giller-prize-for-novel-419 |date=2012-12-27 }} ''[[Toronto Star]]'', October 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The novel went on to win the 2013 Libris Award from the Canadian Booksellers Association for Fiction Book of the Year.

'''William Edward David Allen''' (6 January 1901 – 18 September 1973) was a British scholar, Foreign Service officer, politician and businessman, best known as a historian of the [[South Caucasus]]—notably [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. He was closely involved in the politics of [[Northern Ireland]], and had [[Fascism|fascist]] tendencies.

==Career==
Born in London and brought up in Hertfordshire, he was educated at [[Eton College]] (1914-1918), where he began to learn Russian and Turkish. He published his first book, ''The Turks in Europe'', when he was eighteen.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50331 "Allen, William Edward David", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']&lt;/ref&gt; He was a special correspondent for the ''Morning Post'' during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] and the [[Rif Republic|Rif War]] (1925).

In the pre-[[World War II]] years, he travelled a lot and conducted extensive research on the history of the peoples of the [[Caucasus]] and [[Anatolia]]. In 1930, along with [[Sir Oliver Wardrop]], he founded the Georgian Historical Society; the Society published its own journal, ''Georgica'', dedicated to [[Kartvelian studies]].

His mother financed his personal enterprises until around 1935, and also provided a home at Commonwood House, Chipperfield, Hertfordshire, where he and his brothers could bring their guests at weekends: in Allen's case, he wrote later, these would include 'bizarre intellectuals, Caucasian philologists and exiled national leaders from the remoter parts of Central Asia'.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

In 1940-1, he accompanied [[Orde Wingate]] on his mission to Abyssinia, and wrote a book of his experiences called ''Guerrilla War in Abyssinia''.&lt;ref name="TPP 09.04.1944"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpress.org.il/Repository/getimage.dll?path=PLS/1944/04/09/4/Img/Pg004_122.png |title=Wingate of the Gideonites |author=W.E.D. Allen |date=9 April 1944 |newspaper=The Palestine Post |accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 1941 the Italian division won a victory; what they did know was that a much smaller force opposed them.  Wingate set out to fool them in a game of deception: Allen remarked "Perhaps God fights on the side of great hearts and not of the big battalions."  The tactic of surprise attacks behind unnerved the garrison at Debra Markos which scarpered in some disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Guerilla War, p.31; Foot, p.222&lt;/ref&gt; He also met and recorded the activities of other SOE comrades Tony Simonds and Billy Maclean remarkable for their informality and eccentricities as their soldierly demeanour.&lt;ref&gt;Foot, SOE, pp.9, 297&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote with Paul Muratoff ([[Pavel Muratov]]) two volumes on the Russian campaign for [[Penguin Books]]. [[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]] wrote that they (particularly the second volume) are examples of skilful exploitation of contemporary sources, and even today retain considerable value, including the elucidation of terrain factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Erickson |first= John |title= The Road to Berlin: Stalin’s War with Germany: Volume Two |accessdate= |edition= 2 |origyear= 1983 |year= 1999 |publisher=  Yale University Press |location= New Haven |isbn= 0-300-07813-7 |oclc= |page= |pages= 789, 836 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen was a [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Foreign Service]] officer from 1943—notably information counsellor at Ankara between 1947 and 1949—until he stepped down and returned to his native [[Ulster]] in 1949. There he divided his working time between running the family business (''David Allen's'', a major bill-posting company) and writing the two major books which he completed during the 1950s: ''Caucasian Battlefields'' (1953, with [[Pavel Muratov]]), and ''David Allens'' (1957, an account of the business and a collective biography of the Allen family). His last book, ''Russian Embassies to the Georgian Kings (1589-1605)'', written with the help of the translator Anthony Mango, was published in two volumes by the [[Hakluyt Society]] in 1970.

After his death in 1973, his extensive library of books on Georgia and the Caucasus was estimated at £30,000 (worth between £280,000 and £530,000 in 2014).&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/ "Measuring Worth" website]&lt;/ref&gt; This library is now part of the [[Indiana University]]'s [[Lilly Library]], which describes it as being 'rich in travel narratives, chronicles and works in linguistics, and [containing] a number of books and some manuscripts in the Georgian language'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/collections/overview/history_europe.shtml The Lilly Library: Guide to the Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career and fascism==
Allen stood unsuccessfully in [[Fermanagh and Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and Tyrone]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922 general election]],&lt;ref name="Craig-Fermanagh"&gt;{{cite book |last=Craig |first=F. W. S. |authorlink= F. W. S. Craig  |title=British parliamentary election results 1918–1949 |origyear=1969 |edition=3rd |year=1983 |publisher= Parliamentary Research Services |location=Chichester |isbn=0-900178-06-X |page=660}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was elected seven years later on his next attempt, at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]] as the [[Conservative Party (UK)#Conservatives and Unionists|Unionist]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]].&lt;ref name="Craig-Belfast"&gt;{{cite book |last=Craig |first=F. W. S. |authorlink= F. W. S. Craig  |title=British parliamentary election results 1918–1949 |origyear=1969 |edition=3rd |year=1983 |publisher= Parliamentary Research Services |location=Chichester |isbn=0-900178-06-X |page=654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He defected from the Unionists in 1931, to join Sir [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[New Party (Oswald Mosley)|New Party]], but did not contest the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]].&lt;ref name="Craig-Belfast" /&gt;  He was a close friend of Mosley helping him to pursue his fascist ambitions from behind the scenes, by supporting him financially and by contributing mainly anonymous articles to ''The [[Blackshirt]]'', including  "The Letters of [[Lucifer]]".  Allen also wrote ''[[British Union of Fascists|BUF]], Oswald Mosley and British Fascism'' (1934) under the pen name of "James Drennan".

It was believed that assertions he was an MI5 informant were false&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesecrets.co.uk/who/index-a.html Statesecrets.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; however documents now available in the National Archive confirm that he was interviewed by MI5 and gave over information regarding the BUF's funding from Fascist Italy.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archive (1942), KV 3/35 14. ''British Union evidence of support from Italy'' (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married: (1) from 1922 to 1932, to Lady Phyllis Edith King (1897–1947), the daughter of Lionel Fortescue King, 3rd [[Earl of Lovelace]] (1865–1929);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp61667 National Portrait Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; (2) from 1932 to 1939, to [[Paula Gellibrand]] (1898–1986), once one of [[Cecil Beaton]]'s favourite models, formerly the wife of the Marquis de Casa Maury and formerly the wife of Ivan Wilkie Brooks; and (3) from 1943, to Nathalie Maximovna (c.1900-1966).

'''William James Anderson''' (2 November 1812 – 15 May 1873) was a physician, amateur geologist and historian of Scottish descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=4796 Biography of William James Anderson from Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Volume X (1871-1880)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied medicine at [[Edinburgh]], where he obtained the degree of MD. Anderson was a physician in [[the Maritimes]] in the 1830s. At that time he developed an interest in the history and geology of [[Nova Scotia]]. After a serious health problem he left the medical profession and the Maritimes in 1847. He was in the lumber business in [[Upper Canada]] and moved to [[Quebec City]] in 1860.

In 1873, Anderson died in Quebec City of [[Tuberculosis]]. He was survived by a wife and daughter.

'''William Miller Macmillan''' (1 October 1885 in [[Aberdeen, Scotland]] – 23 October 1974 in [[Long Wittenham]], [[Berkshire]]), England&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|last=Lavin|first=Deborah|title=Macmillan, William Miller (1885–1974)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37723|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=19 September 2013|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/37723|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; is regarded as  a founder of the liberal school of [[South Africa]]n [[historiography]] and as a forerunner of the radical school of historiography that emerged in the 1970s. He was also a critic of colonial rule and an early advocate of self-government for colonial territories in Africa and of what became known as development aid.

==Early life==
Macmillan was born in Aberdeen, Scotland on 1 October 1885. He was the son of the Reverend John Macmillan (born Glen Urquhart, [[Inverness, Scotland]] 1831, died [[Stellenbosch, South Africa]],1909).  His mother was Elizabeth Caird Lindsay (born [[Glasgow, Scotland]] 1845, died [[Cape Town, South Africa]],1927). John Macmillan served with the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] mission in [[India]] and was a founder with the Reverend William Miller of the Free Church College in [[Madras, India]], now the [[Madras Christian College]].

William Macmillan travelled to South Africa in 1891 with his mother and five elder siblings to join his father, who was working at the Victoria College, Stellenbosch, now the [[University of Stellenbosch]]. He attended the Boys High School, Stellenbosch, and did the first two years of the BA degree at the Victoria College, matriculating in 1901 and passing the intermediate exams in 1903. Following the death of [[Cecil Rhodes]] in 1902, Macmillan was in 1903 one of the first group of [[Rhodes Scholar]]s at [[Oxford University]] in England.

Macmillan studied [[modern history]] at [[Merton College]] and graduated in 1906.&lt;ref name="MCreg"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled for the divinity course at the [[Free Church College]] in Aberdeen, and also studied divinity in [[Glasgow]], but he did not proceed to the ministry. An important influence on Macmillan's later work was the semester that he spent at the Kaiser Wilhelm University in Berlin in 1910. He was fluent in [[German language|German]] (as well as [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaan]]s) and attended the lectures of the [[ecclesiastical]] historian, [[Adolf von Harnack]], the economic historian [[Gustav Schmoller]], and the pioneer sociologist, [[Franz Oppenheimer]]. Macmillan joined the [[Fabian Society]] in 1911 and remained an evolutionary [[socialist]] or [[social democrat]] for most of his life, reverting to liberalism in old age.

==Career in South Africa==
Macmillan returned to South Africa in 1911 to become a lecturer in history and economics at [[Rhodes University]] College, [[Grahamstown, South Africa]], where he remained until 1917, when he became the first professor of history at the Johannesburg School of Mines (later the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]).&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt;

While in Grahamstown, Macmillan did pioneering work on poverty among white South Africans. He was the only English-speaking delegate at the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] congress on White Poverty, which was held at [[Cradock, Eastern Cape]] in 1916. Macmillan's first published work appeared anonymously as a pamphlet, ''Sanitary Reform for Grahamstown'' in 1915. This was followed in the same year by ''Economic Conditions in a Non-industrial South African Town''. In 1918, Macmillan did substantial fieldwork on white poverty in rural areas, resulting in lectures and a book, ''The South African Agrarian Problem and its Historical Development'', published in [[Johannesburg]] in 1919.

In 1920, the family of Dr [[John Philip (died c. 1920)|John Philip]] entrusted Macmillan with his papers.  Philip was the superintendent of the [[London Missionary Society]] in South Africa in the first half of the 19th century. In the following decade, Macmillan produced two important books, ''The Cape Colour Question'' (1927) and ''[[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Boer]] and Briton: The Making of the South African Native Problem''. These books rewrote the history of South Africa in the first half of the nineteenth century, introducing a new emphasis on the history of South Africa as the history of all its people. The third volume of a trilogy, ''Complex South Africa'' (1930), brought together his early work on white poverty with work done in the 1920s on African poverty, including his pioneering work on the economics of the reserves, and his 'sample survey' of the Herschel district in [[Eastern Cape]].

Macmillan was one of the first people to articulate a vision of South African as a single society. This view brought him into conflict with the segregationist government of the day as well as with liberal segregationists. He became chairman of the Johannesburg Joint Council of Natives and Europeans and was involved in 1932 with public clashes with the ministers of Native Affairs and of Justice – the latter was [[Oswald Pirow]]. After the University of Witwatersrand sought to gag Macmillan, he went on [[sabbatical]] leave at the end of 1932, but he did not return to the university. He resigned in September 1933.

==Work on Colonial Africa and the West Indies==
After the completion of his work on Dr John Philip in 1929, Macmillan began traveling in Central, East, and West Africa. At this time, he began work on issues of governance in [[Colonial Africa]]. He published this  work as ''Africa Emergent'' in 1938. Macmillan was a major critic of colonial rule and an advocate of a gradual democratisation of colonial rule through the introduction of representative, as opposed to 'traditional', systems of local government. He was at the same time critical of the colonial doctrine of financial self-sufficiency and became an advocate of aid. Macmillan had travelled to the United States and the [[West Indies]] in 1934-5 and was shocked by the neglect of the West Indian islands. His critique of colonial rule in these territories was published as ''Warning from the West Indies'' in 1936 - it was republished as a Penguin special in 1938.

Following his return to the United Kingdom in 1932, Macmillan was unable to secure academic employment and remained self-employed until after the outbreak of [[World War II]]. He was, however, active in a number of pressure groups including the Friends of Africa, the [[Anti-Slavery Society]], the [[British Labour Party]]'s committee on Imperial Questions, and with the [[Trade Union Congress]].

==Wartime work==
After the outbreak of the Second World War he became a member of the [[Colonial Office]] Advisory Committee on Education and was a member of the Channon sub-committee on Higher Education. This drew up the guidelines for the postwar expansion of university education in Africa and the West Indies. He was also a signatory of the report on Mass Education which recommended the extension of primary and adult education in the colonies. From 1941-3 he worked as director of Empire Intelligence for the [[BBC]]. In that capacity, Macmillan helped lay the foundations of the World and Africa Services of the BBC.

From 1943-6 Macmillan was Senior Representative of the British Council in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; He was based at [[Accra]] in the Gold Coast (now [[Ghana]]), but was also responsible for the inauguration of the council's work in [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]] and the [[Gambia]], including libraries and scholarship schemes.

==Postwar career==
After the war, the postwar Labour government supported Macmillan's appointment as director of Colonial Studies at the [[University of St Andrews]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; He returned to South Africa for the first time in seventeen years to give the Hoernle Memorial lecture in [[Durban]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; In 1951 the British government sent Macmillan on a three-man observer mission to [[Bechuanaland]] to advise on the status of [[Tshekedi Khama]] who had been excluded from the [[Bamangwato]] Reserve in the wake of the crisis over the marriage of Seretse and Ruth Khama.

Macmillan retired from St Andrews in 1954 and served for one year, 1954-5, as acting professor of History at the [[University of the West Indies]] in [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; After his wartime experience in [[West Africa]], he became skeptical about the claims of [[African Nationalism]] and was broadly supportive of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], which the British government saw as a bulwark against the spread of [[Afrikaner]] nationalism from the south and African nationalism from the north.

==Family==
He married firstly in 1913 Jean Sutherland, daughter of the Reverend John Sutherland of Uitenhague, South Africa, and, secondly, Mona Constance Marion Tweedie, daughter of Admiral Sir Hugh Tweedie, KCB, and his wife, Constance Marion (Mona) Crossman.&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; He acknowledged the help of his first wife in the production of his first four books and of his second wife in the production of his later works. He  met Mona Tweedie in 1931 and was married to her after divorce from his first wife in 1936. Mona Macmillan became an author in her own right, publishing ''Introducing East Africa'' in 1952, ''The Land of Look Behind: A Study of Jamaica'' (1957), ''Mediator and Moderator: The life of Sir Henry Barkly'' (1969), ''Champion of Africa: W.M. Macmillan, the second phase'' (1985), and a memoir, ''Mona's Story'', posthumously, in 2008. She also edited the writings of the controversial Zambian archbishop, Emmanuel Milingo, and, with her daughter, Catriona, the correspondence of the Pratt family. She died in Oxfordshire in 2003 at the age of 95. There were no children from the first marriage and four children from the second marriage.&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt;

His elder son, the eminent art historian and writer [[Duncan Macmillan (art historian)|Duncan Macmillan]] FRSA FRSE HRSA, is Emeritus Professor of Art History at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and was curator of the university's [[Talbot Rice Gallery]]. He is the author of books including ''Scottish Art, 1460-2000'', ''Painting in Scotland: The Golden Age'', ''Painting in Scotland in the Twentieth Century'' and ''Scotland's Shrine: The Scottish National War Memorial''. He is the art critic of [[The Scotsman]].

His younger son, Hugh Macmillan, has worked at universities in Swaziland, Zambia and South Africa, and is currently a research associate at the African Studies Centre, University of Oxford. He is the author of ''The Lusaka Years: The ANC in Exile in Zambia, 1963–94'' (2013); ''An African Trading Empire: The story of Susman Brothers &amp; Wulfsohn'' (2005), and of ''Zion in Africa: The Jews of Zambia'' (1999, with Frank Shapiro). He has also written pocket biographies of Chris Hani, Jack Simons and Oliver Tambo and is the co-editor with Shula Marks of ''Africa and Empire: W.M. Macmillan, historian and social critic'' (1989). His elder daughter, Lindsay, married Alexander Arthur Dow, and had a career as a teacher in Zambia and Scotland. His younger daughter, Catriona, married Colonel Alistair Miller, Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, and had a career as a hotelier in Dorset. She edited, with her mother, ''Exiles of Empire'', the nineteenth century correspondence of the Pratt family between Scotland, India and Australia.

==Honours==
Macmillan was awarded honorary degrees of [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] by Oxford University in 1957, [[University of Natal]] in 1962,&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; and [[Edinburgh University]] in 1974.

[[File:Wisconsin Death Trip book cover.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Cover]]

'''''Wisconsin Death Trip''''' is a 1973 [[non-fiction]] book by [[Michael Lesy]], based on a collection of late 19th century photographs by [[Jackson County, Wisconsin]] photographer Charles Van Schaick &amp;ndash; mostly taken in the city of [[Black River Falls]] &amp;ndash; and local news reports from the same period. It emphasizes the harsh aspects of [[Midwest]]ern rural life under the pressures of [[crime]], [[disease]], [[mental illness]], and [[urbanization]].

The book was adapted into a film in 1999.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|Wisconsin Death Trip (film)}}
The 1999 film adaptation was directed by [[James Marsh (director)|James Marsh]] as a [[docudrama]]. It was shot primarily in [[black-and-white]], with contrasting color sequences of modern life in the area. It combined re-enactments of some of the events described in the book with a voice-over narration by [[Ian Holm]]. Its visual style was intended to carry the content of the film; as Marsh said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted to convey in the film the real pathos contained in a four line newspaper report that simultaneously records and dismisses the end of someone’s life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsindeathtrip.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
'''Music'''&lt;br&gt;
The book inspired a number of musical works, including the opera ''Black River''  by [[Conrad Susa]], which was composed in 1975 and revised 1981; the "dramatic cantata" ''Songs of Madness and Sorrow'' by [[Daron Hagen]]; and the 1999 album ''[[Wisconsin Death Trip (album)|Wisconsin Death Trip]]'' by the band [[Static-X]]. British post-punk band [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]] used photographs from the book as artwork for their 2001 album ''[[Flowers (Echo &amp; the Bunnymen album)|Flowers]]'', as well as its singles. A song performed by [[Jerry Joseph]] was inspired by the title of the film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jerryjoseph.com/lyrics/self-titled-lyrics/&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, the book was adapted into a bluegrass/roots-rock opera by Tim Raphael and composer Jeff Berkson, which had its world premiere at [[Georgetown University]]'s Davis Performing Arts Center on February 1, 2008.  The soundtrack for the film adaptation of the book features original music by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[John Cale]].

'''Literature'''&lt;br&gt;
The Australian author [[Rod Jones (author)|Rod Jones]] cites ''Wisconsin Death Trip'' as an inspiration for his novel ''Billy Sunday'', and the American author [[Robert Goolrick]] also cites it as an inspiration for his novel ''A Reliable Wife.'' [[Stephen King]]'s book of novellas, ''[[Full Dark, No Stars]]'', cites ''Wisconsin Death Trip'' as the inspiration for the story ''[[1922 (novella)|1922]]''. The American author [[Stewart O'Nan]] "acknowledges his great debt to Michael Lesy," citing ''Wisconsin Death Trip'' as an inspiration for his novel ''A Prayer for the Dying''. (NB: at least one early Picador edition misattributes this to "Michael Levy".)

'''Film'''&lt;br&gt;
In commentary on the two-disc DVD release of the [[Bob Dylan]] [[biopic]] ''[[I'm Not There]]'', director [[Todd Haynes]] said that much of the imagery for the town of Riddle in the [[Richard Gere]] segment of the film was inspired by Lesy's book. Director [[Walter Murch]] also used the book as an historical source for the 1985 [[cult film|cult classic]] ''[[Return to Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film | author=Ondaatje, Michael | year=2002 | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Television'''&lt;br&gt;
The creators of the show ''[[The Heart, She Holler]]'' have discussed being influenced by the book in the creation of their show about rural America.&lt;ref&gt;Czajkowski, Elise. [http://splitsider.com/2013/09/inside-the-inbred-horror-comedy-of-the-heart-she-holler/ "Inside the Inbred Horror Comedy of 'The Heart, She Holler'"] ''Splitsider'' (December 26, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prof.]] [[PhDr.]] '''Zdeněk Kárník''', DrSc. (Czech pronunciation: [ˈZdenyek 'Car-neek]; 25 June 1931 in Dobré, [[Rychnov nad Kněžnou District]] - 30 September 2011 in Prague&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejinyasoucasnost.cz/archiv/2011/11/neskryval-odvahu-i-hrdsot-a-umel-zurocit-uspech/|title=Neskrýval odvahu i hrdost a uměl zúročit úspěch|last=Čechurová|first=Jana |publisher=Dějiny a současnost|language=Czech|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[historian]] and [[pedagogue]].

==Life==
Zdeněk Kárník was born to the family of Eastern Bohemian tradesman František Kárník. His early influences include his elder brother František who worked as a lecturer and later as an assistant professor at Vysoká škola politických a hospodářských věd (University of Political and Economic Sciences) and was a resolute patriot and an anti-nazi resistance supporter during [[World War II]]; he died prematurely at age 38. Zdeněk Kárník graduated from the Reálné gymnázium F. M. Pelcla (F. M. Pelcl High School) in [[Rychnov nad Kněžnou]] and was a student of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the UPES from 1950; the Faculty was merged with the Faculty of Philosophy and History of the [[Charles University]] from 1952; and he started teaching at the institution in 1954, becoming a modern Czechoslovak history lecturer in 1965. Zdeněk Kárník got involved in the renascence movement of 1968 at the Faculty; as a result, he had to quit teaching in 1969 and was forced to leave the faculty altogether one year later. He was permitted to return in 1990 (as the Head of the Social History Seminar of the Institute for Economic and Social History). In the meantime (1970–1990), he worked at the State Heritage Care Centre for the Central Bohemian Region. He published in the ''samizdat'' (as an editor of ''Historický sborník'' - ''Historical Proceedings'', published 1978 to 1989) and/or under other names. He has worked at the Charles University in [[Prague]], [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] and University of Pedagogy in [[Hradec Králové]] – Faculty of Arts, later Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Hradec Králové. In 1993 he was an adjunct professor at [[Ruhr-Universität Bochum]], and he was on internship in [[Vienna]] in 1998. A member of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] between 1956 and 1969, he left the party later on (expulsed in 1970). His hobbies included skiing, hiking, and classical music.

==Brief description of the work==
Zdeněk Kárník initially focused on the history of the [[workers' movement]] and [[socialist parties]], extending his interest later on to the history of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|First]] and [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Second]] Czechoslovak Republics (1918–1939) in relation to the period of the existence of [[Austria-Hungary]]: ''Socialisté na rozcestí: Habsburk, Masaryk či Šmeral?'' (''Socialists at the Crossroads: The Habsburg, Masaryk, or Šmeral?'' 1968, extended edition in 1996), ''České země v éře První republiky (1918–1938)'', I–III (''Bohemia in the First Republic Era (1918-1938)'', ed. 2000-2003), ''Malé dějiny československé (1867–1939)'' (''Small History of Czechoslovakia (1867–1039)'', 2007). Professor Kárník’s professional creed was: “Find the cause of the phenomenon regardless of others’ and your own previous conviction or opinion.”

In his [[inaugural dissertation]], ''První pokusy o založení komunistické strany v Čechách'' (''Initial Attempts at Founding a Communist Party in Bohemia''), he focused on radical leftist groupings, primarily [[anarchists]] and [[Anarchist communism|anarchist-communists]]. His chef d’oeuvre about ‘socialists at the crossroads’ focuses in detail on the developments in the [[social democracy|social democrats’]] policies in Bohemia during the [[First World War]] in the [[Czechs|Czech]], [[Austrian-Hungarian]], and international political context. The extensive trilogy on the First Republic brings a multifaceted analysis and description of the political, economic, demographic, social, and cultural and scientific development between the two world wars. The book is illustrated with images and tables, and the third tome analyses in detail the tragic period of the way to [[Munich Agreement]]. The work also takes into consideration the developments in [[Slovakia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. His subsequent (and again extensive) work with a modest title of ''Small History of Czechoslovakia (1867–1939)'' approaches the topic from new positions. The timeline in itself is of principal importance, suggesting that the author examined both the prelude to the rise of the first Czechoslovak state towards the close of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] and its epilogue – the Second Republic. The delivery tends towards the non-fiction fiction genre, in places focusing even more on the topics brought up by the ‘trilogy’, with more attention focused on Slovakia. Compared with the ‘trilogy’, the illustrations are much more extensive and illustration captions have the form of extensive explanations.

Kárník’s editorial work is also of importance: Karel Kazbunda, ''Otázka česko-německá v předvečer Velké války'' (''Czech-German Question at the Dawn of the Great War'', 1995), ''Bolševismus, komunismus a radikální socialismus v Československu'', I–V (''Bolshevism, Communism, and Radical Socialism in Czechoslovakia'', 2003–2005), ''K novověkým sociálním dějinám českých zemí'', I–IV (''On the Modern Times History of Bohemia'', 1998–2001), etc. He also wrote a number of articles, essays, and 2 children’s books about a group of boys set in the vicinity of Castle Handštejn during [[World War II]].

Zdeněk Kárník has also contributed to the periodicals ''Památkářské práce'' (''Heritage Works''), ''Acta Oeconomica Pragensia'','' Historický obzor'' (''Historical Horizon''), ''Východočeské listy historické'' (''Eastern Bohemian Historical Letters''), ''Acta historica et museologica Universitatis Silesianae Opaviensis'' et al., to the Larousse encyclopaedia, and a number of collections and publications focusing on heritage preservation.

'''Édouard Charton''' (11 May 1807 &amp;ndash; 27 February 1890) was an eminent French literary figure who was the founder and, for fifty-five years (1833–88), editor-in-chief of the publication ''Magasin pittoresque'', in addition to serving for thirty years (1860–90) as director of publication for [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette]]. 
 
A native of [[Sens]] in the [[Bourgogne]] ''[[Regions of France|région]]'', Édouard Charton trained as a lawyer, receiving his degree at the age of 20. His first great dedication to a cause came two years later when, during 1829&amp;ndash;31, using his oratorical skills, he became a traveling propagator for the social philosophy of [[Saint-Simonism]], which ultimately resulted for him in great disappointment.

From his mid-forties onward, he spent many years in politics, serving in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] as Deputy and Senator, expressing his convictions which formed a continuation and refinement of the previous century's [[Age of Enlightenment]]: faith in progress and the [[emancipation]] of people through education; respect for [[human dignity]], constant fight for the dissemination of knowledge and political action in favor of [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[republic]]an ideas.

He reaffirmed the [[moral values]] acquired within his family and found inspiration in the works of [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin]], the [[Mysticism|mystic]] who used "[[Unknown Philosopher]]" as his [[nom de plume]]. He also gathered experience in philanthropy, discovered the problems involved in the social condition of man, tested solutions, and worked for what he felt were noble causes, establishing durable and useful friendships with men who shared common ideals.

In 1833 he put into effect his ideals of "fighting ignorance" by starting a new publication ''Le Magasin pittoresque'' (''pittoresque'' means that the publication was illustrated). He was inspired by the British [[Penny Magazine]].
He remained at the helm director of the successful enterprise until 1888, past his eightieth birthday. For more than a half-century, he always pursued the same aims, while collecting and writing texts, selecting [[engravings]], and supervising the printing and distribution of what he referred to as an "out-of-order encyclopedia".

Applying the same rigor and consistency, he chose the best collaborators to propagate practical knowledge while stimulating curiosity and forming artistic tastes. ''[[L'Illustration]]'', a renowned pictorial review, created in 1843 on his initiative, lasted a century (to 1944). In 1860, he embarked upon a working partnership with [[Louis Hachette]] and his successors, which would continue for the remaining thirty years of his life. It gave him the opportunity to reach new readers with the travel and exploration review ''[[Le Tour du Monde]]'' (''World Tour'') and the scientific publication ''Bibliothèque des merveilles'' (''Library of Wonders'').
 
Based on the conviction that man could improve and progress through the acquisition of knowledge, Charton applied his considerable efforts disseminating "practical knowledge" to the greatest number, using his great writing talent only to inform and provide moral guidance. After the [[French Revolution of 1848]], his friend [[Hippolyte Carnot]], who was appointed the Minister of Public Instruction and Religion, recruited Charton as Secretary General of the Ministry. It was the beginning of his political career.

Although an opponent of [[Napoleon III]]'s 1852 [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], Charton adapted to the circumstances, without ever denying his Republican convictions. He promoted public reading with the creation of popular libraries, participated in the creation of the Paris Museum of [[Anthropology]] and showed throughout his life a consistency of behavior as testified by his friends and two generations of colleagues.
 
He was described as a man of action able to overcome his anxiety-ridden personal nature. Faithful in friendship, he maintained relations with those who shared his belief in the moral progress of man, whereby the progress of each individual led to the progress of humanity as a whole. In the National Assembly, he remained in the background despite his talents as a speaker. When he did take the floor, it was to raise crucial points speak concerning questions of education, fine arts and the press, as well as to express his opposition to the death penalty.

Encouraging his colleagues to reach a consensus, he could also remain firm and intransigent on points of principle. During the Second Empire, he turned down the post of director of the [[Comédie française]] which would have necessitated swearing an oath to the Emperor. 
Political misalliances prevented him from attaining what would have been the crowning glories of his life&amp;mdash;serving as Head of Administration, or as Minister of Fine Arts, both opportunities to demonstrate his organizational talents.
