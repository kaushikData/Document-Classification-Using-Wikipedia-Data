[[File:798创意广场.jpg|thumb|200px|The Factory #798]]
'''798 Art Zone''' ({{zh|c=798艺术区|p=798 Yìshùqū}}), or '''Dashanzi Art District''', comprise a complex of 50-year-old decommissioned [[military]] [[factory]] buildings boasting a unique [[architectural style]], located in [[Dashanzi]], [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] of [[Beijing]], that houses a thriving [[artist]]ic [[community]]. The area is often called the '''798 Art District''' or '''Factory 798''' although technically, '''Factory #798''' is only one of several structures inside a complex formerly known as '''718 Joint Factory'''. The buildings are within alleys number 2 and 4 on Jiǔxiānqiáo Lù (酒仙桥路), south of the Dàshānziqiáo [[Overpass|flyover]] (大山子桥). In recent years, it has been the main venue for the annual [[Beijing Queer Film Festival]] and [[Beijing Design Week]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chinas-beijing-queer-film-festival-577997|title=China's Beijing Queer Film Festival Concludes Without Government Interference|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|author=Patrick Brzeski|date=1 July 2013|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

[[File:798工厂展厅.jpg|left|thumb|300px|798 Space gallery, January 2009. Old Maoist slogans are visible on the ceiling arches.]]
The Dashanzi factory complex began as an extension of the "Socialist Unification Plan" of military-industrial cooperation between the [[Soviet Union]] and the newly formed [[People's Republic of China]]. By 1951, 156 "joint factory" projects had been realized under that agreement, part of the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s first [[Five-year plans of China|Five-Year Plan]]. However the [[People's Liberation Army]] still had a dire need of modern electronic components, which were produced in only two of the joint factories. The Russians were unwilling to undertake an additional project at the time, and suggested that the Chinese turn to [[East Germany]] from which much of the Soviet Union's electronics equipment was imported. So at the request of then-Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], scientists and engineers joined the first Chinese trade delegation to East Germany in 1951, visiting a dozen factories. The project was green-lighted in early 1952 and a Chinese preparatory group was sent to [[East Berlin]] to prepare design plans. This project, which was to be the largest by East Germany in China, was then informally known as Project #157.

The architectural plans were left to the Germans, who chose a functional [[Bauhaus]]-influenced design over the more ornamental [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet style]], triggering the first of many disputes between the German and Russian consultants on the project. The plans, where [[form follows function]], called for large indoor spaces designed to let the maximum amount of natural light into the workplace. Arch-supported sections of the ceiling would curve upwards then fall diagonally along the high slanted banks or windows; this pattern would be repeated several times in the larger rooms, giving the roof its characteristic sawtooth-like appearance. Despite Beijing's northern location, the windows were all to face north because the light from that direction would cast fewer shadows.

The chosen location was a 640,000 square metre area in Dashanzi, then a low-lying patch of farmland northeast of Beijing. The complex was to occupy 500,000 square metres, 370,000 of which were allocated to living quarters. It was officially named '''Joint Factory 718''', following the Chinese government's method of naming military factories starting with the number 7. Fully funded by the Chinese side, the initial budget was enormous for the times: 9 million [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] or approximately 140 million [[Renminbi|RMB]] ([[US$]]17 million) at today's rates; actual costs were 147 million RMB.

Ground was broken in April 1954. Construction was marked by disagreements between the Chinese, Soviet and German experts, which led at one point to a six-month postponement of the project. The Germans' harshest critic was the Russian technology consultant in charge of Beijing's two Soviet-built electronics factories (714 and 738), who was also head consultant of the Radio Industrial Office of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry. The disputes generally revolved around the Germans' high but expensive quality standards for buildings and machines, which were called "over-engineering" by the Russians. Among such points of contention was the Germans' insistence, historical seismic data in hand, that the buildings be built to withstand [[earthquakes]] of magnitude 8 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]], whereas the Chinese and Russians wanted to settle for 7. Communications expert Wang Zheng, head of Communications Industry in the Chinese Ministry of National Defense and supporter the East German bid from the start, ruled in favor of the Germans for this particular factory.

At the height of the construction effort, more than 100 East German foreign experts worked on the project. The resources of as many as 22 of their factories supplied the construction; at the same time, supply delays were caused by the Soviet [[Red Army]]'s tremendous drain on East Germany's industrial production. The equipment was transported directly through the Soviet Union via the [[Trans-Siberian railway]], and a 15&amp;nbsp;km track of railroad between [[Beijing Railway Station]] and [[Beijing east railway station|Dongjiao Station]] was built especially to service the factory. [[Caltech]]-educated scientist Dr. Luo Peilin (罗沛霖), formerly head of the preparatory group in 1951-1953, was Head Engineer of Joint Factory 718 during its construction phase. Dr. Luo, now retired in Beijing, is remembered by his former colleagues as a dedicated [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] whose commitment to the obstacle-strewn project was a major factor of its eventual success.

==Operation==
[[File:798artzone2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Joint Factory 718]]
Joint Factory 718 began production in 1957, amid a grandiose opening ceremony and display of Communist brotherhood between China and East Germany, attended by high officials of both countries. The first director was [[Li Rui (Communist Party of China)|Li Rui]] (李瑞), who had been involved in the early negotiations in Berlin.

The factory quickly established a reputation for itself as one of the best in China. Through its several ''danwei'' or "[[work unit]]s", it offered considerable social benefits to its 10,000-20,000 workers, especially considering the relative poverty of the country during such periods as the [[Great Leap Forward]]. The factory boasted, among others:

* the best housing available to workers in Beijing, providing fully furnished rooms to whole families for less than 1/30 of the workers' income;
* diverse extracurricular activities such as social and sporting events, dancing, swimming, and training classes;
* its own athletics, soccer, basketball and volleyball teams for men and women, ranked among the best in inter-factory competitions;
* a brigade of German-made motorcycles, performing races and stunt demonstrations;
* an orchestra that played not only revolutionary hymns, but also German-influenced classical Western music;
* literary clubs and publications, and a library furnished with Chinese and foreign (German) books;
* Jiuxianqiao hospital, featuring German equipment and offering the most advanced dental facilities in China.

The factory even had its own volunteer military reserves or ''jinweishi'' (近卫师), which numbered hundreds and were equipped with large-scale weapons and [[anti-aircraft gun]]s.

Workers' skills were honed by frequent personnel exchanges, internships and training in cooperation with East Germany. Different incentives kept motivation high, such as rewards systems and "model worker" distinctions. At the same time, political activities such as [[Maoism]] study workshops kept the workers in line with [[Communist Party of China]] doctrine. During the [[Cultural revolution]], [[propaganda]] slogans for [[Mao Zedong Thought]] were painted on the ceiling arches in bright red characters (where they remain today at the latter tenants' request).

Frequent VIP visits contributed to the festive atmosphere. Notable guests included [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Jiang Zemin]], [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Zhu De]], and [[Kim Il-Sung]].

The Joint Factory produced a wide variety of military and civilian equipment. Civilian production included acoustic equipment for Beijing's [[Workers' Stadium]] and [[Great Hall of the People]], as well as all the [[loudspeaker]]s on [[Tiananmen Square]] and [[Chang'an Avenue]]. Military components were also exported to China's Communist allies, and helped establish [[North Korea]]'s [[wireless]] electronics industry.
[[Image:798machine art.jpg|right|thumb|One of the old machine tools in front of some contemporary art in Dec 2005]]

After 10 years of operation, Joint Factory 718 was split into more manageable components, such as sub-Factories 706, 707, 751, 761, 797 and 798. The first Head of sub-Factory 798 (the largest) was Branch Party Secretary Fu Ke (傅克), who played a major role in recruiting skilled workers from southern China and among returned [[overseas Chinese]].

However, the factory came under pressure during Deng Xiaoping's [[Chinese economic reform|reforms]] of the 1980s. Deprived of governmental support like many [[state-owned enterprises]], it underwent a gradual decline and was eventually rendered obsolete. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, most sub-factories had ceased production, 60% of the workers had been [[unemployment|laid off]], and the remains of the management were reconstituted as a real-estate operation called "Seven-Star Huadian Science and Technology Group", charged with overseeing the industrial park and finding tenants for the abandoned buildings.

==Artistic rebirth==
The Dashanzi factory complex was vacated at around the time when most of Beijing's contemporary artist community was looking for a new home. [[Avant-garde]] art being frowned upon by the government, the community had traditionally existed on the fringes of the city. From 1984 to 1995, they worked in run-down houses near the [[Old Summer Palace]] (Yuanmingyuan) in northwestern Beijing, until their [[eviction]]. Many then moved to the eastern Tongxian County (now [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tongzhou District]]), more than an hour's drive from the city center.

Then in 1995, Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), looking for cheap, ample workshop space away from downtown, set up in the now defunct Factory 706. The temporary move became permanent and in 2000 [[Sui Jianguo]](隋建国), Dean of the Department of [[Sculpture]], located his own studio in the area. The cluttered sculpture workshops have always remained open for visitors to peek at the dozens of workers milling about.

In 2001, American Robert Bernell (considered by many to be the founder of contemporary 798) moved his Timezone 8 Art Books bookshop, gallery and publishing office into a former factory canteen; he was the first [[wikt:laowai|foreigner]] to move in. One of Timezone 8's early employees was fashion designer Xiao Li, who along her husband, performance artist [[Cang Xin]],and Bernell,  helped artists secure and rent spaces in the area.

Through word-of-mouth, artists and designers started trickling in, attracted to the vast cathedral-like spaces. Despite the lack of any conscious aesthetic in the Bauhaus-inspired style, which grounded architectural beauty in practical, industrial function, the swooping arcs and soaring [[chimney]]s had an uplifting effect on modern eyes, a sort of [[post-industrial]] chic. At the artists' requests, workers renovating the spaces preserved the prominent Maoist slogans on the arches, adding a touch of ironic "[[Mao Zedong|Mao]] [[kitsch]]" to the place.

Later that year, Mr. Tabata Yukihito from Japan's Tokyo Gallery set up  Beijing Tokyo Art Projects (BTAP, 北京东京艺术工程) inside a 400-m² division of Factory 798's main area; this was the first renovated space featuring the high arched ceilings that would become synonymous with the Art District. BTAP's 2002 opening exhibition "Beijing Afloat" ([[curator]]: [[Feng Boyi]]), drew a crowd of over 1,000 people and marked the beginning of the popular infatuation with the area.

In 2002, designer artist [[Huang Rui]] (黄锐) and [[hutong]] photographer Xu Yong (徐勇) set up the 798 Space gallery (时态空间) next to BTAP. With its cavernous 1200-m² floor and multiple-arched ceilings at the center of Factory 798, it was and still is the symbolic center of the whole district. (Huang and Xu since designed at least seven spaces in the area and became the prime movers and [[de facto]] spokespersons of the District.) A glass-fronted café was set up in the former office section at the back of the 798 space, opening into a back alley now lined with studios and restaurants such as Huang's own At Café, and Cang Xin's #6 [[Szechuan cuisine|Sichuan]] restaurant, the area's "canteen".

In 2003, Lu Jie (卢杰) set up the Long March Foundation, an ongoing project for artistic re-interpretation of the historical [[Long March]], inside the 25,000 [[Chinese units|''Li'']] Cultural Transmission Center (二万五千里文化传播中心). Around that time, Singapore-owned China Art Seasons (北京季节画廊) opened for display for pan-Asian art, and was one of several new galleries setting up at that time.

==Notable exhibitions==
Several [[Art exhibition|exhibition]]s of note took place in 2003. In March 2004, "Transborder Language", part of the First Dashanzhi International Art Festival, (curators: [[Huang Rui]] and Thomas J. Berghuis) combined [[poetry]] [[Installation art|installation]] and [[performance art]]. "Blue Sky Exposure" was held outdoors in southern Beijing and then relocated to the Art District. On April 13, despite widespread fear of public gatherings during [[SARS]], the exhibitions "Reconstruction 798" (798 space) and "Operation Ink Freedom" (25,000 ''Li'' Cultural Transmission Center) drew crowds of 5,000 and definitely confirmed the area's widespread appeal.

In July, with Beijing in full [[construction]] boom, Wang Wei's "Temporary Space" (curator: Philip Tinari) featured workers completely enclosing an area of the exhibition with a brick wall and then removing the bricks one by one. In September, "Left Hand - Right Hand" (curator: [[Feng Boyi]]) showcased Chinese and German sculptors at 798 Space and Daoyaolu Workshop A. Among the works was Sui Jianguo's enormous [[concrete]] sculpture "Mao's Right Hand", which is just what the name suggests, and an example of modern Chinese art's ironic reflections on history.

The first [http://www.bjbiennale.com.cn Beijing Biennale] was held on September 18, 2003 at the Art District and featured 14 exhibitions. "Tui-Transfiguration" (curator: Wu Hung; ''tui'' here roughly means ''[[moult]]'') featured photographs by [[East Village (Beijing)|East Village]] chronicler Rong Rong (荣荣) and his wife, Japan-born Inri (映里). Their works notably featured their own [[nudity|naked]] bodies in various strange locales, and were generally well-received despite being criticized by some as typical of the self-centered nature of much art in the area.

The first [https://web.archive.org/web/20040926062123/http://diaf.vip.myrice.com/ Dashanzi International Art Festival], directed by the ever-present [[Huang Rui]], was held from April 24 to May 23, 2004. This first edition, named ''Radiance and Resonance/Signals of Time'' (光•音 / 光阴), was beset by logistical problems arising from landowner Seven-Star Group's increasing irritation with the art community. As such, the festival became as much a public protest against the area's upcoming destruction that a showcase of art itself.

The environmental performance artist [[Brother Nut]] installed his project, “Nongfu Spring Market,” in 798 Art Zone in 2018. A commentary on pollution in China, this project received international attention including an article in the [[New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/world/asia/china-water-pollution-brother-nut.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most (in)famous displays at the Festival was performance artist He Yunchang having himself [[cement]]ed shut in a wooden box with only two pipes for [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], and staying there for 24 hours before being chiseled out, prompting the proverbial "[[Is it art?]]" questionings. "Shock" exhibitions have become increasingly common in the Art District (see ''China Daily'''s article [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/02/content_356928.htm "The avant-garde art goes too far?"] for some extreme examples).

In 2008 the notable exhibition of foreign artists from Italy ("Rabarama. Italian Shape", AnniArt Gallery 798,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anniart.com/exhibition1.asp?smallclass2=2008%20exhibition&amp;smallclassname=Italian%20Shape&lt;/ref&gt;): [[Rabarama]] and [[Cesare Berlingeri]].

==Gentrification==
[[File:Dior在798的休息区.jpg|left|thumb|Dior in 798 Art District]]
The district's popularity has exploded since the opening of BTAP and 798 Space in 2002, with scores of [[art gallery|galleries]], [[loft]]s, [[publishing]] firms, [[design]] companies, high-end [[tailor]] shops, and [[café]]s and fancy restaurants setting up. In 2003, around 30 artists and organizations had set up studios or offices in the area, with 200 more reportedly on the waiting list to move in.

Fashionable clubs also sprang up such as Zhou Ying's "Vibes", known for its [[fetishism|fetish]] nights. A former factory cafeteria became Yan Club&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20040925074646/http://www.yanclub.com/&lt;/ref&gt; (仁俱乐部), owned by well-known Beijing socialite and writer Li Xuebing or "Bing Bing" (冰冰), also owner of [[Sanlitun]]'s Jam House. Notable performers at Yan included [[Morcheeba]] in March 2003.

In keeping with the area's "community spirit", most galleries and spaces in Dashanzi do not charge either exhibitors or visitors. Instead, they generally sustain themselves by hosting profitable fashion shows and corporate events; among others, [[Sony]] had a product launch gala at 798 space, and [[watchmaker]] [[Omega SA|Omega]] presented a fashion show at Yan Club. Others include [[Christian Dior]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Toyota]]; supermodel [[Cindy Crawford]] also made an appearance. Even [[Li Ka-shing]]'s [[Cheung Kong Holdings]] held an event in the district, which some{{Who|date=January 2011}} found unsettling given the real-estate industry's designs on the land it sits on.

As such, Dashanzi is now a center of Beijing's nascent "[[Bobos in Paradise|BoBo]]" (bourgeois-bohemian) community. [[Huang Rui]] and Xu Yong are good representatives of the type. And a local [[guru]] of sorts is artist/curator/architect [[Ai Weiwei]] (艾未未), whose self-designed house in [[Caochangdi]] just outside the factory complex was a trend-setter.

In the absence of any [[rent control]], tenants' costs have escalated. In 2000–2001, rents were 0.8 RMB per square metre per day (24 RMB or US$2.90/m²/month, or about US$0.27/sq.foot/month). They increased slightly to 30 RMB/m²/month in 2003, and then doubled to 60 RMB/m²/month (US$0.67/sq.foot/month) in 2004. Total costs can be quite high considering the average 200–400 m² area of the spaces, and the overhead of [[renovation|renovating]] and retrofitting the rooms to use modern appliances.

Another sign of creeping [[gentrification]] is the increasing number of luxury cars parked near the galleries; local artist Zhao Bandi purchased the first [[Alfa Romeo]] convertible in Beijing. Some (but not all) of the resident artists and their patrons are quite rich compared to other occupants of the area, the remaining factory workers. Some of the workshops are still operational on a small scale, mostly doing car repair or industrial laundry.

Some local artists such as Zhang Zhaohui, a New York-trained art critic and curator, and architect Zhu Jun, a new Dashanzi resident, have criticized the Art District as being less about art and more about show. Says Zhang: "Few of the artists come to seriously practice art. Most of them just come for opportunities to exhibit and sell works or just have parties and gatherings." (''China Daily'')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/63022.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, young artists like Zhang Yue find this atmosphere particularly conducive to establishing one's career. In the course of one summer, Dashanzi Art District's Platform China Contemporary Art Institute and Unlimited Art Gallery afforded this rising artist two well-received solo shows.

==Closure averted==

In the days of Joint Factory 718, Dashanzi was chosen for its peripheral position well outside the city center. The artists who later moved there were attracted from the fringes of the city as well. However, the area today sits right on the strategic corridor between the [[Beijing Capital Airport|Capital Airport]] and downtown Beijing along the [[Airport Expressway (Beijing)|Airport Expressway]]. In the context of China's current [[real estate]] [[bubble (economics)|bubble]], the district is highly likely to be demolished in the near future. Hints of development are already appearing with the western entrances of the complex flanked by the Jiuxian and Hongyuan luxury apartment towers. There is all the current government projects which call for the expansion of the neighbouring [[industrial park]] to turn all of Dashanzi into a high-tech development zone similar to [[Zhongguancun]]. Landowner Seven-Star Group thus hopes to re-employ some of the 10,000 laid-off workers it is still responsible for.

Influential members of the artist community and architects are [[lobbying]] various government instances to persuade them to allow the old buildings to remain, as part of a cultural center which Beijing otherwise lacks and that can only grow organically. In 2003, International Architects Salon roped in architects from various international architectural associations and renowned architects like [[Bernard Tschumi]] and [[Coop Himmelblau]]'s Wolf Prix to hammer in the point how attractive spaces like Factory 798 can be to international design community. They point out that such communities are important if Beijing, and China, is to become a major source of creative design instead of mere low cost low value-added manufacturing. (This issue has far-reaching implications in the domain of [[intellectual property]] protection in China - some experts believe that the local IP laws will start to be enforced only when China becomes a source of its own intellectual property.)[[Image:798ArtZone2009.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Patrons stroll through the 798 Art Zone, Beijing, April 2009]]

Part of the lobbying effort is resident sculptor Li Xiangqun, professor at the  Academy of Arts and Design&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20041022053723/http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/docsn/msxy/index-en.html&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Tsinghua University]], who was elected deputy of the 12th [[National People's Congress]] in 2004. Li presented the municipal government with a formal bill in February, requesting suspension of the destruction plans and preservation of the buildings as part of an Olympic-caliber cultural center.

Professors from architecture schools such as Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts and the [[Southern California Institute of Architecture]] have proposed various development plans for the area that involve preserving the buildings, although those do not appear especially profitable financially.

Meanwhile, attempts have been made to appeal to the developers' sense of economics by pointing out similarities with New York's Greenwich Village and SoHo, where the high profitability of real estate is due partly to the presence of former post-industrial artists' dwellings. Those arguments have so far been ignored.

In 2004, Seven-Star Group froze the rental of new spaces and prohibited all renewals. Tenants resorted to subdividing and subleasing their spaces, to which the Group responded by attempting to forbid subleasing to cultural organizations or to foreigners, hoping to drive out the artists. Tenants, despite some of them having leases still valid for several years, were given the ultimatum of December 31, 2005 to vacate the premises.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.sohu.com/2004/07/05/42/article220864288.shtml &lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006, public outcry was relentless, and prominent cultural organizations from around the world spoke up. An unlikely duo including SevenStar, a government-led consortium acting as stewards of a pension fund for former factory workers, and [[Guy Ullens]], a Belgian philanthropist who had amassed the world's largest collection of contemporary Chinese art, commissioned [[Boston]]-based design firm [[Sasaki Associates]] to produce a vision plan which sought to re-purpose the district into a stable source of revenue while providing a much needed destination for China's burgeoning arts scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.planning.org/awards/2018/798arts/|title=798 Arts District|author=[[American Planning Association]]|date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan needed to inspire multiple stakeholders with often divergent interests. First, the city government in [[Beijing]] wanted to ensure that the district would a visible and acclaimed destination. Second, land-holder SevenStar Group needed to generate a sustainable revenue stream to endow the pension fund of former factory workers. Third, international and Chinese non-profit cultural institutions investing in 798 such as the [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art]] wanted to focus on culture and protecting the district’s distinctive character. Finally, residents of adjacent neighborhoods were vocal about the need for community parks, recreation, and job opportunities. 
 
Considering these voices equally, the [[Sasaki Associates]] master plan for 798 endeavored to reach consensus with a long-game approach to redevelopment. Leading with clear principles and detailed guidelines, the plan was an opportunity to codify the values of the district. To address the city’s concerns, connections from nearby transit stations were strengthened, historic buildings were catalogued, and guidelines for their preservation and adaptive reuse were outlined. Next, a long-term strategy for obtaining revenue from new building leases was realized. A proposed arts school, artist-in-residence program, and requirements that tenants are involved in a creative industry provided cultural institutions with a sense that 798 would attract new talent and ideas. Last, multiple parks and plazas responded to community desire for more public open space.

By the end of 2007 it was decided that the area would continue in its current format of a special art zone.  In 2009, the area has been refurbished and is thriving. 798’s abandoned factory buildings have been transformed into new museums, galleries, and cafes. Fallow fields and once hidden courtyards have reemerged as settings for outdoor sculpture, fashion shows, and other cultural events. The roads have been repaved, new galleries have opened, and a [[coffee culture|cafe culture]] is emerging. What began as a small collection of ephemeral studios and other work spaces has become the third most visited destination in Beijing, after the Forbidden City and the Great Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93374332|title=Finding Beijing's Not-So-Hidden Art Treasure|work=[[NPR]]|author=Jamila Trindle|date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ahhr photo 1926.jpg|thumb|Members of AKhRR in 1926: Yevgeny Katzman, Isaak Brodsky, Yuri Repin, Alexander Grigoriev, Pavel Radimov]]
The '''Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia''' ({{lang-ru|Ассоциация художников революционной России}},

''Assotsiatsia Khudozhnikov Revolutsionnoi Rossii'', 1922-1928), later known as '''Association of Artists of the Revolution''' (Ассоциация художников революции, ''Assotsiatsia Khudozhnikov Revolutsii'' or '''AKhR''', 1928-1932) was a group of artists in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922-1933. Diverse members of the group gained favor as the legitimate bearers of the Communist ideas into the world of art, formulating framework for the [[Socialist Realism]] style. See also [[red cossacks]].

Original founding members included [[Pavel Radimov]] (the last chairman of [[Peredvizhniki]] movement), [[Sergey Malyutin]], [[Yevgeny Katzman]], [[Pyotr Shukhmin]] and other realist painters, who already established themselves in artistic world before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. The group formed within the [[Peredvizhniki]] movement, that held their last, 47th, public exhibition in 1922, and clearly placed itself in opposition to [[avant-garde]] art.

Their first public statement as a new entity was a 1922 exhibition in [[Moscow]]; all proceeds were used for the relief of [[Russian famine of 1921]]. By 1928, the group sponsored 10 nationwide exhibitions with high publicity. Despite its revolutionary title, it successfully united artists of the "old school" like [[Abram Arkhipov]], [[Aleksandr Makovsky]], [[Nikolay Kasatkin]], [[Konstantin Yuon]] and the younger ones like [[Sergei Vasilyevich Gerasimov|Sergei Gerasimov]] and [[Isaak Brodsky]]. In a decade, it grew up from 80 to over 300 members. Broad membership and dominance of mature artists born in the 1870s and 1880s helped in establishing AKhRR as a reliable institution, far from ultra-revolutionary rhetorics. 

During the crackdown on independent art movements in 1932-1933, AKhRR served as the nucleus for the stalinist [[USSR Union of Artists]], and was liquidated after its formation.

The '''Alexander Mosaic''', dating from circa 100&amp;nbsp;BC, is a [[Roman mosaic|Roman]] floor [[mosaic]] originally from the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;European History, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000712/http://europeanhistory.boisestate.edu/westciv/alexander/06.shtml Alexander the Great, The Battle of Issus]&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a battle between the armies of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III of Persia]] and measures {{convert|2.72|x|5.13|m|ftin}}.&lt;ref name="HF"&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 178. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original is preserved in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]. The mosaic is believed to be a copy of an early 3rd-century BC Hellenistic painting.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Woodford, Susan. (1982) ''The Art of Greece and Rome''.

==Subject==

===Battle===
The mosaic illustrates a battle in which Alexander faced and attempted to capture or kill Darius. Alexander defeated him at the [[Battle of Issus]] and two years later at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. The work is traditionally believed to show the Battle of Issus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/wars-of-alexander-the-great-battle-of-issus.htm Battle of Issus], [[History.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mosaic emulates the appearance of a painting so accurately, it has been uniformly agreed that the mosaic is a copy of an original Hellenistic Greek painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mosaics|last = L'Orange and Nordhagen|first = Hans Peter and Per Jonas|year = 1966|isbn = |location = Great Britain|pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic is held to be a copy either of a painting by [[Aristides of Thebes]], or of a lost late 4th-century BC [[fresco]] by the painter [[Philoxenus of Eretria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/alexander-mosaic.html Alexander Mosaic] by Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker, ''Smarthistory'', 2013. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] (XXXV, 110) as a commission for the [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonian]] king [[Cassander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A Global History|first=Fred S.|last=Kleiner|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=0-495-11549-5|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexander and Darius===

Despite being damaged, the two main figures are easy to recognize.
*The portrait of Alexander is one of his most famous. Alexander's breastplate depicts [[Medusa]], the famous [[Gorgon]], and his wavy hair is typical of royal portraiture as established in Greek art of the fourth century BC. He is portrayed sweeping into battle at the left, on his famous horse, [[Bucephalus]],&lt;ref&gt;Winkes, Rolf: "Bukephalas”, Archaeologia Transantlantica XVIII, 2000, 101-107&lt;/ref&gt; and focusing his gaze on the Persian leader.
*Darius is shown in a chariot. He seems to be desperately commanding his frightened charioteer to flee the battle, while stretching out his hand either as a mute gesture to Alexander, or possibly after throwing a [[javelin]]. He has a worried expression on his face. The charioteer is whipping the horses as he tries to escape.

The Persian soldiers behind him have expressions of determination and consternation.

===Other features===
Darius's brother [[Oxyathres of Persia|Oxyathres]] is also portrayed, sacrificing himself to save the King.

Radical [[foreshortening]] – as in the central horse, seen from behind – and the use of shading to convey a sense of mass and volume enhance the naturalistic effect of the scene. Repeated diagonal spears, clashing metal, and the crowding of men and horses evoke the din of battle. At the same time, action is arrested by dramatic details such as the fallen horse and the Persian soldier in the foreground who watches his own death throes reflected in a shield.

==History of the mosaic==

===Production===
The mosaic is made of about one and a half million tiny colored tiles called [[tesserae]], arranged in gradual curves called ''[[opus vermiculatum]],'' (also known as "worm work," because they seem to replicate the slow motion of a crawling worm). The color scale of Roman mosaics are extremely rich in gradation. The process of gathering materials for mosaics was a complex undertaking since the color scale was based solely on the pieces of marble that could be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Janson's History of Art|last = Davies|first = Penelope JE|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0135006887|location = New Jersey|pages = 246|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic is an unusually detailed work for a private residence and was likely commissioned by a wealthy person or family. The fact that this scene was made to be viewed in the house of a Roman civilian reveals that Alexander the Great was more than just a heroic image to the Romans. Because Roman leaders followed after Alexander's image, Roman civilians also aspired to emulate the power he represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Janson's History of Art|last = Davies|first = Penelope JE|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0135006887|location = New Jersey|pages = 146|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mosaic was arranged on the floor where the patron could receive guests, it was the first decorative object a visitor would see upon entering that room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Houses and Society in Pompeii and Herculaneum|last = Wallace-Hadrill|first = Andrew|publisher = |year = 1994|isbn = |location = |pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
The mosaic was rediscovered on October 24, 1831 in [[Pompeii]], and was moved to [[Naples]] in September 1843, where it is currently preserved on a wall (''not'' on a floor as it was found) in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]]. The mosaic is featured on 1,000 [[Greek drachma]] banknotes from 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://history-of-macedonia.com/2012/03/04/16-04-1956-alexander-the-great-in-modern-greek-bank-note-of-one-thousand-drachmas/|title=16.04.1956: Alexander the Great in Modern Greek Bank Note of one thousand Drachmas=|publisher=History of Macedonia| accessdate =16 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern copy===
[[File:Battle of Issus.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern reconstruction of the Alexander Mosaic.]]
In 2003 the ''International Center for the Study and Teaching of Mosaic'' (CISIM) in [[Ravenna]], Italy, proposed to create a copy of the mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.archaeology.org/0601/abstracts/mosaic.html Alexander, Piece by Piece.] by Marco Merola, ''Archaeology'', Abstracts Vol. 59, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2006. Retrieved 26 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GtFeiXeK Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; When they had received approval, the mosaic master Severo Bignami and his eight-person team took a large photograph of the mosaic, made a tracing of the image with a dark marker and created a negative impression of the mosaic.

The team composed the mosaic in sections in 44 clay frames, trying to preserve the pieces of the mosaic in the exact positions they are in the original mosaic. They had to keep the plates wet all the time. Then they pressed a tissue on the clay to create an image of the outlines of the mosaic in the clay. The team recreated the mosaic with about 2 million pieces of various marble types. When they had placed all the pieces, they covered the result with a layer of glue and gauze and pulled it out of the clay. They placed each section on synthetic concrete and then united the sections with the compound of glasswool and plastic.

The project took 22 months and a cost equivalent to US $216,000. The copy was installed in the [[House of the Faun]] in 2005.

'''''Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business''''' (1985) is a book by educator [[Neil Postman]].  The book's origins lay in a talk Postman gave to the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] in 1984.  He was participating in a panel on [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and the contemporary world.  In the introduction to his book, Postman said that the contemporary world was better reflected by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', whose public was oppressed by their addiction to amusement, than by Orwell's work, where they were oppressed by state control.

It has been translated into eight languages and sold some 200,000 copies worldwide{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. In 2005, Postman's son Andrew reissued the book in a 20th anniversary edition.

==Summary==
Postman distinguishes the [[Orwellian]] vision of the future, in which [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] governments seize individual rights, from that offered by [[Aldous Huxley]] in ''[[Brave New World]],'' where people medicate themselves into bliss, thereby voluntarily sacrificing their rights.  Drawing an analogy with the latter scenario, Postman sees television's entertainment value as a present-day "[[Soma (Brave New World)|soma]]", the fictitious pleasure drug in Brave New World, by means of which the citizens' rights are exchanged for consumers' entertainment.

The essential premise of the book, which Postman extends to the rest of his argument(s), is that "form excludes the content" that is, a particular medium can only sustain a particular level of ideas. Thus [[Logical argument|rational argument]], integral to print typography, is militated against by the medium of television for this reason. Owing to this shortcoming, politics and religion are diluted, and "news of the day" becomes a packaged commodity. Television de-emphasises the quality of information in favour of satisfying the far-reaching needs of entertainment, by which information is encumbered and to which it is subordinate.

Postman asserts the presentation of [[television news]] is a form of entertainment programming; arguing that the inclusion of theme music, the interruption of commercials, and "talking hairdos" bear witness that televised news cannot readily be taken seriously.  Postman further examines the differences between written speech, which he argues reached its prime in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and the forms of televisual communication, which rely mostly on visual images to "sell" lifestyles.  He argues that, owing to this change in public discourse, [[politics]] has ceased to be about a candidate's ideas and solutions, but whether he comes across favorably on television. Television, he notes, has introduced the phrase "now this", which implies a ''complete absence'' of connection between the separate topics the phrase ostensibly connects.  [[Larry Gonick]] used this phrase to conclude his ''Cartoon Guide to (Non)Communication,'' instead of the traditional "the end".

Postman refers to the inability to act upon much of the so-called information from televised sources as the [[Information-action ratio]]. He contends that "television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing".

Drawing on the ideas of media scholar [[Marshall McLuhan]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; altering McLuhan's [[aphorism]] "[[the medium is the message]]", to "the medium is the metaphor"&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; he describes how oral, literate, and televisual cultures radically differ in the processing and prioritization of information; he argues that each medium is appropriate for a different kind of knowledge. The faculties requisite for rational inquiry are simply weakened by televised viewing.  Accordingly, reading, a prime example cited by Postman, exacts intense intellectual involvement, at once interactive and [[dialectical]]; whereas television only requires passive involvement.

Postman argues that commercial television has become derivative of advertising. Moreover, modern television commercials are not "a series of testable, logically ordered assertions" rationalizing consumer decisions, but "is a drama—a mythology, if you will—of handsome people" being driven to "near ecstasy by their good fortune" of possessing advertised goods or services. "The truth or falsity of an advertiser's claim is simply not an issue" because more often than not "no claims are made, except those the viewer projects onto or infers from the drama."  Because commercial television is programmed according to ratings, its content is determined by commercial feasibility, not critical acumen. Television in its present state, he says, does not satisfy the conditions for honest intellectual involvement and rational argument.

He repeatedly states that the eighteenth century, the "[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]", was the pinnacle for rational argument. Only in the printed word, he states, could complicated truths be rationally conveyed.  Postman gives a striking example: many of the first fifteen [[U.S. presidents]] could probably have walked down the street without being recognized by the average citizen, yet all these men would have been quickly known by their written words.  However, the reverse is true today.  The names of presidents or even famous preachers, lawyers, and scientists call up visual images, typically television images, but few, if any, of their words come to mind.  The few that do almost exclusively consist of carefully chosen [[soundbite]]s.  Postman mentions [[Ronald Reagan]], and comments upon Reagan's abilities as an entertainer.

'''Brigie de Courcy''' is an Irish television producer.

Graduating from [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) with a PhD in [[Drama]], she began working for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] (RTÉ) as an assistant script editor on the Irish soap ''[[Fair City]]'' in 2000. After a promotion to Script Editor and successful stints as Story Editor and Story Producer on ''[[Emmerdale]]'', she transferred to the [[BBC]]. She worked as Series Story Producer on ''[[EastEnders]]'' under [[Kate Harwood]]. 

This period, from 2005 to 2006, represented a return to form for the show. Criticism had been intense, with particular ire directed at "the quality of its storylines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/12048 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509131624/http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/12048 |archivedate=2006-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general recovery under Harwood, and the improvement in storylines under de Courcy, culminated in a [[National Television Awards|National Television Award]] for most popular series, as well as ''[[EastEnders]]'''s first [[BAFTA]] nomination since 2002 and first victory since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088512/ |title=Awards Section|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harwood went on to become Head of Series and Serials at the BBC in October 2006, while de Courcy left shortly after for a spell in senior BBC management.

In 2008, she returned to Irish television and was appointed Executive Producer of ''[[Fair City]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.ie/star/fair-city-faced-axe-after-a-season-53261/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006104057/http://www.thestar.ie/star/fair-city-faced-axe-after-a-season-53261/ |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; During her reign, the soap has received critical acclaim for its more credible, sophisticated and psychological stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/alls-fair-in-love-and-war-26550149.html |title=All's Fair in love and war |website=Independent.ie |date=2009-07-11 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently she has become Script Producer of the new animated show on RTÉ called ''[[Ballybraddan]]'' which is about [[hurling]] and was brought in to celebrate 125 years of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metroeireann.com/article/all-in-good-time%2C2120 |title=All in good time |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233337/http://metroeireann.com/article/all-in-good-time%2C2120 |archivedate=2014-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Sadie Glass (Tipton) is on a book tour with her boyfriend, Thierry (Merlet). She is promoting her book that details her chaotic relationship with Alex (Cedergren), which is implied to have been sexual and violent. At an event in Italy, Alex shows up and invites Sadie to spend the weekend with him instead of meeting Thierry's family in Paris.

Disenchanted with her current relationship, she agrees to meet Alex at a club. There, they meet Francesca (Gastini), who performs an erotic dance. Sadie agrees to join Alex only if Francesca joins them.

At the villa, Sadie and Francesca drink and take drugs and begin a sexual relationship while Alex prepares for a party. At the party, many guests arrive, take drugs, and have sex with one another. Sadie walks into a room where a woman's throat is slit and she is lifted into the air by her arms.

Sadie awakens with a start, questioning whether what she saw was real. She confronts Alex, who blames her for not knowing what she was getting herself into.

Sadie leaves the villa and tries to leave town. She asks a man in a car to drive her away, but the man attacks and drugs her, returning her to the villa. When she wakes up, Alex cleans her up and tells her it was just a game.

That night, before another party, Thierry shows up and tells Sadie that he loves her. Sadie rebuffs him and searches for Alex. She tells Alex that Thierry doesn't belong here, and that if he lets Thierry go, she will do what he wants.

Francesca gives Sadie more drugs, but while she isn't looking, Sadie spits them out. Alex escorts Sadie to a room full of people surrounding Thierry, who is tied up in the same way the woman was the previous night. Francesca, dressed as an executioner, gives Sadie a knife. Sadie approaches Thierry and cuts him lightly on the back while the rest of the crowd begins to kiss and fondle each other. As Sadie moves to cut Thierry's bonds, Alex attempts to stop her but she stabs him in the stomach. Furious, Francesca slits Thierry's throat and Francesca runs away.

Some time later, in New York City, Sadie is at a restaurant still promoting her book. She sees Francesca in the crowd and they speak afterwards, Francesca implying that Sadie will soon return to the violent and sex-filled world she's trying to run away from. Outside, as Sadie is being photographed, she sees Francesca enter a car and sit next to a man who appears to be Alex.

In 2000, the organization was recognized for a special preservation award by the Dance Heritage Coalition, as well as being recognized by the [[White House Millennium Council]], as part of "[[Save America's Treasures]]".&lt;ref name=greatness&gt;{{cite news|title=Dancing into greatness|work=[[Asbury Park Press]]|date=2000-08-20|author=Collins, Karyn D.|quote=Preservation awards went to the Katherine Dunham Center in East St. Louis, Il., Cross-Cultural Dance Resources  in Flagstaff, Ariz., and the Halla Huhm Foundation in Honolulu. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehouse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/Initiatives/Millennium/AndersonCottage_ListofGrants.html|publisher=[[National Archives]]|accessdate=2008-06-03|title=President Clinton announces FY2000 Save America's Treasures grants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Founded in 1981, the CCDR's mission is to promote dance resources, preserve and research dance materials, and foster a dynamic environment for dance events. It provides consultation on [[dance theory]] and methods, [[ethnomusicology]], cultural dynamics and ethics.  The organization sponsors concerts and visiting artists and lectures.  CCDR also maintains a non lending library of over 15,000 shelved items, including artwork, audiovisual materials, books, clippings, monographs, periodicals, costumes, dolls, and musical instruments, as well as the archives of [[Gertrude Prokosch Kurath]], [[Eleanor King]], [[Joann Kealiinohomoku]] (in progress), and the [[Daniel J. Crowley]] musical instrument collection.

Since 1989, the organization's director is Joann Kealiinohomoku, known for her 1970 essay, "An Anthropologist Looks at Ballet as a Form of Ethnic Dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A forecast of dance's future|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=1989-07-02|author=Popper, Regina|quote=Joann Kealiinohomoku, a cultural anthropologist who directs Cross-Cultural Dance Resources in Flagstaff, Ariz., and who in 1970 wrote an essay titled ''An Anthropologist Looks at Ballet as a Form of Ethnic Dance.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Theory and methods for an anthropological study of dance", her 1976 doctoral dissertation.

The CCDR receives partial funding from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the Arizona Commission on the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CCDR Newsletter|url=http://www.ccdr.org/Newletters/issue23-2003-dec.pdf|date=December 2003|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a library which is open to the public Monday through Friday from 10-5, and by appointment.

In 2008, it was announced that the CCDR's collections are being transferred to the [[Herberger College of the Arts]] at [[Arizona State University]], Dance Department. The organization's vice president, [[Elsie Ivancich Dunin]], made a gift to the College to provide for the collection's permanent care and [[Cultural heritage management|curation]].&lt;ref name=herberger&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herbergercollege.asu.edu/news/press_release.php?id=650|title=The Power of Place: Renowned collection comes to ASU Herberger College Dance with $1.15 million gift from international dance scholar |publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|format=press release|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2000, CCDR was recognized by  President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[White House Millennium Council]], "[[Save America's Treasures]]". The DHC was awarded a grant on behalf of three archives, one in Hawaii, one in Missouri and CCDR in Arizona.  CCDR received one third of  the grant, specifically for the preservation of the Gertrude Kurath, Eleanor King, and Kealiinohomoku Collections.&lt;ref name=greatness/&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehouse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dance notes|work=[[Star-Ledger]]|date=2000-08-09|author=Johnson, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black, depending on the concentration of [[melanin]] in the [[iris pigment epithelium]] (located on the back of the iris), the melanin content within the iris stroma (located at the front of the iris), and the cellular density of the stroma.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huiqiong Wang, Stephen Lin, Xiaopei Liu, Sing Bing Kang |title=Separating Reflections in Human Iris Images for Illumination Estimation |journal=Tenth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision |volume=2 |pages=1691–1698 |year=2005 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.87.418 | doi=10.1109/ICCV.2005.215 |isbn=0-7695-2334-X|last2=Lin|last3=Xiaopei Liu |last4=Sing Bing Kang }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of blue and green, as well as hazel eyes, results from the [[Tyndall effect|Tyndall scattering]] of light in the stroma, a phenomenon similar to that which accounts for the blueness of the sky called [[Rayleigh scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturm R.A. &amp; Larsson M., Genetics of human iris colour and patterns, Pigment Cell Melanoma Res, 22:544-562, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or ocular fluid.&lt;ref name="Fox1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Clyde W. |title=Blue Eyes |journal= Journal of Physical Chemistry | volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=498–501 |year=1924 | doi=10.1021/j150239a007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eye color is thus an instance of [[structural color]] and varies depending on the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-colored eyes.

These changes are known as [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s or SNPs. The actual number of genes that contribute to eye color is currently unknown, but there are a few likely candidates. A study in [[Rotterdam]] (2009) found that it was possible to predict eye color with more than 90% accuracy for brown and blue using just six SNPs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126992.100-dna-test-for-eye-colour-could-help-fight-crime.html "DNA test for eye colour could help fight crime"], ''[[New Scientist]]'' 14 March 2009.

The gene ''OCA2'' ({{OMIM3|203200}}), when in a variant form, causes the pink eye color and [[hypopigmentation]] common in human [[albinism]]. (The name of the gene is derived from the disorder it causes, oculocutaneous albinism type II.) Different SNPs within ''OCA2'' are strongly associated with blue and green eyes as well as variations in [[freckling]], [[Mole (skin marking)|mole]] counts, [[hair color|hair]] and [[Human skin color|skin tone]]. The polymorphisms may be in an ''OCA2'' [[regulatory sequence]], where they may influence the expression of the gene product, which in turn affects pigmentation.&lt;ref name="OCA2" /&gt; A specific mutation within the ''HERC2'' gene, a gene that regulates ''OCA2'' expression, is partly responsible for blue eyes.&lt;ref name="Kayser"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Three genome-wide association studies and a linkage analysis identify HERC2 as a human iris color gene |journal=Am.

==Ancient DNA and eye color in Europe==
People of European descent show the greatest variety in eye color of any population worldwide. Recent advances in [[ancient DNA]] technology have revealed some of the history of eye color in Europe. All European [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherer remains so far investigated have shown genetic markers for light-colored eyes, in the case of western and central European hunter-gatherers combined with dark skin color. The later additions to the European [[gene pool]], the Early [[Neolithic]] farmers from [[Anatolia]] and the [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] [[Copper Age]]/[[Bronze Age]] pastoralists (possibly the [[Proto-Indo-European]] population) from the area north of the [[Black Sea]] appear to have had much higher incidences of dark eye color alleles, and alleles giving rise to lighter skin, than the original European population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Haak | first1 =W. | last2 = Lazaridis | first2 = I. | last3 = Patterson | first3 = N. | last4 = Rohland | first4 = N. | last5 = Mallick | first5 = S. | last6 = Llamas | first6 = B. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = G. | last8 = Nordenfelt | first8 = S. | last9 = Harney | first9 = E. | last10 = Stewardson | first10 = K. | last11 = Fu | first11 = Q. | last12 = Mittnik | first12 = A. | last13 = Bánffy | first13 = E. | last14 = Economou | first14 = C. | last15 = Francken | first15 = M. | last16 = Friederich | first16 = S. | last17 = Pena | first17 = R.

Iris color can provide a large amount of information about a person, and a classification of colors may be useful in documenting pathological changes or determining how a person may respond to ocular pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=German&gt;{{cite journal |author=German EJ, Hurst MA, Wood D, Gilchrist J |title=A novel system for the objective classification of iris colour and its correlation with response to 1% tropicamide |journal=Ophthalmic Physiol Opt |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=103–10 |year=1998|pmid=9692029 |doi=10.1016/S0275-5408(97)00070-7|last2=Hurst |last3=Wood |last4=Gilchrist }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classification systems have ranged from a basic light or dark description to detailed gradings employing photographic standards for comparison.&lt;ref name=German/&gt; Others have attempted to set objective standards of color comparison.&lt;ref name=Fan&gt;Fan S, Dyer CR, Hubbard L.

Eye colors range from the darkest shades of brown to the lightest tints of blue.&lt;ref name=Sturm/&gt; To meet the need for standardized classification, at once simple yet detailed enough for research purposes, Seddon et al. developed a graded system based on the predominant iris color and the amount of brown or yellow pigment present.&lt;ref name=Seddon&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evaluation of an iris color classification system |journal=[[Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science]] |last=Seddon |first=J.M. |author2=CR Sahagian, RJ Glynn, RD Sperduto and ES Gragoudas |volume=31 |pages=1592–8 |publisher=Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology |date=1 August 1990|url=http://www.iovs.org/content/31/8/1592.abstract |accessdate=19 October 2011 |pmid=2201662 |issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three pigment colors that determine, depending on their proportion, the outward appearance of the iris, along with [[structural color]]. Green irises, for example, have blue and some yellow. Brown irises contain mostly brown. Some eyes have a dark ring around the iris, called a [[limbal ring]].

Eye color in non-human animals is regulated differently. For example, instead of blue as in humans, [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive]] eye color in the skink species ''[[Corucia zebrata]]'' is black, and the autosomal [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] color is yellow-green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones, S.L. |author2=Schnirel, B.L. |title=Subspecies comparison of the Genus: Corucia |journal=Polyphemos |year=2006 |volume=4 |pages=1–25 |url=http://www.biology-online.org/biology-forum/about7587.html |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202023446/http://www.biology-online.org/biology-forum/about7587.html |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

As the [[color vision|perception of color]] depends on viewing conditions (e.g., the amount and kind of illumination, as well as the hue of the surrounding environment), so does the perception of eye color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edromanguitars.com/tech/color.htm Color Perception] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020182804/http://www.edromanguitars.com/tech/color.htm |date=20 October 2006 }}.

==Changes in eye color==
[[File:Light eye coloration map.png|thumb|Percentage of light eyes in and near Europe according to anthropologist Robert Frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html|title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors?|website=cogweb.ucla.edu|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Most new-born babies who have European ancestry have light-colored eyes. As the child develops, melanocytes (cells found within the iris of human eyes, as well as skin and hair follicles) slowly begin to produce [[melanin]]. Because melanocyte cells continually produce pigment, in theory eye color can be changed. Adult eye color is usually established between 3 and 6 months of age, though this can be later.&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, A. and Leifer, G. (2001) ''Maternity Nursing: An Introductory Text'', W.B. Saunders Medical, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the iris of an infant from the side using only transmitted light with no reflection from the back of the iris, it is possible to detect the presence or absence of low levels of melanin. An iris that appears blue under this method of observation is more likely to remain blue as the infant ages. An iris that appears golden contains some melanin even at this early age and is likely to turn from blue to green or brown as the infant ages.

Changes (lightening or darkening) of eye colors during early childhood, puberty, pregnancy, and sometimes after serious trauma (like [[heterochromia]]) do represent cause for a plausible argument stating that some eyes can or do change, based on chemical reactions and hormonal changes within the body.

Studies on Caucasian twins, both fraternal and identical, have shown that eye color over time can be subject to change, and major demelanization of the iris may also be genetically determined. Most eye-color changes have been observed or reported in the Caucasian population with hazel and amber eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9152135|title=Eye Color Changes Past Early Childhood|year=1997|last1=Bito|first1=LZ|last2=Matheny|first2=A|last3=Cruickshanks|first3=KJ|last4=Nondahl|first4=DM|last5=Carino|first5=OB|volume=115|issue=5|pages=659–63|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology|doi=10.1001/archopht.1997.01100150661017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eye color chart (Martin scale)==
[[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton Coon]] created a chart by the original [[Martin scale]]. The numbering is reversed on the scale below in the (later) [[Martin–Schultz scale]], which is (still) used in [[physical anthropology]].

'''Light and light-mixed eyes''' (16–12 in Martin scale)

Pure light (16–15 in Martin scale)
* 16: pure light blue
* 15: gray

Light-mixed (14–12 in Martin scale)
* 14: Very light-mixed (blue with gray or green or green with gray)
* 13-12: Light-mixed (light or very light-mixed with small admixture of brown)

'''Mixed eyes''' (11–7 in Martin scale) 
Mixture of light eyes (blue, gray or green) with brown when light and brown appearance is at the same level.

'''Dark and dark-mixed eyes''' (6–1 in Martin scale)
* Dark-mixed: 6–5 in Martin scale. Brown with small admixture of light
* Dark: 4–1 in Martin scale. Brown (light brown and dark brown) and very dark brown (almost black)

===Amber===
[[File:EyesAmber1.JPG|thumb|Amber eyes in sunlight – displaying an orange color rather than brown]]
Amber eyes are of a solid color and have a strong yellowish/golden and russet/coppery tint. This may be due to the deposition of the yellow pigment called [[lipochrome]] in the iris (which is also found in green eyes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhmi.org/cgi-bin/askascientist/highlight.pl?kw=&amp;file=answers%2Fgenetics%2Fans_044.html Howard Hughes Medical Institute: Ask A Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901150309/http://www.hhmi.org/cgi-bin/askascientist/highlight.pl?kw=&amp;file=answers%2Fgenetics%2Fans_044.html |date=1 September 2010 }}.

Retrieved on 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Amber eyes should not be confused with hazel eyes; although hazel eyes may contain specks of amber or gold, they usually tend to comprise many other colors, including green, brown and orange. Also, hazel eyes may appear to shift in color and consist of flecks and ripples, while amber eyes are of a solid gold hue. Even though amber is considered to be like gold, some people have russet or copper colored amber eyes that many people mistake for hazel, though hazel tends to be duller and contains green with red/gold flecks, as mentioned above. Amber eyes may also contain amounts of very light gold-ish gray.

The eyes of some pigeons contain yellow fluorescing pigments known as [[pteridine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliphant LW |title=Observations on the pigmentation of the pigeon iris |journal=Pigment Cell Res. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=202–8 |year=1987 |pmid=3508278 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0749.1987.tb00414.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bright yellow eyes of the [[great horned owl]] are thought to be due to the presence of the pteridine pigment [[xanthopterin]] within certain [[chromatophore]]s (called xanthophores) located in the iris stroma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliphant LW |title=Crystalline pteridines in the stromal pigment cells of the iris of the great horned owl |journal=Cell Tissue Res. |volume=217 |issue=2 |pages=387–95 |year=1981 |pmid=7237534 |doi=10.1007/BF00233588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, yellowish specks or patches are thought to be due to the pigment [[lipofuscin]], also known as lipochrome.&lt;ref name=Lefohn/&gt; Many animals such as canines, domestic cats, owls, eagles, pigeons and fish have amber eyes as a common color, whereas in humans this color occurs less frequently.

===Blue===
{{redirect|Blue eyes}}
[[File:BrightBlueEyes.JPG|thumb|A light blue iris]]

There is no blue pigmentation either in the iris or in the ocular fluid. Dissection reveals that the iris pigment [[epithelium]] is brownish black due to the presence of [[melanin]].&lt;ref name=Menon&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Menon IA, Basu PK, Persad S, Avaria M, Felix CC, Kalyanaraman B |title=Is there any difference in the photobiological properties of melanins isolated from human blue and brown eyes? |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=549–52 |year=1987|pmid=2820463 |pmc=1041224 |doi=10.1136/bjo.71.7.549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike brown eyes, blue eyes have low concentrations of [[melanin]] in the stroma of the iris, which lies in front of the dark epithelium. Longer wavelengths of light tend to be absorbed by the dark underlying epithelium, while shorter wavelengths are reflected and undergo [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the [[Turbidity|turbid]] medium of the stroma.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; This is the same frequency-dependence of scattering that accounts for the blue appearance of the sky.&lt;ref name="Fox1978"/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt; The result is a "[[Tyndall effect|Tyndall]] blue" [[structural color]] that varies with external lighting conditions.

In humans, the inheritance pattern followed by blue eyes is considered similar to that of a [[recessive]] trait (in general, eye color inheritance is considered a [[polygenic trait]], meaning that it is controlled by the interactions of several genes, not just one).&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt; In 2008, new research tracked down a single genetic mutation that leads to blue eyes.

[[File:Blue_eyed_black_lemur_face_by_Bruce_McAdam.jpg|thumb|[[Sclater's lemur]], also known as the blue-eyed black lemur]] 
Blue eyes are rare in mammals; one example is the recently discovered marsupial, the [[blue-eyed spotted cuscus]] (''Spilocuscus wilsoni''). The trait is hitherto known only from a single [[primate]] other than humans – [[Sclater's lemur]] (''Eulemur flavifrons'') of Madagascar. While some [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s have blue eyes, this is usually due to another mutation that is [[Deaf white cat|associated with deafness]]. But in cats alone, there are four identified gene mutations that produce blue eyes, some of which are associated with [[congenital]] [[neurological disorder]]s.  The mutation found in the [[Siamese cat]]s is associated with strabismus (crossed eyes).  The mutation found in blue-eyed solid white cats (where the coat color is caused by the gene for "epistatic white") is linked with deafness.  However, there are phenotypically identical, but genotypically different, blue-eyed white cats (where the coat color is caused by the gene for white spotting) where the coat color is not strongly associated with deafness.  In the blue-eyed [[Ojos Azules]] breed, there may be other neurological defects.  Blue-eyed non-white cats of unknown genotype also occur at random in the cat population.

===Gray===
[[File:Gray eyes.jpg|thumb|Gray eyes]]

Like blue eyes, gray eyes have a dark epithelium at the back of the iris and a relatively clear stroma at the front. One possible explanation for the difference in the appearance of gray and blue eyes is that gray eyes have larger deposits of [[collagen]] in the stroma, so that the light that is reflected from the epithelium undergoes [[Mie scattering]] (which is not strongly frequency-dependent) rather than Rayleigh scattering (in which shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more). This would be analogous to the change in the color of the sky, from the blue given by the Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by small gas molecules when the sky is clear, to the gray caused by Mie scattering of large water droplets when the sky is cloudy.&lt;ref name="Southworth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=232 |title=Are gray eyes the same as blue in terms of genetics? |work=Understanding Genetics: Human Health and the Genome |publisher=Stanford School of Medicine |author=Lucy Southworth |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927085904/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=232 |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been suggested that gray and blue eyes might differ in the concentration of melanin at the front of the stroma.&lt;ref name="Southworth" /&gt;

As with blue eyes, the color of green eyes does not result simply from the pigmentation of the iris.  The green color is caused by the combination of: 1) an amber or light brown pigmentation in the stroma of the iris (which has a low or moderate concentration of melanin) with: 2) a blue shade created by the Rayleigh scattering of reflected light.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; Green eyes contain the yellowish pigment [[lipochrome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://allaboutgenes.weebly.com/oca2.html OCA2: The Gene for Color]. allaboutgenes.weebly.com.

===Wilson's disease===
[[File:Kayser-Fleischer ring.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Kayser–Fleischer ring]] in a patient with [[Wilson's disease]]]]
[[Wilson's disease]] involves a mutation of the gene coding for the enzyme [[ATPase]]7B, which prevents [[copper]] within the liver from entering the [[Golgi apparatus]] in cells. Instead, the copper accumulates in the liver and in other tissues, including the iris of the eye. This results in the formation of [[Kayser–Fleischer ring]]s, which are dark rings that encircle the periphery of the iris.&lt;ref name=McDonnell&gt;{{cite journal |author=McDonnell G, Esmonde T |title=A homesick student |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=75 |issue=884 |pages=375–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10435182|pmc=1741256|last2=Esmonde | doi = 10.1136/pgmj.75.884.375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aniridia===
{{Main|Aniridia}}
[[Aniridia]] is a congenital condition characterized by an extremely underdeveloped iris, which appears absent on superficial examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|oph|43|Aniridia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocular albinism and eye color===
Normally, there is a thick layer of melanin on the back of the iris. Even people with the lightest blue eyes, with no melanin on the front of the iris at all, have dark brown coloration on the back of it, to prevent light from scattering around inside the eye. In those with milder forms of [[albinism]], the color of the iris is typically blue but can vary from blue to brown. In severe forms of albinism, there is no pigment on the back of the iris, and light from inside the eye can pass through the iris to the front. In these cases, the only color seen is the red from the hemoglobin of the blood in the capillaries of the iris. Such albinos have pink eyes, as do albino rabbits, mice, or any other animal with a total lack of melanin. [[Transillumination]] defects can almost always be observed during an [[eye examination]] due to lack of iridial pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|OPH|260|Ocular Manifestations of Albinism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ocular albino also lacks normal amounts of melanin in the retina as well, which allows more light than normal to reflect off the retina and out of the eye. Because of this, the [[Pupillary light reflex|pupillary reflex]] is much more pronounced in albino individuals, and this can emphasize the [[red eye effect]] in photographs.

===Heterochromia===
{{Main|Heterochromia iridum}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Heterochromia.jpg|thumb|An example of complete heterochromia. The subject has one brown eye and one hazel eye.]]
[[File:HeterochromiaEye.jpg|thumb|left|An example of sectoral heterochromia. The subject has a blue iris with a brown section.]]

Heterochromia (''[[heterochromia iridum]]'' or ''heterochromia iridis'') is an eye condition in which one iris is a different color from the other (complete heterochromia), or where a part of one iris is a different color from the remainder (partial heterochromia or sectoral heterochromia). It is a result of the relative excess or lack of [[pigment]] within an iris or part of an iris, which may be [[Biological inheritance|inherited]] or acquired by [[disease]] or [[injury]].&lt;ref name=Imesch&gt;{{cite journal |author=Imesch PD, Wallow IH, Albert DM |title=The color of the human eye: a review of morphologic correlates and of some conditions that affect iridial pigmentation |journal=Surv Ophthalmol |volume=41 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S117–23 |year=1997 |pmid=9154287 |doi=10.1016/S0039-6257(97)80018-5 |last2=Wallow |last3=Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uncommon condition usually results due to uneven [[melanin]] content. A number of causes are responsible, including genetic, such as [[Chimera (genetics)|chimerism]], [[Horner's syndrome]] and [[Waardenburg syndrome]].

A [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]] can have two different colored eyes just like any two siblings can—because each cell has different eye color genes. A [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] can have two different colored eyes if the DNA difference happens to be in an eye-color gene.

There are many other possible reasons for having two different-colored eyes.  For example, the film actor [[Lee Van Cleef]] was born with one blue eye and one green eye, a trait that reportedly was common in his family, suggesting that it was a genetic trait.  This anomaly, which film producers thought would be disturbing to film audiences, was "corrected" by having Van Cleef wear brown contact lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1812|section=bio|Lee Van Cleef}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Bowie]], on the other hand, had the appearance of different eye colors due to an injury that caused one pupil to be permanently dilated.

Another hypothesis about heterochromia is that it can result from a viral infection ''in utero'' affecting the development of one eye, possibly through some sort of genetic mutation.  Occasionally, heterochromia can be a sign of a serious medical condition.

A common cause in females with heterochromia is [[X-inactivation]], which can result in a number of heterochromatic traits, such as [[calico cats]]. Trauma and certain medications, such as some [[prostaglandin analogue]]s, can also cause increased pigmentation in one eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hejkal TW, Camras CB |title=Prostaglandin analogs in the treatment of glaucoma |journal=Seminars in ophthalmology |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=114–23 |year=1999 |pmid=10790575 |doi=10.3109/08820539909061464 |last2=Camras}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, a difference in eye color is caused by blood staining the iris after injury.

==Mate selection and traits that have been linked to iris color==

===Selection for rare iris colors===
A study compared the frequency of eye color in commercial advertising models in Brazil and the UK, these countries were chosen because they have inverted frequencies of eye-coloration, with Brazil having an excess of brown and the UK an excess of light-colored eyes. Models are chosen for their attractiveness, and it was found that, in Brazil, models with light eyes are in a significant excess compared to the levels found in the general population, while, in the UK, models with brown or intermediate eyes were in significant excess over their frequency in the general population. This suggests that eye color rarity plays a role in sexual attraction, people with rare eye colors being perceived as being more attractive. Some research indicates that eye color variation is greater in women than in men, which may reflect [[sexual selection]] of mates with rare eye colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0168458| pmid=28005995| pmc=5179042|title = Human Commercial Models' Eye Colour Shows Negative Frequency-Dependent Selection| journal=PLOS ONE| volume=11| issue=12| pages=e0168458|year = 2016|last1 = Forti|first1 = Isabela Rodrigues Nogueira| last2=Young| first2=Robert John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection though imprinting of parental eye color===
In contrast to the phenomenon of selection for rarity, scholarship has implied the existence another form of eye color involvement in mate selection. A study found a significant incidence of the partners of heterosexual people possessing similar eye and hair color to that of their opposite-sex parent. This is suggestive of a form of parental imprinting on eventual mate selection.&lt;ref&gt;Little A.C., Penton-Voak I.S., Burt D.M., Perrett D.I. (2003)''Investigating an imprinting like phenomenon in humans: partners and opposite-sex parents have similar hair and eye colour'', Evol Hum Behav., 24(1):43–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fashion design''' is the [[art]] of applying [[design]], [[aesthetics]] and natural beauty to [[clothing]] and its [[Fashion accessory|accessories]]. It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes, and has varied over time and place. [[Fashion designers]] work in a number of ways in designing clothing and accessories such as bracelets and necklaces. Because of the time required to bring a garment onto the market, designers must at times [[Fashion forecasting|anticipate changes to consumer tastes]].

Designers conduct research on fashion trends and interpret them for their audience. Their specific designs are used by manufacturers. This is the essence of a designer’s role; however, there is variation within this that is determined by the buying and merchandising approach, and product quality; for example, budget retailers will use inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends, but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1517632943/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_TIXlzbNKHZAEH|title=Fashion Buying and Merchandising: From mass-market to luxury retail|last=Hebrero|first=Miguel|date=2015-10-15|publisher=CreateSpace|year=|isbn=9781517632946|location=Printed in the USA|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn, they have a wide range and combinations of materials to work with and a wide range of colors, patterns and styles to choose from. Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within a narrow range of conventional styles, unusual garments are usually sought for special occasions such as [[formal wear|evening wear]] or party [[dress]]es.

Some clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of [[haute couture]] or [[bespoke tailoring]]. Today, most clothing is designed for the [[mass market]], especially casual and every-day wear are called [[ready to wear]].

== Structure ==
Fashion designers may work full-time for one fashion house, as 'in-house designers', which owns the designs, or they work alone or as part of a team. Freelance designers work for themselves, selling their designs to fashion houses, directly to shops, or to clothing manufacturers. The garments bear the buyer's label. Some fashion designers set up their own labels, under which their designs are marketed. Some fashion designers are self-employed and design for individual clients. Other [[high-end]] fashion designers cater to specialty stores or high-end fashion department stores. These designers create original garments, as well as those that follow established fashion trends. Most fashion designers, however, work for apparel manufacturers, creating designs of men's, women's, and children's fashions for the mass market. Large designer brands which have a 'name' as their brand such as [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], [[Tween Brands|Justice]], or [[Juicy Couture|Juicy]] are likely to be designed by a team of individual designers under the direction of a design director.

== Designing a garment ==
Fashion designers work in different ways. Some sketch their ideas on paper, while others drape fabric on a dress form. When a designer is completely satisfied with the fit of the ''toile'' (or muslin), he or she will consult a professional pattern maker who then makes the finished, working version of the pattern out of card or via a computerized system. Finally, a sample garment is made up and tested on a model to make sure it is an operational outfit.

==History==
[[File:Chéruit Salon Paris.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Louise Chéruit|Chéruit]] salon on [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris, 1910]]
{{main article|History of fashion design}}
Fashion design is generally considered to have started in the 19th century with [[Charles Frederick Worth]] who was the first designer to have his [[label]] sewn into the garments that he created. Before the former [[draper]] set up his ''maison couture'' (fashion house) in [[Paris]], clothing design and creation was handled by largely anonymous seamstresses, and high fashion descended from that worn at royal courts. Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear, instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done. The term ''couturier'' was in fact first created in order to describe him. While all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design, only clothing created after 1858 is considered as fashion design.

It was during this period that many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. The images were shown to clients, which was much cheaper than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client liked their design, they ordered it and the resulting garment made money for the house. Thus, the tradition of designers sketching out garment designs instead of presenting completed garments on models to customers began as an economy.

==Types of fashion==
The garments produced by clothing manufacturers fall into three main categories, although these may be split up into additional, more specific categories

===Haute couture===
{{Main article|Haute couture}}
Until the 1950s, fashion clothing was predominately designed and manufactured on a [[made-to-measure]] or [[haute couture]] basis ([[French language|French]] for high-sewing), with each garment being created for a specific client. A couture garment is made to order for an individual customer, and is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric, sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Look and fit take priority over the cost of materials and the time it takes to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Haute Couture?|url=http://www.hautecouturenews.com/what-is-haute-couture/|work=Haute Couture Hot|publisher=HauteCoutureNews.com|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haute Couture Fashion History|url=http://fashion-era.com/haute_couture.htm|work=Fashion-Era.com|publisher=Fashion-Era.com|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Pauline Weston Thomas|format=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of each garment, haute couture makes little direct profit for the fashion houses, but is important for prestige and publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG7883236/Haute-couture-Making-a-loss-is-the-height-of-fashion.html|title=Haute couture: Making a loss is the height of fashion|work=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ready-to-wear (prêt-à-porter)===
{{Main article|Ready-to-wear}}

Ready-to-wear, or prêt-à-porter, clothes are a cross between haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as [[Fashion Week]]. This takes place on a citywide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons of [[Fashion Week]] include, spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal.

===Mass market===

}}
{{Main article|Mass market}}

Currently the [[fashion industry]] relies more on mass market sales. The mass market caters for a wide range of customers, producing ready-to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait around a season to make sure a style is going to catch on before producing their own versions of the original look. To save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machine. The end product can therefore be sold much more cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designers Flock to Mass-Market Retailers|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=87177&amp;page=1#.T68WL9kZHIU|work=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Catherine Valenti|format=Article|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out from Underground|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/10/31/out-from-underground.html|work=The Daily Beast|publisher=Newsweek Magazine|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Sameer Reddy|format=Article|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass market broached by high-end fashion |url=http://www.utepprospector.com/news/mass-market-broached-by-high-end-fashion-1.1494091#.T68YgNkZHIU |work=The Prospector |publisher=College Media Network |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Stephania Lara |format=Article |date=22 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102205229/http://www.utepprospector.com/news/mass-market-broached-by-high-end-fashion-1.1494091 |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a type of design called "kutch" design originated from the German word "kitschig" meaning "ugly" or "not aesthetically pleasing".  ''Kitsch'' can also refer to "wearing or displaying something that is therefore no longer in fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kitsch pickings|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3e2b1f30-7f3a-11e1-b3d4-00144feab49a.html#axzz1uiFiHExC|work=Financial Times Online: Style|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Bethan Cole|format=Article|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Income ==
Median annual wages for salaried fashion designers were $61,160 in May 2008. The middle 50 percent earned between $42,150 and $87,120.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Designers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Arts-and-Design/Fashion-designers.htm|work=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lowest 10 percent earned less than $32,150, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $124,780. Median annual earnings were $52,860 (£40,730.47) in apparel, piece goods, and notions - the industry employing the largest numbers of fashion designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/ooh20022003/ocos090.htm|title=Designers|work=umsl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2016,a fashion designer's median annual salary was $65,170. High end designers can earn around $92,550. In the year of 2016, 23,800 people were accounted as fashion designers in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;((cite web/ url= https://work.chron.com/starting-salary-range-fashion-designer-9391.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"Elements" Fashion Show at College of DuPage 2015 30 (17334518498).jpg|thumb|260px|Fashion show at a fashion designing college, USA, 2015]]

Most fashion houses in the United States are based in [[New York City]], with a high concentration centered in the [[Garment District, New York City|Garment District]] neighborhood. On the west coast, there are also a significant number of fashion houses in [[Los Angeles]], where a substantial percentage of high fashion clothing manufactured in the United States is actually made. [[Beverly Hills]], particularly on [[Rodeo Drive]], is globally renowned for its fashion design and prestigious shopping. Burgeoning industries in [[Miami]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], and especially [[San Francisco]] have developed as well. A semi-annual event held every February and September, [[New York Fashion Week]] is the oldest of the four major [[fashion week]]s held throughout the world. [[Parsons The New School for Design]], located in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Lower Manhattan]] in New York City, is considered as one of the top fashion schools in the world. There are numerous fashion magazines published in the United States and distributed around the world for global readership. Examples include [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], [[Harper’s Bazaar]], and [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]. 

American fashion design is dominated by a clean-cut, urban, casual style; reflecting the [[athlete|athletic]], health-conscious lifestyles of urban city-dwellers.

===British fashion design===
[[London]] has long been the capital of the United Kingdom fashion industry and has a wide range of foreign designs which have integrated with modern British styles. Typical, British design is smart but innovative yet recently has become more and more unconventional, fusing traditional styles with modern techniques. Vintage styles play an important role in the British fashion and styling industry. Stylists regularly 'mix and match' the old with the new, which gives British style that unique, bohemian aesthetic that many of the other fashion capitals try to imitate. Irish fashion (both design and styling) is also heavily influenced by fashion trends from Britain.
Famous British brands and designers include [[Burberry]], [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], [[Alfred Dunhill, Ltd.|Alfred Dunhill]], [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]], [[John Galliano]], [[John Richmond (fashion designer)|John Richmond]], [[Neil Barrett (fashion designer)|Neil Barrett]], [[Matthew Williamson]], [[Hussein Chalayan]], [[Gareth Pugh]], [[Stella McCartney]], [[Mulberry (company)|Mulberry]], [[Thomas Pink]] and [[Vivienne Westwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British fashion designers|url=http://www.visitbritain.com/en/Fashion-designers/|work=Visit Britain|publisher=Visit Britain|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet fashion design===
{{Main article|Fashion in the Soviet Union}}
Fashion in the [[Soviet Union]] largely followed general trends of the Western world. However, the state's [[Socialism|socialist ideology]] consistently moderated and influenced these trends. In addition, shortages of [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] meant that the general public did not have ready access to pre-made fashion.

===Swiss fashion design===
Most of the Swiss fashion houses are in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich labels|url=http://www.zuerich.com/files/?id=40184|work=Zurich labels: Media Information|publisher=Zurich Tourism|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss look is casual elegant and luxurious with a slight touch of quirkiness. Additionally, it has been greatly influenced by the dance club scene.

==Fashion design services==
{{or|date=April 2017}}
Fashion design services provide services like [[Trend forecasting|trend]] and color forecasting, [[market analysis]], design concepts and [[design document]]ation for [[manufacturer]]s. This way the manufacturer can contract out the design requirements rather than maintaining an in-house design team. Fashion design services providers can either sell the [[design]]s outright or license them out on a [[Royalties|royalty]] basis.

If someone is interested in launching a line in footwear, handbags, bedding etc. and are looking to outsource the design work, then a fashion design services provider can help. When initially launching the business, it might be expensive to launch with many new designs, and thus a licensing option from such a company might save startup cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS160645+17-Aug-2009+PRN20090817 27th Point Launches a New Program to Help Start-Up Manufacturers in the Home and Fashion Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion design terms==
* A '''fashion designer''' conceives garment combinations of line, proportion, color, and texture. While sewing and pattern-making skills are beneficial, they are not a pre-requisite of successful fashion design. Most fashion designers are formally trained or apprenticed.
* A '''technical designer''' works with the design team and the factories overseas to ensure correct garment construction, appropriate fabric choices and a good fit. The technical designer fits the garment samples on a fit model, and decides which fit and construction changes to make before mass-producing the garment.
* A '''[[Pattern (sewing)|pattern maker]]''' (''also referred as pattern master or'' ''pattern cutter'') drafts the shapes and sizes of a garment's pieces. This may be done manually with paper and measuring tools or by using a CAD computer software program. Another method is to drape fabric directly onto a dress form. The resulting pattern pieces can be constructed to produce the intended design of the garment and required size. Formal training is usually required for working as a pattern marker.
* A '''[[tailor]]''' makes custom designed garments made to the client's measure; especially suits (coat and trousers, jacket and skirt, et cetera). Tailors usually undergo an apprenticeship or other formal training.
* A '''[[Textiles|textile designer]]''' designs fabric weaves and prints for clothes and furnishings. Most textile designers are formally trained as apprentices and in school.
* A '''[[Wardrobe stylist|stylist]]''' co-ordinates the clothes, jewelry, and accessories used in fashion photography and catwalk presentations. A stylist may also work with an individual client to design a coordinated wardrobe of garments. Many stylists are trained in fashion design, the history of fashion, and historical costume, and have a high level of expertise in the current fashion market and future market trends. However, some simply have a strong aesthetic sense for pulling great looks together.
* A '''[[fashion buyer]]''' selects and buys the mix of clothing available in retail shops, department stores, and chain stores. Most fashion buyers are trained in business and/or fashion studies.
*A '''[[seamstress]]''' sews ready-to-wear or mass-produced clothing by hand or with a sewing machine, either in a garment shop or as a sewing machine operator in a factory. She (or he) may not have the skills to make (design and cut) the garments, or to fit them on a model.
* A '''[[teacher|teacher of fashion design]]''' teaches the art and craft of fashion design in art or fashion school.
* A '''custom clothier''' makes custom-made garments to order, for a given customer.
* A '''[[dressmaker]]''' specializes in custom-made women's clothes: day, cocktail, and evening dresses, business clothes and suits, trousseaus, sports clothes, and lingerie. 

* An '''[[illustration|illustrator]]''' draws and paints clothing designs for commercial use.
* A '''[[fashion forecasting|fashion forecaster]]''' predicts what colours, styles and shapes will be popular ("on-trend") before the garments are on sale in stores.
* A '''[[Fashion model|model]]''' wears and displays clothes at fashion shows and in photographs.
* A '''[[fit model]]''' aids the fashion designer by wearing and commenting on the fit of clothes during their design and pre-manufacture. Fit models need to be a particular size for this purpose.
* A '''[[Fashion journalism|fashion journalist]]''' writes fashion articles describing the garments presented or fashion trends, for magazines or newspapers.
* An '''alterations specialist''' ('''alterationist''') adjusts the fit of completed garments, usually ready-to-wear, and sometimes re-styles them. NOTE: despite tailors altering garments to fit the client, not all alterationists are tailors.
* An '''image consultant''', '''wardrobe consultant''' or '''fashion advisor''' recommends styles and colors that are flattering to the client.

'''''Fifty Shades Freed''''' is a 2018 American [[Sex in film|erotic]] [[romantic drama film]] directed by [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]] and written by Niall Leonard, and based on [[E. L. James]]'s [[Fifty Shades Freed|2012 novel of the same name]]. It is the third and final installment in the [[Fifty Shades (film series)|''Fifty Shades'' film series]], following ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' (2015) and ''[[Fifty Shades Darker (film)|Fifty Shades Darker]]'' (2017). The film stars [[Dakota Johnson]] and [[Jamie Dornan]] as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, respectively, and follows the couple as they marry, and must deal with Ana's former boss ([[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]]), who begins to stalk them.

[[Principal photography]] on ''Fifty Shades Freed'' began simultaneously with ''Darker'' in February 2016, in [[Paris]] and [[Vancouver]]. The film was released in the United States on February 9, 2018, including a limited [[IMAX]] release. It grossed $371 million worldwide, the lowest total of the series, and like its two predecessors received negative reviews, with criticism of its screenplay and acting.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
Newlyweds Christian and Anastasia are forced to cut their honeymoon short and return home after receiving news of a break-in at Christian's corporate headquarters. Some computer files were stolen and security camera tapes identify the perpetrator as Jack Hyde, Ana's former boss who was fired for sexual assault. Meanwhile, Ana is introduced to her new personal security team.

Christian surprises Ana with a new house and has hired an attractive architect, Gia Matteo, to rebuild it. Ana is annoyed when Gia openly flirts with Christian in Ana's presence. Ana privately threatens to fire Gia if she continues her flirting, forcing her to stop.

When Christian is away on a business trip, Ana disregards his wishes that she stay at home, and meets her friend, Kate Kavanagh, for a drink. Kate, who is dating Christian's older brother Elliot, confides that she suspects Elliot may be having an affair with Gia, who is also his business associate. When Ana returns home, she encounters Jack Hyde, who attempts to kidnap her. Ana's security team subdues him and he is arrested. After an argument with Christian about her night out with Kate, Ana berates Christian for being overly controlling and possessive and demands more freedom. Soon after, Christian surprises Ana with a trip to Aspen, bringing along Kate, Elliot, Mia, and José. Elliott proposes to Kate, who accepts. It is revealed that Gia was only helping Elliott choose the ring.

The newlyweds continue with their erotic sexual experimentation, but matters become complicated when Ana announces she is pregnant. Christian is deeply disturbed, saying he had other plans for their early years together. He leaves, going on a night-long drunken bender. After he returns, Ana discovers that Christian had texted and met his ex-lover and former [[BDSM]] dominant, Elena Lincoln. She becomes angry with Christian and locks herself in the playroom for the night. Christian searches for Ana in the morning and they continue arguing with Ana telling Christian how important the baby is for her.

Shortly after, Hyde, released on a $500,000 bond, phones Ana demanding a ransom for Mia, Christian's abducted sister. Hyde demands $5,000,000 in cash in two hours and threatens to kill Mia if his demands aren't met. He warns Ana to tell no one and to bring the money alone. Ana takes some money and a revolver from the house safe, then goes to the bank to withdraw the full amount. The suspicious bank manager calls Christian. He thinks Ana is leaving him but then notices the coincidence of Hyde's recent release, Mia's unknown whereabouts, and Ana's sudden large cash withdrawal. Hyde instructs Ana to get into a car parked in the alley and to hand over her phone to the driver to discard. Ana tricks Hyde by taking the bank manager's phone and slipping her own phone into the bag of money. She exits the back entrance to discover that the driver and Jack's accomplice is her co-worker, Liz.

Ana arrives at the drop-off site with the money. Hyde, psychotic and vengeful, attacks Ana and kicks her abdomen. Liz tries to stop Jack as Ana pulls out the revolver and shoots Hyde in the leg. Christian and his security team, who electronically tracked Ana's cell phone, arrive and apprehend Hyde and Liz. Ana blacks out as she hears Christian's voice.

Ana awakens three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side. Though angry at Ana's recklessness and still anxious about fatherhood, Christian realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile. Christian's adoptive mother, Grace, assures Christian that Ana will not leave him. Ana returns home the next day. Christian's private investigator, Welch, has left a report showing that Christian and Hyde had shared the same foster family, though Christian has no memory of this. Hyde was vengeful over Christian being adopted by the wealthy Grey family instead of him. It is also learned that Hyde blackmailed Liz into being his accomplice. Christian and Ana also learn where Christian's birth mother is buried. They visit her grave and Christian lays flowers on it.

Eight months later, Christian and Ana have a son named Theodore and a year later Ana is pregnant with their second child.

''Fifty Shades Freed'' grossed $101 million in the United States and Canada, and $270.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $371.2 million, against a production budget of $55 million.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt;

In the United States and Canada, ''Fifty Shades Freed'' was released alongside ''[[Peter Rabbit (film)|Peter Rabbit]]'' and ''[[The 15:17 to Paris]]'', and was projected to gross $37–40 million from 3,768 theaters in its opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/fifty-shades-freed-peter-rabbit-clint-eastwood-1517-to-paris-1202245710/|title='Fifty Shades Freed' Looks To Lead Pre-Valentine's Day Weekend With Around $40M – B.O.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 13%, based on 150 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 3.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Fifty Shades Freed'' brings its titillating trilogy to a clumsy conclusion, making for a film franchise that adds up to a distinctly dissatisfying ''[[ménage à trois]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fifty Shades Freed (2018) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fifty_shades_freed|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 43 critics, meaning "generally unfavorable reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fifty Shades Freed Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fifty-shades-freed |accessdate=February 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by ''Darker'', while [[PostTrak]] reported that 56% of females (who made up 81% of the opening weekend audience) gave the film a "definite recommend".&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Guy Lodge was critical of the film, saying "Indeed, a sex-free, PG-13 version of ''Freed'' could be cut without shedding a second of narrative coherence, such as it is; one could ask what the point of that would be, though similar queries might be leveled at the film as it stands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/fifty-shades-freed-review-1202689842/|title=Film Review: 'Fifty Shades Freed'|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |date=February 7, 2018 |accessdate=February 8, 2018|last=Lodge|first=Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] gave the film zero out of four, stating "With this last entry, we have officially hit the bottom of the barrel. Whips, chains, butt plugs and nipple clips are nothing compared to the sheer torture of watching this movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/peter-travers-fifty-shades-freed-is-pure-cinematic-masochism-w516369|title='Fifty Shades Freed' Review: Welcome to the Most Painful 'Shades' of All|first=Peter |last=Travers|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=February 8, 2018|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robbie Collin]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' gave the film one out of five stars, and wrote "This is a film in which one of the more emotionally detailed performances is given by a product-placement [[Audi]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/fifty-shades-freed-review-painful-prissy-even-ropier-last-one/|title=Fifty Shades Freed review: painful, prissy, and even ropier than the last one|first=Robbie|last=Collin|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=February 8, 2018|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeannette Catsoulis, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', found the film to be significantly inferior to [[Kim Basinger]]'s ''[[9½ Weeks]]'', stating: "Layering a damp-squib thriller subplot beneath what appears to be an ad campaign for the one-percent lifestyle, the returning director and screenwriter test the newly married couple with an inconvenient pregnancy and an unconvincing car chase. There's an out-of-left-field abduction and a marital tiff over email addresses; but these narrative fragments, lazily tossed together alongside a neglected supporting cast, are no more than a flimsy causeway connecting bonking sessions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/movies/fifty-shades-freed-review-jamie-dornan-dakota-johnson.html|title=Review: Finally, the Audience Is 'Fifty Shades Freed'|first=Jeannette|last=Catsoulis|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 8, 2018|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, ''[[IndieWire]]'' reviewer Manuela Lazic gave the film three out of four stars, saying "Finally, the ''Fifty Shades'' phenomenon has yielded a disarming comedy that makes this ridiculous material fun to watch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2018/02/fifty-shades-freed-review-sex-comedy-bdsm-1201925918/|title='Fifty Shades Freed' Review: Finally, a Sex Comedy From a Franchise That Took Itself Too Seriously|first=Manuela|last=Lazic|work=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=February 8, 2018|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Humanity's End''''' is a 2009 American [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Neil Johnson (director)|Neil Johnson]]. Based upon a story concept by Johnson, and with a screenplay by Johnson and Michael Jonathan Smith, the film stars Jay Laisne, Rochelle Vallese and Cynthia Ickes.&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Home Media Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virtual DVD Magazine"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
Several hundred years into the future, mankind has been relegated to the position of a minority species being replaced by a clone-race called "''Homo technis''" or "Konstrukts" which is itself being supplanted by the [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] race "''Homo superior''".  The ''Homo superior'' have enhanced themselves with DNA from a race of hostile extraterrestrials called Nephilim who are known for their superior military skills, to wipe out all the ''Homo sapiens'' and ''Homo technis'' "lesser" races from the galaxy. In order to save the "lower" races, ''Homo technis'' develops a genus of sapiens called "breeders", with an ability to bring multiple births to term quickly.

The Nephilim ''Homo superior'' manage to destroy all of Earth's "breeders", save one man and one woman. As a "breeder" himself, disgraced military man Derasi Vorde (Jay Laisne), has the duty of bringing the last female "breeder" from Earth to the safety of an off-world rebel base.

==Critical response==
''[[Quiet Earth]]'' praised the expectations created by release of the [[film trailer]], writing they were "immediately blown away by what a SFX extravaganza it was shaping up to be,"&lt;ref name="Quiet Earth"/&gt; and that even if the CGI did not live up to expectations created by such as [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the release of the film was anticipated.&lt;ref name="Quiet Earth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Orange|first=Agent|title=Cool retro poster and new trailer for ambitious scifi flick ''Humanity's End''|url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2009/03/19/Cool-retro-poster-and-new-trailer-for-ambitious-scifi-flick-HUMANITYS-END|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Quiet Earth]]|date=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[DVD Talk]]'' made note the film suffered from low-quality [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] but, based upon its original film trailer, the concept appeared intriguing.  They offered that the film itself came off as an effort that appears to use parts of ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'', post-modern ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', mixed with old-school 1950s [[B-movie]] [[sci-fi]], overstated machismo male characters, and an inventive intergalactic tech-speak, to create a product that is "unintentionally hilarious cinematic cheese".&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"/&gt;  In noted director Neil Johnson's love for "interstellar overdrives",&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"/&gt; they observed that he borrowed plot devices from such as ''[[Children of Men]]'', ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and '50s B-movies, and how like Raul Gasteazoro did with ''10,000 A.D.: The Legend of a Black Pearl'' and [[Cory McAbee]] with ''[[The American Astronaut]]'', he created his own version of the future universe, and stuck to its constraints, even though his characters were caricatures, "no matter how irritating or aggravating."&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"/&gt;  They concluded that the result was "far from space junky",&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"/&gt; but that the director's single-mindedness gave a result which ended up "looking a bit silly."&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"/&gt; They gave him "kudos for being so brave"&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"/&gt; and "a few demerits for being so bafflingly brazen."&lt;ref name="DVD Talk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibron|first=Bill|title=DVD review: ''Humanity's End''|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38012/humanitys-end/|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[DVD Talk]]|date=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Home Media Magazine]]'' makes note that the film does not result in the destruction of humanity, but that the resemblance of the various forms of humans to one another adds to confusion for the viewer. They praised Jay Laisne as Derasi Vorde, writing his "[[Han Solo]] impressions will be enjoyed by sci-fi fans disappointed by [[Harrison Ford]]'s appointment with the natural aging process".&lt;ref name="Home Media Magazine"/&gt;  They also approved of the film's focusing on the characters rather than the technology, offering that this created a science fiction story "that is above the norm."&lt;ref name="Home Media Magazine"/&gt;  They found flaw in the film's concentration on "petty drama between the characters"&lt;ref name="Home Media Magazine"/&gt; when the far more crucial battles of earth-humanity vs Nephilim is played out off camera and in the background.&lt;ref name="Home Media Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hecht|first=Isabella|title=Humanity’s End (DVD Review)|url=http://www.homemediamagazine.com/dvd-reviews/humanity%E2%80%99s-end-dvd-review|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Home Media Magazine]]|date=July 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Virtual DVD Magazine'' offered that the film would be appreciated by lovers of B-movie science fiction, but that its low-quality CGI visuals would require getting used to. They noted as a flaw, the film concentrating on characters to the exclusion of the backstory, in that in omitting the battles between humanity and the Nephilim, the film did not give viewers as much as it could have.&lt;ref name="Virtual DVD Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=staff|language=German|title=Humanity’s End, DVD review|url=http://dvd-magazine.eu/dvd/?p=1525|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=Virtual DVD Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt The Hundred Guilder Print.jpg|thumb|330px|The ''Hundred Guilder Print'', [[etching]], c.&amp;nbsp;1647–1649.]]
The '''''Hundred Guilder Print''''' is an [[etching]] by [[Rembrandt]]. The etching's popular name derives from the large sum of money supposedly once paid for an impression (copy).  It is also called ''Christ healing the sick'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hundred Guilder Print|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O151802/christ-healing-the-sick-the-print-rembrandt-van-rijn/|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Christ with the Sick around Him, Receiving Little Children'',&lt;ref name=MuseumOfFineArts&gt;{{cite book|title=Rembrandt: Experimental Etcher |author=[[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] |publisher=New York Graphic Society|location=Greenwich, CT|year=1969|pages=28–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Christ preaching'',&lt;ref name=Wieseman /&gt; since the print depicts multiple events from [[Gospel of Matthew]] [[Matthew 19|chapter 19]], including [[Jesus|Christ]] [[Miracles of Jesus|healing]] the sick, debating with scholars and [[The Little Children|calling on children]] to come to him.&lt;ref name=Rijksmuseum /&gt; The [[Jesus and the rich young man|rich young man]] mentioned in the chapter is leaving through the gateway on the right.&lt;ref name=Rijksmuseum&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/aria/aria_assets/RP-P-OB-601 Hundred Guilder Print], [[Rijksmuseum]]. Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this work, Rembrandt broke from the long-standing Northern European tradition of ascribing devotional qualities to religious paintings. Instead, Rembrandt depicted Biblical events as tender instances of piety and serenity.&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A Global History|year=2005|publisher=Clark Baxter|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780495115502|pages=680, 685, 686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The print is reminiscent of many other Christian religious artworks because it clearly focuses on the figure of Jesus in the centre of the scene. It differs, however, in that it is not based on a single biblical story. Through his use of recognizable figures, Rembrandt illustrates various themes and events from [[Matthew 19]]. The wealthy youth seated with his head in his hand recalls Christ's admonition against amassing excess wealth, and the mothers presenting their babies to be blessed symbolize Christ's acceptance of all his followers, no matter how individually insignificant. Thus, the etching served an edifying purpose for Rembrandt's original audience because it presents many religious messages all packed together.&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages" /&gt;

Rembrandt worked on the ''Hundred Guilder Print'' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the "critical work in the middle of his career", from which his final etching style began to emerge.&lt;ref name=White&gt;Christopher White, ''The Late Etchings of Rembrandt'', (London: British Museum/Lund Humphries, 1969) pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; He probably completed it in 1649.&lt;ref name=Wieseman /&gt; Although the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.&lt;ref name=White /&gt;

Wieseman describes the etching as a "technical tour de force, incorporating an enormous diversity of printmaking styles and techniques":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The group of figures at the left side of the print, for example, is deftly indicated with a minimum of lightly bitten lines; in contrast, the evocative richness of the blacks and the depth of tone in the right half of the print represents Rembrandt's experimental competition with the newly discovered [[mezzotint]] technique.&lt;ref name=Wieseman&gt;{{cite web|last=Wieseman|first=M|title=The Hundred Guilder Print|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/Rembrandt_HundredGuilder.htm|publisher=[[Allen Memorial Art Museum]]|accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Baillie Print==
Around 1775, Captain [[William Baillie (engraver)|William Baillie]] printed a 100 impression edition of an extensively re-worked, by his own hand, version of Rembrandt's original copper plate.&lt;ref name=MuseumOfFineArts/&gt;

He acquired the plate, already worn down by repeated printings, from the painter and engraver [[John Greenwood (artist)|John Greenwood]].&lt;ref name=MuseumOfFineArts/&gt; As an engraver himself, Baillie attempted to restore the work, but his effort was considered "hard and unfeeling, lacking all the subtleties of Rembrandt's own work".&lt;ref name=MuseumOfFineArts/&gt;  After his edition, Baillie cut the plate into four pieces, reworked them further, and had them printed as separate images. To the reduced center fragment with Christ, he added the frame of an arch.&lt;ref name=MuseumOfFineArts/&gt;&lt;ref name=MfaPrint2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13970">'''Intellectual rights to magic methods''' refers to the legal and ethical debate about the extent to which [[Property|proprietary]] or [[exclusive right]]s may subsist in the methods or processes by which [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks or illusions are performed. It is a subject of some controversy. 

On one side, many magicians argue that methods represent "[[intellectual property]]" and that publication or sharing of methods should be subject to strict codes developed by magicians' organizations. On the other side, a range of people argue that publication of information about methods should not be subject to restrictions because knowledge should be freely available. The sharing of magic methods with non-magicians or the open publication of methods is referred to in the magic community as "[[Exposure (magic)|exposure]]" and many magicians react angrily to it. 

While many magic tricks rely on traditional methods, there is also a continuing development and progress within the genre. Those who are performers and amateurs tend to take a very defensive stance against all "[[Exposure (magic)|exposure]]", while those who are creators and originators tend to care more about recent works – works with living and identifiable creators.

==Possible legal protection==
There are a number of areas of law that might provide a basis for magicians to claim ownership of certain pieces of knowledge and to prevent exposure. [[Copyright]], [[patent]], [[trade secret]] and [[trademark]] law, are the primary sources of legal protection at issue on the topic. Each type of protection has its own limitations and loopholes. 

===Copyright===
Under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], member states are free to prescribe in their national legislation that copyright is automatically granted to a work only when it is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium. In the U.S., [[United States Copyright Law|copyright law]] only protects works that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Accordingly, some argue, the processes or movements required for a trick are not copyrightable within the U.S, but recordings, written descriptions, or photographs of such a performance may be copyrightable themselves.

The [[idea–expression dichotomy]] specifies that mere ideas are not entitled to copyright; only the expression of those ideas are granted protection. For example, if a magician writes a description of how a trick works, the description will generally be subject to copyright.

Another potential area of copyright protection for magic creators is through a choreography or pantomime copyright. This was successfully employed by Teller in 2014 in a case against Belgian entertainer Gerard Dogge, who had posted a YouTube video of an illusion called The Rose &amp; Her Shadow.&lt;ref name="tellercase"/&gt;

Magic illusion inventor and magician Hessel Bos also registered a magic trick as a copyright with the United States Copyright Office (registration is not essential for copyright protection but it offers additional advantages for rights holders). Bos registered his tricks by describing every movement of the magic tricks via text and photographs and then submitted these documents to the copyright office. They were approved under the Performance Art section and a certificate of registration was granted. In September 2008 Bos successfully filed a complaint under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] against America Online to remove a video from their website.

=== Patents ===
An [[invention]] or process which facilitates the performance of a magic trick is potentially [[patentability|patentable]] in the U.S. However, applying for patent protection requires the public release of information about how the device or process works. Furthermore, when a patent is obtained, it can only be used to prevent a third party from making or using the subject matter of the patent. This prevents other magicians from performing the trick but cannot be used to prevent anyone from revealing how the trick works.

Notably, in 1938, [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] was sued by magician [[Horace Goldin]] over an ad campaign which revealed one method for a ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]'' trick.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 22 F. Supp. 61 (D.N.Y. 1938)&lt;/ref&gt; The case was eventually dismissed by a federal court and Goldin then gave up on patenting his methods.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web

===Trade secret and contract law===
Magic methods are effectively forms of [[trade secret]] and share many characteristics of trade secrets in other business sectors. As such there is a significant body of law that falls under the headings of "[[confidentiality]]" and "[[contract law]]" that might be used to control or protect them. These measures can effectively allow a perpetual monopoly in secret information – i.e. it does not expire as would a patent or copyright.

A company or individual can protect their confidential information through non-disclosure contracts with employees or business associates.  A magician might therefore ask a partner or fellow magician to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] before sharing magic methods. That contract could then be enforced through the courts. The terms of such contracts might be subject to constraints of employment law (for example including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic and time scope). As with law generally, there will be variations across jurisdictions. 

Information which a magician has intentionally kept confidential and which is not in the [[public domain]] may also be deemed to have a legally enforceable quality of [[Trade secret#Legal development to protecting trade secrets|confidentiality]]. The exact legal definitions of circumstances in which such protection applies vary across jurisdictions, as do the remedies available.

==Court cases==
{{globalize/US|section|date=November 2017}}
Court cases provide the ultimate test for any of the possible rights outlined above and, indeed, often establish law in the form of [[case law]]. There have been a number of court cases in which magicians have sought to assert rights to magic methods and prevent publications or broadcasts. These include:

* '''1920s–1930s:'''  [[Horace Goldin]] was involved in many legal actions related to the ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]'' illusion, including a successful unfair competition claim in 1922 against the makers of a film that exposed the method,&lt;ref&gt;''Goldin v. Clarion Photoplays'', New York (Dec 1922), referenced in [https://web.archive.org/web/20151104073050/http://www.jstor.org/stable/789035 |The Yale Law Journal], Vol. 32, No. 2, p.201, and also in [http://www.cap-press.com/pdf/1605.pdf ''Advanced Torts: Cases and materials''], (Law Casebook Series), Carolina Academic Press, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and an unsuccessful unfair competition claim in 1938 against the [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] for exposing the secret in an advertisement for cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 22 F. Supp. 61 (SDNY 1938).&lt;/ref&gt; The latter case was dismissed because Goldin's 1923 patent on the illusion revealed its mechanism to the public.
* '''1943:''' Charles "Think-a-Drink" Hoffman sued Maurice Glazer for violation of his copyright and trademark rights in his "Think-a-Drink" act. The Supreme Court of Florida upheld the trademark decision for Hoffman, but held that Hoffman's act was not "dramatic" enough to qualify for Copyright Protection under the 1909 definition.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer v. Hoffman, 153 Fla. 809 (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1947:''' The Harold Lloyd Corporation sued Universal Pictures Company for copyright violation of its film "Movie Crazy." In the infringed scenes, the protagonist accidentally puts on a magician's coat and he is plagued by a series of bewildering magic effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10760655899099210600&amp;q=162+f.2d+354&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002 Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corporation, 162 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1947)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1998:''' Joseph Harrison and a number of other magicians filed an unsuccessful class-action lawsuit against SF broadcasting and Fox Broadcasting for exposing the secrets to a number of illusions on their [[Masked Magician]] special.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison v. SF Broadcasting. No. Civ. A. 98–1107. 1998 WL 355462 (E.D. La. Jun. 30, 1998). Chief Judge Sear stated, "I recognize that Plaintiffs' Petition seeks to redress the betrayal of the honor code among magicians, but such redress is not available here because no legal rights have been violated." &lt;/ref&gt; They sought relief for violation of the magicians' honor code under Louisiana's abuse of rights doctrine, but were denied because the doctrine only applies to contracts and property.
* '''1998:''' [[André Kole]] tried to sue the makers of the ''[[Masked Magician]]'' television specials to prevent exposure of the ''[[Table of Death]]'' trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Codes of practice==
The most effective protection against the public exposure of magic methods may be a matter of [[ethics]] or peer pressure. One of the largest societies of magicians in the world, the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]], has a [[Ethical code|Code of Ethics]] which states:
:''All members of the International Brotherhood of Magicians agree to oppose the willful exposure to the public of any principles of the Art of Magic, or the methods employed in any magic effect or illusion.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.magician.org/CodeOfEthics.htm 
 |title=The International Brotherhood of Magicians (anti-exposure) code of ethics 
 |accessdate=2007-03-12 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310230344/http://www.magician.org/CodeOfEthics.htm 
 |archivedate=2007-03-10 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brotherhood advises that any individual who is a professional or amateur magician should be aware that "exposing" the methods of an illusion may result in damage to their relations among other magicians.

However, such codes don't extend to selling magic, though magicians consider{{Who|date=January 2010}} the seller of a magic trick should prove that the purchaser intends to learn and perform the trick for others, thereby becoming a magician, rather than simply wanting to know how a magic trick is done out of curiosity.

[[File:Rete ferroviaria Libia Italiana.png|thumb|right|The five railways in Italian Libya.]]

'''Italian Libya Railways''' was a group of small railways built in the [[History of Libya as Italian colony|Italian colony of Libya]] between the two World Wars.

==History==
The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] built in [[Italian Libya]] nearly 400&amp;nbsp;km of railways with {{track gauge|950mm|lk=on|al=on}} gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orsomax.com/OEA/OEAvillaggi3.htm |title=Orsomax OEA villaggi |publisher=Orsomax.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The Italian authorities decided to give priority to the construction of [[road]]s in Libya when [[Benito Mussolini]] took control of the Italian colonies. After 1926 no more railways were made in Libya, but during [[World War II]] the need of railways transport to the front during the war in the frontier with [[History of Egypt under the British|British Egypt]] changed this approach.

In spring 1941 the Italian government started the construction of a new railway between Tripoli and [[Benghazi]], but by the end of 1942 all was stopped because of the Italian defeat in north Africa: only 18&amp;nbsp;km were done in Cirenaica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gips.unisi.it/files/wp18.pdf Le ferrovie coloniali italiane in Libia (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722063813/http://www.gips.unisi.it/files/wp18.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
In Libya the first locomotives were the [[steam locomotives]] R.401 and R.301, but the most successful were the R.302 produced in [[northern Italy]].

==Railways==
There were only five small railways:

1) Tripoli-Zuara (118&amp;nbsp;km):

'''''Jasad''''' ("body" in Arabic) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic-language]] cultural magazine based in [[Beirut]], specializing in the literature, art and science of the body. It was founded by [[Joumana Haddad]].

==History and profile==
Founded in 2008, the first issue of ''Jasad'' appeared in December of that same year,&lt;ref name=zab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanese magazine champions sex and the city|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/03/30/69535.html|accessdate=13 October 2013|work=Al Arabiya|date=2 November 2010|agency=AFP|location=Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has raised a great deal of controversy ever since, because it tackles subjects that are taboo in the Arabic language and societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/13/lebanon-middleeast-magazine-taboo|accessdate=22 December 2008|title=From Voyeur's Corner to My First Time: new magazine attempts to lift veil on Arab taboos|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Ian|last=Black|date=13 December 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the March 2009 issue the magazine included articles about sexuality in the Arab world.&lt;ref name=zab&gt;{{cite news|title=Jasad magazine casts an unprecedented spotlight on sexuality in the Arab world|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Arts/Mar/31/Jasad-magazine-casts-an-unprecedented-spotlight-on-sexuality-in-the-Arab-world.ashx#axzz2g1cYANxV|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=31 March 2009|author=Jocelyne Zablit|agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jasad'' is published by "Al Joumana". It is mainly in print, but small excerpts from each new issue are made available on its website. The founder, editor and publisher of the magazine is Lebanese poet and journalist [[Joumana Haddad]] who is also culture editor of ''[[An Nahar]]'' daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/12/AR2009051203465.html|accessdate=12 September 2009|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Alia Ibrahim|date=13 May 2009|title=Beirut's 'Body' Language Pioneer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dobrina Zhekova|title=Joumana Haddad on the Fate of the Arab World's First Erotic Literary Magazine|url=http://www.elle.com/news/culture/joumana-haddad-interview-on-womens-rights-jasad|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=Elle|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jasad'' is distributed to readers worldwide through bookshops and/or by rapid courier via a yearly subscription system. It is a glossy magazine, 200 pages, sized 22 x 28&amp;nbsp;cm, and consists of different sections and columns, ranging from reportages, testimonies and articles, to essays, translations and creative writings, all covering the fields of cinema, literature, arts, theater, philosophy, science, revolving around the axis of the body.&lt;ref name=llc&gt;{{cite news|title=In Lebanon, 'Jasad' Magazine Defies Taboos|url=http://researchandmedia.ning.com/profiles/blogs/in-lebanon-jasad-magazine|accessdate=13 October 2013|work=Research and Media Network|date=16 March 2009|author=Lynette Lee Corporal|location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saseen Kawzally regarded the magazine on 2 February 2009 as "very confusing" and as covering varied material that is not "entirely coherent".&lt;ref name=llc/&gt;

Furie]] about [[jazz]] singer [[Billie Holiday]], loosely based on her [[Lady Sings the Blues (book)|1956 autobiography]] which, in turn, took its title from [[Lady Sings the Blues (song)|one of Holiday's most popular songs]]. It was produced by [[de Passe Entertainment|Motown Productions]] for [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Diana Ross]] portrayed Holiday, alongside a cast including [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[James T. Callahan]], and [[Scatman Crothers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=54377 The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:''Lady Sings the Blues'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1945 New York City, [[Billie Holiday]] is arrested on a drugs charge.

In a flashback to 1928, Billie is working as a housekeeper in a brothel in Baltimore where she is raped. She runs away to her mother, who sets up a job cleaning for another brothel in the Harlem section of New York. The brothel is run by an arrogant, selfish owner who pays Billie very little money.

Eventually, Billie tires of scrubbing floors and becomes a prostitute, but later quits and returns to a nightclub to unsuccessfully audition to become a showgirl. After "Piano Man" accompanies Billie when she sings "[[All of Me (Ruth Etting song)|All of Me]]", club owner Jerry books her as a singer in the show.

Billie's debut begins unsuccessfully until Louis McKay arrives and gives her a fifty dollar tip. Billie takes the money and sings "Them There Eyes". Billie takes a liking to Louis and begins a relationship with him. Eventually she is discovered by Harry and Reg Hanley, who sign her as a soloist for their southern tour in hopes of landing a radio network gig. During the tour, Billie witnesses the aftermath of the [[lynching]] of an African-American man, which presses her to record the controversial song "[[Strange Fruit]]". The harsh experiences on the tour result in Billie taking drugs which Harry supplies. One night when Billie is performing, Louis comes to see Billie. She collapses on stage. In her dressing room, Louis notices her needle marks, knows that she is doing drugs, and tells her she is going home with him. Billie promises to stay off the drugs if Louis stays with her.

In New York, Reg and Louis arrange Billie's radio debut, but the station does not call her to sing; the radio sponsors, a soap company, object to her race. The group heads to Cafe Manhattan to drown their sorrows. Billie has too much to drink and asks Harry for drugs, saying that she does not want her family to know that the radio show upset her. He refuses and she throws her drink in his face. She is ready to leave, but Louis has arranged for her to sing at the Cafe, a club where she once aspired to sing. She obliges with one song but refuses an encore, leaving the club in urgent need of a fix. Louis, suspicious that Billie has broken her promise, takes her back to his home but refuses to allow her access to the bathroom or her kit. She fights Louis for it, pulling a razor on him. Louis leaves her to shoot up, telling her he does not want her there when he returns.

Billie returns to the Harlem nightclub, where her drug use intensifies until she hears of the death of her mother. Billie checks herself into a drug clinic, but because she cannot afford her treatment the hospital secretly calls Louis, who comes to see her and agrees to pay her bills without her knowledge. Impressed with the initiative she has taken to straighten herself out, Louis proposes to her at the hospital. Just as things are looking up, Billie is arrested for possession of narcotics and removed from the clinic.

In prison, Billie goes through crippling withdrawal. Louis brings the doctor from the hospital to treat her, but she is incoherent. He puts a ring on her finger to remind her of his promise to marry her. When she finishes her prison sentence, Billie returns home and tells her friends that she does not want to sing anymore. Billie marries Louis and pledges not to continue her career, but the lure of performing is too strong and she returns to singing with Louis as her manager. Unfortunately, her felony conviction has stripped her of her Cabaret Card, which would allow her to sing in NYC nightclubs. To restore public confidence and regain her license, Billie agrees to a cross-country tour. Billie's career takes off on the nightclub circuit.

Louis leaves for New York to arrange a comeback performance for Billie at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Despondent at Louis' absence and the never-ending stream of venues, Billie asks Piano Man to pawn the ring Louis gave her in exchange for drugs. While they are high that evening, Piano Man's drug connections arrive; he neither pawned the ring nor paid for the drugs. Piano Man is killed by the dealers. Within the hour, Louis and her promoter call Billie with news that they got Carnegie Hall. Louis returns to find a very fragile Billie who is traumatized and has fallen back into drugs. Louis takes her back to New York.

Billie plays to a packed house at Carnegie Hall. Her encore, "God Bless the Child", is overlaid with newspaper clippings highlighting subsequent events: the concert fails to sway the Commission to restore her license; subsequent appeals are denied; she is later re-arrested on drug charges and finally dies when she is 44. Nevertheless, the Carnegie triumph is frozen in time.

==Critical reception==
[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Ross as "an an actress of exceptional beauty and wit, who is very much involved in trying to make a bad movie work ... her only apparent limitations are those imposed on her by a screenplay and direction seemingly designed to turn a legitimate legend into a whopper of a cliché."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=October 19, 1972 |title=Screen: Billie Holiday |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that "for the bulk of general audiences, the film serves as a very good screen debut vehicle for Diana Ross, supported strongly by excellent casting, handsome '30s physical values, and a script which is far better in dialog than structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 18, 1972 |title=Lady Sings The Blues |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, writing that Ross had given "one of the great performances of 1972" and observing that the film "has most of the clichés we expect—but do we really mind clichés in a movie like this? I don't think so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lady-sings-the-blues-1972 |title=Lady Sings The Blues |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=November 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also awarded three out of four stars, writing, "The fact that 'Lady Sings the Blues' is a failure as a biography of legendary jazz singer Billie Holiday doesn't mean it can't be an entertaining movie. And it is just that—entertaining — because of an old fashioned ''grand dame'' performance by Diana Ross, late of the pop-rock scene, in the title role."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (October 27, 1972). "A nice 'Lady,' but she's no Billie". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that Ross gave "one of the truly fine screen performances, full of power and pathos and enormously engaging and sympathetic."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Champlin|Champlin, Charles]] (October 25, 1972). "Two Ladies Who Sing the Blues". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that "when the movie was over I wrote 'I love it' on my pad of paper ... Factually it's a fraud, but emotionally it delivers. It has what makes movies work for a mass audience: easy pleasure, tawdry electricity, personality—great quantities of personality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kael |first=Pauline |authorlink=Pauline Kael |date=November 4, 1972 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Milne]] of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote that Ross did "a remarkable pastiche job on the tone and timbre of Billie Holiday's voice, [but] misses the elegant, almost literary wit of her phrasing," and found the presentation of Holiday's life story "offensively simplistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milne |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Milne |date=May 1973 |title=Lady Sings the Blues |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=40 |issue=472 |page=99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lambert de Hondt the Elder''' or '''Lambert de Hondt (I)''' (c. 1620 - before 10 February 1665) was a Flemish painter and draughtsman mainly known for his equestrian and [[military art|battle]] scenes as well as his [[genre art|genre]] and [[landscape art|landscape]] paintings.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/39415 Lambert de Hondt (I)] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Only a few details about de Hondt’s life have been preserved.  He is recorded as working in [[Mechelen]].  Since his widow remarried on 10 February 1665, we know he died before that date.  He is sometimes confused with another artist who signed his paintings with L. de Hondt.&lt;ref name=wel&gt;[http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=190641 Lambert de Hondt (I) - An Encampment with Soldiers Playing Cards], at vads&lt;/ref&gt;  This other artist who also specialised in battle scenes and made designs for tapestries around 1700 is referred to as [[Lambert de Hondt the Younger]].  It is not known whether the two artists were related.

De Hondt must have enjoyed high-level patronage as one of his paintings (''[[:image:Lambert de Hondt (I) - An Encampment with Soldiers Playing Cards.jpg|An Encampment with Soldiers Playing Cards]]'', now at the Wellington Museum, [[Apsley House]], London) is marked with a white ''fleur-de-lis'', and originally had a coat of arms on the back.  This indicates that the painting was in the collection of [[Elisabeth Farnese]].&lt;ref name=wel/&gt;
==Work==
[[File:Lambert de Hondt (I) - Battle Scene.jpg|thumb|''Battle Scene'']]
He was probably responsible for the compositions depicting military camps, cavalry and military convoys and battles signed L.D. HONDT.  These paintings are reminiscent of the manner of [[David Teniers the Younger]].  In his military scenes he often used a sketchy technique.&lt;ref name=wel/&gt; His paintings often depict horses and cavalry.  He also painted village scenes (such as ''[[:image:Lambert de Hondt (I) - The Vegetable Vendor.jpg|The Vegetable Vendor]]''), hunting scenes (such as ''[[:image:Lambert de Hondt (I) - A Hunting Scene.jpg|A Hunting Scene]]'') and landscapes.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;
 
As was the custom at the time, he regularly collaborated with other painters.  He worked with [[Willem van Herp]] in the production of landscapes (painted by de Hondt) with figures (painted by van Herp) such as ''Noah gathering his Family and the Animals on the Ark'', ''Orpheus charming the animals'', ''St. Francis with the Animals'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proantic.com/display.php?mode=obj&amp;id=84714 Lambert de Hondt l’ancien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030203317/http://www.proantic.com/display.php?mode=obj&amp;id=84714 |date=30 October 2014 }} at pro antic {{link language|fr|French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These paintings are similar in composition and are a variation of the type of the so-called 'paradise landscape'.  Paradise landscapes depict the [[Garden of Eden]] as described in the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'', filled with all the animals, fish and birds that were believed to be God’s creation.  The type was invented and popularized by [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]]. Jan Brueghel was employed at the court of the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]] in [[Brussels]], who maintained an extensive animal menagerie.  He was also a native of [[Antwerp]], a major port city and trading center for exotic goods and animals from Asia and the New World.  Jan Brueghel  was thus in an ideal position to study many domestic and exotic animal species and include them in his compositions.  De Hondt was manifestly inspired by Brueghel’s paradise landscapes such as Brueghel's ''[[:image:Jan Brueghel the Younger Creation of Adam.jpg|The Creation of Adam]]'' and ''[[:image:Jan Breughel de Jonge - De vermelding van de dieren in de ark van Noach.jpg|The Entry of the Animals into Noah's Ark]]''.  He was clearly also familiar with Rubens’ animal scenes as his depiction of the lions in his ‘paradise paintings’ resemble those of Rubens in the painting ''[[:Image:Daniel in the Lion's Den c1615 Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|Daniel in the Lion's Den]]''.

He occasionally painted on copper, a support which offered a perfectly smooth surface allowing the precise detail of the paradise paintings.&lt;ref name=haldane&gt;[http://www.haldanefineart.com/cataloguing/de-hondt-lambert-saint-francis.html Lambert de Hondt the Elder (before 1622-before 1655) and Willem van Herp the Elder (1613/14-1677), ''Saint Francis with the Animals''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102050630/http://www.haldanefineart.com/cataloguing/de-hondt-lambert-saint-francis.html |date=2 November 2014 }} at Haldane Fine Art&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Maria Bamford was born on September 3, 1970 at the Port Hueneme Naval Base in [[Port Hueneme, California]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051469/bio|title=Maria Bamford|website=IMDb|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, her father, Joel Bamford, was serving as a Navy doctor. She grew up in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], where she attended Chester Park Elementary and [[Marshall School|Duluth Marshall School]]. Bamford has stated that when she was younger she was often troubled with her anxiety, depression, and bouts of what she has called "Unwanted Thoughts Syndrome", a subset of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

Upon graduating, she attended [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. In a 2014 interview with ''[[The New York Times]],'' Bamford elaborated on her experience as a college student. She recalled as a sophomore at Bates in 1990 she felt "isolated" and in "a period of despair", when she called the college's [[Crisis hotline|suicide hotline]] after she ate a large amount of food in order to [[Self-harm|self harm]].&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

In 1992, Bamford transferred to the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]] at the start of her junior year. While at the university she became the first female member of the college's improvised comedy group, [[Improverts|The Improverts]]. After a year in Scotland, she transferred back to her home state and enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]], where she earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[creative writing]]. She started doing stand-up in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] at age 19, at Stevie Ray's Comedy Cabaret.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==

=== Early comedy beginnings: 1998–2008 ===
Bamford has been in a number of movies and television shows, including voice appearances in cartoons. She was the voice of Shriek in ''[[CatDog]]'', a huge selection of secondary characters in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Adventure Time]]'', and Mrs. Botsford, Violet, and Leslie on the long running [[PBS]] educational series ''[[WordGirl]]''. She does various impersonations (including her mother and her agent).  Her stand-up comedy often takes the form of [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] rather than the standard setup/punchline format.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051469/|title=Maria Bamford|website=IMDb|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamford was featured in the documentary series ''[[The Comedians of Comedy]]'' on [[Comedy Central]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], and appears in short skits titled ''The Maria Bamford Show'', broadcast on the website [[Super Deluxe]].  She appears on the comedy compilation CD ''[[Comedy Death-Ray (album)|Comedy Death-Ray]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Her album ''Unwanted Thoughts Syndrome'', produced by [[Comedy Central Records]], was released in April 2009 and includes a DVD containing ''The Maria Bamford Show'' episodes. During the Christmas 2009-2010 shopping seasons, Bamford was featured in a series of [[Target Corporation|Target]] commercials, portraying an overachieving shopper determined to be first in line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joel|last=Keller|url= http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/11/24/maria-bamford-plays-a-demented-shopper-in-new-target-ads/|title= Maria Bamford plays a demented shopper in new Target ads|work= TVSquad |publisher= AOL Television|date= November 24, 2009|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Christmas 2009, she released a free stand-up special online as a gift to her fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{vimeo|id=7944778|title=Maria Bamford's One-Hour Homemade Christmas Special!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working in voice-over shows and advertisements in [[Los Angeles]], she was hospitalized three times over the course of 18 months for nervous breakdowns. She commented on the hospital visits by saying "it was the responsible thing to do" after she felt "suicidal" and "dispirited". At the time she was seeing a therapist weekly and a psychiatrist every three months.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

In 2012 she released ''The Special Special Special'' for download through Chill.com. The special was recorded at her own home in Los Angeles with only Bamford's parents present as the audience and is now available on [[Netflix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chill.com/MariaBamfoo/the-special-special-special |title=Maria Bamford: the special special special! |publisher=Chill |date=November 29, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119075646/http://chill.com/MariaBamfoo/the-special-special-special |archivedate=January 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

}}Bamford's unique [[Comedic genres|comedic style]] has drawn praise and criticism. She is best known for her portrayal of her [[dysfunctional family]] and [[self-deprecating]] comedy involving jokes about [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]]. Her comedy style is [[surreal humour|surreal]] and incorporates [[Impressionist (entertainment)|voice impressions]] of various character types. Zach Freeman of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' has noted her content and comedic style as "comically erratic" with "seemingly unrelated tangents and constantly varying vocal inflections".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Zach|last=Freeeman|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-maria-bamford-review-athenaeum-theatre-story.html|title=Maria Bamford on edge and on point at the Athenaeum Theatre|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=August 20, 2016|access-date=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Sims of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' noted her roles and voice work as having themes of "serial passivity" stemming from her "polite upbringing and own internal anxieties".&lt;ref name="Sims"&gt;{{Cite web|first=David|last=Sims|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/maria-bamford-lady-dynamite-netflix-review/483689/|title=Maria Bamford's 'Lady Dynamite' Is a Weird, Sweet Comedy|language=en-US|date=May 20, 2016|access-date=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film producer [[Judd Apatow]] has described her comedic style as "complex" and "bizarre", later calling her "the funniest woman in the world".&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Libby|last=Hill|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-st-maria-bamford-and-friends-announce-premiere-date-netflix-20160224-story.html|title='Who is Maria Bamford?'

A 2014 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' profile of Bamford noted her comedic style by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;Much of Bamford’s work examines the relationship between “people” — generally well-intentioned friends and family — and those who grapple with depression or anxiety or any other challenge to the [[Psychology|psyche]]. Her act is a series of monologues and mini-skits performed rapid fire and often without regard for transition. Deploying a range of [[deadpan]] voices, she mimics the faux-enlightened who hover around the afflicted, offering toothless platitudes, bootstrapping pep talks or concern warped by self-interest. The humor of any given moment relies not so much on punch lines as it does on the impeccably timed swerves of her tone, the interplay between Bamford’s persona and those of all the people who don’t get her.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
Bamford stated in an interview with ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' that she has been diagnosed with [[bipolar II disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Burger|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment/52050618-81/maria-utah-bamford-comic.html.csp|title=Comic Maria Bamford will cross personal boundaries at Utah show|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|publisher=Huntsman Family Investments, LLC|location=Salt Laker City, Utah|date=June 22, 2011|quote=I was re-diagnosed (after a three-day stay at the hospital) as Bipolar II}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD)&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt; - "the new gladiator sandal", as she puts it in her comic performances.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

On December 11, 2014, during her show at the Neptune Theater in [[Seattle]], Bamford announced that she was engaged to artist Scott Marvel Cassidy.&lt;ref name=TucsonStar&gt;{{cite news|first1=Cathalena|last1=Burch|title=Comic takes on politics, understanding conservatives and suicide|url=http://tucson.com/entertainment/blogs/caliente-tuned-in/comic-takes-on-politics-understanding-conservatives-and-suicide/article_f86f01ad-033e-55ec-9827-87e4519a9357.html|work=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|location=Tucson, Arizona|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married at a private ceremony in 2015.

[[File:Spiro Wulfing and Etowah repousse plates HRoe 2012.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Plates from [[Wulfing cache|Malden]], [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] and [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]]]]

'''Mississippian copper plates''', or plaques, are plain and [[Repoussé and chasing|repousséd]] plates of beaten [[copper]] crafted by peoples of the various regional expressions of the [[Mississippian culture]] between 800 and 1600 CE.  They have been found as [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in [[archaeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast. The plates, found as far afield as Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept known as the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]]. Some of the more notable examples are representations of [[Bird of prey|raptorial birds]] and avian-themed dancing warriors.

==Copper in the Eastern Woodlands==
[[File:Anishanabe1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Diorama of [[Anishinaabe]] people mining copper near [[Lake Superior]]]]
Copper trade routes throughout the [[Eastern Woodlands]] were established during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] (3000 - 1000 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 28-9&lt;/ref&gt; and continued into historic times.&lt;ref name="Broseet"&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 149&lt;/ref&gt; Copper was usually imported from the [[Great Lakes]] region; however other sources of copper have been found elsewhere including in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the Etowah Site in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 184&lt;/ref&gt;

For generations the [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Indigenous peoples of North America]] pursued copper sources and transmitted the skill of copper’s manipulation and preparation as a special material for use in elite goods on to their descendants. Elites at major political and religious centers during the Mississippian period used copper ornamentation as a sign of their status by crafting the sacred material into representations connected with the Chiefly Warrior cult of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. These elites used a trade network that spanned most of North America to acquire exotic trade items from far away, trading their own locally manufactured elite goods and materials.&lt;ref name=ROBB&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu/files/spotlightMar10_2.pdf|title=Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum-Spotlight Series March 2010|first=Matthew H.|last=Robb|publisher=[[Saint Louis Art Museum]]|accessdate=April 19, 2012|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the Mississippian way of life in the 1500s with the advent of European colonization, copper still retained a place in Native American religious life as a special material. Copper was traditionally regarded as sacred by many historic period Eastern tribes. Copper nuggets are included in [[medicine bundle]]s among Great Lakes tribes. Among 19th century [[Muscogee Creek people|Muscogee (Creek)]], a group of copper plates carried along the [[Trail of Tears]] are regarded as some of the tribe's most sacred items.&lt;ref name="Broseet" /&gt;

==Methods of manufacture==
[[File:NatCopper.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Unworked copper nugget]]
The [[native copper]], as well as the [[Work hardening|knowledge to work it]], is believed to have come from the Great Lakes area, hundreds of miles to the north of the Cahokia polity and most other Mississippian culture sites, although the copper workshops discovered near [[Mound 34]] at Cahokia are so far the only copper workshops found at a Mississippian culture [[archaeological site]].&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK/&gt; Researchers at [[Northwestern University|Northwestern’s]] [[Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]] used an electron microscope to analyze pieces of the flat copper sheets found during excavations at the Mound 34 site at Cahokia. The researchers found that the metal had been repeatedly heated and cooled and while it was softened by the heat, had been hammered, a process known as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], similar to how blacksmiths work iron. They were also able to determine that the Cahokian coppersmiths had heated the copper in a wood fire to produce sufficient heat for this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311000793|title=Metallurgical analysis of copper artifacts from Cahokia|author1= Chastaina, Matthew L.|author2= Deymier-Black, Alix C.|author3=Kelly, John E.|author4=Brown, James A.|author5= Dunand,David C.|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume =38|date=July 2011|pages=1727–1736|issue=7|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHITE2011/&gt; This process of heating and hammering was repeated over and over until a sheet of the desired thickness was obtained and was sufficient a method to allow the craftsman to work the copper into very thin sheets.&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK/&gt; Researchers have also tried different techniques to duplicate how larger pieces were manufactured. They determined that the larger pieces had not been [[laminate]]d together but had most likely been [[rivet]]ed together with small copper knobs. Researchers were also able to determine that the artisans cut the copper into the desired shapes by bending the sheet metal back and forth until it broke in the desired location.&lt;ref name=WHITE2011&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=USNews|url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2011/06/15/science-explains-ancient-copper-artifacts|title=Researchers Explain Ancient Copper Artifacts|author= White, Erin|date=June 15, 2011|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report LP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mississippian culture repoussé plate making HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Working the prepared copper plate]]
After the flat sheets of copper were produced, designs were then embossed into the surfaces probably with stone, bone or wooden tools. [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]], an anthropologist working in the early 20th century, worked out a method for flattening and embossing the plates. He hammered raw nuggets of copper smooth and removed imperfections by scouring the surface with a piece of sandstone. He was then able to duplicate the avian designs by resting the sheet of copper on a rawhide pad and pressing into the surface using a piece of pointed deer antler and pressing with his chest. This produced a sharp thin line that when the plate was reversed resembled the embossed lines of the aboriginal artifacts. This process is considered to be roughly similar to how Mississippian coppersmiths probably worked.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wulfing Plates : Products of Prehistoric Americans|author=Watkins, Virginia D.|year=2010|origyear=1950|publisher=Gustavs Library|asin=B004618COA}}&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Mississippian avian themed copper plates HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Distribution of avian themed copper plates]]
==Iconography==
===Avian themed plates===
Avian themed plates are thought to depict aspects of the ''[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|Birdman]]'', a major figure in Mississippian iconography closely associated with warfare, ritual dancing, and the game of [[chunkey]].&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; Numerous examples of similar avian themed plates have been found in locations across the Midwest and Southeast, from the large cache found in [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] near the  bootheel region in [[Dunklin County, Missouri]] to others from [[Mangum Mound Site|Mangum]] in Mississippi,&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Mangum Plate|journal=[[American Antiquity]]|volume=18|date=July 1952|page=65|jstor=276247|issue=1|doi=10.2307/276247}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] in Oklahoma, [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] in Georgia, [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Mounds]] in Florida and other sites in Missouri, Illinois, and Alabama.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

====Cahokia and the Birdman====
[[File:Bird Man Cahokia USA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Birdman burial from Cahokia]]
Years of study by archaeologists, ethnologists and historians of artifacts of different materials found at many sites throughout the midwestern and southeastern United States has led many of these researchers to conclude that the cosmology associated with the avian imagery of this artwork originated at [[Cahokia]] (the largest Mississippian culture site, in western Illinois near St Louis, Missouri) between 1100 - 1300 CE. This cosmology was expressed as the "[[Braden style]]", a label applied to [[Mississippian culture pottery|ceramics]], [[Mississippian shell artwork|shell pieces]], [[Mississippian stone statuary|stone statuary]] and copper artifacts all bearing the hallmarks and elements of the same sophisticated style. These pieces were exported to other centers where they were emulated by regional craftsman and became the basis of local styles, such as the "Craig style" of Spiro Mounds, the "Hightower style" of Etowah Mounds and the "[[Hemphill style]]" of Moundville.&lt;ref name=2BROWN2004&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, James|chapter=Sequencing the Braden style within Mississippian Period Art and Iconography|editor-first=F.

Avian imagery occupied a central place in Cahokian iconography, with examples including an incised sandstone tablet with a birdman excavated from [[Monks Mound]] and an elaborate elite personage burial in [[Mound 72#Birdman burial|Mound 72]] with thousands of shell beads arranged in the shape of a bird.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

Although no copper plates other than some small fragments have ever been found at Cahokia, it is the only Mississippian culture site to date where a copper workshop has been located by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK&gt;{{ cite news|newspaper=SOTT.net|publisher=Signs of the Times|last=Pawlaczyk|first= George|authorlink=George Pawlaczyk|url=http://www.sott.net/articles/show/203233-Copper-men-Archaeologists-uncover-%0AStone-Age-copper-workshop-near-Monk-s-Mound-in-Illinois|title=Copper men: Archaeologists uncover Stone Age copper workshop near Monk's Mound|date=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations of the copper workshops at [[Mound 34]], (a small mound located on the Ramey Plaza east of [[Monks Mound]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/34/|title=Cahokia Mounds - Mound 34|publisher=Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233858/http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/34|archivedate=April 25, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) indicate copper was worked there. The area contains the remains of three tree stumps thought to have been used to hold anvil stones used for beating out the flattened sheets of copper.&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK/&gt; However, despite the lack of copper plates, one copper artifact has been found at the site. A copper-covered wooden [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] {{convert|6.3|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|2.5|cm|in|sp=us}} thought to have been part of a headdress was found during surface collections at Cahokia.

===Other themes===
[[File:Etowah copper pieces HRoe 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Bi-lobed arrow plates from Etowah]]
Many of the hundreds of plates found have not been specifically avian themed and come in a variety of other shapes. These include embossed geometric designs, weeping eye motifs, bi-lobed arrow motif headdresses, head shapes with headresses, and plain sheets.&lt;ref name=FUND107-108/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.spiromound.com/|title=The Spiro Mound: A Photo Essay|author1=Merriam, Larry|author2= Merriam Christopher|publisher= SpiroMound.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique "Upper Bluff Lake Dancing Birdmen" plate was found in the same burial in Union County, Illinois as a Malden style avian plate.&lt;ref name="Broseet_a"&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 160-1, 213&lt;/ref&gt; Several related examples of bi-lobed arrow headdresses have been found at the Etowah Site and the Moundville Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Visualizing the Sacred: Cosmic Visions, Regionalism, and the Art of the Mississippian World|url=http://rla.unc.edu/personal/vps/articles/SECCv2.Hemphill.pdf| page=227|editor1-last=Lankford|editor1-first=George E.|editor2-last= Reilly|editor2-first=F.

==Known locations==

===Arkansas plates===
[[File:Toul Creek plate HRoe 2012.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|Toul Creek plate from northern Arkansas]]
A number of plates have been found in various sites in eastern [[Arkansas]]. At least three of the Arkansas examples (Rose Mound, Scott Place, and Clay Hill) and two others (a {{convert|32.6 |cm|in|sp=us}} found in a [[Dallas Phase]] burial at the [[Henry Farm Site]] (40 LO 53) in [[Loudon County, Tennessee]] in 1975 and a specimen unexamined by archaeologists thought to come either from the [[Neeley’s Ferry Site|Neeley’s Ferry]] (3 CS 24) or Rose Mound sites in Cross County) have stylistic similarities that indicate they may have all been made by the same artist. Four of the five were found in the [[St. Francis River]] Valley area of Arkansas. Researchers think the five plates may represent a composite creature that is part snake and part hawk as the shape of the tail feathers resemble a rattlesnakes' rattle or that the design may represent a hawk in the act of swallowing a snake.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008&gt;{{cite conference|conference=Southeastern Archaeological Conference|location=Charlotte, North Carolina|date=November 13, 2008|title=Mississippian copper artifacts from Arkansas|author=Mitchem, Jeffrey M.|url=https://uark.academia.edu/JeffreyMMitchem/Papers/1288775/Mississippian_Copper_Artifacts_from_Arkansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copper plate found at the [[Clay Hill Site]] (3 LE 11) in [[Lee County, Arkansas]] has the same chest region design and long narrow shape and distinctive tail feathers as the Scott Site and Rose Mound examples. Although fragmented it is approximately {{convert|14|in|cm}} in length. It was recorded to be in a private collection in 1978 but has not been seen since. The plate was found in an [[Armorel Phase]] burial that also contained a [[Clarksdale bell]], an item of European manufacture that is a hallmark of the 1541 [[Hernando de Soto]] excursion through the southeast. This does not date the era for the production of the plate though as such items were often kept as heirlooms for long periods, even many generations, before they ended up becoming [[grave goods]].&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

In 1910 [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] found a stylized hawk or eagle plate while excavating graves at the [[Rose Mound Site]] (3 CS 27) in [[Cross County, Arkansas]]. The plate was {{convert|16.25|in|cm}} and remarkably well preserved, missing only the tip of one wing. The plate is not embossed but merely a shape cut from a flat copper sheet.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

In the 1970s a copper bird {{convert|28|cm|in|sp=us}} in length was found by looters at the [[Scott Site]] (3 MS 24), also known as Big Lake Bridge, in [[Mississippi County, Arkansas]]. The specimen was located at the back of the head of an extended adult burial, and may have been bent over the top of the head. Eight plain pottery vessels grave good vessels were found with it.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

A possible partial avian style plate was found at the [[Magness Site]] (3 IN 8) in [[Independence County, Arkansas]] along with several [[Mississippian culture shell objects#Shell Cups|engraved shell cups]]. The plate is a typical head portion with the forked eye, earspool, and elaborate headdress and hairdo known from other examples. As the lower portion of the plate is missing it is impossible to tell if the figure is a dancer or a human headed bird like the Wulfing A plate.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;
 
A {{convert|8|in|cm}} avian themed plate very similar to the Wulfing Plates copper plate was discovered at the [[Toul Creek Site]] in [[Baxter County, Arkansas]] by several local farmers. The plate was located in the chest area of an extended adult who was also wearing the two limestone ear spools. Other grave goods found in the burial included a marine shell dipper and a {{convert|6|in|cm}} chert knife. Its whereabouts are currently unknown.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

===Etowah and the Rogan plates===
[[File:Rogan plate 1 birdman HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Rogan plate, A91117]]
{{main|Etowah plates}} 
The Rogan plates were discovered in a [[stone box grave]] within Mound C at the [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Site]] by [[John P. Rogan]] in the 1880s. Several are very similar to plates later found at Lake Jackson Mounds, and it is believed that the Lake Jackson plates came from Etowah. The designs of the plates are in the Classic Braden style from the Cahokian area, and it is generally thought that some of the plates were manufactured at Cahokia before ending up at sites in the Southeast.&lt;ref name=BOLFING2010/&gt; The two Rogan plates were interred as a pair and are very similar to one another. The first is approximately {{convert|20|in|cm}} and the second {{convert|16|in|cm}}. Holes in the plates suggest they were once hung as a decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Art of the Southeastern Indians : Feathered Serpents &amp; Winged Beings|first=Susan C.|last=Power|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JcEp9_6TPtMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=rogan+plates#v=onepage&amp;q=rogan%20plates&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0820325019|date=May 24, 2004|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plates were found by [[Warren K. Moorehead]] at the Etowah site in excavations during the mid-1920s. The other plates are in a slightly different style and indicate that local artisans had begun production of their own copper plates in emulation of the Braden style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1100&amp;context=honorprog|page=39|last=LeDoux|first=Spencer Curtis|title=Embodying the Sacred : Temporal Changes in the Cosmological Function of Art and Symbolism in the Mississippian Period, AD 1250-1400|year=2009|publisher=Texas State University-San Marcos, University College, University Honors Program|accessdate=October 25, 2010|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

These plates, along with artifacts from Spiro and [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept of the S.E.C.C.

===Florida plates===
[[File:Lake Jackson Braden Style Birdman Plate HRoe 2016.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Copper Solar Ogee Deity plate found at Lake Jackson Mounds, Florida]]
Although at the periphery of the Mississippian world, Florida has been the site of the discovery many S.E.C.C. associated copper artworks. Archaeologists believe that this is because of the [[busycon]] shell trade, the shells being a valuable ritual and high status trade good to Mississippian elites. It has even been proposed that the [[Fort Walton culture]] founders of the [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Mounds Site]] moved east and founded the settlement in approximately 1100 CE to strategically position themselves in this trade network. Lake Jackson trade for copper pieces seems to have taken place almost exclusively with the Etowah polity of north central Georgia. When Mound 3 at the site was excavated it yielded fourteen copper plates, deposited in the burial mound sometime between 1300—1500 CE.&lt;ref name=LEDOUX2009&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Embodying the Sacred : Temporal Changes in the Cosmological Function of Art and Symbolism in the Mississippian Period, AD 1250-1400|author= LeDoux, Spencer C.|degree=Honors|year=2009|publisher=Texas State University-San Marcos |chapter=Chapter 4 : The Lake Jackson Site|url= https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/3248/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called "Copper Solar Ogee Deity," a {{convert|21|in|cm}} high repoussé copper plate, depicts the profile of a dancing winged figure, wielding a ceremonial mace in its right hand and a severed head in the left. The extended, curling nose resembles a [[proboscis]] and resembles another S.E.C.C. motif, the long-nosed god maskette. The figures elaborate headdress includes a bi-lobed arrow motif and, at the top of the plate, an ogee motif surrounded by a chambered circle. Some art historians have argued that this plate and one of the Rogan plates may represent a female or "Birdwoman" because the breast on the figure protrudes slightly more than it does on other examples, while others have argued that the plate may represent a third gender or "[[two-spirit]]" tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Power (2004), Early Art of the Southeastern Indians : 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Birdman, Birdwoman : Queering archeology at Lake Jackson|author=Bloch, Lee|url= http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00209/47j|volume=62|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=June 2010|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of the Etowah polity in approximately 1375 trade continued for the Lake Jackson peoples, albeit now with peoples located in the northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee area. No longer able to get the elaborate copper plates from Etowah, a local style developed, producing a new style of such as that depicted on the "Elder Birdman" plate, thought to represent the merger of the Birdman corpus with a local solar deity.&lt;ref name=LEDOUX2009/&gt;

Further east and south into Florida were non-Mississippian culture peoples who were involved in long distance trade of local high status items such as busycon shells for gorgets and [[yaupon]] holly for the [[black drink]]. The [[Mill Cove Complex]] is a [[St. Johns culture]] site in [[Duval County, Florida]] with two sand burial mounds, one [[platform mound]] shaped and associated village habitation areas. [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] excavated the mounds in 1894 and found numerous copper grave goods, including two copper [[long-nosed god maskette]]s and 11 copper plates. The one plate found in the Shields Mound was plain, but several of the other 10 found in the Grant Mound were decorated with an oval central boss and ringed with an oval embossed or beaded line. They measured {{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us}}-{{convert|15|cm|in|sp=us}} to {{convert|5|cm|in|sp=us}}-{{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us}}. They had perforated holes for hanging. Archaeologists speculate they were used either for gorgets or headdress ornaments. Analysis of the metal in the plaques has connected them to locations in the Great Lakes region, Wisconsin and the Appalachian Mountains.&lt;ref name=ASHLEY2002&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the periphery of the Early Mississippian world : Looking within and beyond Northeastern Florida|author=Ashley, Keith H.|journal=Southeastern Archaeology| url=http://www.unf.edu/~kashley/Other%20Files/2002-periphery.pdf|volume=2|year=2002|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in central Florida, the [[Old Okahumpka Site]] (8 LA 57) is a now destroyed burial mound in [[Lake County, Florida]] near the modern town of [[Okahumpka, Florida|Okahumpka]]. The site was excavated by Clarence B. Moore in the 1890s. During his excavation he found a burial associated plate measuring {{convert|7.1|cm|in|sp=us}} wide by {{convert|15.2|cm|in|sp=us}} in length and depicting the lower portion of a dancing figure wearing a sash, kilt, cuffed [[moccasin]]s, and holding a knife. The design is almost identical to two examples known from Spiro and a site in [[Jackson County, Alabama]], although of the three it is the only one to show a figure wielding a knife. Archaeologists estimate the plate was deposited in the mound sometime between 1100 and 1300 CE. The plate is now part of the collection of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].&lt;ref name=MITCHEM1996&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|title=The Old Okahumpka Site (8LA57): Late Prehistoric Iconography and Mississippian Influence in Peninsular Florida |url=https://www.academia.edu/1101995/The_Old_Okahumpka_Site_8LA57_Late_Prehistoric_Iconography_and_Mississippian_Influence_in_Peninsular_Florida|author=Jeffrey M.

From an unknown location on the west coast of central Florida comes the Wilcox plate, a partial avian themed copper plate showing the middle section details of scalloped wings, tail feathers and a raptors leg and claw in the Malden style very similar to the Wulfing plates. It was discovered somewhere near [[Waldo, Florida]] in [[Levy County, Florida|Levy County]] in the 1880s, where it was purchased from a local doctor by [[Joseph Wilcox]] for the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]]. It has been part of the collection of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] since the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Expedition Magazine|url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/43-2/Research%20Notes.pdf|title=The Wilcox copper plate from Florida|author=Mitchem, Jeffrey M.|date=|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illinois plates===
[[File:Upper Bluff Lake Dancing Figures plate HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Upper Bluff Lake Dancing Birdmen plate]]
Outside of Cahokia, Illinois has seen the discovery of many Mississippian culture copper items including copper maces, ear spools, several avian plates, a wooden copper covered mask (known as the [[Emmons mask]]), and headdress pieces. Three copper plates have been found, one of them been identified as being from the same workshop as the Wulfing plates and others as having stylistic similarities with the Wulfing, Spiro and Etowah plates.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt;

The Edwards falcon plate is a {{convert|37.8|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|11.3|cm|in|sp=us}} copper avian plate found at the [[Material Service Quarry Site]] in [[La Salle County, Illinois]]. Before it was deposited as a grave good it had its head riveted on in the reverse position. It is one of several plates found in Illinois believed to have been made by the same workshop as the Malden plates.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt;

The ''Peoria Falcon'' is a unique avian plate found in 1856&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Peoria Magazines|url=http://www.peoriamagazines.com/as/2009/mar-apr/falcon-soars-peoria-reads|title=Falcon Soars, Peoria Reads|author= Noack, Trisha}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the shore of [[Peoria Lake]]. It is a {{convert|7|in|cm}} by {{convert|9|in|cm}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoriariverfrontmuseum.org/international_gallery.html|title=INTERNATIONAL FEATURES GALLERY|publisher=Peoria Riverftont Museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801154941/http://www.peoriariverfrontmuseum.org/international_gallery.html|archivedate=August 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; copper plate depicting a naturalistic [[peregrine falcon]]. It is part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Natural History]], but it is on long term loan to the [[Lakeview Museum of Arts and Sciences]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]] where it is on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/multimedia/photos/103551754.html?c=y&amp;page=11|journal=Smithsonian Magazine|title=The Peoria Falcon|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Upper Bluff Lake plates are two plates found at the [[Saddle Site]] (11U284) in [[Union County, Illinois]] in the 1880s, in the same stone box grave. One of the plates is avian themed and the other a unique double birdman design, but still within the corpus of the S.E.C.C. The Upper Bluff Lake falcon plate is a {{convert|25.7|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|8.25|cm|in|sp=us}} avian themed Wulfing style plate. It has a mostly intact tail, which the Malden plates do not, and has helped archaeologists understand what the tails of the other pieces would have looked like.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; The Dancing Figures plate is a rectangular {{convert|15.5|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|16.5|cm|in|sp=us}} plate depicting two Birdman figures holding ceremonial chipped flint maces, possibly dancing, and shielding themselves from a possible liquid or ropelike motif falling from the top center of the plate. Stylistically the Dancers plate has been linked to the Classic Braden style associated with Cahokia and it bears stylistic similarities  to Craig A style shell objects found at the Spiro site.&lt;ref name="Broseet_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name=HEROHAWK&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand: American Indian Art of the Ancient Midwest and South|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|editor-last =Townsend|editor-first=Richard F.|editor2-last =Sharp|editor2-first=Richard V.|date=October 11, 2004|isbn=978-0300106015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the plates date from 1100 to 1300 CE.&lt;ref name="Broseet_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dickson Mounds Acquires Important Artifact|url=http://museum.state.il.us/ismsites/dickson/mace.htm|publisher=Dickson Mounds Museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220190510/http://museum.state.il.us/ismsites/dickson/mace.htm|archivedate=February 20, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Upper Bluff Lake plates are now in the collection of the National Museum of Natural History.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt;

===Malden plates or the Wulfing cache===
[[File:Wulfing plate A human headed avian HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|upright=0.75|Human headed avian Malden Plate A]]
{{main|Wulfing cache}}
The plates of the ''Wulfing cache'', named after an early owner, were discovered by a farmer named Ray Groomes while plowing a field south of [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] in [[Dunklin County, Missouri]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 213&lt;/ref&gt; The eight plates, made in the Late Braden style associated with Cahokia, are thought to date to the late 13th or early 14th century.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; The Wulfing plates depict raptors and one bird-human hybrids, ranging human heads to raptor's heads to double-headed raptors on stylized bird's bodies, with naturalistic bird's claws.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 164-6&lt;/ref&gt; The plates were found buried in a field with no known local mounds or village sites. They had been considerably used prior to their burial, as each plates shows multiple episodes of aboriginal repair work including patch repairs and riveted cracks.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950/&gt;

The eight plates are designated Plates A-H. Plate A, the only anthropomorphic human headed avian in the Wulfing cache, measures {{convert|30|cm|in|sp=us}} in length by {{convert|13.5|cm|in|sp=us}} in width and weighs {{convert|84|g|oz}}.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950/&gt;

Many similar plates found in other states are now believed to have come from the same workshop, if not the same artist, as the Wulfing cache. The sites of the discovery of these other plates span the United States from central Florida to northern Illinois to Oklahoma, and include the Upper Bluff Lake falcon plate, the Toul Creek plate, the Reed Mound plate, the Edwards plate,&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; and the Wilcox plate,&lt;ref name="MITCHEM" /&gt; as well as showing stylistic links to plates found in burials at Etowah and Spiro.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

===Spiro plates===
[[File:Spiro human headed avian plate HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Anthropomorphic human headed avian plate from Spiro]]
[[Spiro Mounds]] is a [[Caddoan Mississippian culture]] archaeological site located in present-day [[LeFlore County, Oklahoma]]. In the 1930s the only burial mound at the site, the Craig Mound, was looted by locals who used [[dynamite]] on the mound to gain access to its interior. Once inside the {{convert|10|ft|m}} high and {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide cavity the looters discovered almost perfectly preserved fragile artifacts made of wood, [[Lightning whelk|conch shell]], fabric of vegetal and animal fibers, lace, fur, feathers and copper. The Great Mortuary, as the hollow interior has since became known to archaeologists, was a burial structure for Spiro's rulers. It was created as a circle of sacred [[Ulmus crassifolia|cedar posts]] sunk in the ground and angled together at the top like a ''[[tipi]]''. The cone-shaped chamber was covered with layers of earth to create the mound, and it never collapsed. Minerals percolating through the mound hardened the chamber's log walls, making them resistant to decay and shielding the perishable artifacts inside from direct contact with the earth. No other Mississippian mound has been found with such a hollow space inside it or with such large and distinctive collection of preserved artifacts. Among the grave goods were numerous copper pieces, including [[ear-spool]]s, [[Celt (tool)|{{not a typo|celts}}]], copper sheathed wooden knives&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY/&gt; and 265  repoussé plates.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; One of the more famous of these copper plates depicts a man's head, possibly severed, in profile, with a Forked Eye motif, an ear-spool, and hair styled into an occipital hair knot from which a single feather projects.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 142-3&lt;/ref&gt; The plate measures {{convert|24|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|17.4|cm|in|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 211&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the plates is the avian themed "naturalistic hawk cutout", which measures {{convert|11.5|in|cm}} in width.&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiro Mound:A photo essay|author1=Larry G. Merriam|author2=Christopher J.

Some of the other repoussé copper pieces found include eight examples of copper "feathers" that were worn as hair ornaments.&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY/&gt;
Many of the  plates found at Spiro are in the "Braden Style" and are thought by archaeologists to have been imported from Cahokia.&lt;ref name=LAVERE&gt;{{cite book | title= Looting Spiro Mounds: An American King Tut's Tomb | author= La Vere, David | publisher= University of Oklahoma Press | date = April 1, 2007 |isbn=  978-0806138138 |pages= 80–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other locations===
[[File:Mangum plate HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Reconstruction of the plate found at Mangum]]
Besides the Spiro site, four other plates have been found during excavations at Caddoan Mississippian sites. The [[Reed Mound]] in Oklahoma produced a fragmentary Malden style plate thought to be from the same workshop as the Wulfing set.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; Three other plates were found at the [[Gahagan Mounds Site]] in [[Red River Parish, Louisiana]] in the early 20th century, along with numerous other copper objects including copper covered ear spools and a matched set of large copper long-nosed god maskettes. The plates were large rectangular plaques embossed with concentric circles or squares&lt;ref name=FUND107-108&gt;Fundaburk, ''Sun Circles and Human Hands'' : 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; and are similar to the Mount Royal plates from Florida. A matching pair of large thin sheet copper cutout human hands were also found at Gahagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caddo Ancestors : Early Caddo, A.D. 800-1200|url=http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/ancestors/early.html|publisher=University of Texas at Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two plates were found in a [[Plaquemine culture]] site in Mississippi. Three fragments of a repoussé plate with an avian design were found in a burial in the [[Mangum Mound Site]] in [[Claiborne County, Mississippi]] in 1936 by a farmer who owned the site. When pieced together the plate was about {{convert|12|in|cm}} in width and weighed a total of {{convert|53|g|oz}}. The plate had been reinforced and riveted in several places to protect weak spots in the metal.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt; A second plate was found during archaeological excavations at the site in 1963.&lt;ref name=GALLOWAY&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Patricia Galloway|last=Galloway|first=Patricia|title= Choctaw Genesis, 1500-1700 (Indians of the Southeast)|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2HVOImebydMC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=Mangum+copper+plate#v=onepage&amp;q=Mangum%20copper%20plate&amp;f=false|isbn=0-8032-7070-4|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mangum plates stylistically resemble the Rogan plates from Etowah.&lt;ref name=BROWN2004&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, James|chapter=On the identity of the Birdman within Mississippian Period Art and Iconography|pages=56–106|editor-first=F.

==Other copper items==
[[File:Spiro copper ear spools HRoe 2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Copper earspools from Spiro]]
Besides the repoussé copper plates, Mississippian people also created copper axes, knives, gorgets, beads, and fishhooks, as well as wooden beads and [[ear spool]]s covered in copper.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 69, 168&lt;/ref&gt; [[Long-nosed god maskette]]s, a special kind of ear ornamentation, are sometimes found made of copper. Copper examples have been found at the Gahagan Mounds Site in Louisiana and at the Grant Mound in Florida, each of which produced two of the earpieces.&lt;ref name=ASHLEY2002/&gt; Several copper covered cedar knives were found in the Great Mortuary mound at Spiro. Several matching pairs were found, although of slightly differing lengths, ranging up to {{convert|17|in|cm}} long. One set had Weeping eye motifs repousséd into the copper sheathing.&lt;ref name=MERRIAM2004-a&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiro Mound :A photo essay|author1= Merriam, Larry|author2=Merriam, Christopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lX5sAAAAMAAJ|asin=B000V6S52S|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of copper and copper covered items have been found at the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in Alabama, although no copper plates have been found there. Moundville copper artifacts generally consist of copper covered ear spools and tear drop shaped pendants thought to represent trophy scalps. A unique copper piece was discovered at the [[Emmons Cemetery Site]] in [[Fulton County, Illinois]]. It is a wooden {{convert|11.9|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|9.9|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|5.5|cm|in|sp=us}} copper covered object shaped like a human face with a crenelated crown-like decoration on its forehead. It resembles the small human face that makes up part of the headdress of Malden plate A (including the distinctive crenelated crown-like structure) and archaeologists believe it was in fact part of a real headdress.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5109">The '''Moscow State Jewish Theater'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moscovery.com/shalom-moscow-jewish-theatre/|title=History of the Jewish Theatre in Moscow (in English)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Московский '''Гос'''ударственный '''Е'''врейский '''Т'''еатр}}), also known by its [[acronym]] '''GOSET''' (ГОСЕТ), was a [[Yiddish theater]] company established in 1919 and shut down in 1948 by the [[USSR|Soviet]] authorities.

It was founded by [[Alexis Granowsky|Alexander Granowsky]] as the Jewish Theater Workshop, in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Riss, Heidelore (2000). ''Ansätze zu einer Geschichte des jüdischen Theaters in Berlin 1889-1936''. Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang. p.&amp;nbsp;154.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, when Granowsky's theater was taken over by the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment, it relocated to Moscow, and became the Moscow State Jewish Theater.&lt;ref name="Veidlinger-YIVO"&gt;Veidlinger, Jeffrey (September&amp;nbsp;3, 2010). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Moscow_State_Yiddish_Theater Moscow State Yiddish Theater]." ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 2017-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; It early on attracted [[Solomon Mikhoels]], who eventually became the leading actor and, in 1928, its director. The design of GOSET's foyer, as well as decorations sets and costumes for its first production, were done by [[Marc Chagall]].

The theater's repertoire included adaptations of [[Sholom Aleichem]], such as ''[[Tevye|Tevye the Milkman]]'' (also adopted in the West as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''), and of [[Avrom Goldfaden]], such as ''Bar Kokhba'', as well as works by contemporary Soviet Yiddish writers, such as [[Perets Markish]] and [[Dovid Bergelson]].  The theater also performed [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' to great acclaim. Many of the theater's plays were ostensibly supportive of the Soviet state, but closer readings suggest that they actually contained veiled critiques of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s regime.

In January 1948, Mikhoels was murdered by the [[MVD]], and his death was made to look like a car accident. Months later the theater was shut down, and the members of the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] (also headed by Mikhoels) were arrested. At least thirteen prominent Soviet Yiddish writers were executed on August 12, 1952 in the event known as "The [[Night of the Murdered Poets]]" ("Ночь казненных поэтов").

'''''Neptune and Triton''''' is an early sculpture by the Italian artist [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. It is housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] of London and was executed c. 1622–1623. Carved from [[marble]], it stands 182.2&amp;nbsp;cm (71.7&amp;nbsp;in) in height.&lt;ref name="williamson"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Paul Williamson |title=European Sculpture at the Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |location=London |year=1996 |page=132 |isbn=978-1851771738}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="v&amp;a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neptune and Triton by Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1620–2 |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/n/berninis-neptune-and-triton/ |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture was originally commissioned by Cardinal Peretti Montalto, serving as a fountain to decorate the pond in the garden of his Villa Peretti Montalto on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in Rome. It was purchased by the Englishman Thomas Jenkins in 1786, from whom it was purchased later that year by the painter [[Joshua Reynolds]]. After Reynolds's death in 1792 it was sold to Charles Pelham, who kept it in the garden of his home in [[Chelsea, London]], Walpole House. His descendants moved it in 1906 to their country house, Brocklesby Park, [[Lincolnshire]]. It was bought from the family by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1950, although had appeared at an exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55948134 |title=TO BE SHOWN AT ART EXHIBITION. |newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=24 January 1938 |accessdate=9 November 2013 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
Bernini's ''Neptune and Triton'' references the mythological characters of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] (or Poseidon) and his son [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], the rulers of the seas. Neptune and Triton are deities that appear relatively briefly in classical literature; however, they are deemed important as controllers of the earth and seas. It is a common modern misconception to attribute Neptune to just the seas; however, in Greek myth Neptune is the ruler of earth and all it possesses, just as Zeus is the ruler of the heavens and Hades is the ruler of the Underworld. Triton is actually the character attributed to ruler of (just) the seas. Neptune and Triton are often depicted in water-like settings, holding tridents and usually driving chariots that have horses shooting out from the water.

Bernini's sculpture gives a slightly different representation of the duo. The story depicted in the sculpture was that Neptune was rescuing the Aenean fleet from raging seas. Bernini re-interpreted the myth, focussing on the responses of Neptune and Triton more than the actual story itself. In the myth, Neptune comes from beneath the seas to split the ships with his trident. Bernini flipped the appearance of the scene, with Neptune pointing the trident downwards and making no reference to the Aenean fleet, thereby giving the impression Neptune ruled the seas from above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Willam Collier|title=New Light on Bernini's Neptune and Triton|publisher=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes|volume=31|pages=38–440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neptune===
In Bernini's sculpture, you see Neptune towering over Triton. He appears to be a man in his early thirties, with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is balancing on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look like he is about to thrust it at someone. "(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident."&lt;ref name="R. Wittkower"&gt;{{cite news|author=R. Wittkower|title=Bernini: The Sculptor of the Roman Baroque|edition=4th|location=London|publisher=Phaidon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune's hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.

===Triton===
Triton, Neptune's son, is positioned below Neptune's legs, thrusting himself forward to blow the conch shell.  He is noticeably younger, maybe a teenage boy, though also with defined musculature. He blows his shell as a horn to announce that the king of the earth and oceans is approaching.  Triton grasps Neptune's leg and ducks his left shoulder between the thighs of Neptune.

==Naturalism==
The naturalism of the figures suggests the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune's furrowed brow gives a sense of his fierce strength. His stance is set in stone, solidifying his divine power. In contrast, Triton looks somewhat submissive while he is grabbing Neptune's thigh. His face looks to be full of anxiety as if he knows that he should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune's dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini's plan to convey myths coming to life.

Bernini gave the audience the chance to "see" these gods in person; in movement. This was Bernini's first sculpture to " …work where the silhouette is broken, where the climax of a transitory action is given and where the action extends beyond the physical limits."&lt;ref name="R. Wittkower"/&gt; The point of the sculpture is to bring the viewer to face a myth or story to be true and real by its dramatic tension in the body positions and subtle hints at natural life. He was making the myths, rumours and stories an opportunity to be true and demand its viewer to believe in its truth.

The '''Newton disc''' is a well-known physics experiment with a rotating disc with segments in different colors (usually Newton's primary colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) appearing as white (or off-white or gray) when it spins very fast.

This type of mix of light stimuli is called temporal optical mixing, a version of additive-averaging mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/044.php|title=Additive mixing, additive-averaging|last=Briggs|first=David|date=2012-08-12|website=The Dimensions of Colour|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern sources state that [[Isaac Newton]] himself used a disc with colored sectors to demonstrate how white light was actually the compound of the primary colors. However, none seem to refer to a historical source for this.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Ptolemy]] and [[Ibn al-Haytham]] described additive optical mixing with turning wheels and spinning tops hundreds of years before Newton, but they did not use primary colors to get the (off-)white result of the Newton disc.

Transparent variations for [[magic lantern]] projection have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Optics/Newtons_Color_Wheel/Newtons_Color_Wheel.html|title=Newton's Color Wheel|last=Greenslade, Jr.|first=Thomas B.|date=|website=Instruments for Natural Philosophy, [[Kenyon College]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Around CE 165 [[Ptolemy]] described in his book ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' a rotating potter's wheel with different colors on it. He noted how the different colors of sectors mixed together into one color and how dots appeared as circles when the wheel was spinning very fast. When lines are drawn across the axis of the disc they make the whole surface appear to be of a uniform color. "The visual impression that is created in the first revolution is invariably followed by repeated instances that subsequently produce an identical impression. This also happens in the case of shooting stars, whose light seems distended on account of their speed of motion, all according to the amount of perceptible distance it passes along with the sensible impression that arises in the visual faculty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ASILAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=l7oKmVwhW5&amp;dq=ptolemy%20potter's%20wheel&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ptolemy and the Foundations of Ancient Mathematical Optics: A Source Based Guided Study|last=Smith|first=A.

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (circa 243-305) wrote in his commentary on Ptolemy's ''Harmonics'' how the senses are not stable but confused and inaccurate. Certain intervals between repeated impressions are not detected. A white or black spot on a spinning cone (or top) appears as a circle of that color and a line on the top makes the whole surface appear in that color. "Because of the swiftness of the movement we receive the impression of the line on every part of the cone as the line moves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=c6QKDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=ptolemy%20spinning%20top&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Porphyry's Commentary on Ptolemy's Harmonics: A Greek Text and Annotated Translation|date=2015-09-15|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316239681|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th century Ibn al-Haytam, who was familiar with Ptolemy's writings, described how colored lines on a spinning top could not be discerned as different colors but appeared as one new color composed of all of the colors of the lines. He deducted that sight needs some time to discern a color. al-Haytam also noted that the top appeared motionless when spun extremely quick "for none of its points remains fixed in the same spot for any perceptible time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=3x0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA639&amp;ots=bID4ipQ84C&amp;dq=ptolemy%20optics%20color%20rotating%20wheel&amp;pg=PA444#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception: A Critical Edition, with English Translation and Commentary, of the First Three Books of Alhacen's De Aspectibus, the Medieval Latin Version of Ibn Al-Haytham's Kitab Al-Manazir|last=Alhazen|last2=Smith|first2=A.

On 6 February 1671/72 Isaac Newton wrote a paper about the experiments he had been conducting since 1666 with the [[refraction]] of light through glass prisms. He concluded that the different refracted rays of light - well parted from others - could not be changed by further refraction, nor by reflection or other means, except through mixture with other rays. He thus found the seven primary colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, "a violet-purple" and indigo. When mixing these rays he found that "the most surprising and wonderful composition was that of whiteness" requiring all the primary colors "mixed in a due proportion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newton|first=Isaac|date=1671|title=A Letter of Mr. Isaac Newton, Professor of the Mathematicks in the University of Cambridge; Containing His New Theory about Light and Colors: Sent by the Author to the Publisher from Cambridge, Febr. 6. 1671/72; In Order to be Communicated to the R. Society|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/101125|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=6|pages=3075–3087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704) Newton describes a device with prisms, a lens and a large moving comb with teeth causing alternating colors to be projected successively. "But if I so much accelerated the Motion, that the Colours by reason of their quick Succession could not be distinguished from one another, the Appearance of the single Colours ceased. There was no red, no yellow, no green, no blue, nor purple to be seen any longer, but from a Confusion of them all there arose one uniform white Colour."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=GnAFAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq|title=Opticks:: Or, A Treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light|last=Newton|first=Sir Isaac|date=1730|publisher=William Innys at the West-End of St. Paul's.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Paris Street; Rainy Day''''' ({{lang-fr|Rue de Paris, temps de pluie}}) is a large 1877 oil painting by the French artist [[Gustave Caillebotte]] (1848–1894), and is his best known work.&lt;ref name="h624"&gt;Hagen, 624&lt;/ref&gt; It shows a number of individuals walking through the Place de Dublin, then known as the Carrefour de Moscou, at an intersection to the east of the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] in north Paris. Although Caillebotte was a friend and patron of many of the impressionist painters, and this work is part of that school, it differs in its realism and reliance on line rather than broad brush strokes.

Caillebotte's interest in photography is evident. The figures in the foreground appear "out of focus", those in the mid-distance (the carriage and the pedestrians in the intersection) have sharp edges, while the features in the background become progressively indistinct. The severe cropping of some figures –particularly the man to the far right– further suggests the influence of photography.

The painting was first shown at the Third [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] Exhibition of 1877. It is currently owned by the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/20684 Paris Street; Rainy Day, 1877]. Art Institute of Chicago. Retrieved 29 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art Institute of Chicago|AIC]] curator Gloria Groom described the work as "the great picture of urban life in the late 19th century."&lt;ref&gt;Hedy Weiss. "Gustave Who?" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. 12 February 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Paris Street; Rainy Day Detail 1.png|thumb|240px|Detail]]
The tone of the light indicates that the painting is set on a wintery afternoon,&lt;ref name="w174"&gt;Weinber, 174&lt;/ref&gt; and the two main figures walk underneath an umbrella.  They are dressed in the height of contemporary Parisian fashion. She wears a hat, veil, diamond earring, demure brown dress, and a fur lined coat, described in 1877 as "modern – or should I say, the latest fashion". The man wears a moustache, [[overcoat|topcoat]], [[frock coat]],&lt;ref name="h627"&gt;Hagen, 627&lt;/ref&gt; top hat, bow tie, starched white shirt, buttoned waistcoat and an open long coat with collar turned up. They are unambiguously middle class, yet some working class figures may be seen in the background; a maid in a doorway, the decorator carrying a ladder, cut-off by the umbrella above him.&lt;ref name="h626"&gt;Hagen, 626&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b19"&gt;Broude, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Caillebotte juxtaposes the figures and the perspective in a playful manner, with one man appearing to jump from the wheel of a carriage; another pair of legs appear below the rim of an umbrella.

[[File:Gustave Caillebotte, 1877 - Rue de Paris, jour de pluie (étude).jpg|left|thumb|300px|Study for ''Paris Street; Rainy Day'']]
The painting does not present a convivial mood. The figures seem mostly isolated, and their expressions are largely downcast. They appear to hurry rather than stroll through the streets, absorbed in their own thoughts. The umbrellas shield them, in the words of Rose-Marie Hagen, "not just from the rain, but, also it seems, from other passers by".&lt;ref name="h626" /&gt; Characteristic of the positioning of the figures, the heads and eyes of the main couple are faced away from the man approaching them from their right. Hagen believes that given their close quarters, they will both be unable to comfortably step out of the man's way, but also their averted gaze applies equally to the viewer, who looks from a perspective equal to us.&lt;ref name="h625"&gt;Hagen, 625&lt;/ref&gt; Caillebotte reproduces the effect of a camera lens in that the points at the center of the image seem to bulge. He also recreates the focusing effect of the camera in the way that it sharpens certain subjects of an image, but not others. The same purpose is seen in the overall clarity of the image. The foreground is in focus, but slightly smudged; the middle ground has sharp, clear edges and well defined subjects, and the background fades into the distance, becoming more and more blurry the farther back the eye travels. He makes the middle ground section more clear, mimicking the effect of a camera.

The figures appear to have walked into the painting, as though Caillebotte was taking a snapshot of people going about their day; in fact, he spent months carefully placing them within the pictorial space.&lt;ref name="h626" /&gt; The painting is highly linear;&lt;ref name="b18"&gt;Broude, 18&lt;/ref&gt; its focus draws the viewer's eye to the vantage point at the center of the buildings in the background. The strong vertical of the central green lamp post divides the painting; a horizontal alignment breaks the painting into quarters; the gaslight at the center of the picture throws shadows on the wet cobblestones, and divides the composition in two. Cobblestones dominate one full quarter of the canvas.&lt;ref name="h626" /&gt;

==Setting==
[[File:Place de Dublin, Paris May 2010.jpg|thumb|320px|2010 photograph of the [[Place de Dublin]]]]
''Paris Street; Rainy Day'' gives a view from the eastern side of the {{ill|Rue de Turin|fr|Rue de Turin (Paris)}}, looking north toward the [[Place de Dublin]]. The neoclassical buildings reflect the construction works of [[Baron Haussmann]]. The view shown is spacious, and details a broad view of a number of streets. Although the [[ashlar]] facades of the buildings might today seem uniform, at the time they would have been modern and fresh – in Caillebotte's youth the area was a hill just beyond the city edge just beginning to be developed as a residential center for the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name="h625"&gt;Hagen, 625&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Three roads are visible on the northern side of the square: the {{ill|rue de Moscou|fr|Rue de Moscou (Paris)}} (left), the {{ill|rue Clapeyron|fr}} (center), and a continuation of the rue de Turin (right), which runs from the foreground and into the background. The square is crossed by the {{ill|rue de Saint-Pétersbourg|fr}}, suggested by the line of the buildings to the left and a break in the buildings to the right.&lt;ref name="h625"&gt;Hagen, 625&lt;/ref&gt; The point of view of the roads and the buildings portrayed allows Caillebotte to use [[two-point perspective]].

==Reception and provenance==
[[Émile Zola]], often a critic of Caillebotte,  praised this work in an article "Notes parisiennes: Une exposition: les peintres impressionnistes" published in ''Le Sémaphore de Marseille'' in 1877.

As with many of Caillebotte's paintings, it remained with the family until the mid twentieth century. It was acquired by [[Walter P. Chrysler Jr.]] in 1955, who in turn sold it to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/5wEUCOlEf-EaVQ?projectId=art-project#!asset-viewer:l.id=5wEUCOlEf-EaVQ&amp;projectId=art-project&amp;urlStub=Paris%20Street%3B%20Rainy%20Day Paris Street; Rainy Day1877], Google Art Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==English editions==
[[File:Den ende.png|thumb|right|''Den ende och hans egendom'' – a 1911 Swedish edition, with a foreword by [[Georg Brandes]] and afterword by [[Albert Jensen (anarchist)|Albert Jensen]].]]
===First edition (1907)===
* The first English Language Edition appeared in 1907; it was a translation by the [[United States|American]] [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]], [[Steven T. Byington]] with an introduction by [[James L. Walker]]. The publisher was [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], [[New York City]]. This edition was reprinted several times by several publishers in New York and [[London]] up to 1931.

===Libertarian Book Club edition (1963)===
* The 1963 [[Libertarian Book Club]] edition is a re-print of the 1907 Byington translation. Edited by [[James J. Martin]] and with a cover by the son of [[Rudolf Rocker]], the edition revived interest in Stirner as an influence on [[anarchism]] and related ideologies and brought [[Max Stirner]] to a wider audience in the [[English-speaking world]]. This edition was reprinted several times by several publishers in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] up to 1993, sometimes with a preface by Sidney E. Parker.

===Harper &amp; Row - Readings in Fascist, Racist and Elitist Ideology (1971)===
* An [[abridged]] English edition of the Byington translation revised, selected and annotated by John Carroll. [[New York City]] / [[London]]: [[Harper &amp; Row]] 1971. 266 pp. The book appeared in a series "Roots of the Right. Readings in [[Fascist]], [[Racist]] and [[Elitist]] [[Ideology]]", together with writings by [[Gobineau]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], [[Joseph de Maistre|de Maistre]], [[Maurras]]. The text consists of a mix of about a hundred quotations from ''The Ego'' (and some from Stirner's minor writings), reducing the volume by about a half. The reason why Stirner's work was selected for this series remains unclear given the book's fierce anti-authoritarianism and emphasis on the sovereignty of the individual.

===Rebel Press edition (1993)===
* The 1993 Rebel Press, [[London]] edition is an unabridged republication of the 1963 re-print of the 1907 Byington translation by the Libertarian Book Club. The Rebel Press, [[London]] edition has a cover design from [[anarchist]] [[artist]] and [[cartoonist]], [[Clifford Harper]] and a preface by Sidney E. Parker.

===Cambridge University press edition (1995)===
* The [[Cambridge University]] press edition (ed. David Leopold, 1995) is a revised version of the original 1907 Byington translation with a new introduction by David Leopold. Leopold changed the title (His to Its) "not out of ahistorical considerations of 'political correctness' but because [[Stirner]] clearly identifies the egoistic subject as prior to gender" (p. xl). While Leopold accepted the Byington translation as "an heroic attempt to convey the readable yet idiosyncratic prose of [[Stirner]]'s original", he "made a number of amendments, such as removing infelicities and archaisms, replacing the occasional missing sentence, and restoring some of the original paragraph and sections breaks." (p. xxxix)

===Underworld Amusements edition (2017)===
* [[Individualist Anarchism|Individual Anarchist]] writer and historian Wolfi Landstreicher began his completely new translation in 2010, and published under the more literal title of "The Unique and Its Property." All prior published editions had been reproductions of, or based on the Byington translation, but Landstreicher's work constitutes the second full translation ever completed. He also wrote an introduction to it.

==History==
{{Main|Radio in Ireland}}
===Background===
After the [[Irish Free State]] was formed and the [[Irish Civil War]] was concluded, the new state set up a single radio channel named [[2RN]] in 1926, launched by [[Douglas Hyde]]. This was ran by the [[Irish Post Office]] and was not a private enterprise. The radio program, operating out of [[Dublin]], largely served the [[Anglophone]] population and at best reached as far as [[County Tipperary]]; a situation which did not change until more powerful transmitters were adopted in the 1930s at [[Athlone]].&lt;ref name="wat97"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/5703|title=A History of Irish Language Broadcasting: National Ideology, Commercial Interest and Minority Rights|author=Iarfhlaith Watson|date=1997|publisher=UCD Press|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved in setting up 2RN and [[J. J. Walsh]] ([[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]] from 1923 to 1927) discussed the possibility of setting up an [[Irish-language]] radio service for the ''[[Gaeltacht]]'' community and more widely were sympathetic to Irish culture which included language revival, but the project was frustrated due to economic reasons and came to little.&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rte.ie/archives/2017/0228/856014-raidio-na-gaeltachta/|title=Local Radio Service at Last for An Gaeltacht 1972|author=Féach|date= 6 March 1972|publisher= RTÉ Archives|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. O'Hegarty]]|source=''Secretary of the Department for Posts and Telegraphs'', 1924.&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://mro.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/1864/02_whole.pdf|title=Te Reo Pāho: Māori radio and language revitalisation|author=Rangiānehu Matamua|date=2006|publisher=Massey University|accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Éamon de Valera.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Éamon de Valera]], [[Taoiseach]] and later [[President of Ireland]], supported the idea of establishing a ''Gaeltacht'' radio station.]]
As the Irish language was valued as part of Irish national identity and a marker of the young state's independence, there were some broadcasts in the language such as ''Nuacht'' and ''Tréimhseachán Teann'' (shows with English equivalents), the latter written by [[Séamus Ó Néill]] and [[Ciarán Ó Nualláin]] (brother of [[Brian Ó Nualláin]]). These featured alongside focus on [[Gaelic games]], [[Irish traditional music]] and [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic religious]] programming as part of a general [[nation-building]] content focus. In the 1940s, there were shows which sought to proactively teach the language such as ''Is Your Irish Rusty?'' and ''Listen and Learn''.&lt;ref name="wat"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/handle/10197/5633/Watson_2002_Irish_Language_Broadcasting._Media_Culture_&amp;_Society.pdf?sequence=1|title=Irish-language broadcasting: history, ideology and identity|author=Iarfhlaith Watson|date= 2002|publisher=Sage Publications|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish-language programming suffered from a shortage of materials and for audience figures. In 1943, [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] – whose wife [[Sinéad Ní Fhlannagáin]] was a keen ''[[Conradh na Gaeilge]]'' activist – promoted the idea of a ''Gaeltacht'' station again, but there was no breakthrough.&lt;ref name="rte"/&gt; By this time, 2RN had become ''[[Radio Éireann]]'' and still only had [[RTÉ Radio 1|one channel]], with limited broadcasting hours, often in competition for listeners with [[BBC Radio]] and [[Radio Luxembourg]].

In the 1950s, a general [[liberalisation]] and [[commercialisation]], indeed [[Americanisation]] began to occur in Ireland, as a push was made to move Ireland from a rural-agrarian society with a protectionist cultural policy, towards a [[market economy]] basis, with [[supply and demand]] the primarily basis of public communications. This brought Ireland into line culturally with the [[Western powers]] and eventually paved the way for its entrance into the [[European Economic Community]]. In 1960, [[RTÉ]] was established and direct control of communications moved from a government ministry position to a non-governmental [[Director-General of RTÉ|RTÉ Director-General]] position, first filled by the American, Edward Roth. Previous cultural policies, including broadcasting in Irish, reduced in percentage, as ratings and profit became key. Eventually, in the late 1960s, a civil rights movement in the ''Gaeltacht'', particularly Conamara emerged, seeking development and services for Irish-speakers, including a radio service. Out of the {{lang|ga|[[Gluaiseacht Chearta Siabhialta na Gaeltachta]]}}'s advocacy came the [[Irish pirate radio|pirate radio]] station ''[[Saor Raidió Chonamara]]'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/4561/OhIfearnain_2000_Irish.pdf;sequence=1|title=Irish Language Broadcast Media: The Interaction of State Language Policy, Broadcasters and their Audiences|author=Tadhg Ó hIfearnáin |date= 2000|publisher=University of Limerick|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the subsequent discourse for Irish-language and ''Gaeltacht'' issues as a [[civil rights]] and [[minority rights]] imperative.

===Foundation===
[[File:Raidío na Gaeltachta, Casla - geograph.org.uk - 1269978.jpg|thumb|240px|Raidió na Gaeltachta headquarters in [[Casla]], [[County Galway]]. It is located in the [[Conamara]] Gaeltacht.]]
[[Gerry Collins (politician)|Gerry Collins]], the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, announced in the ''[[Dáil]]'' in February 1971 that a new radio station for the ''Gaeltacht'' would be created. ''Raidió na Gaeltachta'' began broadcasting at 3pm on 2 April 1972 as part of an [[Easter Sunday]] programming. During the very first broadcast, the main station at [[Casla]], [[County Galway]] was not yet finished and the studios in [[County Kerry]] and [[County Donegal]] were still in construction, so it was broadcast from [[Galway]]. The first ''Ceannaire'' (Controller) Pádraic Ó Raghallaigh opened the show, which was followed by a recording from President Éamon de Valera. A recording of [[Seán Ó Riada]]'s Irish-language [[Mass (music)|Mass]], ''Ceol an Aifrinn'' (which includes the hymn ''[[Ag Críost an Síol]]'') from the ''Seipéal Mhic Dara'' at [[Carraroe]] was also played.

At foundation, the station began with a staff of seven, including six former teachers and a businessman: Ó Raghallaigh, Breandán Feiritéar, Timlín Ó Cearnaigh, Máirtín Ó Fátharta, Seán Ó Tuairisg, Maidhc P. Ó Conaola, [[Mícheál Ó Sé]] and Feardorcha Ó Colla.&lt;ref name="it"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/raidi%C3%B3-r%C3%A9alteanna-raidi%C3%B3-na-gaeltachta-marks-40-years-1.493375|title=Raidió réalteanna: Raidió na Gaeltachta marks 40 years|author=Lorna Siggins|date= 2 April 2012|publisher= [[Irish Times]]|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, ''Raidió na Gaeltachta'' broadcast for only two hours a day&lt;ref name="gp"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gaelport.com/default.aspx?treeid=37&amp;NewsItemID=7887|title=RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta celebrates 40 years on the air|author=|date= 3 April 2012|publisher= Gaelport|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was only available in or near the three largest ''Gaeltacht'' districts. The local studio at [[Derrybeg]] in [[Gweedore]], County Donegal, under the direction of Ulstermen, Ó Cearnaigh and Ó Colla, aided the native Irish music scene there. In the 1970s, ''Raidió na Gaeltachta'' gave early coverage to [[Clannad]] and [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]] (later the singer for [[Altan (band)|Altan]]). These groups would gain popularity not only in Ireland, but on the international stage, selling millions of records during the 1980s especially.&lt;ref name="it"/&gt; The station was dedicated to bringing the listener general news, both national and international (which, in the [[The Troubles|context]] of the times meant Donegal reporters with names ''as Gaeilge'' having to cross [[British Army]] checkpoints into [[Northern Ireland]]), as well as [[Gaelic sports]] coverage and more localised affairs of significance to the community in the ''Gaeltacht''.&lt;ref name="it"/&gt;

===Recent===
Following the putting in place of a fourth RTÉ national radio transmitter network (used for [[RTÉ lyric fm]]), the station expanded to 24 hours from 1 October 2001. Listenership figures are hard to come by, as the station does not make payments to be included covered in the [[Joint National Listenership Research|JNLR]] listenership survey. It is claimed that – as it doesn't carry advertising (the only Irish radio station not to do so) – paying to be included in a survey organised mainly for the benefit of the Irish advertising industry would be a pointless waste of scarce funds. It is generally believed that listenership is high amongst fluent Irish speakers but its appeal among those learning the language is not as high as [[TG4]] because (despite being available nationally) it is widely perceived as being oriented (as its name suggests) towards [[Gaeltacht]] residents.

For many years it was the only Irish-language broadcaster in the country; in recent years it has been joined by a television service, Telefís na Gaeilge ([[TG4]]), and by regional community radio stations: [[Raidió na Life]] in Dublin, [[Raidió Fáilte]] in Belfast and [[Raidió Rí-Rá]].

In March 2005, RTÉ announced that RnaG would allow songs with English lyrics to be played between 21:00 and 01:00, as part of a new popular music strand. In April 2005, it was announced that the name of this strand would be ''Anocht FM'' (Tonight FM). On weeknights the strand includes a new programme, ''Géill Slí'' (Give Way), as well as the existing long-running ''An Taobh Tuathail'' slot. ''Anocht FM'' will also be broadcast at weekends with different programmes. The new service was launched on 2 May 2005. The first track with English-language lyrics played was ''[[Blister in the Sun]]'' by the [[Violent Femmes]], chosen by public vote.

==Locations==
RnaG is based in [[Casla]], Co. Galway. It also has studios at [[Gaoth Dobhair]] (''Gweedore''), Co. Donegal; [[Ballynagall|Baile na nGall]] in [[Ard na Caithne]], Co. Kerry; [[Castlebar]], Co. Mayo; with a smaller studio in [[An Rinn]], County Waterford and the [[RTÉ Radio Centre]] in [[Dublin]].

The '''Rehearsal Club''' was a theatrical girls' boarding house was founded in 1913 by Jean "Daisy" Greer, daughter of New York's Episcopal bishop, and Episcopal Deaconess Jane Harriss Hall. The residence provided young women pursuing a life in the theater a place to rest between auditions, along with opportunities to socialize and receive simple meals.&lt;ref&gt;NY Times, July, 1913, https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/07/06/100633752.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, the Professional Children’s School was established in back parlors of The Rehearsal Club.&lt;ref&gt;Professional Children’s School, From the Archives, 2012, by John Tucker&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1920, the Club relocated from its first home on West 46th Street to a large house on West 45th to accommodate increasing residency. In 1923, the Club moved to 47 West 53rd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, where it remained for over 50 years.  The brownstone and its neighbor number 45, acquired for the Club in 1925, were owned by Rockefeller family members.

In 1936, The Rehearsal Club served as the inspiration behind [[Edna Ferber]] and [[George S. Kaufman|George S. Kaufman's]] play, ''[[Stage Door]]'' which opened on October 20, 1936 at the Music Box Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Elita Wilson, October 21, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the RKO film version of ''Stage Door'' was released, featuring [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Ginger Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;Published The New York Times, October 8, 1937 by Frank S. Nugent.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most noted Rehearsal Club residents was [[Carol Burnett]].  In 1955, she initiated and was featured in a showcase of her fellow Club friends called 'The Rehearsal Club Revue,'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=93 The Paley Center for Media | She Made It | Carol Burnett&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which served as an initial career boost for several of the girls. Ms. Burnett sponsored scholarships for Club residents in the 1960s, and fondly recalls her Club life in her memoirs ''This Time Together'' &lt;ref&gt;''This Time Together'' by Carol Burnett, published Harmony Books (April 6, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''One More Time: A Memoir''.&lt;ref&gt;''One More Time: A Memoir'' by Carol Burnett, Publisher: Random House, c1986&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Although men were not allowed upstairs, many did hang out in the Rehearsal Club’s first-floor parlor.&lt;ref&gt;Published The New York Times, July 6, 1913, retrieved August, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Dean]], before he became a Hollywood legend, often visited the Rehearsal Club and for a time dated resident [[Liz Sheridan]], also known as "Dizzy," then a 23-year-old fledgling dancer on the Milton Berle Show.&lt;ref&gt;"People Magazine": An Affair to Remember, by Michael A. Lipton, June 24, 1996 Vol. 45 No. 25. http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20141628,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Published as the “saddest site today,” [http://our.tentativetimes.net/olddean/magdalin.html James Dean Walking Tours, In Search of a Legend in New York], December 7, 2001,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] sold the buildings at 45–47 West 53rd Street to [[American Folk Art Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkartmuseum.org/history American Folk Art Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Rehearsal Club closed for good.&lt;ref&gt;Life Magazine, April, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
In 2007, Rehearsal Club alumnae gathered and formed an organization with a mission statement to "preserve the name of The Rehearsal Club, protect its legacy and inspire other younger generations".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rehearsalclubnyc.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The list received mixed response from fellow publications. Writing for ''[[Flavorwire]]'', Judy Berman criticized the selection of the songwriters, saying "Predictably, it's over 70% white and features only nine solo female songwriters (five other women are included as part of mixed-gender writing teams). Classic rock is overrepresented; every other genre and subgenre of popular music is underrepresented."&lt;ref name="flavorwire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/532955/does-rolling-stone-know-it-declared-songwriting-dead|work=[[Flavorwire]]|title=Does ‘Rolling Stone’ Know It Declared Songwriting Dead?|first=Judy |last=Berman|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geeta Dayal from ''[[The Guardian]]'' accused "corporate sponsorship" in determining the list's content.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/aug/24/rolling-stones-greatest-songwriters-list-corporate-sponsorship-apple-music|title=The real peril in Rolling Stone's greatest songwriters wasn't the lack of diversity – it was the corporate sponsorship|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Geeta|last=Dayal|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Moon from [[NPR]] wrote that "This list represents another trip through the hagiographic, hermetically sealed [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|rock hall of fame]], with the same stars you've been reading about in Rolling Stone since the dinosaur age."&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/08/24/433206610/the-one-real-problem-with-rolling-stones-greatest-songwriters-of-all-time|first=Tom|last=Moon|publisher=[[NPR]]|title=The One Real Problem With Rolling Stone's 'Greatest Songwriters Of All Time'|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' editor Martin Chilton responded with a list of 100 best songwriters missed out by ''Rolling Stone'', including [[Cole Porter]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Kate Bush]], and [[Ray Charles]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/100-great-songwriters/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=100 great songwriters not in the Rolling Stone list|date=May 17, 2016|first=Martin|last=Chilton|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacqueline Cutler from ''[[New York Daily News]]'' agreed with the magazine for ranking [[Bob Dylan]] as the top songwriter.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/bob-dylan-rolling-stone-greatest-songwriter-article-1.2325783|title=Bob Dylan is Rolling Stone’s greatest songwriter|work=[[New York Daily News]]|first=Jacqueline|last=Cutler|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Bream from ''[[Star Tribune]]'' praised the inclusion of songwriters from [[Minnesota]] and said that Dylan as a number-one songwriter is not surprising at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/dylan-tops-rolling-stone-s-rankings-of-best-songwriters-prince-is-no-18/321851631/|title=Dylan tops Rolling Stone's rankings of best songwriters; Prince is No. 18|first=Jon|last=Bream|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baby A.

'''Russian Telegraph Agency''' ({{lang-ru|Российское телеграфное агентство}}, ''Rossiyskoye telegrafnoye agentstvo''), [[abbreviation|abbr.]] '''ROSTA''', was the [[State media|state]] [[news agency]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] (1918-35). After the creation of [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] in 1925, it remained the news agency of Soviet Russia. Its name was associated with ''Rosta windows'' ({{lang-ru|Окна Роста}}, ''Okna Rosta'').

==Rosta windows==
Rosta windows or satirical Rosta windows ({{lang-ru|Окна сатиры Роста}}, ''Okna satiry Rosta'') were [[stencil]]-replicated [[propaganda]] [[poster]]s created by artists and poets within the Rosta system, under the supervision of the Chief Committee of Political Education during 1919-21. Inheriting the [[Russia]]n design traditions of [[lubok]] and [[rayok]], the main topics were current political events. They were usually displayed in windows, hence the name.

The first Rosta window was created in Moscow by Mikhail Cheremnykh (1890-1962). He was soon joined by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], a popular and prolific author, [[Dmitry Moor]] (1883-1946), [[Amshey Nurenberg]] (1887-1979), [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Mikhail Volpin]] and others. Similar projects were performed in other Soviet cities. Cheremnykh and Mayakovsky, for example, produced a poster in 1921 satirising a [[French people|French]] delegation led by [[Joseph Noulens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O74913/poster/ V&amp;A Images]&lt;/ref&gt;

The design featured graphical simplicity suitable for viewing from distance and often used [[lubok]]-styled sequences of pictures according to some plot, similar to modern [[comics]]. The posters were not printed but rather painted with cut-out stencils made from cardboard. Once the required number of posters was painted, the stencils were sent to another city and put in circulation throughout the Soviet Union.

During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], this approach was reproduced in Tass windows by [[Kukryniksy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19124">The '''Synod of Elvira''' ({{lang-la|Concilium Eliberritanum}}, {{lang-es|Concilio de Elvira}}) was an ecclesiastical [[synod]] held at Elvira in the [[Western Roman Empire|Roman province]] of [[Hispania Baetica]], now [[Granada]] in southern Spain.&lt;ref name = "Hennecke"&gt;{{Citation | first = Edgar | last = Hennecke | author-link = Edgar Hennecke | contribution = Elvira, Synod of | title = [[Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]] | edition = 3rd}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its date has not been exactly determined but is believed to be in the first quarter of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]], approximately 305–6. It was one of three councils, together with the [[Synod of Arles (314)]] and the [[Synod of Ancyra]], that first approached the character of general councils and prepared the way for the first [[ecumenical council]]. It was attended by nineteen bishops and twenty-six presbyters, mostly resident in [[Hispania Baetica|Baetica]]. Deacons and laymen were also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Philip | last = Schaff | title = History of the Christian Church}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty-one canons are recorded, although it is believed that many were added at later dates. All concern order, discipline and conduct among the Christian community.  Canon 36, [[Aniconism in Christianity|forbidding the use of images in churches]], became a bone of contention between Catholic and Protestant scholars after the [[Protestant Reformation]].

It is one of a number of [[Ancient church councils (pre-ecumenical)|pre-ecumenical ancient church councils and synods]].  The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia refers to this as a "council," conveying a wider scope than a synod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05395b.htm | publisher = New Advent | title = Catholic encyclopedia | year = 1913}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican refers to it using both terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_31011994_directory_en.html | publisher = Roman curia | place = The Vatican | title = Congregation of the clergy}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grenade, Puerta de Elvira.jpg|thumb|If the ancient Roman city of Elvira was located in the Albaicín district of Granada, as some think, the synod may have taken place just inside the Puerta de Elvira (eleventh-century), seen here.]]

==Place and purpose==
The place of meeting, Eliberri, rendered as Elvira,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eliberri]], Elimberri'' or ''Ilumberri'' was an ancient cognate of today Basque ''Hiriberri'' or ''Irunberri'' that mean 'new domain', 'new town.&lt;/ref&gt; was not far from the modern [[Granada]], if not, as A.W. Dale&lt;ref&gt;Dale 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; and Edgar Hennecke&lt;ref name = "Hennecke" /&gt; think, actually identical with it. There the nineteen bishops and twenty-four presbyters, mostly  from [[Hispania Baetica]] and [[Carthago Nova]],{{Efn | Hennecke noted that Legio (Leon) and Saragoza were represented, but not Tarragona.}} assembled, probably at the instigation of [[Hosius of Córdoba]], but under the presidency of Felix of Accitum ([[Guadix]]) in Baetica, probably by virtue of his being the oldest bishop present,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Hosius%20(1),%20a%20confessor%20under%20Maximian | first = Henry | last = Wace | title = Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature | contribution = Hosius (1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a view to restoring order and discipline in the church. The canons which were adopted reflect with considerable fullness the internal life and external relations of the Spanish Church of the 4th century. The reputation of this council drew to its canons further canons that came to be associated with the Synod of Elvira.

Victor De Clercq&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Clercq | first = Victor | type = review | contribution = Samuel Laeuchli, ''Power and Sexuality: The Emergence of Canon Law at the Synod of Elvira | title = Vigiliae Christianae | volume = 29 | issue = 1 |date=March 1975 | page = 76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; notes "that except for [[Hosius of Córdoba]], we know practically nothing about these men, nor do we know with certainty when and why the council was held, and that the church of Spain is one of the least known in pre-constantinian [sic] times". 

==The canons==
Maurice Meigne&lt;ref&gt;"Concile ou collection d'Elvire," ''[[Revue d'histoire ecclésiastique]]'' '''70''' (1975) pp 361-387&lt;/ref&gt; considers that only the first twenty-one canons in the list that has been transmitted&lt;ref&gt;Problems of the textual transmission of the canons are discussed in Hamilton Hess, ''The Early Development of Canon Law and the Council of Serdica'' (Oxford Early Christian Studies, Oxford: 2002) pp 40-42.&lt;/ref&gt; were promulgated at Elvira; the remainder having been added to the collection.

The social environment of [[Christian]]s in Hispania may be inferred from the canons prohibiting [[Interfaith marriage|marriage]] and other intercourse with [[Jew]]s, [[paganism|pagans]] and [[heretics]], closing the offices of [[flamen]] and [[duumvir]] to Christians, forbidding all contact with [[idolatry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Grigg | contribution = Aniconic Worship and the Apologetic Tradition: A Note on Canon 36 of the Council of Elvira | title = Church History | volume = 45 | issue = 4 |date=December 1976 | pages = 428–33}} finds that the hostility to [[icon]]s, forbidding the introduction of images into the churches is based on Christian [[apologist]]s' use of pagan sources denouncing the veneration of images, rather than on the prohibition in ''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'', which it fails to cite. He instances the contemporaneous apologists [[Arnobius]] and [[Lactantius]].&lt;/ref&gt; and likewise participation in pagan festivals and public games. The state of morals is mirrored in the canons denouncing prevalent vices. The canons respecting the clergy exhibit the clergy as already a special class with particular privileges, as acting under a more exacting moral standard, with heavier penalties for delinquency. The [[bishop]] has acquired control of the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacraments]], [[presbyter]]s and [[deacons]] acting only under his orders; the episcopate appears as a unit, bishops being bound to respect one another's disciplinary decrees.

The canons (which are available in English and Latin online) are almost entirely concerned with the conduct of various elements of the Christian community, and have no theological content as such.  Sanctions include long delays before baptism, exclusion from the [[Eucharist]] for periods of months or years, or indefinitely, sometimes with an exception for the death-bed, though this is also specifically excluded in some cases. Periods of [[penance]], often for sexual offences, extend to 5 or 10 years:  "Canon 5. If a woman beats her servant and causes death within three days, she shall undergo seven years' penance if the injury was inflicted on purpose and five years' if it was accidental.  She shall not receive communion during this penance unless she becomes ill.  If so, she may receive communion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fordham | title = Canon 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the canons which pertain to Jews served to maintain a separation between the two communities. Canon 15 prohibited marriage with pagans, while Canon 16 prohibited marriage of Christians with Jews. Canon 78 threatens Christians who commit adultery with Jews with [[ostracism]]. Canon 49 forbade the blessing of Christian crops by Jews, and Canon 50 forbade the sharing of meals by Christians and Jews.

Among the early canons (which are possibly the only original ones), Canon 1 forbade giving holy communion to lapsed Christians even ''in articulo mortis'', an unusually severe application of [[Novatianism|Novatianist principles]], which had divided the church since the recovery from mid 3rd-century persecutions: compare the severity of [[Cyprian of Carthage]]. The subject of this leading canon is a major indication for a date following recent persecution.

Among the later canons, of especial note are Canon 33, enjoining [[celibacy]] upon all clerics, married or not, and all who minister at the altar (the most ancient canon of [[clerical celibacy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Charles A | last = Frazee | title = The Origins of Clerical Celibacy in the Western Church | journal = Church History | volume = 57 | issue = Supplement Centennial | year = 1988 | pages = 108–26 | doi=10.2307/3165654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also relating to the subject of clerical celibacy is Canon 27, which calls for bishops and other clergy to refrain from living with women unless they are of relation.&lt;ref&gt;Hefele, Karl Joseph von, Joseph Hergenröther, Alois Knöpfler, and Henri Leclercq. 1907. Histoire des conciles d'après les documents originaux. 236. Paris: Letouzey et Ané. http://www.llmcdigital.org/default.aspx?redir=87181.&lt;/ref&gt; This canon is believed to be condemning the practice of [[Syneisaktism]], or spiritual marriage, which was growing more and more popular among ascetic men and women.

Canon 36 states, "It has seemed good that images should not be in churches so that what is venerated and worshiped not be painted on the walls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm | quote = Placuit picturas in ecclesia esse non debere, ne quod colitur et adoratur in parietibus depingatur | title = Elvira canons | publisher = Cua | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AS7rgB7f?url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm | archivedate = 2012-09-05 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Catholic Encyclopedia | quote = This canon has often been urged against the veneration of images as practised in the Catholic Church. [[Anton Joseph Binterim|Binterim]], De Rossi, and [[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]] interpret this prohibition as directed against the use of images in overground churches only, lest the pagans should caricature sacred scenes and ideas; [[Franz Xaver von Funk|Von Funk]], Termel, and [[Henri Leclercq|Dom Leclerq]] opine that the council did not pronounce as to the liceity or non-liceity of the use of images, but as an administrative measure simply forbade them, lest new and weak converts from paganism should incur thereby any danger of relapse into idolatry, or be scandalized by certain superstitious excesses in no way approved by the ecclesiastical authority.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn | A possible translation is also: "There shall be no pictures in the church, lest what is worshipped and adored should be depicted on the walls."}}  It allegedly [[Aniconism|forbids pictures]] in churches (compare the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]] in the East); according to [[Philip Schaff]] this canon "has often been quoted by Protestants as an argument against image worship as idolatrous; while Roman Catholic writers explain it either as a prohibition of representations of the deity only, or as a prudential measure against heathen desecration of holy things".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schaff | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc2.v.vi.xv.html | title = History | volume = II | chapter = 55 | publisher = The Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 36 was the first official statement on art by the Christian Church and so of special interest in the history of Early Christian and medieval art, even if it represents Church policy only within the limits of the synod's jurisdiction of Spain.  Recent scholarship argues that, rather than read the canon as a simple prohibition against the use of Christian art as idolatrous as has traditionally been done, its purpose was to counter a disturbing culture of apostasy and loss of communal identity that had arisen in the Spanish Church through the strong integration of the Christian subculture within the dominant pagan culture (the result of a peaceful period of social integration followed by an unusually bloody persecution).[[:File:///C:/Users/Rackdude/Google Drive/Riverside/2015-2016/Winter/Wikipedia Project/Basic Files/Synod of Elvira.docx# edn1|[i]]]  In this, Canon 36 was a compromise solution in its silence on the subject of private Christian art.  Never adopted outside of Spain (although many other canons of the Synod of Elvira were), Canon 36 is tacit evidence of a significant point of transition in the development of a distinctly Christian artistic culture, one that was leaving the venerable Judaic precedent of the Second Commandment behind as the Church cautiously accepted its increasingly mainstream status and the powerful socio-political dynamic that was a part of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1999-03-01|title=In the Beginning: Theories and images of creation in Northern Europe in the twelfth century|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8365.00138/abstract|journal=Art History|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=3–55|doi=10.1111/1467-8365.00138|issn=1467-8365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon 38, permits lay [[baptism]] under certain conditions, and Canon 53, forbids one bishop restoring a person [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by another.

Other provisions relating to images forbade Christian slave-owners from allowing their pagan slaves to keep their personal idols, or "if this is impossible to enforce, they must at least avoid the idols and remain pure.  If this does not happen, they are alienated from the church" (Canon 41).  Canon 60 says "If someone smashes an idol and is then punished by death, he or she may not be placed in the list of martyrs, since such action is not sanctioned by the Scriptures or by the apostles."  Canon 34 says "Candles are not to be burned in a cemetery during the day.  This practice is related to paganism and is harmful to Christians.  Those who do this are to be denied the communion of the church".  Other canons imposed "the rigorous form of fasting" every Saturday (Canon 26), forbade the baptism of chariot racers or stage performers (Canon 62), and many tightly control the reception of former pagan priests into the Christian church and clergy (Canons, 2,3,4,55).

Several canons relate only to the behaviour of women, such as Canon 67: "A woman who is baptized or is a catechumen must not associate with hairdressers or men with long hair..."  Canon 81 reads: "A woman may not write to other lay Christians without her husband's consent.  A woman may not receive letters of friendship addressed to her only and not to her husband as well."  However married former prostitutes are not to suffer delays in baptism on that account (Canon 44).

==Date of the synod==
The solution of the question of the date hinges upon the interpretation of the canons, that is, upon whether they are to be taken as reflecting a recent persecution, or as redacted in a time of peace, that is either after or before the [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecution under Diocletian]]. Thus the earliest investigators, [[Louis Duchesne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Duchesne | first = Louis | author-link = Louis Duchesne | title = Le concile d'Elvira et les flamines chrétiennes | language = French |trans-title=The Elvira council and the Christian… | journal = Mélanges Renier | place = Paris | year = 1887 | pages = 159–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Victor De Clercq,&lt;ref&gt;De Clercq (1954), ''Ossius of Cordova''.&lt;/ref&gt; argue for a date between 300 and 303, i.e. before the persecution under [[Diocletian]]; others for a date between 303 and 314, after the persecution, but before the [[Synod of Arles (314)]]; a few others argue for a date between the synod of Arles and the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], (325).  [[Karl Josef von Hefele]] and [[Robert William Dale]] follow early compilers of the canons [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi]] and [[Jean Hardouin]] in agreement upon 305 or 306, while Hennecke&lt;ref name = "Hennecke" /&gt; concludes that "the whole attitude points to a time of peace, not to one immediately following a persecution; the complete absence of any provisions as to the case of the lapsed is enough to preclude the modern theory as to the date".

==Documentation==
The scanty documentation of the Synod of Elvira was first assembled by  Ferdinand de Mendoza, ''De confirmando Concilio IIIiberitano ad Clementem VIII'', 1593.

'''Tania Tinoco''' (born August 2, 1963) is an [[Ecuador]]ian journalist, author, television producer, director, TV and radio presenter, reporter, interviewer, and [[Opinion leadership|opinion leader]]. For more than 30 years she has been known as the host of the [[Ecuavisa]] nightly newscast, ''Telemundo''.

==Biography==
Tania Tinoco was born in [[Machala]] on August 2, 1963. At the age of 11, together with her father Colón Tinoco, she went to live in [[Guayaquil]], where she studied at the {{ill|Unidad Educativa Bilingüe Interamericana|es|lt=Unidad Educativa Bilingüe}} de La Inmaculada.

At age 15, she was a member of the school's Journalism Club. Her first report for the school magazine was about an interview with the singer [[José Luis Rodríguez (singer)|José Luis "El Puma" Rodríguez]], granted after much insistence to his manager. This cemented her decision to pursue journalism as a profession.

Tinoco studied journalism at the {{ill|Universidad Laica Vicente Rocafuerte|es}}.

In December 1983, at age 20, with the help of the director of her college who recommended her to the Human Resources manager of Ecuavisa, she was brought on by the channel to work in filing.

In 1986, Nila Velásquez, then director of the Sunday newscast and current opinion editor of the newspaper ''[[El Universo]]'', recommended to {{ill|Alberto Borges|es}} that he choose Tania to read the news. Thus she became part of the evening news show ''Telemundo'', alongside Borges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2003/08/31/0001/262/E878E843851F448597E72C86D5B278FA.html |title=Tania Tinoco: Mi familia es lo primero |trans-title=Tania Tinoco: My Family Comes First |last=Pezo |first=Claudia |work=[[El Universo]] |language=Spanish |date=August 31, 2003 |access-date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 1992, Tinoco married Bruce Hardeman, a Swiss businessman with whom she has two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://caras.com.ec/index.php/gente/entrevistas/item/179-tania-tinoco-y-bruce-hardeman |title=Tania Tinoco y Bruce Hardeman |website=caras.com.ec |language=Spanish |date=April 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120439/http://caras.com.ec/index.php/gente/entrevistas/item/179-tania-tinoco-y-bruce-hardeman |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 her father died, followed six months later by Alberto Borges, who had been her companion on the news for eight years.

Tania Tinoco is currently the director and presenter of the news program ''Telemundo'' and the investigative program ''{{ill|Visión 360|es}}'', both on Ecuavisa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecuavisa.com/video/noticiero-telemundo |title=Noticiero Telemundo |publisher=[[Ecuavisa]] |language=Spanish |date=March 5, 2013 |access-date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
On January 29, 2015, Tinoco was presented with the Eugenio Espejo National Journalism Prize by the National Union of Ecuadorian Journalists ({{lang-es|Unión Nacional de Periodistas del Ecuador|links=no}}; UNP) in the television category, for the documentary titled ''Los niños de Génova''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://m.elcomercio.com/actualidad/nota/287354253 |title=UNP entregó sus premios al periodismo ecuatoriano |trans-title=UNP Awarded Its Ecuadorian Journalism Prizes |work=[[El Comercio (Ecuador)|El Comercio]] |language=Spanish |date=January 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209222959/http://m.elcomercio.com/actualidad/nota/287354253 |archive-date=February 9, 2015 |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.larepublica.ec/blog/politica/2015/01/30/tania-tinoco-gana-premio-nacional-periodismo-eugenio-espejo/ |title=Tania Tinoco gana Premio Nacional de Periodismo Eugenio Espejo |trans-title=Tania Tinoco Wins the Eugenio Espejo National Journalism Prize |work=[[La República (Ecuador)|La República]] |location=Ecuador |language=Spanish |date=January 30, 2015 |access-date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.revistamundodiners.com/?p=4134 |title=Tania Tinoco: una carrera de resistencia |trans-title=Tania Tinoco: A Career of Resistance |last=Garcés |first=Verónica |work=Mundo Diners |language=Spanish |date=August 13, 2014 |access-date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOQzZztzV18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2003) is a 10-minute [[video art]] project created by [[Genco Gulan]]. The film features two female teams inside a swimming pool, fighting each other over a television, and pushing the television around. Tele-rugby was presented in [[Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro]].

''Tele-rugby'' is filmed underwater with professional swimmers. Despite what the title may suggest Tele-rugby is not about a sports match but it is about a love and hate relationship with media and especially TV. It depicts the fight for the screen in a new environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7134">The '''Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art''' ('''ICAA'''), founded as two separate nonprofit organizations - ''The Institute of Classical Architecture'' and ''Classical America'' in 1991 and 1968, respectively - merged in 2002 as a national organization dedicated to advancing the classical tradition in [[architecture]], [[urbanism]], and their allied arts. It does so through education, publication, awards, and advocacy. Today there are fifteen regional Institute chapters and an international UK affiliate that together extend this unique public service.

The organization is a valued educational resource for students of art, planning, and architecture; for design professionals; and for the general public. It offers a wide array of programs including continuing education classes, travel programs, lectures, salons, and conferences. It publishes an academic journal called [http://www.classicist.org/publications-and-bookshop/the-classicist/ ''The Classicist''] as well as the acclaimed book series, the [http://www.classicist.org/publications-and-bookshop/classical-america-series-in-art-and-architecture/ ''Classical America Series in Art and Architecture'']. The [[Grand Central Academy of Art]] flourishes as the ICAA’s division of fine arts pedagogy, while the [[Beaux-Arts Atelier]] welcomes students of classical architecture and design.

Partnerships with non-architect, building, and residential designers via the American Institute of Building Design as well as [[Habitat for Humanity International]] bring the traditional design skills sustained and disseminated by the Institute to bear in diverse communities across America. An official Institute blog offers a further voice for advocacy.

Awarded annually, the Arthur Ross Awards are an increasingly recognized awards program administered by the Institute that honors excellence in the classical tradition, be it in practice, scholarship, or patronage. The first awards were presented by [[Brooke Astor]] in 1982. The Institute additionally offers two affiliated fellowships at the [[American Academy in Rome]] to advance the career of the architect or artist recipient and to foster a continuity of knowledge of the classical tradition as a vital aspect of contemporary culture around the globe.

==Academic Programs==
The Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art (ICAA) is the leading national nonprofit educational organization dedicated to advancing the practice and appreciation of the classical tradition in architecture, urbanism, and the allied arts. Under the heading “Academic Programs” the ICAA has developed a wide variety of course offerings, including studio-based seminars, lectures and travel tours. By adapting course content and crafting delivery methods to meet the educational needs of a diverse body of learners, the ICAA has pioneered an ecumenical curriculum model aimed to educate all individuals interested in mastering the language of classical design.

==Prizes and Scholarships==
The ICAA offers two bi-annual prizes, [[The Rieger Graham Prize]] for architecture and the [[Alma Schapiro Prize]] for fine artists. The prizes alternate years and grant the recipient a three-month Fellowship at the [[American Academy in Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicist.org/awards-and-prizes/alma-schapiro-prize/application/|title=Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art — Awards &amp; Prizes|last=America|first=Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Classical|website=www.classicist.org|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the ICAA also awards the [[Stanford White Awards]] for "excellence in classical and traditional design".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicist.org/awards-and-prizes/stanford-white-awards/ Stanford White Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other awards and prizes of the ICAA include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicist.org/awards-and-prizes/ Awards and Prizes of the ICAA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Programs==
[[File:Wall of books.jpg|alt=Looking up at rows of bookcases|thumb|Bookcases at New York office]]

In addition to training professionals and students, the ICAA also serves the general public audience and professional audience through its public lectures, walking tours, travel programs and special events. Offered throughout the year, activities include a Member Lecture Program, often free of charge to members and often in collaboration with like-minded organizations; and Discover Classical New York, which takes members on walking tours to visit classical or traditional sites in the five boroughs and beyond.

Other signature programs include the annual The McKim Lecture with the [[One West 54th Street Foundation]] and the Summer Lecture Series. Special events include the Arthur Ross Awards, which celebrate excellence in the classical tradition, and the bi-annual Holiday Benefit Auction, as well as occasional salon-style gatherings.

The ICAA Chapters offer a wide range of comparable programs themed and tied geographically to their respective regions.

==Publications==
Publications play a large role in the mission of the ICAA and are overseen by the Publications Committee, an active volunteer group made up of ICAA board members, staff, Fellows, and members of the Council of Advisors. The committee regularly reviews re-printing possibilities for texts that are no longer available, as well as proposals for new books to be included in the “Classical America Series in Art and Architecture”. This important series is a legacy from [[Classical America]] which the ICAA now vigorously maintains today. The budget each year includes grant subsidies for either authors or publishers selected to be part of the series.

'''Third-party technique''' is a marketing strategy employed by [[public relations]] (PR) firms, that involves placing a premeditated message in the "mouth of the media." Third-party technique can take many forms, ranging from the hiring of journalists to report the organization in a favorable light, to using scientists within the organization to present their perhaps prejudicial findings to the public.

Industry-sponsored groups used to relay these findings to the public are known as [[front groups]].  These groups claim to represent the general public’s agenda, when in reality they are facilitating the hidden interests of the organizations that are sponsoring them.  Also related are [[Astroturfing|astroturf groups]], which are groups that have been formed by the industry, yet appear to have been formed by ordinary citizens.

[[Edward Bernays]], the “father of public relation,” is also said to be the founder of using front groups as [[marketing]] techniques.  Bernays qualified the use of a reputable and prominent sponsoring groups in the statement, “The most useful method in a multiple society like ours to indicate the support of an idea of the many varied elements that make up our society. Opinion leaders and group leaders have an effect in a democracy and stand as symbols to their constituency."

The recent rise of the use of third-party technique has spurred the creation of groups such as [[PR Watch]], an organization that investigates and combats manipulative and misleading PR messages.
Third-party technique is often found within the drug and [[pharmaceutical industry]]. Journalists that may mistakenly report on these front groups' findings can unknowingly perpetuate the spread of biased information. The result is the perpetual exposure of doctors and patients to these carefully crafted messages.

In defense of the practice of third-party technique, public relations firms often qualify the use of a third-party to report on information as not putting words in the mouth of the media, but simply as mechanisms to display accurate information in a manner that the public will not see as biased towards the organization.  
"Developing third party support and validation for the basic risk messages of the corporation is essential. This support should ideally come from medical authorities, political leaders, union officials, relevant academics, fire and police officials, environmentalists, regulators,” says Amanda Little from the world’s fifth largest PR firm, [[Burson-Marsteller]].

The '''University of Brighton Faculty of Arts''' was an organisational grouping at the University of Brighton centred around the University's origins in the Brighton School of Art, with courses in the creative arts, architecture, design and humanities. At different times it has been known as the '''Faculty of Art and Design''', the '''Faculty of Art and Architecture''' (1999-2009), the '''Faculty of Arts''' (2009-2014), and the '''College of Arts and Humanities''' (2014-2017). In 2017, the College structure was dissolved. At this time the constituent schools became independent units: the School of Architecture and Design, the School of Art, the School of Humanities, and the School of Media.

The Faculty hosted significant design and screen archives, and the [http://www.brighton.ac.uk/adm-hea/index.html Higher Education Academy Subject Centre for Art Design &amp; Media] (ADM HEA). In 2005 it was also recognised as a [[Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning through Design]] (CETLD), bringing together its knowledge and expertise with that of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]; the [[Royal College of Art]] and The [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].

== Organisational structure and name changes ==
Since 1999, the Faculty has undergone a number of changes in organisation:
* Between 1999 and 2009 it was known as the Faculty of Art and Architecture. 
* In 2009 it took the name Faculty of Arts, embracing departments in literature, languages and media, and being organised in three schools: Architecture and Design, Art and Media, and Humanities. 
* In 2012, the Schools of Architecture and Design and Art and Media were merged to form the School of Art, Design and Media. 
* In 2014, the Faculty of Arts became the College of Arts and Humanities as part of a University wide reorganisation. 
* In 2016, the School of Art, Design and Media was split into three schools: the School of Architecture and Design (based at Mouslecoomb), the School of Art (at Grand Parade), and the School of Media (at Edward Street). 
* With the dissolution of the College in 2017, these schools, together with the School of Humanities, became independent organisational units within the University.

== Alumni, staff and associates ==
Brighton Faculty of Arts and Architecture has supported and educated many key figures in the arts. In 2009 an Exhibition, ''From Art School to University: Art and Design at Brighton 1859-2009'', paid tribute to many of them and included [[Turner Prize]] winners, iconic design work, cutting-edge dance for camera and classic rock and pop imagery.
 
Turner Prize winners [[Keith Tyson]] and [[Rachel Whiteread]] studied there, as did artists [[Alison Lapper]], [[Keith Coventry]], [[Sylvia Sleigh]], designer [[Julien Macdonald]] and writer-illustrator [[Emily Gravett]]. 

Students, lecturers and researchers once at Brighton includes sculptor [[Anthony Gormley]], Kate Greenaway Medal winners [[Emily Gravett]], [[Raymond Briggs]] and [[Quentin Blake]]; artist [[Mike Chaplin]]; children's writer-illustrator [[Lucy Cousins]]; Magnum photographer [[Mark Power]]; fashion designers [[Barbara Hulanicki]] and [[Julien Macdonald]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2004/041103fashionaward.php?PageId=824&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributions made to modern visual culture by Brighton Faculty of Arts and Architecture members include Royal Designer for Industry [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]]'s cover designs for [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', and several series of Royal Mail stamps, and [[John Vernon Lord]]'s sleeve for [[Deep Purple]]'s ''Book of Taliesyn''.

The longer history of the school of art in Brighton includes artists [[Conrad Heighton Leigh]] and [[Helen Chadwick]], and poster designer [[John Bellany]].

== History ==
=== 19th century, Brighton School of Art ===
Ideas for the establishment of a School of Art in [[Brighton]] resulted from a public meeting in 1858 which led to the formation of a Committee to raise subscriptions and donations. The Committee sought to “instruct working people to do their work better by turning it out of hand neatly and handsomely as well as usefully, and thus enable them to command the best price for their labour, and to compete more successfully with the foreign workman”.&lt;ref&gt;"The Royal Visit to Brighton. Inauguration of the New School for Science and Art", ''Sussex Daily News'', 3 February 1877&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the art schools that had been established in Britain by the 1840s and 1850s were linked to local and regional industries. Brighton was not an industrial centre in the most obvious sense but, according to [[Henry Cole]] her "industries" were "health, recreation, education and pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;see Elizabeth Bonython and Anthony Burton, ''The Great Exhibitor: The Life and Work of Henry Cole'', London: V &amp; A, 2003. See also Louise Purbrick, "Building the house of Henry Cole", in Marcia Pointon (ed) ''Art apart: art institutions and ideology across England and North America'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 17 January 1859 Brighton School of Art opened its doors to more than fifty pupils and was situated in a room off the [[Royal Pavilion]] Kitchen provided by the Town Council. The first Art Master was John White, who brought with him experience of a similar post at Leeds School of Practical Art and ran classes for several different constituencies: those of independent means who attended the Day Classes and were segregated by gender; artisans who were provided with evening classes at a low fee rate; and teachers, for whom fees were lower still.

New premises for Brighton School of Science and Art were purpose-built in Grand Parade, Brighton, in 1877, in a [[Romanesque Revival]] style, with the façade in brick with [[Bath stone]] coping and cornices. The columns flanking the main entrance were in polished red granite, and the façade enriched by a series of terracotta panels and lunettes that had been designed by the Art Master Alexander Fisher, and executed by Messrs Johnson at the nearby [[Ditchling]] Pottery Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;The two main panels and a small number of lunettes were saved when the building was demolished in the 1960s and are on public view in the current Grand Parade Campus.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll]], the most artistic of [[Queen Victoria]]’s children, and an accomplished sculptor in her own right, was present, as was Victorian art educational tsar, Sir [[Henry Cole]].

=== 20th century ===
As a result of new openings for local authorities, a new Municipal School of Science and Technology, designed by F C May, the Borough Surveyor and Engineer, was opened on 20 September 1897.  This allowed for an expansion of activities in the School in Grand Parade. At Brighton before [[World War I]], the portfolio of courses at the School of Art included [[typography]], [[silversmithing]], jewellery, leatherwork, woodcarving, [[embroidery]] and lace making.

In 1915, the [[Design and Industries Association]] (DIA) was established, a national non government-funded organisation that set out to establish stronger relationships between British designers and manufacturers. The Head Master at Brighton, William H Bond, played an important role in promoting the aims of the DIA in the town, explaining how Britain lagged behind her competitors such as Germany and America, claiming that the typographer "[[Edward Johnston]]  was far better known in Germany than he was in England five years ago".&lt;ref&gt;‘Design in Manufacture: At Upheld by Commerce, ''[[Brighton Herald]]'' 13 October 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;  During World War I the School of Art provided opportunities for a number of disabled soldiers at the Brighton Pavilion Hospital, offering training for such occupations as letter cutting in wood and stone, mechanical draughtsmanship, die-cutting and other related subjects that required instruction in [[industrial arts]]. Bond was also concerned with the appearance of Brighton, reacting negatively to many aspects of the urban environment, a theme that a number of his British arts and crafts antecedents such as John Ruskin and William Morris had pursued with zeal. Bond complained about the ‘gruesome horror’ of the New England Road railway arch and commented on plans to render it an ‘attractive entrance to the town’.  He also argued for the preservation of the ‘distinctive soul’ of Georgian Brighton (cf [[Georgian Architecture]])and that the Town Council should desist from painting the Royal Pavilion ‘[[workhouse]] yellow’ as it represented the ‘last despairing cry of colour on its deathbed, and in its raucous tones some devilish influences might be traced’.&lt;ref&gt;‘How to Beautify Brighton”, ''[[Brighton Herald]]'', 30 March 1918&lt;/ref&gt; 
The work of Brighton School of Art performed well in the international arena. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that at the 1925 Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]], it received a Diploma of Honour for technical instruction, a Gold Medal for technical instruction in ceramics, and Silver Medals for technical instruction in textiles and metal.

Mural art was a field in which Brighton staff were widely recognised, bringing together the fine arts and interior design. A notable example of this was seen in the interiors of the Regent Cinema, Brighton, which included murals by Lawrence Preston of Brighton School of Art and Walter Bayes, Head of the Westminster School of Art. Lawrence Preston’s other mural schemes included his First World War mural at St Luke’s School, Brighton, restored in 2007 after a £30,000 fund-raising campaign. Dorothy Sawyers, another member of staff at the School was also widely known as a muralist who worked on cinema schemes.

Following the appointment in 1934 of E A Sallis Benney as its Principal, Brighton School of Art became involved with presenting its own fresh, modern and international profile. While, during [[World War II]], the School of Art was able to demonstrate its usefulness to the wider community through involvement with the [[propaganda]] campaigns, in which the Women’s Crafts Department provided a particular focus, especially in the ‘Make Do and Mend’ ethos following the introduction of clothes [[rationing in the United Kingdom]] in 1941.

Brighton College of Art did not have specific industrial links in the way that was the case with similar educational organisations in [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]].  Nonetheless, in the 1950s it was well placed to provide expertise in commercial and industrial design and worked with industry through a number of Advisory Committees alongside local, regional and national arts associations.  Such activities found their applications in the development of the curriculum.  For example, in 1951, the first cohort of students completed the National Retail Association of Furniture Retailers Diploma, launched at the College in 1949 as the first such course outside London

=== Polytechnic ===

Following the 1963 [[Robbins Report]] on Higher Education and the White Paper, 'A Plan for Polytechnics', there emerged proposals for Brighton Polytechnic, along with Brighton College of Technology. Brighton’s Education Committee took the view that the Brighton College of Art should be preserved as a specialist institution of art and design. However, despite the uneasy accommodation of different standpoints at Brighton, the wider national campaigns against the absorption of art colleges into polytechnics continued into the 1970s, an outlook typified by painter [[Patrick Heron]]'s article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in October 1971, entitled "Murder in the Art Schools". 

The Town Council decided to employ the municipal architect, Percy Billington, for the new building, rejecting the Education Committee’s earlier enquiries into the possibility of bringing in outside architects sympathetic to the [[Regency architecture|Regency style]]. Considerable local anger had been expressed about the possibility of demolishing a Grade II-listed terrace of Regency houses ignoring the advice of the Royal Fine Art Commission. Michael Viney, however, described it: “Decisively modern and pseudo anything, the building nonetheless makes gradual easy transition from the Regency bow-fronts adjacent in Grand Parade to the sharper, cleaner, more functional lines of 1958.”  

From its earliest days Brighton School of Art (and successors) has maintained involved with the town and regional community, whether in such areas as the annual displays of student work or close relationship with many of the trades in the town. On a wider cultural front staff and students’ participation in public performances began in the 1860s and constantly punctuated its history, whether the Carnivals and  ‘Vision of Empire’ for Empire Week in the 1920s, innovative performance and ‘live art’ at the Zap Club in the 1980s, or a wide variety of more recent manifestations such as ‘Dance for Camera’ and ‘Smudged’ at Tate Modern led by Alice Fox.

The Art College Basement Club was an important catalyst in the development of live and performing arts at Brighton. It hosted a wide range of performances, such as those associated with the innovative Brighton Contemporary Festival Arts (1977–79) organised by Roger Ely and Neil Butler. Dave Reeves, with Butler, was one of the founding directors of [[the Zap]] Club.

A fresh diet of courses and innovations were rolled out during Robin Plummer’s headship. During this period the range of courses included Fashion &amp; Textiles with Administration, Graphic Design &amp; Illustration, Expressive Arts (including music, dance, performance, theatre and visual studies) and History of Design, with the development of a number of postgraduate courses including Printmaking and Narrative and Sequential Illustration. A new Department of Art History was formed and headed by Robert Haynes in 1977. David Vaughan was appointed as course leader for the BA (Hons) Wood, Metal, Ceramics and Plastics degree in 1979, later becoming head of the department of Three Dimensional Design. Another key appointment made in these years was that of Bill Beech who was appointed as the head of the department of Fine Art following the retirement of Gwyther Irwin in 1984. In September 1986 the Department of Humanities joined the Faculty thereby setting in place the opportunity to develop fresh curricular initiatives.

=== Research Development ===
Robin Plummer was quick to see the importance of research for art and design, arguing for it nationally and implementing it locally, notably in the Brighton Design History: Fad or Function? Conference in 1977.  Evelyn Goldsmith’s PhD, completed in 1978, led to her book entitled Research into illustration: an approach and a review, published by Cambridge University Press in 1984. The merging of the Polytechnic with the Brighton College of Education in 1976 resulted in the transfer of the Department of Art Education to the Polytechnic’s newly created Faculty of Education, long a distinctive aspect of the School of Art in its rite of passage from School of Art to Faculty of Art &amp; Design.  However, a number of academics specialising in the visual and performing arts joined the Faculty of Art and Design. This in turn led to the formation of a new Department of Combined Arts under the leadership of Peter Rose.  Despite some misgivings on the part of a number of practitioners in the more established disciplinary fields in the Faculty, this proved to be a dynamic, challenging and highly productive initiative, with Liz Aggiss and Billy Cowie playing key roles.

=== New University ===
A number of highly significant steps have been taken at Brighton since the 1960s, sustained by enhanced and developing intellectual and material resources.  These include the establishment of Screen Archive South East, the Design Archives and the establishment of the Centre for Research &amp; Development; the hosting of the CTI (Computers in Teaching Initiative) Centre for Art and Design, the [[Brighton Photo Biennial]], Cinecity and the National Subject Centre for Learning &amp; Teaching in Art, Design &amp; Communications and its successor, the Higher Education Academy: Art, Design Media Subject Centre, and the establishment of the Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning through Design (CETLD). Many other networks, national and international, formal and informal have also been set in place

The institution’s re-designation as the University of Brighton in 1992, with Professor David Watson as Vice-Chancellor, resulted in a number of fresh opportunities. Since 1992 there has been a discernible change in the ways in which the Faculty views itself and how the rest of the University, in turn, sees it. Success in art and design in the first round of the RAE which the University was able to enter confirmed two lingering prejudices: from the art and design perspective, there was still an aura of the notion of excellence as something that had been known since pre-polytechnic, independent art college days; from the standpoint of some other parts of the university there was still a lingering view that it was somehow easier for art and design to achieve academic and research success.

In 2009 plans to expand the Faculty came to fruition. From elsewhere in the University, departments of English language and literature, media, linguistics and modern languages became included under the new Faculty of Arts, reinforcing the long-established academic work of the 'Art School' in historical and critical studies, communication and media.

'''Yitzchok Moully''' is an [[Australian]]-[[Americans|American]], [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi and artist associated with the [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement and is known for his "Chasidic Pop Art" painting style. Moully serves as a Chabad emissary (''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shaliach]]'') in [[Basking Ridge, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=mishpop&gt;Bensoussan, Barbara. "True Color." ''Mishpacha Magazine''. July 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mishpop1&gt;[http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=20827&amp;alias=pop-artist-chossid-shliach "Pop Artist, Chossid, Shliach."] ''COLlive.com''. July 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=algepop&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/author/yitzchak-moully/ "Yitzchok Moully."] ''The Algemeiner Journal''. Accessed December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moully's combination of rabbinic work and art is expressed in a piece "Orange Socks."
The piece, according to Moully, contrasts what people think of as a homogeneous Chassidic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wischusen |first1=Phreddy |title=‘Under the Black Hat’ Pop Art in Jerusalem Focuses on Chassidim - Rabbi Yitzchok Moully brings spiritual and emotional depth to a new exhibit |url=https://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/3824604/jewish/Under-the-Black-Hat-Pop-Art-in-Jerusalem-Focuses-on-Chassidim.htm |website=www.chabad.org |accessdate=October 29, 2018 |language=en |date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Yitzchok Moully was born in 1979&lt;ref name=forpop/&gt; in [[Queensland, Australia]] but moved to [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] at the age of three. At the age of five, Moully and his mother moved to [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn]] and joined the Chabad community there. Moully later studied at Chabad yeshivoth, married, and became the assistant rabbi at the Chabad Jewish Center of Basking Ridge, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=mishpop/&gt;

==Art==
Moully has produced works by using the silkscreen process; his art contrasts strong Jewish and Chasidic images with vibrant bold colors creating what he describes as "Chassidic Pop Art."&lt;ref name=algepop/&gt; Moully uses color and styles similar to the work of [[Andy Warhol]], using popular images from Jewish Chasidic culture including [[dreidels]], [[Kiddush]] cups and praying rabbis.&lt;ref name=forpop&gt;Trappler-Spielman, Sara. [http://www.forward.com/articles/12739/hasidic-rabbi-by-day-pop-artist-by-night-/ Hasidic Rabbi by Day, Pop Artist by Night."] ''The Jewish Daily Forward''. Wednesday, February 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Moully also works in abstract art, and has been heavily influenced by artists such as by the French Canadian artist Jean Pierre Lafrance &lt;ref&gt;Peter Kharmandarian [http://www.artonthebanks.com/2015/05/interviews-the-pop-art-rabbi-yitzchok-moully/ Interview: The Pop Art Rabbi – Yitzchok Moully]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Moully began exhibiting his art in galleries and community centers in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Currently, his work is on exhibit at the gallery [[ArtisZen Arts]] in [[Lambertville, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=forpop/&gt;

==The Creative Soul==
Moully founded a network of Orthodox Jewish artists called "The Creative Soul."&lt;ref name=mishpop/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trappler-Spielman, Sara.

April 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Creative Soul has organized an annual exhibition in Crown Heights during the Jewish holiday of [[Sukkot]]. The exhibition has included submissions from local Chabad artists including Yitzchok Moully and [[Michoel Muchnik]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crownheights.info/psa/47250/chassidic-artists-to-participate-in-group-art-show/ "Chassidic artists to participate in group art show."] ''CrownHeights.info''.
