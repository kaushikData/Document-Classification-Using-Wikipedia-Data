==Ramy Brooks incident==
[[Image:Ramy Brooks 0045 crop.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|Ramy Brooks at the [[2006 Iditarod]]]]

Witnesses said they saw [[Ramy Brooks]] punch and kick some of his dogs and hit them with a ski pole when they refused to leave a checkpoint during a March 15, 2007 stage in [[Golovin, Alaska]], less than {{convert|100|mi|km}} from the finish in [[Nome, Alaska]]. Brooks denies the more serious allegations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7193806.html KOMOTV.com: Iditarod awaits dog abuse report]&lt;/ref&gt; but acknowledged "spanking" the dogs in his team with a trail marking lathe. One of Brooks' dogs died the day after the incident, but a [[necropsy]] could not determine why the dog died and race officials said there was no evidence that Brooks was to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.heraldnewsdaily.com/stories/index.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=103332 |title=Herald News Daily: Iditarod organizers hear abuse testimony |access-date=2007-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203300/http://www.heraldnewsdaily.com/stories/index.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=103332 |archive-date=2007-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 2007, the judges voted unanimously to disqualify Brooks from the 2007 Iditarod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://iditarod.com/press/release/pressrelease_370.html |title=Iditarod XXXV Media Advisory |access-date=2007-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329051935/http://www.iditarod.com/press/release/pressrelease_370.html |archive-date=2007-03-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shane Goosen]] who has taken part in the Iditarod three times, told the Iditarod board that during the [[Tustumena 200]] Sled Dog Race in January 2007 five people said they saw Brooks kick, hit and drag his dogs and that "There is no doubt in my mind that he beat his dogs" and "It took three days to disqualify this guy, there went the credibility of the Iditarod right there — it's gone", said Goosen. [[Bud Smyth]], a former race marshal and Iditarod musher, criticized race officials, saying the Iditarod officials were slow to interview and tape record witnesses. Musher [[Perry Solmonson]] stated "It is just a sad situation, I hope as a board you will have some integrity and do what is necessary for the dogs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,269044,00.html Fox News: Iditarod Organizers Hear Testimony of Alleged Dog Abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chas St. George]], the Director of Public Relations, stated "If you are, by Alaska state statute,
convicted of animal abuse or cruelty, then you are not allowed to enter this race."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktva.com/topstory/ci_5768264 KTVA News: Ramy Brooks Investigation; alleged Iditarod abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iditarod Trail Committee President, [[Richard Burmeister]] announced on April 26, 2007, that the ongoing independent investigation being conducted by the [[Anchorage, Alaska]] law firm of [[Davis Wright Tremaine]] is not yet complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iditarod.com/2007/dailyarchives/story_413.html Iditarod: Independent Investigation Continues]&lt;/ref&gt; Race officials are hoping the report will be ready for the board of directors meeting on April 26, 2007. [[Stan Hooley]] said it is unlikely the board will make an immediate decision on consequences ranging from doing nothing to a lifetime ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/sports/story/3951728p-4563863c.html The Winnipeg Free Press: Iditarod awaits dog abuse report concerning allegations from last race]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2007, the Iditarod Trail Committee Board of Directors announced that they had suspended [[Ramy Brooks]] for abusing his sled dogs.  The suspension was for the 2008 and 2009 races, and following that Brooks was put on probation for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktva.com/topstory/ci_5930449 KTVA: Ramy Brooks Decision] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927084239/http://www.ktva.com/topstory/ci_5930449 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–2012 Sinaloa massacres===
As a response for the killings in Veracruz, [[Los Zetas]] carried out an incursion to the state of Sinaloa on 23 November 2011 and left 26 bodies — 16 of them burned to death — in several abandoned vehicles in [[Sinaloa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico Security Memo: Los Zetas Strike in Sinaloa Territory|url=http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/mexico-security-memo-los-zetas-strike-sinaloa-territory|publisher=[[Stratfor]]|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news|title=Las autoridades de Sinaloa localizan 23 cadáveres en tres municipios|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/11/23/las-autoridades-de-sinaloa-localizan-20-cadaveres-en-dos-municipios|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=CNN Mexico|date=23 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123204241/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/11/23/las-autoridades-de-sinaloa-localizan-20-cadaveres-en-dos-municipios|archive-date=2011-11-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident began at early hours of the morning in [[Culiacán]], [[Sinaloa]] with the discovery of a vehicle on fire.&lt;ref name=26sinaloa&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news|title=26 muertos en Sinaloa; 16 fueron calcinados|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/811193.html|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the police forces managed to put down the flames, they found inside the vehicle a dozen of bodies burned to death, and with wood remains on top of them.

In the afternoon of November 21, 2016, a [[school bus]] in [[Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]], rolled over onto its passenger side and became wrapped around a tree. There were fatalities and injuries.  The incident took place in the city's Brainerd neighborhood on Talley Road, which officials described as a "narrow, winding road". The bus, operated by [[Durham School Services]],&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; was transporting children from Woodmore Elementary School.&lt;ref name="ABCNews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kids Who Died in Chattanooga School Bus Crash Include 3 Fourth-Graders|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/kids-killed-chattanooga-school-bus-crash-include-fourth/story?id=43702930|last1=Hayden|first1=Michael Edison | last2=Gallagher| first2=J.J.| last3=Liddy|first3=Tom|last4=Cook|first4=Jeffrey|website=abcnews.go.com|publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures|date=November 22, 2016|access-date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRCB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Ken|title=Driver charged in deadly Talley Road school bus crash|url=http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/33763627/update-driver-charged-in-deadly-talley-road-school-bus-crash|website=wrcbtv.com|publisher=WRCB-TV|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bus was transporting 37 children. Five of the children died at the scene of the crash. 23 children were hospitalized, six of them in critical condition.  A sixth child died two days later.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/us/tennessee-chattanooga-school-bus-accident/index.html|title=6 dead in Tennessee school bus crash| last1=Sterling| first1=Joe| last2=Simon| first2=Darran| website=cnn.com| publisher=Cable News Network|date=November 21, 2016|access-date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WBIR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbir.com/news/local/authorities-investigate-chattanooga-school-bus-crash/354658853|title=Bus driver charged with vehicular manslaughter in Chattanooga bus crash|last=(staff writer)|date=November 21, 2016|website=wbir.com|publisher=WBIR-TV|language=en-US|access-date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KRQE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drugs, alcohol not involved in bus crash; 6th child dies| url=http://krqe.com/2016/11/23/drugs-alcohol-not-involved-in-bus-crash-6th-child-dies/|website=krqe.com| publisher=LIN Television|last=Associated Press|date=November 23, 2016|access-date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The cause of the crash is under investigation, but officials believe that the speed of the bus might have been a contributing factor. On the day after the crash, a spokesman for the Chattanooga police department reported that drugs and alcohol were not factors. According to [[CBS News]] correspondent Mark Strassmann, the mother of three children on the bus, including one who died, stated that her surviving children told her that Walker asked if they were "ready to die" immediately before the crash. Chattanooga police disputed the accuracy of this claim.&lt;ref name="KRQE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driver Asked Kids 'Are You Ready to Die' Before Crashing Bus in Chattanooga| url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2016/11/22/report-driver-asked-kids-are-you-ready-to-die-before-crashing-bus-in-chattanooga/|website=detroit.cbslocal.com|publisher=CBS Local Media|last=(staff writer)|date=November 22, 2016|access-date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chattanooga Officers testified during the 2016 hearing that the school bus traveled between 48 and 52 mph, in a 30 mph zone. Students had previously complained about Walker's quality of driving and the private company that he was employed under, Durham School Services, had a history of traffic accidents in Tennessee.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2018/02/26/chattanooga-school-bus-crash-what-know-trial-gets-underway/374499002/|title=Deadly Chattanooga school bus crash: What to know as trial gets underway|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
[[File:Chattanooga School Bus Crash Press Conference (31184885515).jpg|thumb|NTSB briefing]]
Johnthony K. Walker, the driver, was arrested and charged with six counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment, and reckless driving.&lt;ref name="ABCNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WBIR" /&gt; On March 1, 2018, Walker was convicted of six counts of criminally negligent homicide, 11 counts of reckless aggravated assault, seven counts of assault, reckless endangerment, reckless driving and using his phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/crime/bus-driver-found-guilty-of-criminally-negligent-homicide-in-crash-that-killed-6-kids/51-524203588|title=Bus driver found guilty of criminally negligent homicide in crash that killed 6 kids|work=wbir.com|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition a Hamilton County Criminal Court jury convicted Walker of lesser charges for the crash. He was sentenced to four years in prison, but went free on bail pending an appeal. In June 2018, while still free on bail pending an appeal of the bus crash charges, Walker was arrested for raping a 14-year-old girl at a home where he was staying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2018/06/14/driver-2016-chattanooga-bus-crash-charged-rape-nashville/704263002/ |title=Johnthony K.

'''All Together''' was a series of two [[professional wrestling]] events organized together by [[Japan]]'s three biggest [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]]; [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]], in response to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. The first event was held in [[Tokyo]] on August 27, 2011, and the second in [[Sendai]] on February 19, 2012. All proceeds from the events were donated to [[Japanese Red Cross]]. The events featured no [[Narrative thread|storylines]] or [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship]] matches, instead they were [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] as "[[Card (sports)#Supercard|supercards]]", putting together combinations of wrestlers from the three promotions that fans would normally not see.

The '''Amsterdam Film eXperience''', or AFX for short, is an annual filmfestival that takes place in [[Amsterdam]]. It's being organized by the AISFF (Amsterdam International Short Film Festival). AISFF used to be the name of the festival itself, but the organization decided to focus less on short film and more on the broader experience of film in all its forms, hence Amsterdam Film '''eXperience'''.

Even though AFX is [[Amsterdam]](NL)-based, the focus of the festival is mainly international. The organization of AFX consists of a varied group of people with different cultural, educational and professional backgrounds. All team members hold full-time jobs or study next to their work for the festival. Apart from the AFX core-team, the festival is made possible every year with the help of volunteers.

== The beginning ==
The first edition of AFX took place from 6 to 8 October 2006 at the old part of Het Ketelhuis (also called 'Openbare Verlichting') in [[Amsterdam]], The Netherlands. During this first edition short films were shown in six different categories of competition:
#Experimental Documentary
#Guerilla Techniques
#Sound &amp; Vision
#Narrative Time Space Continuum
#Buzz Clicks &amp; Visual Chaos: New Directions
#Crossover Animation.

Each film that ran in competition could win one of the four awards. The following four films eventually won the prizes:

:*'''''Tyger''''' (Guilherme Marcondes, Brazilië 2006)       –  ''Best in Show''
:*'''''Spin''''' (Jamin Winans, Verenigde Staten 2005)       –  ''People's Choice''
:*'''''[[Metalosis Maligna]]''''' (Floris Kaayk, Nederland 2006) –  ''Jameson-Award'' (sponsor-award)
:*'''''Kapitaal''''' (Thom Snels, Nederland 2005)            –  ''Breaking Out of the Frame-Award'' (jury-prize)

There were also films shown out of competition, some names of filmmakers running out of competition are Rosto A. D., [[Chris Cunningham]] and [[Virgil Widrich]]. They collaborated with other international filmfestivals, which resulted mainly in exchanging parts of the program and cross-promotion. Also, there was a special kids-program.

According to AFX, the festival concerns itself not just with film, but with the broader experience of everything that has in any way to do with film. They hope to accomplish this by having a strong supporting program consisting of (video-, art-, media-)installations, workshops (e.g. Florian Thalhofer), lectures en interactive content (e.g. 15x15).

== AFX'07 ==
Between 2 and 4 November 2007, the festival was held at [[Het Ketelhuis]], now in their new setting which counts three filmscreens. Also, the area around the cinema, which lies on the '[[Westergasfabriek]]'-terrain, will be actively used for the festival. The organization hopes to offer a bigger, broader and even more compelling festival in 2007.

'''''April Rhapsody''''' is a 2000 TV series written by [[Wang Hui-ling]], based on the romantic life of [[Xu Zhimo]], one of China's most renowned poets in the 20th century.

Virtually all characters in the story are historical, but the plot deviates from history somewhat. After the series' broadcast, historian [[Liang Congjie]] blasted the show and denied his mother [[Lin Huiyin]]'s relationship with Xu was anything other than platonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.gmw.cn/01ds/2000-05/10/GB/2000%5E299%5E0%5EDS506.htm 梁从诫直言：电视剧《人间四月天》是对历史事实和文化精神的双重歪曲]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Barnum''''' is an American musical with a book by [[Mark Bramble]], lyrics by [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]], and music by [[Cy Coleman]].  It is based on the life of showman [[P. T. Barnum]], covering the period from 1835 through 1880 in America and major cities of the world where Barnum took his performing companies.  The production combines elements of traditional musical theater with the spectacle of the [[circus]].  The characters include [[juggler]]s, [[trapeze]] artists and [[clown]]s, as well as such real-life personalities as [[Jenny Lind]] and [[General Tom Thumb]].

The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production ran for 854 performances and was followed by a London production, among others.

==Synopsis==
In the middle of the 19th century, Phineas Taylor (P.T.) Barnum introduces his circus acts as he stands in front of a tent, proclaiming "There Is a Sucker Born Ev'ry Minute". He loves spectacle and excitement, using hype and "humbug" to promote his exhibits. His wife Charity disagrees with his use of "humbug" but loves him and aims to keep him grounded. Barnum then introduces the oldest woman alive, [[Joice Heth]], and thanks to some Barnum humbug she becomes a success ("Thank God I'm Old"). His wife Charity ("Chairy") urges him to get a job in a factory, but Barnum refuses ("The Colors of My Life [Part One]") and Charity wryly admits and accepts the disparity between their views ("The Colors of My Life [Part Two]"). Barnum enlists clowns to help in building a museum to house his attractions (with expected comical results) and it's up to Charity to encourage him to keep going ("One Brick at a Time"), with the result that "everything about [his] museum was spectacular" ("Museum Song"); however, the museum burns down accidentally. Barnum finds two new star attractions, [[General Tom Thumb|Tom Thumb]], who appears to advise that "Bigger Isn't Better", and [[Jumbo|Jumbo the elephant]]. Barnum then becomes manager of the famous Swedish opera singer [[Jenny Lind]] ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All"). Barnum becomes enamored of her and sees the attraction of going on tour with her ("Out There"). He accompanies Jenny on tour, leaving Charity behind, as a marching band greets them ("Come Follow the Band"). Although all seems to be going well for Barnum, he finds that without Charity in his life he is miserable, and he decides to break ties with Jenny and return home to the woman he loves ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All [Reprise]"). Upon his return to Charity, he promises to live the more sedate life she desires for him, in "Black and White." After a failed stint running a clockworks factory and a failed attempt to build his own city, he turns to politics; when his campaign looks doomed to fail due to lack of interest, Charity realizes how important his talents and passion are in his life and allows him to inject color and life into his campaign. He is elected Mayor of Bridgeport, and the two of them recognize the value in each other's approach to life and how they complement one another ("The Colors of My Life [Reprise]"). Barnum is prepared to run for Senator, but his beloved Charity dies suddenly, leaving Barnum bereft and alone. When Barnum finds himself cheated of the Senatortial nomination by his political party, he laments his position, realizes that his talent for Humbug will never leave him and wishes to "make it right, shoot a rocket, shine a light" ("Prince of Humbug"). [[James Anthony Bailey]] arrives and offers him the chance to "Join the Circus". Initially resisting, he relents (thanks in part to Charity's two-headed coin, which she has used to humbug him throughout the show) and joins Bailey, and they form the famous [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|circus Barnum and Bailey]].

In "a princely final attraction", Barnum appears before the audience ("The Final Event: There is a Sucker Born Ev'ry Minute" [Reprise]") and reflects on his past:

{{quote|"Of course, that was a long time ago...and Joice Heth is gone and forgotten. And so's the American Museum...and the Living Whale...and Jennie Lind...and my poor Tom Thumb. And them reubens that came over on the ''Mayflower'' have gone to dust...and Tom Jefferson's a memory...and old Franklin's flown his last kite.  So my kind of Humbug's disappeared. Pity."}}

==Productions==
===Original Broadway Production===
The original production opened at the [[St. James Theatre]] on Broadway, on April 30, 1980, and closed on May 16, 1982, after 854 performances and 26 previews. It was directed and choreographed by [[Joe Layton]], with scenic design by David Mitchell, costume design by [[Theoni V. Aldredge]], and lighting design by Craig Miller. The musical starred [[Jim Dale]] as P.T. Barnum, [[Glenn Close]] as Charity Barnum, Marianne Tatum as Jenny Lind, [[Terri White]] as Joice Heth, and [[Terrence Mann]] as Chester Lyman (he also understudied Dale as Barnum). During Jim Dale's vacation in May 1981, the part of Barnum was played by [[Tony Orlando]], and when Dale left the production in October 1981, [[Mike Burstyn]] assumed the role for the remainder of the show's run.

===Original London Production===
The show made its [[West End theatre|West End]] debut on June 11, 1981, at the [[London Palladium]], where it ran for 655 performances. The London cast included [[Michael Crawford]] as P.T. Barnum, [[Deborah Grant]] as Charity Barnum and [[Sarah Payne (actress)|Sarah Payne]] as Jenny Lind. Crawford reprised his role opposite Eileen Battye in a UK Tour of the show which ran between 1984 and 1986, stopping off at various venues including the [[Manchester Opera House]] and a West End revival at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. The tour was recorded for television and broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 1986. It was later released on VHS and DVD.

There was a further revival in London at the Dominion Theatre, starring [[Paul Nicholas]] and another in a circus tent in Battersea Park (where circuses run by David Smart had previously been held) starring ''[[Blue Peter]]'' presenter [[Peter Duncan (actor)|Peter Duncan]].

Two-time [[Tony Award]]-nominee [[Christopher Fitzgerald (actor)|Christopher Fitzgerald]] starred in [[Cameron Mackintosh]]'s new production of the show at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] from 15 July to 31 August 2013. The show was not performed at the Festival Theatre due to its refurbishment. Instead, it was performed in the Theatre in the Park, which is near the Festival Theatre. It was directed by [[Timothy Sheader]], co-directed and choreographed by Liam Steel and co-choreographed by Andrew Wright, set design by [[Scott Pask]], costume design by Paul Wills, lighting design by [[Paule Constable]], sound design by Mick Potter and circus consultancy by Vicki Amedume. Alongside [[Christopher Fitzgerald (actor)|Christopher Fitzgerald]] as P. T. Barnum was [[Tamsin Carroll]] as Charity Barnum, Anna O'Byrne as Jenny Lind, Aretha Ayeh as Joice Heth and Jack North as Tom Thumb.

The production was revised by [[Cameron Mackintosh]] and [[Mark Bramble]] with a new number, "Barnum's Lament", replacing "The Prince of Humbug", slight revisions elsewhere and new orchestrations by [[William David Brohn]].

The national tour of Cameron Mackintosh and Chichester Festival Theatre's production opened at [[Curve (theatre)|Curve, Leicester]] in September 2014 and ran until August 2015. The tour starred [[Brian Conley]] in the title role, alongside [[Linzi Hateley]] as Charity.

=== 2017 London revival ===
The show will receive its first [[London]] revival at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] from 5 December 2017, with previews from 25 November to 3 March 2018. [[Gordon Greenberg]] will direct, with choreography by Rebecca Howell, design by Paul Farnsworth and musical direction by Alex Parker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/barnum-menier-chocolate-factory_44424.html|title=Barnum to receive first major London revival at Menier Chocolate Factory|work=WhatsOnStage.com|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production will star [[Marcus Brigstocke]] in the title role, [[Laura Pitt-Pullford]] as Charity, Celinde Schoenmaker as Jenny Lind, Tupele Dorgu as Joice Heath and Harry Francis as Tom Thumb.

===Other Productions===
[[Stacy Keach]] played Barnum in a June 1981 production at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] with [[Dee Hoty]] as Charity and [[Terri White]] reprising her Broadway role as Joice Heth.

International productions were staged in France (1981) starring Jean-Luc Moreau, Australia (1982) starring [[Reg Livermore]], Madrid (1984) starring [[Emilio Aragón Álvarez|Emilio Aragón]], Florida (2008) starring [[Brad Oscar]].

==Recording==
The Original Broadway Cast recording was released in 1980 and reissued on October 25, 1990, by Sony. The London cast album ''Michael Crawford in Barnum'' was released on January 1, 1994, by Musicrama, Inc.  The original Madrid cast album (starring Emilio Aragón) was released in 1984 by BAT Discos S.A.  Now a collector's item, this Spanish language recording has never been released on CD. A French cast album (ZL 37467) starring [[Jean-Luc Moreau]] was released in 1981; it is unknown at this time if a CD version has been released.

An Australian cast recording was released starring Reg Livermore by RCA Victor.

==Response==
According to Don Wilmeth, ''Barnum'' "was blessed with a brilliant production by director-choreographer Joe Layton, who turned the theatre into a circus, and a memorable performance by Jim Dale."&lt;ref&gt;Wilmeth, Don B. (2000, Volume 3). ''The Cambridge History of American Theatre''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-66959-6}}, p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Hischak wrote: "Joe Layton directed and choreographed with inventive and colorful theatrics, and [Jim] Dale endeared himself to audiences by singing, dancing, walking a tightrope, clowning, and riding a unicycle, most of which had nothing to do with anything. Critics carped but playgoers knew a fun show when they saw one so the show ran for 854 performances."&lt;ref&gt;Hischak, Thomas S. (2008). ''The Oxford Companion to the American Musical''. Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0-19-533533-3}}, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the campaign and '''Battle of Al-Fule''' (in Crusader terms '''La Fève''', Latin '''Castrum Fabe'''), a Crusader force led by [[Guy of Lusignan]] skirmished with [[Saladin]]'s [[Ayyubid]] army for more than a week in September and October 1183. The fighting ended on 6 October with Saladin choosing to withdraw.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=233}}

== Background ==
In May 1182, Saladin invaded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] by way of [[Eilat]], the [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]] and [[Galilee]]. During the summer, he was successfully resisted by King [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]] in the campaign and [[Battle of Belvoir Castle (1182)|Battle of Belvoir Castle]]; however, the Crusader lands were badly damaged by Saracen raiders. By September 1183, Baldwin, crippled by [[leprosy]], could no longer function as monarch. Guy of Lusignan, who had married Baldwin's sister [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]] in 1180, was appointed regent.

== Campaign ==
On August 24, 1183, Saladin returned to Damascus, having conquered [[Halab|Aleppo]] and several cities in [[Mesopotamia]] for his empire. In September, he mounted a major invasion of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Crossing the [[Jordan River]], the Ayyubid host plundered the abandoned town of [[Bet She'an|Baisan]]. Continuing west, up the [[Jezreel Valley]], Saladin established his army near some springs about 8&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Merhavia (kibbutz)|Al-Fule]]. At the same time, the Muslim leader sent out numerous columns to damage as much property as possible. The raiders destroyed the villages of [[Jenin]] and [[Taibe, Galilee|Afrabala]], attacked the monastery on [[Mount Tabor]] and wiped out a contingent from [[Al Karak|Kerak]] that was trying to join the Crusader field army.

Expecting an attack, [[Guy of Lusignan]] mustered the Crusader host at [[Sepphoris|La Sephorie]]. When intelligence reports detected Saladin's invasion route, Guy marched the field army to the small castle of [[Merhavia (kibbutz)|La Fève]] (Al-Fule). His army was swollen by pilgrims and Italian sailors to a size of 1,300–1,500 [[knight]]s, 1,500 [[turcopole]]s and over 15,000 [[infantry]]. This was said to be the largest Latin army assembled "within living memory."&lt;ref&gt;Smail, 1995, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EGLlBWvG-kC&amp;pg=PA155 155]. This is the major source for this article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;c.f. [[William of Tyre]], XXII.27: 'nowhere is it recorded that such large forces of both cavalry and infantry were ever assembled from all parts of the East, nor do aged men remember that forces so well equipped were ever united into one body from a single kingdom'&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=232}}

== Battle ==
The Frankish army advanced in its usual fashion toward the water points at [[Ain Jalut]] (site of a decisive [[Battle of Ain Jalut|Muslim victory]] over the Mongols in 1260) and Tubania (Ain Tuba'un). The exact formation cannot be reconstructed, except that the infantry spearmen and bowmen kept the Turkish horse archers at a respectable distance while the mounted knights launched local charges to drive away any Saracens who approached too closely. Muslim chroniclers mention how Saladin's [[Mamluk]]s led by [[Jorduk an-Nuri]] and [[Jawili]] were faced with an unexpected crusader attack, but they fortified themselves at a base of a mountain and caused the crusaders to retire.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Muslims harassed them with archery and constantly renewed attacks; these were on occasions pressed home to an extent which provoked the Franks to counter-attacks to clear their lines. As in [[Battle of Shaizar (1111)|1111]] and [[Battle of Belvoir Castle (1182)|1182]] the Franks executed a fighting march which never quite became a pitched battle.&lt;ref name="Smail, p 154"&gt;Smail, 1995, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EGLlBWvG-kC&amp;pg=PA154 154]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unable to halt his enemies or to provoke them to fight a pitched battle, Saladin withdrew his army from the springs and moved downstream. The Latin army camped around the springs and remained passive for eight days, refusing battle. The Saracens tried to incite the Franks into an attack while intercepting the Crusaders' supply convoys. Since the local Crusaders brought provisions for only three days while the pilgrims and the sailors brought none, the supply situation soon became critical. By great good luck, the Latin soldiers found quantities of fish at Ain Tuba'un and this prevented them from starving until some food convoys got through the Ayyubid blockade.&lt;ref name="Smail, p 154"/&gt;

Saladin then moved toward Mount Tabor, hoping to lure the Franks into an ambush. Instead, Guy retreated to La Fève. During this move, the Ayyubid army quickly returned and pounced on the Crusaders again, but they were unable to halt or disrupt the march. Saladin, also short of supplies, concluded the campaign. At this, Guy marched back to his main base at La Sephorie.

== Aftermath ==
Following long-standing Crusader policy, Guy successfully thwarted Saladin's invasion by preventing him from capturing any strongholds and by keeping the field army intact. But, as in 1182, the Saracen raiders caused extensive damage to crops and villages. Guy was harshly criticized by some for failing to fight a major battle when in command of such a large host. Others, mostly native barons such as [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], supported his cautious strategy. They pointed out that Saladin's army was drawn up on rough ground, unsuitable for a Frankish heavy cavalry charge. Soon after this battle, Guy lost his position as regent.

The next time Guy commanded a major Crusader army, he was reminded how severely he was criticized for avoiding battle in 1183.&lt;ref&gt;Reston, 2007,  p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=n68ZQKYAj58C&amp;pg=PA54 54]&lt;/ref&gt; On that occasion, he initiated an aggressive move that resulted in total disaster for him at the [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187.

The '''Beaman Oak''' was the largest [[white oak]] tree in the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]]. It stood in the front yard of a [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]] three-story house in the town of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]]. It was so named because Gamaliel Beaman had originally settled the spot in 1659. The oak became known as a prominent landmark in Central Massachusetts and is featured prominently on the town seal of [[West Boylston, Massachusetts|West Boylston]].

In 1970, the Beaman Oak's circumference at its base was {{convert|31|ft|abbr=on}}, with a circumference {{convert|5|ft|abbr=on}} above the base of {{convert|31|ft|abbr=on}}, and its height was {{convert|75|ft|abbr=on}} and spread was {{convert|75|ft|abbr=on}}.

The oak's trunk was partially hollow towards the end of its life.

{{Paranormal}}

The '''Bermuda Triangle''', also known as the '''Devil's Triangle''' or '''Hurricane Alley''', is a loosely-defined region in the western part of the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], where a number of [[aircraft]] and [[Surface ship|ships]] are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery. The vicinity of the Bermuda Triangle is amongst the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas, [[Europe]] and the Caribbean islands. Cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region, and commercial and private aircraft routinely fly over it.

[[Popular culture]] has attributed various disappearances to the [[paranormal]] or activity by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]]. Documented evidence indicates that a significant percentage of the incidents were spurious, inaccurately reported, or embellished by later authors.

==Triangle area==
In 1964, [[Vincent Gaddis]] wrote in the pulp magazine ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' of the boundaries of the Bermuda Triangle,&lt;ref name="Gaddis,1964"/&gt; giving its [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] as [[Miami]]; [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]; and [[Bermuda]]. Subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this definition.&lt;ref name="navy,1996"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Bermuda Triangle Fact Sheet |year=1998 |url=http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Reading_Room/UFO/195.pdf |publisher=US Department of Defense |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121111220/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Reading_Room/UFO/195.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle, with the total area varying from {{convert|1300000|to|3900000|sqkm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=navy,1996/&gt;  "Indeed, some writers even stretch it as far as the Irish coast."&lt;ref name="NOVA,1976"&gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported them.&lt;ref name=navy,1996/&gt;

===Origins===
The earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in a September 17, 1950, article published in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' ([[Associated Press]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.smu.edu/pseudo/BermudaTriangle/evwjones.html|title=E. V. W. Jones AP article|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Edward Van Winkle Jones.&lt;ref name="Jones,1950"&gt;{{cite news
| title = ''Same Big World'', Sea's Puzzles Still Baffle Men In Pushbutton Age| agency = Associated Press| author = E.V.W. Jones
| date = September 16, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' magazine published "Sea Mystery at Our Back Door",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/environment/2016/10/24/has-the-mystery-of-the-bermuda-triangle-finally-been-solved-hexagonal-clouds-florida-bahamas-puerto-rico|title=Has the ‘Mystery’ of the Bermuda Triangle Finally Been Solved?|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sand,1952"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Sea Mystery at Our Back Door| author = George X. San| journal = [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]|date=October 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short article by George X. Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of [[Flight 19]], a group of five [[US Navy]] [[Grumman TBM Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]s on a training mission. Sand's article was the first to lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place. Flight 19 alone would be covered again in the April 1962 issue of ''American Legion'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Eckert,1962" &gt;{{cite journal| title = The Mystery of The Lost Patrol| journal = American Legion Magazine|author = Allen W. Eckert|date=April 1962}} Cited in [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] (editor), ''Satanism Today: An Encyclopedia of Religion, Folklore, and Popular Culture'', page 72, segment by [[Jerome Clark]] (ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2001). {{ISBN|1-57607-292-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, author [[Allan W. Eckert]] wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, "We are entering white water, nothing seems right. We don't know where we are, the water is green, no&lt;!-- NB: "no" is correct, "not" is incorrect"--&gt; white." He also wrote that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes "flew off to Mars."&lt;ref&gt;Diana Formisano Willett, ''Paranormal Fright'', page 9 (AuthorHouse, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-4817-3268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sand's article was the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident. In the February 1964 issue of ''Argosy'', Vincent Gaddis' article "The Deadly Bermuda Triangle" argued that Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region.&lt;ref name="Gaddis,1964"&gt;{{citation|last = Gaddis| first = Vincent|title = The Deadly Bermuda Triangle| journal = Argosy| year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, ''Invisible Horizons''.&lt;ref name="Gaddis,1965"&gt;{{cite book| title = Invisible Horizons| author = Vincent Gaddis| year = 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others would follow with their own works, elaborating on Gaddis' ideas: John Wallace Spencer (''Limbo of the Lost'', 1969, repr. 1973);&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#refSpencer,1969|Spencer, 1969]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Berlitz]] [[The Bermuda Triangle (book)|(''The Bermuda Triangle'', 1974)]];&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#refBerlitz,1974|Berlitz, 1974]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Winer]] (''The Devil's Triangle'', 1974),&lt;ref name="Winer, 1974"&gt;{{harvnb|Winer|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others, all keeping to some of the same supernatural elements outlined by Eckert.&lt;ref name="Eckert, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept ==

===Larry Kusche {{anchor|Kusche's explanation}}===

[[Larry Kusche|Lawrence David Kusche]], author of ''The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved'' (1975)&lt;ref name="Kusche, 1975"&gt;[[#refKusche,1975|Kusche, 1975]].&lt;/ref&gt; argued that many claims of Gaddis and subsequent writers were often exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman [[Donald Crowhurst]], which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an ''Atlantic'' port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the ''Pacific'' Ocean. Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories.

Kusche concluded that:
* The number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater, proportionally speaking, than in any other part of the ocean.
* In an area frequented by [[tropical cyclone]]s, the number of disappearances that did occur were, for the most part, neither disproportionate, unlikely, nor mysterious.
* Furthermore, Berlitz and other writers would often fail to mention such storms or even represent the disappearance as having happened in calm conditions when meteorological records clearly contradict this.
* The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research. A boat's disappearance, for example, would be reported, but its eventual (if belated) return to port may not have been.
* Some disappearances had, in fact, never happened. One plane crash was said to have taken place in 1937, off [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], in front of hundreds of witnesses; a check of the local papers revealed nothing.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery, perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism.&lt;ref name="Kusche, 1975"/&gt;

In a 2013 study, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] identified the world's 10 most dangerous waters for shipping, but the Bermuda Triangle was not among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22806362|title =Study finds shipwrecks threaten precious seas|date =7 June 2013|accessdate = 7 June 2013|publisher =BBC News/science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2013/0610/Bermuda-Triangle-doesn-t-make-the-cut-on-list-of-world-s-most-dangerous-oceans | title=Bermuda Triangle doesn't make the cut on list of world's most dangerous oceans | work=The Christian Science Monitor | accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further responses===
When the [[Channel 4|UK Channel 4]] television program ''The Bermuda Triangle'' (1992)&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/477884 |title=Equinox: The Bermuda Triangle |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the ''Equinox'' series, the marine insurance market [[Lloyd's of London]] was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there.&lt;ref name="WoodsHole Bermuda"/&gt; Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area. [[United States Coast Guard]] records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="Kusche, 1975"/&gt;

The Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle, noting that they collect and publish, through their inquiries, much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors. In one such incident involving the 1972 explosion and sinking of the tanker {{SS|V. A. Fogg||2}}, the Coast Guard photographed the wreck and recovered several bodies,&lt;ref name="USCG Fogg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/moa/boards/vafog.pdf |title=V A Fogg |format=PDF |publisher=USCG |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with one Triangle author's claim that all the bodies had vanished, with the exception of the captain, who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk, clutching a coffee cup.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In addition, ''V. A. Fogg'' sank off the coast of [[Texas]], nowhere near the commonly accepted boundaries of the Triangle.

The [[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]/[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]] episode ''The Case of the Bermuda Triangle'', aired on June 27, 1976, was highly critical, stating that "When we've gone back to the original sources or the people involved, the mystery evaporates. Science does not have to answer questions about the Triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place&amp;nbsp;... Ships and planes behave in the Triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the world."&lt;ref name="NOVA,1976"/&gt;

Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Taves&lt;ref name="Taves,1978"&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Taves
| first= Ernest H.
| title =
| journal = [[The Skeptical Inquirer]]
| year = 1978

}}&lt;/ref&gt; have noted how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable. This has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle. They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint.

== Explanation attempts ==
Persons accepting the Bermuda Triangle as a real phenomenon have offered a number of explanatory approaches.

===Paranormal explanations===
Triangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events. One explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of [[Atlantis]]. Sometimes connected to the Atlantis story is the submerged rock formation known as the [[Bimini Road]] off the island of [[Bimini]] in the Bahamas, which is in the Triangle by some definitions. Followers of the purported psychic [[Edgar Cayce]] take his prediction that evidence of Atlantis would be found in 1968, as referring to the discovery of the Bimini Road. Believers describe the formation as a road, wall, or other structure, but the Bimini Road is of natural origin.&lt;ref name="CSI,2004"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-01/geologists-adventures.html |title=A Geologist's Adventures with Bimini Beachrock and Atlantis True Believers |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=January 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406124939/http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-01/geologists-adventures.html |archivedate=April 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers attribute the events to [[UFO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufos.about.com/od/classicufocases/a/bermudatriangle.htm |title=UFO over Bermuda Triangle |publisher=Ufos.about.com |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochran,2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cochran-Smith | first = Marilyn | year = 2003 | title = Bermuda Triangle: dichotomy, mythology, and amnesia | journal = Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 54 | doi = 10.1177/0022487103256793 | page = 275 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was used by [[Steven Spielberg]] for his [[science fiction film]] ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', which features the lost Flight 19 aircrews as [[Alien abduction|alien abductees]].

[[Charles Berlitz]], author of various books on anomalous phenomena, lists several theories attributing the losses in the Triangle to anomalous or unexplained forces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

A paranormal explanation in the 2005 three-part US-British-German science fiction miniseries ''[[The Triangle (miniseries)|The Triangle]]'', says the triangle is a wormhole.

===Natural explanations===

====Compass variations====
[[Compass]] problems are one of the cited phrases in many Triangle incidents. While some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the area,&lt;ref name="USNAVY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm|title=Bermuda Triangle|publisher=US Navy|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; such anomalies have not been found. Compasses have natural [[magnetic variation]]s in relation to the [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic poles]], a fact which navigators have known for centuries. [[magnetic north pole|Magnetic (compass) north]] and [[true north|geographic (true) north]] are exactly the same only for a small number of places – for example, {{as of|2000|lc=y}}, in the United States, only those places on a line running from [[Wisconsin]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;National Geomagnetism Program &amp;#124; Charts &amp;#124; North America &amp;#124; Declination&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|url=http://geomag.usgs.gov/charts/IGRF2000.dec.na.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527143024/http://geomag.usgs.gov/charts/IGRF2000.dec.na.pdf|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the public may not be as informed, and think there is something mysterious about a compass "changing" across an area as large as the Triangle, which it naturally will.&lt;ref name="Kusche, 1975"/&gt;

[[File:Gulfstream1.jpg|thumb|upright|False-color image of the Gulf Stream flowing north through the western Atlantic Ocean. (NASA)]]

====Gulf Stream====
The [[Gulf Stream]] is a major surface current, primarily driven by [[thermohaline circulation]] that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and then flows through the [[Straits of Florida]] into the North Atlantic. In essence, it is a river within an ocean, and, like a river, it can and does carry floating objects. It has a maximum surface velocity of about {{cvt|2|m/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Pamela|title=The Gulf Stream|url=http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/student/phillips/|publisher=USNA/Johns Hopkins|accessdate=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small plane making a [[water landing]] or a boat having engine trouble can be carried away from its reported position by the current.

====Human error====
One of the most cited explanations in official inquiries as to the loss of any aircraft or vessel is [[human error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/bermuda-triangle-mystery-disappearance/ |title=Bermuda Triangle: Behind the Intrigue |work=[[National Geographic News]] |access-date=26 May 2009 |date=15 December 2003 |last=Mayell |first=Hillary |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |agency=[[National Geographic Partners, LLC.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human stubbornness may have caused businessman Harvey Conover to lose his sailing yacht, ''Revonoc'', as he sailed into the teeth of a storm south of Florida on January 1, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Captain Thomas A. |title=Histories &amp; Mysteries: The Shipwrecks of Key Largo |year=1994 |isbn=0941332330 |pages=124 |edition=1st |publisher=Best Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violent weather====
Hurricanes are powerful storms that form in tropical waters and have historically cost thousands of lives and caused billions of dollars in damage. The sinking of [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]'s Spanish fleet in 1502 was the first recorded instance of a destructive hurricane. These storms have in the past caused a number of incidents related to the Triangle.

A powerful [[microburst|downdraft of cold air]] was suspected to be a cause in the sinking of ''[[Pride of Baltimore]]'' on May 14, 1986. The crew of the sunken vessel noted the wind suddenly shifted and increased velocity from {{convert|32|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|97|-|145|km/h|abbr=on}}. A National Hurricane Center satellite specialist, James Lushine, stated "during very unstable weather conditions the downburst of cold air from aloft can hit the surface like a bomb, exploding outward like a giant squall line of wind and water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h8wlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TPMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1085,6357771|title=''Downdraft likely sank clipper'', The Miami News, May 23, 1986, p. 6A|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event occurred to ''[[Concordia (ship)|Concordia]]'' in 2010, off the coast of [[Brazil]]. Scientists are currently investigating whether "[[hexagon]]al" clouds may be the source of these up-to-{{cvt|170|mph}} "air bombs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Bermuda Triangle Mystery Explained |url=http://www.rdmag.com/article/2016/10/bermuda-triangle-mystery-explained?et_cid=5637693&amp;et_rid=620328802&amp;type=headline&amp;et_cid=5637693&amp;et_rid=620328802&amp;linkid=content |author=Kenny Walter |publisher=''RandD Magazine'' |date=24 October 2016 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methane hydrates====
{{Main|Methane clathrate}}
[[File:Gas hydrates 1996.svg|thumb|Worldwide distribution of confirmed or inferred offshore gas hydrate-bearing sediments, 1996.&lt;br /&gt;Source: [[United States Geological Survey]]]]
An explanation for some of the disappearances has focused on the presence of large fields of [[methane]] hydrates (a form of natural gas) on the [[continental shelves]].&lt;ref name="Energy Citations Database (ECD) – Document #616279"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; any wreckage consequently rising to the surface would be rapidly dispersed by the Gulf Stream. It has been hypothesized that periodic methane [[eruption]]s (sometimes called "[[mud volcano]]es") may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate [[buoyancy]] for ships. If this were the case, such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning.

==Notable incidents==
{{Main|List of Bermuda Triangle incidents}}

===''Ellen Austin''===
''Ellen Austin'' supposedly came across a derelict ship, placed on board a [[prize crew]], and attempted to sail with it to New York in 1881. According to the stories, the derelict disappeared; others elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew, then disappeared again with a second prize crew on board. A check from Lloyd's of London records proved the existence of ''Meta'', built in 1854, and that in 1880, ''Meta'' was renamed ''Ellen Austin''. There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest a large number of missing men were placed on board a derelict that later disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-triangle.org/html/ellen_austin.html |title=Ellen Austin |work=Bermuda-Triangle.Org |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710033354/http://bermuda-triangle.org/html/ellen_austin.html |archive-date=10 July 2012 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USS ''Cyclops''===
{{main|USS Cyclops (AC-4)}}

The incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy not related to combat occurred when the collier ''Cyclops'', carrying a full load of [[manganese ore]] and with one engine out of action, went missing without a trace with a crew of 309 sometime after March 4, 1918, after departing the island of [[Barbados]]. Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory, many independent theories exist, some blaming storms, some capsizing, and some suggesting that [[World War I|wartime enemy activity]] was to blame for the loss.&lt;ref name="DMerrill"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, two of ''Cyclops''{{'}}s sister ships, {{USS|Proteus|AC-9|2}} and {{USS|Nereus|AC-10|2}} were subsequently lost in the North Atlantic during [[World War II]]. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on ''Cyclops'' during her fatal voyage. In all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking.

===''Carroll A. Deering''===
{{main|Carroll A. Deering}}

[[File:deering2.jpg|thumb|[[Schooner]] ''[[Carroll A. Deering]]'', as seen from the [[Cape Lookout (North Carolina)|Cape Lookout]] [[lightvessel]] on January 29, 1921, two days before she was found deserted in [[North Carolina]]. (US Coast Guard)]]

A five-masted schooner built in 1919, ''Carroll A. Deering'' was found hard aground and abandoned at [[Diamond Shoals]], near [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]], on January 31, 1921. Rumors and more at the time indicated ''Deering'' was a victim of piracy, possibly connected with the illegal [[rum-running]] trade during [[Prohibition]], and possibly involving another ship, {{SS|Hewitt||2}}, which disappeared at roughly the same time. Just hours later, an unknown steamer sailed near the lightship along the track of ''Deering'', and ignored all signals from the lightship. It is speculated that ''Hewitt'' may have been this mystery ship, and possibly involved in ''Deering''{{'}}s crew disappearance.&lt;ref name="Deering"&gt;{{cite web

===Flight 19===
{{main|Flight 19}}
[[File:TBF (Avengers) flying in formation.jpg|upright|thumb|US Navy Avengers, similar to those of Flight 19]]
Flight 19 was a training flight of five [[Grumman TBF Avenger|TBM Avenger]] torpedo bombers that disappeared on December 5, 1945, while over the Atlantic. The squadron's flight plan was scheduled to take them due east from [[Fort Lauderdale]] for {{cvt|141|mi}}, north for {{cvt|73|mi}}, and then back over a final {{convert|140|mi|adj=on|abbr=off}} leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returned to base. The disappearance is attributed by Navy investigators to navigational error leading to the aircraft running out of fuel.

One of the search and rescue aircraft deployed to look for them, a [[Martin PBM Mariner|PBM Mariner]] with a 13-man crew, also disappeared. A tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an explosion&lt;ref name = "The_Loss_of_Flight_19"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observing a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather was becoming stormy by the end of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/the_disappearance_of_flight_19.html |title=The Disappearance of Flight 19 |work=Bermuda-Triangle.Org |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722093758/http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/the_disappearance_of_flight_19.html |archive-date=22 July 2012 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to contemporaneous sources the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapour leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue operation.

===''Star Tiger'' and ''Star Ariel''===
{{main|BSAA Star Tiger disappearance|BSAA Star Ariel disappearance}}

[[BSAA Star Tiger disappearance|G-AHNP ''Star Tiger'']] disappeared on January 30, 1948, on a flight from the [[Azores]] to Bermuda; [[BSAA Star Ariel disappearance|G-AGRE ''Star Ariel'']] disappeared on January 17, 1949, on a flight from Bermuda to [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Both were [[Avro]] [[Tudor IV]] passenger aircraft operated by [[British South American Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/the_tudors.html |title=The Tudors |work=Bermuda-Triangle.Org |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723095709/http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/the_tudors.html |archive-date=23 July 2012 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both planes were operating at the very limits of their range and the slightest error or fault in the equipment could keep them from reaching the small island.&lt;ref name="Kusche, 1975"/&gt;

===Douglas DC-3===
{{main|1948 Airborne Transport DC-3 (DST) disappearance}}

On December 28, 1948, a [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft, number [[NC16002 disappearance|NC16002]], disappeared while on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Miami. No trace of the aircraft, or the 32 people on board, was ever found. A Civil Aeronautics Board investigation found there was insufficient information available on which to determine probable cause of the disappearance.&lt;ref name="Aviation Safety DC3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avsaf.org/reports/US/1948.12.28_AirborneTransport_DouglasDC-3.pdf#search=%22Airborne%20Transport%2C%20December%2028%2C%201948%2C%20Miami%2C%20Florida%22|title=Airborne Transport, Miami, December 1948|publisher=Aviation Safety|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103193538/http://www.avsaf.org/reports/US/1948.12.28_AirborneTransport_DouglasDC-3.pdf|archivedate=2007-01-03|accessdate=2015-10-05}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Connemara IV''===
A pleasure yacht was found adrift in the Atlantic south of Bermuda on September 26, 1955; it is usually stated in the stories (Berlitz, Winer)&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winer, 1974"/&gt; that the crew vanished while the yacht survived being at sea during three hurricanes. The [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season]] shows [[Hurricane Ione]] passing nearby between 14 and 18 September, with Bermuda being affected by winds of almost gale force.&lt;ref name="Kusche, 1975"/&gt; In his second book on the Bermuda Triangle, Winer quoted from a letter he had received from Mr J.E. Challenor of Barbados:&lt;ref name="Winer, 1975"&gt;{{harvnb|Winer|1975|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the morning of September 22, ''Connemara IV'' was lying to a heavy mooring in the open [[roadstead]] of [[Carlisle Bay, Barbados|Carlisle Bay]]. Because of the approaching hurricane, the owner strengthened the mooring ropes and put out two additional anchors. There was little else he could do, as the exposed mooring was the only available anchorage. ... In Carlisle Bay, the sea in the wake of [[Hurricane Janet]] was awe-inspiring and dangerous. The owner of ''Connemara IV'' observed that she had disappeared. An investigation revealed that she had dragged her moorings and gone to sea.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===KC-135 Stratotankers===
On August 28, 1963, a pair of [[US Air Force]] [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] aircraft collided and crashed into the Atlantic. The Triangle version (Winer, Berlitz, Gaddis)&lt;ref name="Gaddis,1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winer, 1974"/&gt; of this story states that while the two aircraft did collide and crash, there were two distinct crash sites, separated by over {{convert|160|mi|km}} of water. However, Kusche's research showed that the unclassified version of the Air Force investigation report stated that the debris field defining the second "crash site" was examined by a search and rescue ship, and found to be a mass of [[seaweed]] and [[driftwood]] tangled in an old [[buoy]].&lt;ref name="Kusche, 1975"/&gt;

'''Blue Beach Military Cemetery at San Carlos''' is a British war [[cemetery]] in the [[Falkland Islands]] holding the remains of 13 of the 255 British casualties killed during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, and one other killed in early 1984. It is situated close to where [[3 Commando Brigade]] had its initial headquarters after landing on 21 May 1982.

Up until 1982 all British serviceman killed in action were buried and commemorated as close to the place of death as possible and the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] managed these graves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3625387/Well-miss-our-corners-of-a-foreign-field.html Corners of a foreign field] – The Telegraph. Retrieved April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Falklands War]], one family requested the repatriation of their fallen son's body and, following this, other families requested the same;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British families protest Falklands burial for troops|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SAdKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mR4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1809,1777599&amp;dq=soldiers-families-and-comrades-protested-that-the-men-were-being-left&amp;hl=en|accessdate=25 January 2012|newspaper=The Michigan Daily|date=2 June 1982|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result, this offer was extended to all relatives. On 16 November 1982 64 of the dead (52 soldiers, 11 Royal Marines, and one laundryman from [[Hong Kong people|Hong Kong]]) were returned to Britain aboard the landing ship ''[[RFA Sir Bedivere (L3004)|Sir Bedivere]]''.

The families of 15 of the dead kept with tradition and preferred their sons' remains should stay in the islands. Thirteen are buried at [[Port San Carlos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave cemetery|1972415|Blue Beach Military Cemetery}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two more at isolated single grave sites at [[Goose Green]] and [[Port Howard]]. The fourteenth person interred at Port San Carlos is Captain John Belt of the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]], who died in a helicopter crash in January 1984.

==Design==
In 1982, at the request of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], the Commonwealth War Graves Commission undertook the design and construction of a cemetery and memorial. The plans were approved by the MOD on 12 November 1982 at a total cost of £50,000. The work was completed with the assistance of 8 Field Squadron [[Royal Engineers]] and the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] and dedicated on 10 April 1983. The headstones are of [[Orton, Eden#Orton Scar|Orton Scar]] [[limestone]] and the memorial panels are of light sea green [[slate]] from [[Cumbria]].

The cemetery is surrounded by a 1 metre high wall with a small entrance open to the beach in the style of a [[Pen (enclosure)|stone sheep corral]]. Opposite the entrance, the wall is tapered higher with seven slate panels, six with the Regiment, Name, Rank and Service of the fallen and one with the three Forces' Emblems and the following inscription;
&lt;small&gt;

The site is divided into two sections each with seven graves.  The section on the right is known as the Airborne Cemetery as it contains the remains of four [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)#Operation Corporate - The Falklands|Paratroopers]] including that of [[H. Jones|Lieutenant-Colonel "H" Jones]]. Alongside them are two [[Royal Corps of Signals|Royal Signallers]] from [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade Headquarters]] and Sergeant Griffin from [[656 Squadron Army Air Corps#Falklands War|656 Squadron Army Air Corps]] who were all killed in the [[1982 British Army Gazelle friendly fire incident|Gazelle friendly fire incident]]. Directly opposite are another seven headstones laid out in the same pattern with the remains of six [[Royal Marines]] and that of Captain Belt. Nearby is the San Carlos museum, with photographs and relics from the conflict.

On 21 May 2002, the 20th anniversary of the landings, a service of remembrance was held at the cemetery. Over 300 islanders and personnel from the garrison joined the Falklands Governor, in remembering those who lost their lives in the campaign.

;National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire
On 20 May 2012, a duplicate of the San Carlos Memorial was dedicated at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]] in [[Staffordshire]] England. The official dedication, which was attended by [[Royal Marines Band Service|The Band of Her Majesty's Royal Marines]] also marked the 30th anniversary of the landings.

Speaking at the ceremony, the widow of [[H. Jones|Lieutenant-Colonel H Jones]]', Sara, described the memorial as a "Fitting tribute to the members of the Task Force who gave their lives".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hZchiiROIRnLbiRfghO_H1PgChqQ?docId=N0212581337486698442A The Press Association Falklands War memorial unveiled]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17048">The '''Cairo Conference against U.S. hegemony and war on Iraq and in solidarity with Palestine''' (later: '''Popular Campaign for the Support of Resistance in Palestine and Iraq and Against Globalization'''), generally known simply as '''Cairo Anti-war Conference''', is an [[anti-war]] and anti-[[neo-liberalism]] conference held regularly since 2002 in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. The Cairo Conference set up the [[International Campaign Against Aggression on Iraq]] which helped to coordinate the [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|worldwide demonstrations on 15 February 2003]]. In 2009, the Conference was banned by the government of former Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=17897 |title=Mubarak blocks resistance Cairo conference |publisher=Socialistworker.co.uk |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Conference – 2002==
The first conference was held on the 17–19 December 2002, at the [[Conrad Hotel]] on the banks of the [[Nile]]. Four hundred attended. Speakers included former [[United Nations]] (UN) humanitarian coordinator for Iraq Dr [[Hans von Sponeck]]. Former [[Algeria]]n president [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] chaired the conference. One outcome of the conference was the production of the 'Cairo Declaration', which took a stance against the then-looming [[Iraq War]]; it also noted the negative effects of [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[globalisation]] and [[United States|U.S.]] [[hegemony]] on the peoples of the world (including European and American citizens). In addition, it noted that "In the absence of [[democracy]], and with widespread corruption and oppression constituting significant obstacles along the path of the Arab peoples' movement towards economic, social, and intellectual progress, adverse consequences are further aggravated within the framework of the existing world order of [[neoliberal]] [[globalisation]]", while firmly rejecting the 'advance of democracy' justification for attacking Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Full text available here [https://web.archive.org/web/20050226210148/http://www.stopwar.org.uk/Resources/cairo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Stop the War Coalition]], in particular [[John Rees (UK politician)|John Rees]] of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|SWP]], initiated the signing of the declaration by European leftists, including politicians [[Jeremy Corbyn]], [[George Galloway]] and [[Tony Benn]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]] (scholar/activist based in [[France]]), [[Bob Crow]], [[Mick Rix]] (general secretary, UK train drivers' [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|Aslef union]]), [[Julie Christie]], [[George Monbiot]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Ghayasuddin Siddiqui]] ([[Muslim Parliament]]), [[Tommy Sheridan]] (Scottish socialist), Dr [[Ghada Karmi]] (research fellow, [[Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies]], [[University of Exeter]]), [[Tariq Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php4?article_id=2390]&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was followed by a 1,000-strong [[anti-war]] demonstration that was surrounded by riot police and armoured cars.

The organising committee decided to attempt solidarity actions with the US [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war#January 18, 2003|demonstrations on 18 January]] and to organise Egyptian demonstrations as part of [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|15 February global anti-war day]].

==Second Conference – 2003==
Held 13 and 14 December 2003, at the Egyptian Journalists' Union headquarters. This had 800 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;Conference final declaration available here [https://web.archive.org/web/20050310160806/http://www.stopwar.org.uk/article.asp?id=141203].&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Galloway]], [[Tony Benn]], [[Salma Yaqoob]], and former US attorney-general [[Ramsey Clark]] were among the international speakers. Prominent Egyptian campaigners taking part included Nasserist MP [[Hamdeen Sabahy]], [[Galal Aref]], head of the [[Egyptian Journalists' Union]], and [[Ma'mun al-Hodeiby]], leader of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Egyptian novelist [[Sonallah Ibrahim]] and human rights activist [[Aida Seif-al-Dawla]] were among the conference organisers.

The presence of [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leader [[Ma'mun al-Hodeiby]] brought a large number of [[Islamist]] activists into the conference. The Muslim Brotherhood, although officially banned, is by far Egypt's largest opposition organisation. However, some delegates were critical of the Muslim Brotherhood's cooperation with the government in a series of stage-managed anti-war rallies held before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].

German journalist [[Harold Schuman]] who attended the conference expressed frustration that most speeches did not analyse the role of Arab governments but rather took the easy way out by placing all the blame on the US. He also expressed his feelings that the conference should defend the people of [[Iraq]] but not the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/590 |title=Workers Liberty |publisher=Workers Liberty |date= |accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of the Iraqi government were attending the conference, though also the Iraqi opposition had a presence in the form of [[Abdel-Amir Al-Rikabi]] who described himself as a member of "the honest opposition" in contrast with those who met at a US-sponsored event in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistviewpoint.org/feb_03/feb_03_13.html |title=Socialist Viewpoint |publisher=Socialist Viewpoint |date= |accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third Conference – 2005==
24–27 March 2005. Political groups, independent activists, and organisations in Egypt were invited to take part in the conference and also to propose their own activities to take place at the same time as the conference.

Before the conference [[Yehia Fikri]], who represents the [[Center for Socialist Studies]] on the organising committee, called for International delegations to come to the conference in order to protect it from state [[Political repression|repression]]. He has said "The more people who come from abroad, the more prominent personalities who sign up for the conference, the more difficult it will be for the Egyptian authorities to shut us down."

==Fourth Conference – 2006==
The fourth conference, under the rubric "International Campaign against US and Zionist Occupation", was held 23–26 March 2006, on a platform expressed through the slogans "With the Resistance in Palestine and Iraq" and "Against Globalization, Imperialism and Zionism".

The conference discussed means of supporting the resistance in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Iraq]], challenged U.S. and Israeli plans to expand their aggression against the region to [[Syria]] and/or [[Iran]] as well as their plans to liquidate Palestinian and Lebanese resistance organisations, dealt with the issue of supporting the struggle of the peoples of the Arab world for democracy against regimes of the region who collude with aggressors, and called for expanding and developing social struggles against globalisation policies in the Arab region.

The Final Declaration&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiimperialista.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4309&amp;Itemid=55]&lt;/ref&gt; of the conference addressed all of these issues. The declaration expressed support for the [[Hamas]] government of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] against the U.S., Europe and Arab regimes, and opposition to "a peace process that has achieved nothing for the Palestinian people during the last two decades", while rejecting both recognition of Israel and any concessions to it on "the main national demands".

The declaration also stated the ambition to break what it termed "the siege" on the resistance in Iraq, called on neighbouring countries to support "the legitimate Iraqi resistance", and took the position that the Iraqi resistance is "the sole representative of the Iraqi People". In regard to escalating American pressure on Iran and Syria, the conference agreed on an international day of solidarity with Iran and Syria on the 6th of May 2006, an ambition that was reiterated regarding Iran in a separate call for "international coordinated action" that was attached to the declaration.

The declaration also called for "a new Arab movement for change", including "all possible forms of coordination between different democracy movements" and the formation of support committees to protect judges, journalists, lecturers and students against repression.

==Fifth Conference – 2007==
The fifth Cairo Conference was held between March 29 and April 1, 2007. Its declaration is here [http://www.socialistviewpoint.org/feb_03/feb_03_13.html]. According to the ''[[Al-Ahram]]'', the conference was organised by  [[Alkarama]] (Dignity), [[Al-Ishtirakyin Al-Sawryin]] (Socialist Revolutionary Party), Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimin ([[Muslim Brotherhood]]) and [[Al-'Amal]] (Labour), and was held at the [[Egyptian Press Syndicate]], with close to 600 participants and observers from around the world, including a delegation of 80 South Koreans and 20 Canadians.&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/839/sc1.htm Al-Ahram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828171416/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/839/sc1.htm |date=2007-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim Brotherhood reported there were activists present from Palestine (including [[Hamas]] members), Iraq, Lebanon, Venezuela, Turkey, Greece, Nigeria, Britain, Tunisia, Sudan, France and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d6556245.inc69.dotinc.org/Home.asp?zPage=Systems&amp;System=PressR&amp;Press=Show&amp;Lang=E&amp;ID=6692 |title=MB website |publisher=D6556245.inc69.dotinc.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers included [[Ali Fayed]] of [[Hizbullah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/sasha_simic/2007/04/cairo_conference_3.html |title=Guardian Comment is Free |publisher=Commentisfree.guardian.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sadala Mazraani]] of the [[Lebanese Communist Party]],&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram" /&gt; James Clark of the [[Canadian Peace Alliance]],&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram" /&gt; [[Feroze Mithiborwala]] of the [[Muslim Intellectual Forum of India]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/839/sc2.htm Al-Ahram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816134424/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/839/sc2.htm |date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]] of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/839/sc3.htm Al-Ahram Weekly | Special | 'Our opponents are on the defensive'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829173437/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/839/sc3.htm |date=2007-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rose Gentle]] (the mother of [[Gordon Gentle]], a British soldier killed while serving in Iraq, and a leading figure in [[Military Families Against the War]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/sasha_simic/2007/04/cairo_conference.html |title=Guardian Comment is Free |publisher=Commentisfree.guardian.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixth Conference – 2008==
The sixth Cairo antiwar conference was held March 27–30, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isreview.org/issues/59/feat-egyptstrikes.shtml Class struggle in Egypt], International Socialist Review, Issue 59, May–June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalmbreport.org/?p=330 2008 Cairo Antiwar Conference Announced], The Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=14118 All roads are leading to the Cairo Conference], Socialist Worker, Issue:2087, 9 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventh Conference – 2009==
"The seventh Cairo anti-war conference was cancelled after being denied access to a venue".&lt;ref&gt;Amira Howeidy, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/947/eg6.htm Cairo's anti-war obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410132503/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/947/eg6.htm |date=2012-04-10 }}, Al-Ahram, Issue No. 947, 14–20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Egyptian government and the Cairo conference==
Although the Egyptian government was formally against the [[Iraq War]], relations between it and the conference are strained by the fact that [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s regime received funding from the [[United States]] and that the regime feared popular movements which may have grown to challenge its dictatorship.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

==Criticism==
Among the criticisms of the first Conference was that it was building solidarity not with ordinary Iraqis, but rather with the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. This perception was fueled by the reported presence of a number of Iraqi officials at the conference. According to ''Al-Ahram Weekly'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050404204531/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/618/sc1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; German journalist and author Harald Schuman attracted the ire of [[Nabil Negm]], the chief political adviser to the Iraqi president, after comments he made insisting that claims that all the problems of the Arab world could be laid at the door of the US were only half-true and that the conference was not meant to "defend the Iraqi regime and Saddam Hussein in any shape or form". "I am here," he said, "to defend the Iraqi people."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18476">In the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919-1921, [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] were in combat with the newly independent [[Second Polish Republic]] and the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Both sides aimed to secure territory in the often disputed areas of today's [[Ukraine]] and parts of modern-day [[Belarus]], in the context of the fluidity of borders in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] in the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the breakdown of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire|German]] empires. The first clashes between the two sides occurred in February 1919, but full-scale war did not break out until the following year. Especially at first, neither Soviet Russia, embroiled in the [[Russian Civil War]], nor Poland, still in the early stages of state building, were in a position to formulate and pursue clear and consistent war aims. 

[[File:Polish-soviet propaganda poster 1920.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Soviet propaganda poster "This is how the Polish lords' plan finishes"]]
In the winter of 1918-19 the recently established Russian Soviet Republic had already undertaken a "[[Soviet westward offensive of 1918–19|Westward Offensive]]", leading to the establishment of [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] Republics in [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Belarus]]. The overarching aim of [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]] was to spread the [[Bolshevik]] revolution into Germany and other parts of Europe, while realising their limited capacity to engage in large-scale conflict in Europe. The Soviets built up forces positioned for an attack on Poland, although officially denying that an invasion was planned.

For their part, the Poles aimed to secure their independence, contain any resurgence of the Russian or German Empires, and expand into areas to the east claimed to have Polish populations. An ambitious plan formulated by Polish head of state [[Józef Piłsudski]] aimed to create a wide "[[Intermarium]]" (''Międzymorze'') federation of independent states to the west of Russia, of which Poland would be the leading member. Keeping [[Ukraine]] beyond Russian influence was essential to this plan, and Poland was already [[Polish–Ukrainian War|at war]] with Ukrainian forces over [[Eastern Galicia]].

[[File:Bij Bolszewika.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Polish propaganda poster "Strike the Bolshevik"]]
As 1919 progressed, Polish forces took the offensive and in early 1920 Poland formed an alliance with the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], which had lost much of its territory to the Bolsheviks. Both Polish and Soviet forces in the theatre were rapidly increased, and full-scale war began with Poland's [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Kiev Offensive]] into Soviet-controlled Ukraine.

== The prehistory ==
The territory, where this conflict broke out, was a part of the medieval [[Kievan Rus']], and after the disintegration of this united [[Ruthenia]]n state (in the middle of the 12th century) belonged to the Ruthenian princedoms of [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Halych-Volhynia]], [[Principality of Polotsk|Polotsk]], [[Lutsk]], [[Terebovlia]], [[Principality of Turov and Pinsk|Turov-Pinsk]] etc. The majority of these principalities have been ruined during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Tatar–Mongol invasion]] in the middle of the 13th century. Some territories in the [[Dnieper]] region and Black Sea Coast for long years lost [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] settled population and became the so-called [[Wild Fields|''Wild Steppe'']] (i.e., territory of the [[Principality of Pereslavl|Pereyaslavl]]). After the Tatar–Mongol invasion these territories become an object of expansion of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish kingdom]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian princedom]]. For example, in the first half of 14th century Kiev, the Dniepr region, also the region between the rivers [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]] and [[Daugava|West Dvina]] were captured by Lithuania, and in 1352 the Halych-Volhynia princedom was divided by Poland and Lithuania. In 1569, according to the [[Union of Lublin|Lublin Union]], the majority of the Ruthenian territories possessed by Lithuania, passed to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish crown]]. The [[serfdom]] and Catholicism extended in these territories. The local aristocracy was incorporated into the [[Szlachta|Polish aristocracy]]. Cultural, language and religious break between the supreme and lowest layers of a society arose.

The combination of social, language, religious and cultural oppressions had led to destructive [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|popular uprisings of the middle of 17th century]], which the Polish–Lithuanian state could not recover from.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sergey Solovyov]], "History of Russia from the Earliest Times", vol.3–5, {{ISBN|5-17-002142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many territories incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]] in 1772–1795 after [[Partitions of Poland|the partitions]], the domination of the Polish aristocracy was kept, in the territories incorporated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the domination of the Polish aristocracy has been added with active planting of German language and culture. During the First World War Austro-Hungarian authorities undertook reprisals against [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russia-oriented people]] of the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Eastern Galicia]] and the Polish left-nationalist movement led by [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski]] got the support of the [[Central Powers]] for struggle against Russia. In the consequence of the [[Russian Revolution|revolution in Russia]] and the fall of Hohenzollern and Habsburg empires in the end of World War I Poland regained independence. The Polish leaders decided to retrieve as many of the territories that were parts of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian state]] in 1772 as possible.

== The situation ==
In the [[aftermath of World War I]], the map of Central and Eastern Europe had drastically changed.&lt;ref name="FDH"&gt;[[Thomas Grant Fraser]], [[Seamus Dunn]], [[Otto von Habsburg]], ''Europe and Ethnicity: the First World War and contemporary ethnic conflict'', Routledge, 1996, {{ISBN|0-415-11995-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415119960&amp;id=WI2WIiR2FjgC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22First+World+War%22+independence+change+map&amp;sig=cQfWPmNPlCDX9OSsjTduuXFWjGs Google Print, p.2]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (March 3, 1918), by which Russia had lost to [[Imperial Germany]] all the European lands that Russia had seized in the previous two centuries, was rejected by the Bolshevik government in November 1918, following [[armistice]], the surrender of Germany and her allies, and the end of World War I.

Germany, however, had not been keen to see Russia grow strong again and—exploiting her control of those territories, had quickly granted limited independence as [[buffer state]]s to [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. As Germany's defeat rendered her plans for the creation of those [[Mitteleuropa]] [[puppet state]]s obsolete, and as Russia sank into the depths of the [[Russian Civil War]], the newly emergent countries saw a chance for real independence and were not prepared to easily relinquish this rare gift of fate. At the same time, Russia saw these territories as rebellious Russian provinces but was unable to react swiftly, as it was weakened and in the process of transforming herself into the [[Soviet Union]] through the [[Russian Revolution]] and Russian Civil War that had begun in 1917.

[[Image:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Partitions of Poland]], 1795. The colored territories show the greatest extent of the [[Poland]]. Blue (north-west) were taken by [[Kingdom of Prussia]], green (south) by [[Austria]], and cyan (east) by [[Imperial Russia]].]]

With the success of the [[Greater Poland uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland uprising in 1918]], Poland had re-established its [[Sovereign state|statehood]] for the first time since the [[Third Partition of Poland|1795 partition]] and seen the end of a 123 years of rule by three imperial neighbors: [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[German Empire|Germany]],  and [[Austria-Hungary]]. The country, reborn as a [[Second Polish Republic]], proceeded to carve out its borders from the territories of its former partitioners. The [[Western Powers]], in delineating the new European borders after the [[Treaty of Versailles]], had done so in a way unfavorable to Poland. Her western borders cut her off from the [[coal]]-basin and industrial regions of [[Silesia]], leading to the [[Silesian Uprisings]] of 1919-1921. The eastern [[Curzon line]] left millions of Poles, living east of the [[Bug River]], stranded inside Russia's borders.

[[Image:PBW March 1919.png|thumb|left|200px|Rebirth of Poland, March 1919]]
Poland was not alone in its newfound opportunities and troubles. Most if not all of the newly independent neighbours began fighting over borders: [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] fought with [[Hungary]] over [[Transylvania]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] with [[Italy]] over [[Rijeka]], Poland with [[Czechoslovakia]] over [[Cieszyn Silesia]], with Germany over [[Poznań]] and [[Polish-Ukrainian War|with Ukrainians]] over [[Eastern Galicia]] (Galician War). [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainians]], Belarusians, [[Freedom wars of Lithuania|Lithuanians]], [[Estonian Liberation War|Estonians]] and [[Latvian War of Independence|Latvians]] fought against themselves and against the Russians, who were just as divided.&lt;ref name="Davies_WERS-21"&gt;[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–20'', Pimlico, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7126-0694-7}}. (First edition: New York, St. Martin's Press, inc., 1972.) Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading communist influences resulted in communist revolutions in [[Munich]], [[Berlin]], [[Budapest]] and [[Prešov]]. [[Winston Churchill]] commented: "The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begin."&lt;ref name="AHP"&gt;[[Adrian Hyde-Price]], ''Germany and European Order'', Manchester University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7190-5428-1}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=M-2Obqk-VZUC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;sig=DUUDt60sddDtfNR-_h3dt41z5x4 Google Print, p.75]&lt;/ref&gt; All of those engagements &amp;ndash; with the sole exception of the Polish-Soviet war &amp;ndash; would be short-lived border conflicts.

The Polish–Soviet war likely happened more by accident than design, as it is unlikely that anyone in Soviet Russia or in the new Second Republic of Poland would have deliberately planned a major foreign war.&lt;ref name="Davies_WERS-22"&gt;[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–20'', Pimlico, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7126-0694-7}}.

Poland, its territory a major frontline of the First World War, was unstable politically; it had just won the difficult conflict with the West Ukrainian National Republic and was already engaged in new conflicts with Germany (the [[Silesian Uprisings]]) and [[border conflicts between Poland and Czechoslovakia|with Czechoslovakia]]. Polish government was just beginning to organise and had little if any control over various border areas.  Six [[currency|currencies]] affected by various (and rising rapidly) [[inflation]] rates were in circulation.  [[Polish economy|Economy]] was in shambles, some areas were experiencing food shortages, [[crime]] was high and a threat of an armed [[coup d'etat]] by some factions was serious.

The situation in Russia was similar.  The attention of revolutionary Russia, meanwhile, was predominantly directed at thwarting counter-revolution and [[Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War|intervention by the western powers]]. Bolshevik Russia had barely survived its second winter of [[blockade]] and resulting mass [[starvation]] and was in the middle of a bloody civil war.  Lenin controlled only a part of [[European Russia|central Russia]], and the Bolsheviks were surrounded by powerful enemies who needed to be defeated before any thought could be given to advance beyond the unclear Soviet borders. No matter their intent, Lenin and other communist leaders were simply incapable of moving beyond those borders.  While the first clashes between Polish and Soviet forces occurred in February 1919, it would be almost a year before both sides realised that they were engaged in a full war.&lt;ref name="Davies_WERS-22"/&gt;

== Piłsudski's motives ==
[[Image:Jozef Pilsudski1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Józef Piłsudski|Polish Marshal (from March 1920) Józef Piłsudski]]]]
Polish politics was under the strong influence of the statesman [[Józef Piłsudski]], who envisioned a Polish-led [[federation]] (the "Federation of [[Międzymorze]]") comprising Poland, [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]] and other Central and East European countries now emerging out of the crumbling empires after the First World War. The new union would have had borders similar to those of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 15th–18th centuries, and it was to be a counterweight to, and restraint upon, any [[imperialist]] intentions of Russia or Germany.  To this end, Polish forces set out to secure vast territories in the east.  However Piłsudski's federation plan was opposed by another influential Polish politician, [[Roman Dmowski]], who favoured creating a larger, national Polish state.

Poland had never any intention of joining the Western intervention in the Russian Civil War or conquering Russia, as it has done once in the 17th century during the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)|Dimitriads]].  On the contrary, after the [[White Movement|White Russians]] refused to recognise Polish independence, Polish forces acting on orders from Piłsudski delayed or stopped their offensives several times, relieving pressure from Bolshevik forces and thus substantially contributing to White Russian defeat.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== Lenin's motives ==
[[Image:Lenin Validmir.jpg|thumb|150px|Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]]]
In April 1920, when the Red Army's major push towards Polish hinterlands took place, the soldiers and commanders were told that defeat of Poland was not only necessary but simply sufficient for the "oppressed masses of the proletariat" to rise worldwide and create a "workers' paradise." In the words of General Tukhachevski: "To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to world-wide conflagration. March on Vilno, Minsk, Warsaw!".&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Tukhachevski, order of the day, July 2, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1919 the leader of Russia's new [[communist]] government, [[Vladimir Lenin]], was inspired by the Red Army's civil-war victories over [[White Movement|White Russian]] anti-communist forces and their western allies, and began to see the future of the revolution with greater optimism. The Bolsheviks doctrine said that historical processes would lead to [[proletariat]] victory worldwide, and that the [[nation state]]s would be replaced by [[world communism|a worldwide communist community]]. War with Poland was needed if the communist revolution in Russia was to be linked with the expected revolutions in the West, such as [[German Revolution of 1918–19|the one in Germany]]. Early Bolshevik [[ideology]] made it clear that Poland, which was located in between Russia and Germany, had to become the bridge that the [[Red Army]] would have to cross to fulfill the [[Marxist]] doctrine. It was not, however, until the Soviet successes in mid-1920 that this idea became for a short time dominant in Bolshevik policies.

Germany in 1918-1920 was a nation torn by social discontent and embroiled in political chaos. Since the [[Kaiser]]'s [[abdication]] at the end of the First World War, it had seen a series of major internal disturbances, including government takeovers, several [[general strike]]s, some leading to communist revolutions (e.g. the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]), By July 1920, which is when the Soviets were on the verge of taking [[Warsaw]], the [[Weimar Constitution]] was still brand new and the humiliating [[Treaty of Versailles|Peace of Versailles]], even more so. Germany unstable government had to deal with [[separatism|separatist tendencies]], an ongoing conflict, not far from a civil war between the [[Spartacist League]]'s and [[Communist Party of Germany]] and the right-wing [[Freikorps]], all under the watchful and humiliating eyes of the Allied powers. Red Army's remaking of the Versailles system was seen as a major force that could shake the existing system imposed by the victorious western [[Triple Entente|Entente]]. As Lenin himself remarked, "That was the time when everyone in Germany, including the blackest reactionaries and monarchists, declared that the Bolsheviks would be their salvation."

In April 1920 Lenin would complete writing ''The Infantile Disease of "Leftism" in Communism'', a guide to the final stages of the Revolution. He became overconfident, entertaining the thoughts of a serious war with Poland. According to him and his adherents, the Revolution in Russia was doomed unless it was to become worldwide.  The debate in Russia was "not as to whether the Polish bridge should be crossed, but how and when." According to Lenin's doctrine of "revolution from outside" Red Army's advance into Poland would be an opportunity "to probe Europe with the [[bayonet]]s of the Red Army", the first attempt to [[export of revolution|export the Bolshevik Revolution]] by any means necessary. In a [[telegram]], Lenin wrote: "We must direct all our attention to preparing and strengthening the Western [[Front (Soviet Army)|Front]].  A new slogan must be announced: Prepare for war against Poland."&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, ''Red Victory: a History of the Russian Civil War''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9756">The '''Commerce Department trade mission controversy''' was an American political controversy in the 1990s during the [[Clinton Administration]]. It refers to the alleged selling of seats on United States federal planes going on international trade missions, for the purpose of raising campaign contributions. No official charges were ever made in conjunction with the allegations but the Commerce Department did change its policies regarding the selection of participants for such missions so they would not be politically based.

==Allegations==
[[File:RonaldHarmonBrownShakingHands.jpg|thumb|U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown (left) shaking hands at a meeting.]]
Ties between the [[U.S. Commerce Department]] and the [[Democratic National Committee]] had been a subject of scrutiny ever since [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]] became [[U.S. Secretary of Commerce]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=kick/&gt;

The first reports of the alleged connections between seats on trade missions and political donations came in September 1994 with reports in ''[[Business Week]]''&lt;ref name=cozies &gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1994-09-11/clinton-cozies-up-to-business "Clinton Cozies Up to Business"] Business Week 12 September 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Traveling Pals - How Ron Brown Picks Who Joins His Trips Abroad Raises Doubts" The Wall Street Journal 9 September 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The trips in question involved CEOs of [[Fortune 500]] and other companies and trips to China, Hong Kong, Russia, India, South Africa, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=cozies/&gt;&lt;ref name = were/&gt;  The campaign contributions allegedly tied to the trips ranged up to $100,000, although lesser amounts were also made reference to.&lt;ref name=cozies/&gt; Both the Clinton administration and contributors denied any quid pro quo, but unnamed figures in the Clinton and lobbying orbits said making donations, in general, helped one's prospects.&lt;ref name=cozies/&gt;

Largely coincident to this, there were allegations of financial improprieties between Brown and a business partner, Nolanda Hill.&lt;ref name=burton&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-03/news/mn-27515_1_president-clinton&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations got the attention of Republican House member [[Dan Burton]] by early 1995.&lt;ref name=burton/&gt; In July 1995, an [[Independent Counsel]], Daniel Pearson, was appointed to investigate these allegations.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-07-07/news/9507060476_1_appellate-judge-daniel-pearson-brown-case&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit and analyses==
Conservative legal group [[Judicial Watch]] filed a federal lawsuit seeking information.&lt;ref name=were/&gt; This happened in 1995, wherein they filed an action in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] seeking information from the Department of Commerce regarding the department's selection of participants for foreign trade missions. In May 1995, following a search in response to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests, the Department  produced approximately 28,000 pages of nonexempt information and withheld about 1,000 documents as exempt. Disputes arose between the parties over the adequacy of Commerce's search, and Judicial Watch charged that some Department  officials had destroyed or removed responsive documents.

Some of the documents released under this process did show that contributors expected their donations to gain them consideration when seats were selected for Brown's flights, and a few of the documents showed the seats being rewarded accordingly.&lt;ref name=were/&gt; However a 1996 analysis by the nonpartisan but liberal-leaning  [[Center for Public Integrity]] found that Democratic contributors only filled a third of the available trip seats, and many of those made contributions to Republicans as well.&lt;ref name=were/&gt;

==Death of Secretary Brown==
Secretary Brown died on a trade mission to Croatia, when the government plane he was on flew into a mountainside on April 3 in the [[1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash]].&lt;ref name=hill/&gt;  This led to conservative accusations that Clinton had Brown murdered; U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] and others scoffed at this conspiracy theory.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-11/news/9801110008_1_x-rays-steven-cogswell-commerce-secretary-ron-brown&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, Nolanda Hill declared that she had been engaging in a long-running affair with Brown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/brown-day-not-affair-article-1.717253&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade missions controversy became more visible in 1996 as an outgrowth of the [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy]] and investigations of Democratic fundraiser [[John Huang]].&lt;ref name=were&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/time/9611/11/lacayo2.shtml "Were Ron Brown's Trade Missions For Sale?" Richard Kacayo, Time magazine for CNN, 11 November 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; It thusly became an issue during the [[United States presidential election, 1996]],&lt;ref name=were/&gt; in which Clinton was nevertheless re-elected.

In November 1996, independent counsel Daniel Pearson reported:
"My office's investigation of Secretary Brown ended unfinished with his death. The unfinished state of the investigation and considerations of fairness preclude our office from drawing conclusions about the allegations regarding possible criminal conduct by the Secretary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frieden|first1=Terry|title=Independent Counsel: No Conclusions On Brown Probe|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/news/9611/14/ron.brown/index.shtml|publisher=CNN|date=November 14, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes and consequences==
[[File:Us_dept_of_commerce_building.jpg|thumb|U.S. Department of Commerce building in Washington, D.C.]]
Responding to the original criticism, in March 1997 new Commerce Secretary [[William M. Daley]] instituted new departmental policies intended to prevent politics from being part of the trade missions selection process.&lt;ref name =kick &gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-03-04/news/9703040142_1_trade-missions-politics-commerce-secretary-william-daley "Clout Is Kicked Off U. S. Trade Missions"] Chicago Tribune 4 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; He also pledged the process would be far more transparent than in the past.&lt;ref name=kick/&gt; Daley said the new rules were not necessarily an admission that prior practices were improper: "This [is] about going forward, not looking back."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/admin/stories/daley030497.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1997, Nolanda  Hill, the aforementioned business and personal associate of Brown, was the subject of a major profile piece in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' which detailed her colorful business past and her relationship with Brown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/06/09/ron-browns-secrets&lt;/ref&gt;
Hill testified in federal court in March 1998 that Brown had told her that trade mission plane seats were sold to people willing to make campaign contributions.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;{{cite news|last=Frieden |first=Terry |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/23/trade.sale/ |title=Ex-Ron Brown Partner Claims Clintons Backed 'Sale' Of Trade Seats |publisher=CNN.com |date=1998-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Court Judge [[Royce Lamberth]] heard Hill's testimony, rejecting her argument that her testimony would adversely affect a federal indictment she was under for fraudulent business practices.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt; Hill stated Brown was angered when White House political staff made him give seats on the trade missions for fund-raising.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt; Hill said Brown told her the main person involved at the White House was [[Alexis Herman]] (who would later become Clinton's Labor Secretary); she further claimed that Brown had told her that an assistant to Herman, Melissa Moss, wrote the original contribution letters which had upset Brown.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt; Hill also testified that Brown had told her President [[Bill Clinton]] and First Lady [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]] supported the plan to sell seats for contributions.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt; In one memorable turn, she said that Brown had complained 
that "I'm not a motherfucking tour guide for Hillary."&lt;ref name=hill/&gt;

Going back to an earlier accusation by Judicial Watch, in January 1999 Judge Lambert found that a U.S. Commerce Department official appeared to have deliberately destroyed subpoenaed documents relating to the department's trade missions to China, following Brown's death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3091FF8345B0C708CDDA80894D1494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBrown%2c%20Ronald%20H%2e "After Judge's Rebuke, Commerce Secretary Widens Inquiry Into Mishandling of Papers"] January 3, 1999, National Desk Late Edition - Final, Section 1, Page 20, Column 1, New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1999, in the related to Brown but unrelated to trade missions case,  Nolanda Hill pleaded guilty to three counts of aiding and abetting the preparation and filing of a false income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE4DF1338F931A35751C0A96F958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBrown%2c%20Ronald%20H%2e "National News Briefs; Official's Partner Pleads Guilty to Tax Charges"] February 2, 1999. New York Times via Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of the Clintons, nor Brown, were never charged with any wrongdoing in the trade missions seats matter.

{{ForensicScience|disciplines|image=Dent cassee sur une roue spiro-conique.jpg}}
'''Forensic engineering''' has been defined as ''"the investigation of failures - ranging from serviceability to catastrophic - which may lead to legal activity, including both civil and criminal".''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic Engineering - a professional approach to investigation|last=Neale (Ed)|first=B S|publisher=Thomas Telford|year=1999|isbn=|location=London|pages=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It  therefore includes  the investigation of [[material science|materials]], [[product (business)|products]], [[structure]]s or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing [[personal injury]], damage to property or economic loss. The consequences of failure may give rise to action under either criminal or civil law including but not limited to  health and safety legislation, the laws of contract and/or [[product liability]] and the laws of [[Tort|tort.]]  The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery.  Generally, the purpose of a [[Forensics|forensic]] [[engineering]] investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an [[accident]]. It can also involve investigation of [[intellectual property]] claims, especially [[patent]]s.

==History==
As the field of engineering has evolved over time, so has the field of forensic engineering. Early examples include investigation of [[bridge failure]]s such as the [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay rail bridge disaster]] of 1879 and the [[Dee bridge disaster]] of 1847. Many early rail accidents prompted the invention of [[tensile test]]ing of samples and [[fractography]] of failed components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History Of Metallography: The Development Of Ideas On The Structure Of Metals Before 1890 |last=Smith |first=Cyril Stanley|authorlink=Cyril Stanley Smith|origyear=1960|publisher=MIT Press |year=1988|isbn=9780262691208|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Vital to the field of forensic engineering is the process of investigating and collecting data related to the materials, products, structures or components that failed. This involves inspections, collecting evidence, measurements, developing models, obtaining exemplar products, and performing experiments. Often testing and measurements are conducted in an [[Independent testing laboratory]] or other reputable unbiased laboratory.

==Analysis==
[[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) and [[fault tree analysis]] methods also examine product or process failure in a structured and systematic way, in the general context of [[safety engineering]]. However, all such techniques rely on accurate reporting of [[failure rate]]s, and precise identification, of the failure modes involved.

There is some common ground between forensic science and forensic engineering, such as scene of crime and scene of accident analysis, integrity of the evidence and court appearances. Both disciplines make extensive use of optical and [[scanning electron microscope]]s, for example. They also share common use of [[spectroscopy]] ([[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]) to examine critical evidence. [[Radiography]] using [[X-ray]]s (such as [[X-ray computed tomography]]), or [[neutron]]s is also very useful in examining thick products for their internal defects before destructive examination is attempted. Often, however, a simple [[Magnifying glass|hand lens]] may reveal the cause of a particular problem.

[[Trace evidence]] is sometimes an important factor in reconstructing the sequence of events in an accident. For example, tire burn marks on a road surface can enable vehicle speeds to be estimated, when the brakes were applied and so on. Ladder feet often leave a trace of movement of the ladder during a slipaway, and may show how the accident occurred. When a product fails for no obvious reason, [[scanning electron microscope|SEM]] and [[Energy-dispersive X&amp;#8209;ray spectroscopy]] (EDX) performed in the microscope can reveal the presence of aggressive chemicals that have left traces on the fracture or adjacent surfaces. Thus an [[polyoxymethylene plastic|acetal resin]] water pipe joint suddenly failed and caused substantial damages to a building in which it was situated. Analysis of the joint showed traces of chlorine, indicating a [[stress corrosion cracking]] failure mode. The failed fuel pipe junction mentioned above showed traces of [[sulfur]] on the fracture surface from the [[sulfuric acid]], which had initiated the crack.

Extracting physical evidence from digital photography is a major technique used in forensic accident reconstruction. [[Match moving|Camera matching]], [[photogrammetry]], and [[Image rectification|photo rectification]] techniques are used to create three-dimensional and top-down views from the two-dimensional photos typically taken at an accident scene. Overlooked or undocumented evidence for accident reconstruction can be retrieved and quantified as long as photographs of such evidence are available. By using photographs of the accident scene including the vehicle, "lost" evidence can be recovered and accurately determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritecheng.com/white-paper-forensic-accident-reconstruction/ Extracting Physical Evidence from Digital Photographs for use in Forensic Accident Reconstruction], David Danaher, P.E., Jeff Ball, Ph.D., P.E., and Mark Kittel, P.E, 6-15-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forensic materials engineering]] involves methods applied to specific materials, such as [[metal]]s, [[glass]]es, [[ceramic]]s, [[composite material|composites]] and [[polymer]]s.

==Examples==
[[image:Plate7new.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Failed fuel pipe at right from a road traffic accident.]]
[[image:Plate4new.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Close-up of the broken fuel pipe from a road traffic accident.]]
[[Image:Broken fuel pipe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Close-up of the broken fuel pipe.]]
The broken fuel pipe shown at left caused a serious accident when [[diesel fuel]] poured out from a van onto the road. A following car skidded and the driver was seriously injured when she collided with an oncoming [[lorry]]. [[Scanning electron microscopy]] or SEM showed that the [[nylon]] connector had fractured by [[stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) due to a small leak of [[battery acid]]. Nylon is susceptible to [[hydrolysis]] when in contact with [[sulfuric acid]], and only a small leak of acid would have sufficed to start a brittle crack in the [[injection moulded]] [[nylon&amp;nbsp;6,6]] connector by  SCC. The crack took about 7 days to grow across the diameter of the tube. The fracture surface showed a mainly brittle surface with striations indicating progressive growth of the crack across the diameter of the pipe. Once the crack had penetrated the inner bore, fuel started leaking onto the road.

The nylon&amp;nbsp;6,6 had been attacked by the following reaction, which was catalyzed by the acid:
:[[image:amide hydrolysis.svg]]

[[Diesel fuel]] is especially hazardous on road surfaces because it forms a thin, oily film that cannot be easily seen by drivers. It is much like [[black ice]] in its slipperiness, so skids are common when diesel leaks occur. The insurers of the van driver admitted liability and the injured driver was compensated.

==Applications==
Most manufacturing models will have a forensic component that monitors early failures to improve quality or efficiencies. Insurance companies use forensic engineers to prove liability or nonliability. Most engineering disasters ([[structural failure]]s such as bridge and building collapses) are subject to forensic investigation by engineers experienced in forensic methods of investigation. [[Rail crashes]], [[aviation accidents and incidents|aviation accidents]], and some [[car accident|automobile accidents]] are investigated by forensic engineers in particular where component failure is suspected. Furthermore, appliances, consumer products, medical devices, structures, industrial machinery, and even simple hand tools such as hammers or chisels can warrant investigations upon incidents causing injury or property damages. The failure of [[medical device]]s is often [[life-critical system|safety-critical]] to the user, so reporting failures and analysing them is particularly important. The environment of the body is complex, and [[implant (medicine)|implants]] must both survive this environment, and not leach potentially toxic impurities. Problems have been reported with [[breast implant]]s, [[heart valve]]s, and [[catheter]]s, for example.

Failures that occur early in the life of a new product are vital information for the manufacturer to improve the product. [[New product development]] aims to eliminate defects by testing in the factory before launch, but some may occur during its early life. Testing products to simulate their behavior in the external environment is a difficult skill, and may involve [[accelerated life testing]] for example. The worst kind of defect to occur after launch is a [[life-critical system|safety-critical]] defect, a defect that can endanger life or limb. Their discovery usually leads to a [[product recall]] or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Product defects often follow the [[bathtub curve]], with high initial failures, a lower rate during regular life, followed by another rise due to wear-out. National standards, such as those of [[ASTM International|ASTM]] and the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institute]], and [[International standard|International Standard]]s can help the designer in increasing product integrity.

==Historic examples==
[[Image:Dee bridge disaster.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Dee bridge disaster]].]]
There are many examples of forensic methods used to investigate accidents and disasters, one of the earliest in the modern period being the fall of the [[Dee bridge]] at [[Chester]], [[England]]. It was built using [[cast iron]] [[girder]]s, each of which was made of three very large castings dovetailed together. Each girder was strengthened by [[wrought iron]] bars along the length. It was finished in September 1846, and opened for local traffic after approval by the first Railway Inspector, General Charles Pasley. However, on 24 May 1847, a local train to [[Ruabon]] fell through the bridge. The accident resulted in five deaths (three passengers, the train guard, and the locomotive fireman) and nine serious injuries. The bridge had been designed by [[Robert Stephenson]], and he was accused of negligence by a local [[inquest]].

Although strong in compression, cast iron was known to be brittle in tension or bending. On the day of the accident, the bridge deck was covered with track ballast to prevent the oak beams supporting the track from catching fire, imposing a heavy extra load on the girders supporting the bridge and probably exacerbating the accident. Stephenson took this precaution because of a recent fire on the Great Western Railway at Uxbridge, London, where Isambard Kingdom Brunel's bridge caught fire and collapsed.

One of the first major inquiries conducted by the newly formed [[Railway Inspectorate]] was conducted by Captain Simmons of the [[Royal Engineers]], and his report suggested that repeated flexing of the girder weakened it substantially. He examined the broken parts of the main girder, and confirmed that the girder had broken in two places, the first break occurring at the center. He tested the remaining girders by driving a locomotive across them, and found that they deflected by several inches under the moving load. He concluded that the design was flawed, and that the wrought iron trusses fixed to the girders did not reinforce the girders at all, which was a conclusion also reached by the jury at the inquest. Stephenson's design had depended on the wrought iron trusses to strengthen the final structures, but they were anchored on the cast iron girders themselves, and so deformed with any load on the bridge. Others (especially Stephenson) argued that the train had derailed and hit the girder, the [[impact force]] causing it to [[fracture]]. However, [[Witness|eyewitnesses]] maintained that the girder broke first and the fact that the [[locomotive]] remained on the track showed otherwise.

==Publications==
Product failures are not widely published in the [[academic literature]] or trade literature, partly because companies do not want to advertise their problems. However, it then denies others the opportunity to improve product design so as to prevent further accidents. However, a notable exception to the reluctance to publish is the journal ''Engineering Failure Analysis'', which publishes case studies of a wide range of different products, failing under different circumstances. There are also an increasing number of textbooks becoming available.

Another notable publication, dealing with failures of buildings, bridges, and other structures, is the ''Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/cfo/ Scitation.aip.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
which is published by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], under the umbrella of its Technical Council on Forensic Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcfe.asce.org// tcfe.asce.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frozen Dead Guy Days''' (started 2002) is an [[festival|annual celebration]] held in the town of [[Nederland, Colorado]], to loosely celebrate the 1994 discovery of the [[Cryonics|cryonic state]] [[corpse]] of Bredo Morstoel.

==History==
In 1989, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] citizen named Trygve Bauge brought the corpse of his recently deceased grandfather, Bredo Morstøl, to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web | last = McPheeters | first = Sam | title = Home Cryonics in the Smirk Age | work = The Corpse | publisher = ViceLand.com | date = May 2010 | url = http://www.viceland.com/int/v17n5/htdocs/the-corpse-428.php | accessdate = 2010-05-11 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195908/http://www.viceland.com/int/v17n5/htdocs/the-corpse-428.php | archivedate = 2011-07-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The body was preserved on [[dry ice]] for the trip, and stored in [[liquid nitrogen]] at the Trans Time [[cryonics]] facility in San Leandro, California from 1990 to 1993.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

In 1993, Bredo was returned to dry ice and transported to the town of Nederland, where Trygve and his mother Aud planned to create a cryonics facility of their own. When Trygve was deported from the United States for overstaying his [[Visa (document)|visa]], his mother, Aud, continued keeping her father's body [[Cryonics|cryogenically frozen]] in a shack behind her unfinished house.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

Aud was eventually evicted from her home for living in a house with no electricity or plumbing, in violation of local ordinances.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;   At that time, she told a local reporter about her father's body, and those of two other individuals, and the reporter went to the local city hall in order to let them know about Aud's fears that her eviction would cause her father's body to thaw out.

According to an article in the February 7, 1995, ''Denver Post'', Aud Morstoel was found guilty by a jury of building-use and zoning violations.  The Nederland town judge ordered her to remove the frozen body of her father from Nederland by March 6 or face 10 days in jail and a $600.00 fine.

The story caused a sensation.  In response, the city added a broad new provision to Section 7-34 of its Municipal Code, "Keeping of bodies", outlawing the keeping of "the whole or any part of the person, body or carcass of a human being or animal or other biological species which is not alive upon any property".  However, because of the publicity that had arisen, they made an exception for Bredo, a [[grandfather clause]]. Trygve secured the services of Delta Tech, a local environmental company, to keep the cryonic facility running. Bo Shaffer, CEO of Delta Tech, was known locally as "The Iceman" and caretaker responsible for transporting the dry ice necessary for [[cryopreservation]] to the '''IC Institute''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = International Cryonics Institute and Center for Life Extension  | publisher = I.C.I.C.L.E.    | url = http://www.icinstitute.us/  | accessdate = 2010-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; something he has done since 1995.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Pappas |title=Frozen Dead Guy May Move to Michigan |url=https://www.livescience.com/23527-frozen-dead-guy-michigan-cryonics.html |date=September 27, 2012 |work=[[Live Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year, the local [[Tuff Shed]] supplier and a Denver radio station built a new shed to keep the body of Bredo in.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;   In the fall of 2012, Jane Curtis Gazit and Mike Wooten, took over as Bredo's caretakers, but they passed caretaking duties to Brad Wickham, a resident of Nederland, who is the current caretaker.

In honor of the town's unique resident, Nederland holds an annual celebration, first started in 2002.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

==Annual celebration==
[[File:FDGD signage alteration.jpg|Signage alteration at Frozen Dead Guy Days|left|thumb|180px]]
Frozen Dead Guy Days is typically celebrated on the first full weekend of March.  [[Coffin races]], a slow-motion parade, and "Frozen Dead Guy" lookalike contests are held.  A documentary on "Grandpa Bredo", called ''Grandpa's in the Tuff Shed'', is shown.  A newer version of the film, ''Grandpa's Still in the Tuff Shed'', was premiered in Nederland on March 7, 2003.&lt;ref name="FDGD"&gt;{{cite web | title = Frozen Dead Guy Days  | publisher = Nederland Chamber of Commerce   | url = http://nederlandchamber.org/events_fdgd-home.html | accessdate = 2010-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other events include a tour of the Tuff Shed where Grandpa is still frozen; a "polar plunge" for those brave enough to go swimming in Colorado in early March (which generally requires breaking through the ice); a dance, called "Grandpa's Blue Ball"; pancake breakfasts; a market showcasing local artists; [[snowshoe]] races, Snowy Human Foosball, Fix-A-Frozen-Flat competitions,and snow sculpture contests.  Glacier Ice Cream, headquartered in the nearby city of Boulder, makes a flavor specifically for the festival (named, appropriately enough, Frozen Dead Guy), consisting of fruit-flavored blue ice cream mixed with crushed Oreo cookies and sour gummy worms. Tours of the Tuff Shed where Grandpa is still frozen were suspended after 2005, after Grandpa's family "became frustrated with Frozen Dead Guy Days", but they resumed with the 2010 celebration.&lt;ref name="tours"&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Snider |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/archivesearch/ci_14430297 |title=Tours of frozen dead guy's Tuff Shed back on in Nederland |newspaper=[[Boulder Daily Camera]] |date=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Trygve and Aud filed a complaint against Nederland involving money and naming rights in 2005, Frozen Dead Guy Days is still alive; the most recent celebration was held March 9–11, 2018.

There has been a growing increase in interest in the festival and more attendees arrive every year, including fan films which highlight the backstory of the festival.

'''The Great Žemaičių Kalvarija Festival''' or '''The Great Samogitian Calvary Festival''' ({{lang-lt|Didieji Žemaičių Kalvarijos atlaidai}}) is a Roman Catholic festival dedicated to St. Mary. The festival is held annually and takes place every July in the small town of [[Žemaičių Kalvarija]] in [[Samogitia]], [[Lithuania]], attracting many pilgrims and tourists.

==History==
The Samogitian Calvary [[Way of the Cross]] was created by bishop [[Jurgis Tiškevičius]] in 1637. He replicated all [[Stations of the Cross]] precisely just as they appeared in [[Jerusalem]]. In 1937 record number of 100,000 pilgrims visited The Great Žemaičių Kalvarija Festival.

==Festival==

There are 21 [[Stations of the Cross]] in this town. Undertaking the stations of the cross is a very important procession for every Catholic, it should be done often or at least once in their lives. The Pope is the main guardian and supporter of this festival.

During the festival there are days dedicated to youth. Many events take place, which may serve spiritual needs of young people. There are special Masses held, dedicated to youth and children.

==Pilgrims==
The festival attracts many pilgrims from [[Samogitia]] and [[Lithuania]], many Catholic churches in Lithuania organize trips for people.

The '''[[Hanse]] Sail''' in [[Rostock]] is the largest maritime festival in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg]] ([[Germany]]) and one of the largest in [[Europe]].

About 250 traditional sailing ships of all types and sizes from a vast variety of countries visit the coast of the city of [[Rostock]] every year during the second weekend of August. Today, the Hanse Sail forms part of the joint ''Baltic Sail'', which takes place in several countries bordering the [[Baltic Sea]] during July and August.

== History ==
The first Hanse Sail took place between 22–28 July 1991.  Despite initial skepticism, the first Hanse Sail turned out to be a great success. This might have been mainly due to enthusiasm sparked by the [[German reunification]], as the sea border was open for the first time in decades.

Main attractions in past years were [[German Navy]]'s training ship ''[[Gorch Fock (1958)|Gorch Fock]]'', the ''[[Alexander von Humboldt (ship)]]'' and the ''Peace'' from [[Jamaica]].

Every Hanse Sail is usually opened by prominent personalities of the time such as [[Gerhard Schröder]] or [[Wolfgang Thierse]]. This underlines the importance of the event, also for the local tourism industry.

==Overview==
Every year about 1 million visitors visit the Hanse Sail. Even though it is accompanied by other cultural events, the ships remain the center of the festival. Besides watching ships, it is also possible to sail on them or enter them while they are anchored.

Many cruise ships head for the cruise port at [[Warnemünde]] during this time, because the shipping companies think that staying in Rostock during the Hanse Sail is a special highlight for their guests.

There are also sea planes and a helicopter parallel to the festival. They offer the opportunity to fly with them for about 20 minutes.

On the Saturday of the event there are [[firework]]s in Warnemünde and the city harbour.

The 2015 Hanse Sail featured steam ships also, and the event occurred in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanse.org/en/die-hanse-today/news/message/Rostock15HanseSail.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714230331/http://www.hanse.org/en/die-hanse-today/news/message/Rostock15HanseSail.php |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the 25th Hanse Sail since the start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanse.org/en/die-hanse-today/news/message/Rostock15HanseSail.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714230331/http://www.hanse.org/en/die-hanse-today/news/message/Rostock15HanseSail.php |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Hanse Sail Rostock 2015'') It was predicted something like 250 sailing ships would attend Hanse Sail in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/hanse-sail-rostock-sailing-ships-gather-on-the-baltic/a-18632856]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wide image|Panorama1.jpg|2000px|Panorama of a Hanse Sail from the [[Warnow]] coast}}

==Public transport==
[[File:S-Bahn Rostock push-pull-train.jpg|thumb|Expanded train service between [[Rostock]] and [[Warnemünde]]]]
Public transport is significantly increased during the event. Every 7.5 minutes, the [[S-Bahn]] plies between [[Rostock Hauptbahnhof]] (main station) and [[Warnemünde]] with up to five [[bilevel car]]s. Also many chartered trains come to Rostock, some even [[steam locomotive|steam]] powered, and [[Deutsche Bahn]] operates extra trains.

The tram and bus services in Rostock operate a special timetable and on some nights go 24 hours non stop. Due to limited parking lot capacity, a shuttle service with buses is offered to bring people to Warnemünde.

==Funding==
Sponsors have included ''Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock'' (German brewery), ''Ostdeutscher Sparkassenverbund'', and ''OstseeSparkasse Rostock''. Further sources of revenue are letting of boat parking spaces and trading places on markets as well as commercial advertising.

The City of [[Rostock]] supports the Hanse Sail financially, because the city largely profits from the event. During the sail, most hotels are usually fully booked and visitors spend money in the town, in pubs and shops. Last, but not least, the sail is good promotion for Rostock and a good percentage of Hanse Sail visitors usually return for a holiday{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}.

'''Ixi lang''' is a programming language for [[live coding]] musical expression.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Thor (2011) ixi lang: a SuperCollider parasite for live coding. In: International Computer Music Conference, 31 July – 5 August 2011, University of Huddersfield, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=Alan|last2=McLean|first2=Alex|last3=Noble|first3=James|last4=Rohrhuber|first4=Julian|date=2014-01-01|editor-last=Blackwell|editor-first=Alan|editor2-last=McLean|editor2-first=Alex|editor3-last=Noble|editor3-first=James|editor4-last=Rohrhuber|editor4-first=Julian|title=Collaboration and learning through live coding (Dagstuhl Seminar 13382)|url=http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2014/4420|journal=Dagstuhl Reports|volume=3|issue=9|pages=130–168|doi=10.4230/DagRep.3.9.130|issn=2192-5283}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is taught at diverse levels of musical education and used in [[Algorave]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mixmag.net/feature/algorave|title=Algorave: The live coding movement that makes next-level electronic music|work=Mixmag|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other [[live coding]] languages, such [[TidalCycles]], ixi lang is a [[domain-specific language]] that embraces simplicity and constraints in design.

In 2015, ixi lang was presented at the Loop summit, organised by the music software manifacturer [[Ableton]], where it gained critical acclaim as an alternative way of making music in the studio as well as in live performance. Mark Smith, of techno-duo Garland writes about the language: "By entering the name of a sound, drawing your own bars and typing notes with numbers, you can make simple beats and melodies almost immediately. If you memorise a few different command lines a broad range of modulations and structural changes becomes possible. Whatever simple information you entered beforehand becomes hugely pliable – and you can do all this to your own uploaded bank of samples. Given that just about anyone can get up and running with a few minutes, those who are willing to put their time into live coding software like ixi lang can reach highly intuitive and fluid levels of improvised composition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/new-frontiers-of-music-tech/|title=New Frontiers of Music Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ableton.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ixi lang is used internationally, for example by members of the Quase-Linema Lab collective in Brazil, Belisha Beacon, Section 9 and Deerful in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deerful.bandcamp.com/album/tell-me-i-can-fix-this-on-my-own|title=Tell Me I Can Fix This On My Own|last=Winston|first=Emma|date=|website=deerful.bandcamp.com|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by the Paris-based Sougata Bhattacharya.

&lt;!--Place new entries under the name of the country nearest where the wreck occurred or where the wreck is thought to lie. DO NOT place them under the country whose flag the vessel sailed under--&gt;

[[File:Waratah1909.jpg|350px|thumb|[[SS Waratah|SS ''Waratah'']] and its 211 crew and passengers were last heard from on 27 July 1909. Its wreck has yet to be found.]]
This is a '''list of missing ships''' and '''wrecks'''. If it is known that the [[ship]] in question sank, then its [[shipwreck|wreck]] has not yet been located.

Ships are usually declared lost and assumed wrecked after a period of disappearance. The disappearance of a ship usually implies all hands lost. Without witnesses or survivors, the mystery surrounding the fate of missing ships has inspired many items of [[urban legend|nautical lores]] and the creation of [[paranormal]] zones such as the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. In many cases a probable cause has been deduced, such as a known [[storm]] or [[Naval warfare|warfare]], but it could not be confirmed without witnesses or sufficient documentation.

Many disappearances occurred before [[wireless telegraphy]] became available in [[navigation]] applications in the late 1890s, which would have allowed [[Sailor|crew]] to send a [[SOS|distress call]]. Sudden disasters such as military strike, collision, [[rogue wave]], or [[piracy]] could also prevent a crew from sending a distress call and reporting a location.

Among the many missing ships on the list are [[submarine]]s, which have [[communication with submarines|limited communication]], and provide the crew almost no chance of survival if struck by disaster under water.

The [[History of radar|advancement of radar]] technology by the end of [[World War II]] and today's [[Global Positioning System]] make it more likely that a distressed vessel will be located.

Most vessels currently listed as missing disappeared over a vast search area and/or [[Abyssal plain|deep water]] and there is little commercial interest in searching for the vessels and [[marine salvage|salvaging]] the contents. Often the search and recovery costs are prohibitive even with today's [[sonar]] and [[wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]] technologies and could not be compensated by [[Treasure hunting (marine)|salvaged valuables]], even if there were any on board. The search for these types of missing vessels is usually motivated by [[maritime history|historical]], [[lawsuit|legal]] or [[insurance|actuarial]] interests requiring the aid of government funding such as in the [[Search for HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|2008 discovery of HMAS ''Sydney'' and ''Kormoran'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://smh.com.au/articles/2005/08/14/1123957949752.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=PM offers reward to find sunken warship |date=15 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umEP1Ijj?url=http://smh.com.au/articles/2005/08/14/1123957949752.html |archivedate=6 December 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list is organised by the marine region in which the disappearance or sinking occurred, or the closest country to the area. The year of the disappearance, last known location, and possible location of the wreck are included.

&lt;b&gt;Meetup&lt;/b&gt; is a service used to organize online groups that host in-person events for people with similar interests. Meetup was founded in 2002 by CEO Scott Heiferman and four co-founders. It was popularized by Howard Dean’s 2004 political campaign. The company was acquired by WeWork in 2017 and remains headquartered in New York City.

===Early history===
Meetup was founded in June 2002&lt;ref name="Sifry CNN 2011"&gt;{{cite web | last=Sifry | first=Micah | last2=CNN | first2=Special to | title=From Howard Dean to the tea party: The power of Meetup.com | website=CNN | date=November 7, 2011 | url=https://www.cnn.com/2011/11/07/tech/web/meetup-2012-campaign-sifry/index.html | accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knight" /&gt; by Scott Heiferman and five co-founders.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web | last=Review | first=MIT Technology | title=Innovator Under 35: Scott Heiferman, 32 | website=MIT Technology Review | url=http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr35/profile.aspx?TRID=151 | accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans 2011"&gt;{{cite web | last=Evans | first=Teri | title=Meetup's Scott Heiferman on Connecting Communities | website=Entrepreneur | date=June 7, 2011 | url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219753 | accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for Meetup came from Heiferman meeting his neighbors in New York City for the first time after the September 11 attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]].&lt;ref name="Benz 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Benz | first=Kate | title=Pittsburgh Meetup members use the Internet to get off the Internet | website=TribLIVE.com | date=January 23, 2014 | url=http://triblive.com/lifestyles/morelifestyles/5356571-74/meetup-group-internet | accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2011"&gt;{{cite web | first=Lavanya|last=Ramanathan|title=One week of Meetups | website=Washington Post | date=October 13, 2011 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/one-week-of-meetups/2011/09/27/gIQAFUUNhL_story.html | accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heiferman was also influenced by the book [[Bowling Alone]],&lt;ref name="fortune2003" /&gt; which is about the deterioration of community in American culture.&lt;ref name="Gordinier 2008 p. 161"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gordinier | first=J. | title=X Saves the World: How Generation X Got the Shaft But Can Still Keep Everything from Sucking | publisher=Viking | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-670-01858-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynkQg9myKHIC&amp;pg=PA161 | accessdate=March 14, 2018 | page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some initial funding for the venture was raised from friends and family, which was followed by a funding round with angel investors.&lt;ref name="Jeffries 2011"&gt;{{cite web | last=Jeffries | first=Adrianne | title=The Long and Curious History of Meetup.com | website=Observer | date=January 21, 2011 | url=http://observer.com/2011/01/the-long-and-curious-history-of-meetupcom/ | accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early version of Meetup generated revenues by charging a fee to venues in exchange for bringing Meetup users to their business.&lt;ref name="early"&gt;{{cite news|title=Web Site Links up Like Minds|newspaper=The Atlanta Journal|first=Helena|last=Oliviero|date=November 25, 2002|page=E.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once enough users added themselves to a group, Meetup would send the group members an email, asking them to vote on one of three sponsoring venues for the group to meet at.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I’m on the List: Virtual Communities: Not Just for Loners Anymore|url=https://nypost.com/2002/12/08/im-on-the-list-virtual-communities-not-just-for-loners-anymore/|newspaper=The New York Post|first=Sarah|last=Gilbert|date=December 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few months of Meetup launching, 56,000 users had joined the site.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interest Grows in Raleigh, N.C., around Offline Social Gatherings|first=Jonathan|last=Cox|newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News|date=October 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fortune2003" /&gt;

Meetup was originally intended to focus on hobbies and interests,&lt;ref name="Sifry CNN 2011" /&gt; but it was popularized by Presidential hopeful [[Howard Dean]].&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt; Meetup developed paid services to help Dean campaign to Meetup users.&lt;ref name="fortune2003" /&gt; Dean also publicized Meetup groups of supporters in his speeches and on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MeetUp.com Working to Become a Force in Local, State Politics|first=Chris|last=Gray|newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune|date=February 11, 2004|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-113163315.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of Dean's campaign, 143,000 users had joined Meetup groups for Dean supporters.&lt;ref name="Sifry CNN 2011" /&gt; Afterwards, Meetup became a routine part of internet campaigning for American politicians.&lt;ref name="fortune2003"&gt;{{cite news|title= Taking America Offline|first=Maggie|last=Overfelt|newspaper=Fortune Small Business|date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="india"&gt;{{cite news|title= Candidates Hope Voters Meetup.com|newspaper=Indianapolis Star|date=September 2003|page=B.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">{{Competition law}}
In [[US antitrust law]], '''monopolization''' is an illegal and the main categories of prohibited behavior include [[exclusive dealing]], [[price discrimination]], refusing to supply an [[essential facility]], [[product tying]] and [[predatory pricing]]. Monopolization is an offense under Section 2 of the American [[Sherman Antitrust Act 1890]]. It has a specific legal meaning, which is parallel to the "abuse" of a dominant position in [[EU competition law]], under [[TFEU article 102]]. The Sherman Act 1890 §2 states that any person "who shall monopolize . . . any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations shall be deemed guilty of a [[felony]]."  Section 2 also forbids "attempts to monopolize" and "conspiracies to monopolize". Generally this means that corporations may not act in ways that have been identified as contrary to precedent cases.

==Jurisprudential meaning==
Under long-established precedent, the offense of monopolization under Section 2 has two elements.  First, that the defendant possesses [[monopoly]] power in a properly-defined [[Market (economics)|market]] and second that the defendant obtained or maintained that power through conduct deemed unlawfully exclusionary.  The mere fact that conduct disadvantages rivals does not, without more, constitute the sort of exclusionary conduct that satisfies this second element. Instead, such conduct must exclude rivals on some basis other than efficiency.

For several decades courts drew the line between efficient and inefficient exclusion by asking whether the conduct under scrutiny was "competition on the merits". Courts equated such competition on the merits with unilateral conduct such as product improvement, the realization of economies of scale, innovation, and the like.  Such conduct was lawful per se, since it constituted the normal operation of economic forces that a free economy should encourage.  At the same time, courts condemned as "unlawful exclusion" [[tying (commerce)|tying]] contracts, [[exclusive dealing]], and other agreements that disadvantaged rivals.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[United States v. United Machinery Co.]]'', 110 F. 295 (D. Mass. 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction reflected the economic theory of the time, which saw no beneficial purposes for what Professor [[Oliver Williamson]] has called non-standard contracts.

More recently, courts have retained the safe harbor&lt;ref&gt;On the evolution of safe harbors, see Thibault Schrepel, A New Structured Rule of Reason Approach for High-Tech Markets, Suffolk University Law Review, Vol. 50, No. 1, 2017 at https://ssrn.com/abstract=2908838&lt;/ref&gt; for "competition on the merits".  Moreover, the Supreme Court has clarified the standards governing claims of predatory pricing.  At the same time, they have relaxed the standards governing other conduct by monopolists.  For instance, non-standard contracts that exclude rivals are now lawful if supported by a "valid business reason", unless the plaintiff can establish that the defendant could achieve the same benefits by means of a less restrictive alternative.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|504|451|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7005">'''Māori Language Week''' ({{lang-mi|Te Wiki o te Reo Māori}}) is a government-sponsored initiative intended to encourage [[New Zealand]]ers to promote the use of the [[Māori language]], which, along with English and [[New Zealand Sign Language]], is an official language of the country. Māori Language Week is part of a broader [[Māori language revival|revival of the Māori language]].

It has been celebrated since 1975 and is currently spearheaded by [[Te Puni Kōkiri]] (the Ministry of Māori Development) and the [[Māori Language Commission]], with many organizations including schools, libraries, and government departments participating.

On August 2, 2015, to celebrate Māori Language Week, the [[New Zealand national cricket team|Black Caps]] (the New Zealand national cricket team) played under the name of [[Aotearoa]] for their first match [[New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2015|against Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="Aotearoa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-new-zealand-2015/content/story/903551.html |title=New Zealand to play as Aotearoa |accessdate=27 July 2015 |work=ESPNCricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Niadh Nask''' was a [[Self-styled orders|self-styled]] [[nobility|nobiliary]] association devised by the [[self-styled]] [[MacCarthy Mór]], [[Terence Francis MacCarthy]]. It was alleged to be a nobiliary [[Chivalric order|fraternity]] which developed from the old warrior-guard of the [[Kings of Munster]]. In reality there is no evidence of the existence of an organized body of that name before ca. 1990. The group dissolved when it was proven that its Grand Master claimed a false pedigree. He resigned in 1999. It was also determined at this time that the association had no historical precedent.

In 2007, a site was set up by an unknown McCarthy to re-commission the Niadh Nask as a Chivalric order but failed. The site - www.niadhnask.weebly.com - has been shut down. However, the order has recently been reformed under the basis of a non-profit organization designed to promote Gaelic culture.

== Nia Naisc ==

The '''Nia Naisc''' was a Scottish re-creation of the fake Irish order created by MacCarthy in the 1980s.

The '''OM Festival''' was a community-based [[summer solstice]] festival that ran annually in southern [[Ontario]] from 1998 to 2004. The festival, organized by Sumkidz (now [http://www.sumantics.org/ Suma]), primarily featured [[electronic music]] as well as [[dance]], workshops, [[art]], and other forms of acoustic music. It encouraged its attendees to participate by [[volunteering]] and promoted free expression and a no-spectator, leave-no-trace philosophy. At its peak, Om drew in just over 3000 participants from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omreunionproject.org OmReunionProject.org] (ORP)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Nesscircle6126.jpg|thumb|left|200px|OM Circle at the Reunion 2007.  Visible also are [[data projection]] screen in background and [[hydraulophone]] in center of OM Circle.]]
The event had multiple stages, a free community kitchen which produced thousands of meals throughout the weekend, a healing area, and an educational hub where people shared ideas and offered hundreds of workshops on everything from knitting to independent media.

The annual gathering attracted people who enjoyed electronic music, considered themselves knowledge-seekers, environmentalists, spiritual travelers and other individuals who sought the enlightenment of the human spirit. The festival also supported many musicians (primarily electronic) and artists from across Canada and internationally as well as a wide range of collectives, offering them the opportunity and funds to produce and showcase their own work and skills to a large and diverse audience.

Ideals espoused by the core group of festival organizers and participants were togetherness, [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]], [[volunteering]] and spiritual tolerance and exploration.

Former festival attendees and Message Board members sometimes called themselves Omies.

The final Om Festival occurred in 2004. It ended as a result of many factors. Provincial politics and false media surrounding the booming electronic music scene at the time made it increasingly difficult to produce outdoor gatherings of that magnitude. An unsustainable, volunteer-based organizational structure that required many coordinators to work, unpaid, on a nearly full-time basis for months at a time was another significant factor.

[[Image:Nesscircle6142.jpg|thumb|200px|OM Circle at the Reunion 2007]]
The Festival was organized and maintained by [[Sumkidz]] (now known as "Suma"), a [[collective]] of artists and activists living in and around [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].

==Community==
The organizers of the festival, aside from volunteering themselves, relied on hundreds of additional volunteers to make everything happen. Volunteers would attend meetings in Toronto several weeks prior to the festivities, and roles would be assigned, thus cultivating deeper and more meaningful relationships and community connections.

Volunteers chose to work in the [[Kind Kitchen]], on foot patrol (security and first aid), in the child care areas, on cleanup, or in several other positions. Those who gave their time and effort to sustain the festival received a reduced ticket price, although they did not pay for their T-shirt identifying them as OM crew.

==Om Reunion Project==
After the final Om Festival in 2004, several members of Sumkidz, along with many individuals from the larger Om Community, formed the OM Reunion Project (ORP) and began to organize a more intimate and less structured summer solstice gathering. The first such gathering was held in 2005 (called "Re:union"), followed by "In:tent" in 2006, "Re:treat" in 2007, "In:sight" in 2008, "Re:Leaf" in 2009, "In:fuse" in 2010, and "Re:Generate" in 2011 and, as of 2013, is simply called "Solstice". The festival runs for one week, Monday through Monday, on the week which includes the summer solstice. The Om Reunion Project is an intentional community event and goes beyond a "party". All participants must register for the gathering in advance and are responsible for making the gathering happen. Every attendee is required to volunteer, and everyone is encouraged to share their skills, whether it be music, dance, art, food, education or anything else. While, on many levels, ORP has created a differently focused community, it has also pushed away former Om attendees and participants that do not place the same importance on these grass-roots values. Regardless, ORP has encouraged new participants and community willing to pour their creative and intentional energies into the new gathering. ORP continues to grow and evolve each summer solstice in the spirit of the former Om Festival and provides an inspiring and educational retreat for many 'Omies' old and new.

Following the beginning of the [[Yugoslav wars]], especially the [[War in Croatia]] in 1991, members of [[Serbian Radical Party]] and [[Serbian Chetnik Movement]] have been accused to have conducted a campaign of intimidation and [[persecution]] of [[Croats of Serbia]] in [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]], through [[hate speech]] and threats by various parties, including by the [[ICTY]] and [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="indictment"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Prosecutor against Vojislav Seselj - Third Amended Indictment |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/ind/en/seslj3rdind071207e.pdf |publisher=ICTY| author=|date=December 2007 |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts, established pursuant to UN Security Council resolution 780"/&gt; These acts forced a part of the local Croat population to leave the area in 1992.

[[Vojvodina]] is a province of [[Serbia]]. According to the 1991 census, its population was 2,012,517.

In 1991, [[Hrtkovci]] was an ethnically mixed village with [[Croat]]ian plurality (40.24%), located roughly 40 miles west of Belgrade. [[Vojislav Šešelj]], the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, made numerous public threats to Croats in May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.helsinki.org.rs/serbian/tpseselj_t06.html | language = Serbian | title = Slučaj Šešelj - Vojislav Šešelj - Izjave | publisher = [[Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia]] | date = | accessdate = 2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/warning-that-couldn%E2%80%99t-be-ignored.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=11575 | title = Warning that couldn't be ignored | publisher = Sense Agency | date = 2010-02-16 | accessdate = 2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radicals replaced all Latin signs with Cyrillic ones and even renamed Hrtkovci to "Srbislavci" - 'place of Serbs' - though only for a short amount of time.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; Šešelj personally visited Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992 and gave a [[hate speech]] by publicly reading out a list of 17 Croat "traitors" who must leave the village.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/drastic-change-s-in-ethnic-composition-of-population.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=10984|title=Drastic Changes in Ethnic Composition of Population|date=21 October 2008|publisher=Sense Agency|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts, established pursuant to UN Security Council resolution 780"/&gt; Incoming Serb refugees labeled Croats as "fascists".&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

In its 1993 report, published during its 49th session, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] wrote that [[Hungarians in vojvodina|Hungarians]] and Croats in Vojvodina were subjected to "verbal and physical threats and other acts of intimidation, including setting houses on fire and destroying cultural and religious monuments", and thus left their homes in large numbers after Vojvodina lost its [[autonomy]].

The villages of [[Beška]] and [[Golubinci]] were said to have lost their entire respective Croat population. Other means of intimidation included threatening telephone calls and letters. The report alleged that "the police have acquiesced in some of the incidents which have been attributed
to individuals."&lt;ref name="Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia"/&gt; On 23 February 1993, the Commission adopted a resolution expressing its "grave concern" at the "violations of human rights occurring in [[Sandžak]] and Vojvodina, particularly acts of physical harassment, abductions, the burning of homes, warrantless searches, confiscation of property and other practices intended to change the ethnic structure in favour of the Serbian population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations Commission on Human Rights |title=Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia—49th session| date=23 February 1993| url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3b00f2300.html|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 1992, the BBC reported bombings of Croatian homes in the village of [[Nikinci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology for Croats in Yugoslavia|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38f41e.html|publisher=Minorities at Risk Project|date=2004|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Golubinci, twenty cases were recorded where bombs were planted inside Croat houses. A 28-year old Croat woman was killed in her home on 7 February 1994.&lt;ref name="CDCS"/&gt;

According to different sources, between 10,000&lt;ref name="RFERL"/&gt; and 25,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Economist |volume= 336 |issue=7926-7929 |p=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-vtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=25,000+croats+left+vojvodina&amp;dq=25,000+croats+left+vojvodina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|year=1995|publisher=Economist Newspaper Limited|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croats left Vojvodina in the 1990s.

==Legal prosecution==
In 2003, [[Vojislav Šešelj]] was indicted by the U.N. established [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY). On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber sentenced him to 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating [[deportation]], [[persecution]] ([[forcible displacement]]), and other inhumane acts ([[forcible transfer]]) as [[crimes against humanity]] due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmict.org/en/news/appeals-chamber-reverses-%C5%A1e%C5%A1elj%E2%80%99s-acquittal-part-and-convicts-him-crimes-against-humanity|title=APPEALS CHAMBER REVERSES ŠEŠELJ’S ACQUITTAL, IN PART, AND CONVICTS HIM OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY| date=11 April 2018| publisher=United Nations Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/europe/un-court-sentences-ultranationalist-serb-leader-to-10-years-16638|title=UN court sentences ultranationalist Serb leader to 10 years |publisher=[[TRT World]] |accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/serbia-conviction-of-war-criminal-delivers-long-overdue-justice-to-victims/|title=Serbia: Conviction of war criminal delivers long overdue justice to victims| publisher=Amnesty International| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phenoxypropazine''' (trade name '''Drazine''') is an [[irreversible inhibition|irreversible]] and non-[[binding selectivity|selective]] [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI) of the [[hydrazine]] family. It was introduced as an [[antidepressant]] in 1961, but was subsequently withdrawn in 1966 due to [[hepatotoxicity]] concerns.&lt;ref name="pmid13928824"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = LEAHY MR, ROSE JT, PLOWMAN R | title = A preliminary study of phenoxypropazine in the treatment of depression | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 986–7 |date=April 1963 | pmid = 13928824 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.119.10.986 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=13928824}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13956423"&gt;{{cite journal | author = IMLAH NW | title = Preliminary report on phenoxypropazine | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 1091–2 |date=May 1963 | pmid = 13956423 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.119.11.1091 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=13956423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14069469"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ROSE JT, LEAHY MR, PLOWMAN R | title = A comparison of phenoxypropazine and amitriptyline in depression | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 120 | issue = | pages = 393–5 |date=October 1963 | pmid = 14069469 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.120.4.393 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14069469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14129290"&gt;{{cite journal | author = ROSE JT | title = Phenoxypropazine and chlordiazepoxide in depression | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 120 | issue = | pages = 899–900 |date=March 1964 | pmid = 14129290 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.120.9.899 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14129290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14254271"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MCWHINNEY IR, MORRELL DC | title = Treatment of mild endogenous depression with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor: a controlled trial in general practice | journal = The Journal of the College of General Practitioners | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 95–9 |date=January 1965 | pmid = 14254271 | pmc = 1878242 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2509">The '''Reserve Primary Fund''' was a large [[money fund|money market mutual fund]].

On September 16, 2008, during the [[Global financial crisis of September–October, 2008]], it lowered its share price below $1 ("[[Money market fund#Breaking the buck|breaking the buck]]") because of exposure to [[Lehman Brothers]] debt securities. This resulted in demands from investors to return their funds as the financial crisis mounted.&lt;ref name = 'NYT-Bernard-2008-09-17 '&gt;  
[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/yourmoney/18money.html "Money Market Funds Enter a World of Risk"] article by Tara Siegel Bernard in ''[[The New York Times]] September 17, 2008
&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the [[net asset value]] of money market funds is kept at $1. 

Reserve Management had multiple other funds frozen because of this failure.  It has liquidated a few funds, and post periodic updates about plans to liquidate other funds on its website.

As of October 27, 2009, more than $3.5 billion sat in the Primary fund, most in a special reserve held aside to be used for costs and expenses, including legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091109-719631.html Attorney: Court Order On Primary Fund's Unwinding Days Away]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spindles Farm''' was a farm in [[Hyde Heath]], near [[Amersham]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], run by horse dealer James Gray (also known as Jamie Gray).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Five guilty of neglecting horses|date=2009-05-08|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/8037719.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the location of a significant [[animal cruelty]] case in 2008 where dozens of [[horse]]s were neglected, some being left to starve to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Animals 'left to starve' at farm|date=2008-12-09|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/7773639.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mail1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Daily Mail|title=Spindles Farm rescued ponies must feel they've landed in horse heaven|last=Fryer|first=Jane|date=2008-01-10|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-507513/Spindles-Farm-rescued-ponies-feel-theyve-landed-horse-heaven.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident was described as "the worst case ever experienced by the RSPCA" by the judge at the resulting court trial.&lt;ref name=bucks&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bucks Free Press|title=Warrant issued for arrest of Spindles Farm owner James Gray|date=2010-05-12|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/8161528.Horse_trader_disappears_from_court_before_sentencing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal cruelty discovery==

Inspectors from the [[RSPCA]] visited the farm on Friday 4 January 2008 to discover more than 125 horses, ponies and donkeys in a state of neglect at the farm,&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Five charged with animal cruelty|date=2008-03-17|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/7300509.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a further 32 dead equines also found amongst those horses still alive.&lt;ref name=hh2&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Horse and Hound|title=Gray family found guilty of cruelty to Spindles Farm horses again|last=White|first=Charlotte|date=2010-05-06|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/397/297726.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large scale rescue operation was mounted by the [[RSPCA]] along with [[World Horse Welfare]] and [[Redwings Horse Sanctuary]] and took eight days to complete,&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; due to the number of horses involved and their condition.
On 12 and 13 January 2008, 
115 equines were removed from the property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Horse and Hound|title=Disgraced horse dealer James Gray's Spindles Farm is up for sale|last=Mathieson|first=Amy|date=2010-04-28|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/397/297396.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; with others having to be put down on site. 

{{cquote|After seeing the conditions in the fields, it wasn't until I went into the yard that the enormity of it hit me. There were dead horses on the ground in front of me, and to the right. I looked across there was a dead horse in the stalls. It was like walking into another world. There were none of the normal noises I associate with a stable yard - horses moving about, eating, drinking, calling out to one another or the gentle noises that horses make when approached, expecting to be fed or cared for. They were totally silent. Even the horses that appeared in better bodily condition seemed to be depressed, almost as if they had lost their dignity.|4=Nick White|5=World Horse Welfare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Horse Welfare|title=Amersham update: James Gray goes on the run as family lose appeal|date=2010-05-12|url=http://www.worldhorsewelfare.org/information/latest-news?view=show&amp;content_id=3660}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For two days on 12 &amp; 13 January 2008, a nine-year-old girl called Katy Roberts who has [[hemiplegia]] held a silent protest outside the gates of Spindles Farm in protest at the cruelty that had, at that time, been alleged to have taken place there, and later protested outside the hearing at Aylesbury Magistrates court and set up a website detailing events. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=This is local London|last=Evans|first=Oliver|title=Girl makes protest over horse death farm|date=2008-01-16|url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/1971225.Girl_makes_protest_over_horse_death_farm/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bucks Free Press|title=Katy 'ecstatic' at Spindles Farm verdict|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/localnews/amersham/4364690.Delight_for_Katy__11__after_animal_cruelty_verdict/|date=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=KatyRoberts.co.uk|title=Katy's Web site|url=http://www.katyroberts.co.uk/animal_welfare/animal_welfare.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court action==
In June 2009, the owner of the farm, horse trader James John Gray (Jamie Gray) was sentenced to six months imprisonment, fined £400,000 and banned from keeping horses for life, the maximum penalty available to the court for the nine cases of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and two charges of failing to protect animals from pain, injury, suffering and disease.&lt;ref name=hh1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Horse and Hound|last=Butcher|first=Abigail|date=2009-06-12|title=James Gray jailed for six months and banned from keeping horses|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/397/284470.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Gray's son, James Junior, was also convicted on identical charges to his father, although with a sentence of an 18-month supervision order and a ten-year ban on keeping horses. His wife, Julie, and 2 young daughters Jodie and Cordelia were also found guilty of two counts of failing to protect the animals, all being sentenced to 10-year bans on keeping horses and community service.&lt;ref name=hh1/&gt;

The family appealed against their sentences in May 2010, but James Gray, his wife and daughters all had their convictions upheld. James Junior was acquitted of two offences, but was found guilty of all the remaining offences.&lt;ref name=hh2/&gt;

James Gray absconded court while awaiting sentencing on 12 May 2010 and went on the run, with a warrant issued for his arrest.&lt;ref name=bucks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Animal cruelty horse man absconds in Buckinghamshire|date=2010-05-12|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/8678433.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was arrested 2 weeks later on 26 May, during a random spot check  by police between junctions 4a and 5 on the M5 near [[Bromsgrove]], [[Worcestershire]].

'''Tak Bat Devo''' ({{lang-th|ตักบาตรเทโว}}) is a Buddhist festival that is celebrated annually in [[Central Thailand]] a day after [[Wan Ok Phansa]], the 1st day of the 11th waning moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chadchaidee |first=Thanapol "Lamduan"|title=Essays on Thailand |publisher=Booksmango |date=2013 |pages=5-7 |chapter=Tak Bat Devo and Chak Phra Festivals |chapterurl= https://books.google.co.th/books?id=Zk4dAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;This is the celebration in order of [[Lord Buddha]]’s return to [[Earth]] after delivering a semon to his dead mother in heaven.

== Etymology ==

"Tak Bat" ({{lang-th|ตักบาตร}}) means "to present food to a monk or Buddhist priest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/134176 ตัก dtak ''thai-language.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; "Devo" ({{lang-th|เทโว}}) is derived from the word "Theworona" ({{lang-th|เทโวโรหนะ}}) which is "The Buddhas descent from the celestial world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/157585 เทโวโรหนะ theworona ''thai-language.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== The starting point of Tak Bat Thewo ==
In the seventh year after Lord Buddha’s intuition, he decided to give a semon to his dead mother, Sirimahamaya, in Dusit heaven, so he stayed in the heaven for three months from Khao Phansa day to Ok Phansa day. On Ok Phansa day, the 15th day of the 11th waxing moon, Lord Buddha had come back to Earth and made the miracle that all realms (heaven, human, and hell) can see each other while he was going down. The next morning, most citizens made a big "Tak Bat" event as they had not seen Lord Buddha for almost three months. That event was originally called "Tak Bat Theworohana", but as the time passed, it had derived to only "Tak Bat Thewo". To memorize that event, people made it a festival till now.

==The meaning of Theworohana==
	Theworohana means coming down from the heaven of Lord Buddha. It is the part of Buddha’s life. The legend said that, when he come back, Indra had made three ladders for him (gold, silver, and crystal). Their heads were put on the top of a mountain and their bases were at the door of Sanggas Nakorn city. When Lord Buddha come down, he used the crystal ladder while the angels used gold ladder and the archangels used silver ladder. That is called Theworohana.

==Special of Tak Bat Thewo==
	Tak Bat Thewo is the special day that they will install the statue of Buddha on a small moving boat and with a monk's alms bowl in the front. There will be some person pulling it slowly while the monks walk in line in the back and the buddish sit on the side and throw the rice balls into that bowl, which is at the front of the statue. Some people will take some semon in the temple too.

==Tak Bat Thewo in Thailand==
	In Thailand there are countries which do Tak Bat Thewo festival, such as:
1.In [[Uthai Thani]] at [[Wat Sangkat Rattanakhiri]], there are about 500 monks walking 449 steps of the staircase down from Sakaekrang hill to receive alms from locals and tourists.
2.In [[Chonburi (city)|Chon Buri]], monks walk in a long line around the Muang district to join Tak Bat Thewo festival.
3.In [[Buri Ram]], about two thousand people joined in merit-making ritual with 199 monks in this festival.

[[File:Milano teatro Carcano.JPG|thumb|The entrance to the Teatro Carcano photographed in 2014]] 
The '''Teatro Carcano''' is a theatre in [[Milan]], Italy located at 63 Corso di Porta Romana. Although now exclusively devoted to plays and dance, it served as an opera house for much of the 19th century and saw the premieres of several important operas. Completed in 1803, the theatre was commissioned by the Milanese aristocrat and theatre-lover Giuseppe Carcano and originally designed by [[Luigi Canonica]]. Over the succeeding two centuries it has undergone several restructurings and renovations and for time in the mid-20th century functioned as a cinema.

==History==
The Teatro Carcano was commissioned by the Milanese aristocrat and theatre-lover Giuseppe Carcano who entrusted the project to the young architect [[Luigi Canonica]]. Planning began in 1801 and construction began the following year. On 3 September 1803 the theatre was inaugurated with the world premieres of two works by the composer [[Vincenzo Federici]]—the opera ''Zaira'' with a libretto by Mattia Butturini and the ballet ''Alfredo il Grande'' with choreography by Paolo Franchi.&lt;ref&gt;Casaglia, Gherardo (2005). [http://www.amadeusonline.net/almanacco?r=&amp;alm_sett=&amp;alm_giorno=3&amp;alm_mese=9&amp;alm_anno=1803&amp;alm_testo= "3 settembre 1803"]. Almanacco Amadeus. Retrieved 14 October 2015 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "360degrees"&gt;Olivari, Stefano and Brasca, Giulia (2015). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tHrxCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA332 ''Milan 360°], pp. 332–333. OlliService Multimedia&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carcano was built on the site of the former convent of San Lazzaro in the [[Porta Romana (Milan)|Porta Romana district]] of Milan. It was modelled on the two most important public theatres in the city, [[La Scala]] (built in 1778) and the [[Teatro Lirico (Milan)|Teatro alla Cannobiana]] (built in 1779).&lt;ref name = "360degrees" /&gt; Like those theatres it was designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style with a horseshoe-shaped auditorium and four tiers of boxes. In total, it could accommodate 1500 spectators. The interior was lavishly decorated in stucco and gold leaf with frescoes and a large ceiling [[Medallion (architecture)|medallion]] over the auditorium. Contemporary descriptions of the opening performances praised not only the decor but also the extensive illumination provided for the stage. The theatre had its own restaurant and [[pâtisserie]], and in 1806 a gambling casino was added.&lt;ref name = "Lynn"&gt;Lynn, Karyl Charna (2005). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eQK2AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 ''Italian Opera Houses and Festivals''], pp. 41–43. Scarecrow Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gutierrez" /&gt;

The theatre was modernized and partially restructured in 1872 by the Milanese architect [[Achille Sfondrini]]. Opera and classical music concerts continued to be performed throughout the 19th century, although the premieres were increasingly by lesser known composers and the programming was expanded to include prose drama, band concerts, and circuses. By 1904 the theatre, which was essentially constructed of wood was pronounced a serious fire hazard and closed. It was almost completely demolished and then rebuilt in stone to a design by Nazzareno Moretti. The resurrected theatre reopened in 1914.

==Notable performances and premieres==
The Teatro Carcano saw the Milan premiere of Verdi's ''[[La battaglia di Legnano]]'' (1859); the first concert of Wagner's music to be given in the city (conducted by [[Franco Faccio]], 1883); and the Italian premiere of Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'' (1893).&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Hans (ed.) (1997).

Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The actress [[Eleonora Duse]] appeared before Milanese audiences for the first time in May 1884 in a season of plays performed at the Carcano by Cesare Rossi's theatre company. Duse performed in the leading roles in ''[[Fédora]]'' which opened the season and ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'' which ended it.&lt;ref name = "Gutierrez"&gt;Gutierrez, Beniamino (1916).

[[Image:Landesmuseum.jpg|thumb|240px|The Technoseum]]
The '''Technoseum''' (former name State Museum of Technology and Work, German: ''Landesmuseum für Technik und Arbeit'') is a [[technology museum]] in [[Mannheim]], Baden-Württemberg, Germany, with displays covering the industrialisation of the south-western regions of the country.

The museum building was designed by the Berlin architect, Ingeborg Kuhler. Its planning and construction period lasted from 1982 to 1990.

== Permanent exhibitions ==
Visitors who walk through the building from top to bottom will experience a journey in time from the beginning of the industrial revolution in the state of Baden-Württemberg to the present day.

Stands portraying the technical, social and political changes since the 18th century include those on clocks, paper manufacture and weaving. There are displays of living and working premises as well as machinery from the fields of industry, transport and the office. These displays enable the visitor to gain a graphic understanding of the far-reaching changes in living and working conditions right up to the present. 

The ''Elementa'' workshop complements the themes and exhibits of technological, economic and social history shown to date. It is not limited to covering basic scientific principles, but also shows the technical inventions which resulted from various scientific experiments.

===Steam train===
Running from end-to-end through the middle of the museum is a dual-gauge [[metre gauge]] and [[standard gauge]] railway track.  On this track a [[fireless locomotive]] operates steam-haul trips outside of the museum, over a bridge and then back into the museum again.

===Feldbahn railway===
Since 2006, between May and October each year a ''{{lang|de|Feldbahn}}'' narrow gauge trains runs in a {{convert|1.3|km|mi|sigfig=1|adj=mid|-long}} loop around the Technoseum park grounds.  The track gauge is {{convert|600|mm|ft|sigfig=1}} and there are two regular small diesel locomotives.  One locomotive was built in 1961 and worked mining peat in [[Schleswig-Holstein]]; the other one was built in 1964 and matches a locomotive used at the nearby [[Tonwaren-Industrie Wiesloch]] brickworks.&lt;ref name="miniloks-20170317"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.morgenweb.de/mannheim/mannheim-stadt/mini-loks-ziehen-ihre-kreise-1.3198595|title=Mini-Loks ziehen ihre Kreise|trans-title=Mini locomotives draw their loop|work=Mannheimer Morgen|date=17 March 2017|accessdate=18 March 2017|language=de|quote=zwei Feldbahn-Züge aus seinem Fuhrpark für den regelmäßigen Fahrdienst bereit: Eine Lok aus dem Jahr 1964, die in einer Ton- und Ziegelfabrik in Wiesloch im Einsatz war,{{sic}} und eine ehemalige Torfbahn von 1961, die in einem Moor in Schleswig-Holstein verwendet wurde.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Grey''''' is a 2011 [[survival film]] co-written, produced and directed by [[Joe Carnahan]] and starring [[Liam Neeson]], [[Frank Grillo]] and [[Dermot Mulroney]]. It is based on the short story "Ghost Walker" by Ian MacKenzie Jeffers, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Carnahan. The story follows a number of [[Landman (oil worker)|oil-men]] stranded in [[Alaska]] after a [[Aviation accidents and incidents|plane crash]], who must wage a war against a pack of [[grey wolf|grey wolves]] stalking them amidst mercilessly cold weather. 

Released in the United States on January 27, 2012, the film received praise for its philosophical themes, cinematography, sound effects and acting, while some of the dialogue and the film's ending were criticized; it grossed $77 million worldwide.

== Plot ==
John Ottway ([[Liam Neeson]]) works in [[Alaska]] as a marksman for an undisclosed oil company, killing grey wolves that threaten the drillers. On his last day on the job, he shoots one. That evening, Ottway writes a letter "without purpose" to his wife, Ana (Anne Openshaw), explaining his plans to commit suicide. He hears a distant wolf howl and doesn't follow through.

The next day, Ottway and other oil drillers board a plane. During the flight, Ottway dreams of sleeping with his wife in bed but is awakened by a loud bang. He buckles up in fear of a possible plane crash. Shortly afterwards, the back of the plane is torn off and it crashes. Eight people including Ottway survive the crash. However, a young oil worker, Lewenden ([[James Badge Dale]]), dies of his injuries as Ottway sadly watches. Taking charge, Ottway sets the survivors on the task of building a fire. While doing this, he discovers a corpse, and is attacked by the [[grey wolf]] feeding on it. After saving Ottway, the group soon surmises that they are in the wolves' territory. They decide to take turns keeping watch for the predators.

Later, Hernandez (Ben Bray) is killed by two wolves. Ottway suggests they leave the crash site, but Diaz ([[Frank Grillo]]) questions his leadership. While searching for the wallets of their deceased colleagues, intending to return them to their families, Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch containing a radio beacon. The group then leaves the site.

While walking, Flannery ([[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]]) falls behind, and is killed by wolves. One of them spots a pack of wolves approaching and the survivors run for the trees, lighting a fire in an attempt to ward off their attackers. The group sets about producing makeshift weaponry.  A stressed Diaz loses his cool somewhat and belligerently threatens Ottway with a knife, but is quickly disarmed and begins regretting his actions. As he's about to apologize, he's suddenly pounced upon by a wolf from behind. An [[Alpha (ethology)|omega wolf]] sent by the [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha wolf]] to test them, Ottway later surmises, after the survivors manage to kill it and then roast it for food. A bloodied and crazed Diaz, elated at having survived the attack, beheads the corpse and loudly howls like a wolf, then defiantly throws the severed head back at the pack. A move noted by the group as possibly unwise, as they accept a statement that "wolves are known to take revenge".

While sitting around the fire, Diaz tells the group of his [[atheist|atheism]] and Talget ([[Dermot Mulroney]]) states he believes in God and lovingly talks about his daughter. Ottway states he is also an atheist, but wishes he could believe or have faith; he then recites a simple poem written by his father. A blizzard approaches; some survivors set to maintaining the fire while the others get some rest.

The following morning, Burke ([[Nonso Anozie]]), who had earlier been suffering from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], is found dead. The remaining survivors leave the camp and travel to the edge of a steep canyon. Hendrick ([[Dallas Roberts]]) secures a line across to a tall tree opposite and Diaz &amp; Ottway traverse the canyon. Talget, however, is afraid of heights and with the added handicap of a bleeding mangled hand, when his foot becomes caught on a hook, in the ensuing struggle the rope breaks away. He falls to the ground, getting severely thrashed by tree branches on the way down; barely alive, he hallucinates a vision of his daughter, but is instantly set upon and dragged away by four wolves. While attempting to save Talget, Diaz falls from the tree and badly injures his knee.

Diaz, Ottway, and Hendrick continue and arrive at a river. There, Diaz, humbled by his journey and unable to walk on, explains that he can accept dying in the middle of nature and will not try to keep running. They part company, leaving a tearful Diaz contemplating the glorious mountainous vista, resigned to his fate. Reluctantly Ottway and Hendrick continue on together. Further along the river, Ottway and Hendrick are set upon by the wolves. In an attempt to flee, Hendrick falls into the river and in the chaos is trapped beneath the surface when his foot gets wedged between boulders. Ottway attempts to save him but unable to pull him loose, Hendrick soon drowns. Frustrated and now alone, Ottway looks up and angrily appeals to God for help, to "show him something real", but seeing nothing, he decides he will “do this on my own.”

Ottway, cold and wet, continues on alone.  Exhausted, he stops walking and begins going through the collected wallets of the others. Ottway then realizes he has stumbled right into the wolves' den - and that the team had been steadily walking towards, not away from, the source of danger. Surrounded by the pack and having the leader of the pack standing in front of him, he looks at his wife's photo in his wallet; it is then revealed that she was dying of a terminal illness (hence his own futility earlier) and that he was trying to kill himself earlier in the film but unable to do so. As the large, snarling alpha wolf approaches him, Ottway arms himself with a knife and shards of glass from small liquor bottles taped to his other hand. He recites the words "Once more into the fray. Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day. Live and die on this day."

In a brief post-credits scene, the alpha wolf lies on the ground, breathing slowly and deeply. Ottway lies against the wolf, viewed from the back - his fate is unclear.

=== Critical response ===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 200 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Grey'' is an exciting tale of survival, populated with fleshed-out characters and a surprising philosophical agenda."&lt;ref name="tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grey (2012)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_grey_2012/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-grey|title=The Grey reviews|work=Metacritic|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 and a half stars out of 4, and wrote that the unrelenting harshness of ''The Grey'' so affected him that he departed the screening of a different movie on the same day:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Grey|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120125/REVIEWS/120129984|accessdate=February 2, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|It was the first time I've ever walked out of a film because of the previous film.

Dissenters' reviews tend to focus on the film's abrupt ending and perceive the emotional and philosophical undertones as unnecessary. Siobhan Synnot of ''[[The Scotsman]]'' gave the film two stars, commenting that "On the down side, there's a lot of dull pretentious philosophizing about the heartlessness of nature and God.

The market for good used cars does not exist.]]
"'''The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism'''" is a well-known&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/fddde450-2521-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0&lt;/ref&gt; 1970 paper by economist [[George Akerlof]] which examines how the quality of goods traded in a market can degrade in the presence of [[information asymmetry]] between buyers and sellers, leaving only "lemons" behind. In American slang, a [[lemon (automobile)|lemon]] is a car that is found to be defective only after it has been bought.

Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between a high-quality car (a "peach") and a "lemon". Then they are only willing to pay a fixed price for a car that averages the value of a "peach" and "lemon" together (''p''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;). But sellers know whether they hold a peach or a lemon. Given the fixed price at which buyers will buy, sellers will sell only when they hold "lemons" (since ''p''&lt;sub&gt;lemon&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;) and they will leave the market when they hold "peaches" (since ''p''&lt;sub&gt;peach&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;). Eventually, as enough sellers of "peaches" leave the market, the average willingness-to-pay of buyers will decrease (since the average quality of cars on the market decreased), leading to even more sellers of high-quality cars to leave the market through a positive [[feedback loop]].  

Thus the uninformed buyer's price creates an [[adverse selection]] problem that drives the high-quality cars from the market. Adverse selection is a market mechanism that can lead to a market collapse. 

Akerlof's paper shows how prices can determine the quality of goods traded on the market. Low prices drive away sellers of high-quality goods, leaving only lemons behind. In 2001, Akerlof, along with [[Michael Spence]], and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], jointly received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], for their research on issues related to asymmetric information.

==The paper==

===Thesis===
[[File:Kovacs special 1968.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Ernie Kovacs]] in a comedic used car skit]]
Akerlof's paper uses the [[market (economics)|market]] for [[used car]]s as an example of the problem of quality uncertainty. A used car is one in which ownership is transferred from one person to another, after a period of use by its first owner and its inevitable wear and tear. There are good used cars ("peaches") and defective used cars ("lemons"), normally as a consequence of several not-always-traceable variables, such as the owner's driving style, quality and frequency of maintenance, and accident history. Because many important mechanical parts and other elements are hidden from view and not easily accessible for inspection, the buyer of a car does not know beforehand whether it is a peach or a lemon. So the buyer's best guess for a given car is that the car is of average quality; accordingly, he/she will be willing to pay for it only the price of a car of known average quality. This means that the owner of a carefully maintained, never-abused, good used car will be unable to get a high enough price to make selling that car worthwhile.

Therefore, owners of good cars will not place their cars on the used car market. The withdrawal of good cars reduces the average quality of cars on the market, causing buyers to revise downward their expectations for any given car. This, in turn, motivates the owners of moderately good cars not to sell, and so on. The result is that a market in which there is [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] with respect to quality shows characteristics similar to those described by [[Gresham's Law]]: the bad drives out the good. (Although Gresham's principle applies more specifically to exchange rates, modified analogies can be drawn.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phlips|first1=Louis|title=The Economics of Price Discrimination|date=June 30, 1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521283949|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical abstract of the problem===
Akerlof considers a situation in which demand ''D'' for used cars depends on the cars price ''p'' and quality ''µ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''µ''(''p'') and the supply depends on price alone. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akerlof |first=George A. |authorlink= |year=1970 |title=The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=[http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/akerlof/themarketforlemons.pdf 488–500.]|publisher=The MIT Press |doi=10.2307/1879431}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic equilibrium]] is given by ''S''(''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''D''(''p'',''µ'') and there are two groups of traders with utilities given by:

: &lt;math&gt;U_1 = M+\sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U_2 = M+\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{3}{2} x_i&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the consumption of goods other than automobiles, ''x'' the car's quality and ''n'' the number of automobiles. Let ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be income, demand and supply for group&amp;nbsp;''i''. Assuming that utilities are linear, that the traders are [[Von_Neumann–Morgenstern_utility_theorem|Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility]] maximizers and that the price of other ''M'' goods is unitary, the demand ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for cars is ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''p'' if ''μ''/''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, otherwise null. The demand ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''p'' if 3''μ''/''2''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''p'', otherwise null. Market demand is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;D(p,\mu)=\begin{cases} \left( Y_2+Y_1 \right)/p &amp; p &lt; \mu, \\ Y_2/p &amp; \mu &lt; p &lt; 3\mu/2, \\ 0 &amp; p &gt; 3\mu/2, \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Group 1 has ''N'' cars to sell with quality between 0 and 2 and group 2 has no cars to sell, therefore ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''pN''/2 and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. For a given price ''p'', average quality is ''p''/2, and therefore&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The market for used cars collapses when there is asymmetric information.

===Asymmetric information===
The paper by Akerlof describes how the interaction between quality heterogeneity and [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] can lead to the disappearance of a market where guarantees are indefinite. In this model, as quality is indistinguishable beforehand by the buyer (due to the asymmetry of information), incentives exist for the seller to pass off low-quality goods as higher-quality ones. The buyer, however, takes this incentive into consideration, and takes the quality of the goods to be uncertain. Only the average quality of the goods will be considered, which in turn will have the side effect that goods that are above average in terms of quality will be driven out of the market. This mechanism is repeated until a [[no-trade equilibrium]] is reached.

As a consequence of the mechanism described in this paper, markets may fail to exist altogether in certain situations involving quality uncertainty. Examples given in Akerlof's paper include the market for used cars, the dearth of formal credit markets in developing countries, and the difficulties that the elderly encounter in buying health insurance. However, not all players in a given market will follow the same rules or have the same aptitude of assessing quality. So there will always be a distinct advantage for some vendors to offer low-quality goods to the less-informed segment of a market that, on the whole, appears to be of reasonable quality and have reasonable guarantees of certainty. This is part of the basis for the idiom [[buyer beware]].

This is likely the basis for the idiom that an [[informed consumer]] is a better consumer. An example of this might be the subjective quality of fine food and wine. Individual consumers know best what they prefer to eat, and quality is almost always assessed in fine establishments by smell and taste before they pay. That is, if a customer in a fine establishment orders a lobster and the meat is not fresh, he can send the lobster back to the kitchen and refuse to pay for it. However, a definition of 'highest quality' for food eludes providers. Thus, a large variety of better-quality and higher-priced restaurants are supported.

===Impact on markets===
The article draws some conclusions about the cost of dishonesty in markets in general:

{{cquote|The cost of dishonesty, therefore, lies not only in the amount by which the purchaser is cheated; the cost also must include the loss incurred from driving legitimate business out of existence.}}

==Critical reception==
George E. Hoffer and Michael D. Pratt state that the “economic literature is divided on whether a lemons market actually exists in used vehicles”. The authors’ research supports the hypothesis that “known defects provisions”, used by US states (e.g., Wisconsin) to regulate used car sales, have been ineffectual, because the quality of used vehicles sold in these states is not significantly better than the vehicles in neighboring states without such consumer protection legislation.&lt;ref name="Hoffer1987"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Hoffer | first = George E. | authorlink = |author2=Pratt, Michael D. | year = 1987 | title = Used vehicles, lemons markets, and Used Car Rules: Some empirical evidence | journal = Journal of Consumer Policy | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 409–414 | doi = 10.1007/BF00411482 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the ''[[American Economic Review]]'' and the ''[[Review of Economic Studies]]'' rejected the paper for "triviality", while the reviewers for ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' rejected it as incorrect, arguing that, if this paper were correct, then no goods could be traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gans |first=Joshua S. |first2=George B. |last2=Shepherd |year=1994 |title=How Are the Mighty Fallen: Rejected Classic Articles by Leading Economists |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=165–179 |doi=10.1257/jep.8.1.165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only on the fourth attempt did the paper get published in ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/akerlof-article.html Writing the &lt;!--sic;the extra "the" is in the source--&gt; “The Market for ‘Lemons’”: A Personal and Interpretive Essay] by George A. Akerlof&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the paper is one of the most-cited papers in modern economic theory and most downloaded economic journal paper of all time in RePEC (more than 8,530 citations in academic papers as of May 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.de/scholar?cites=8622278700871890196&amp;as_sdt=5,24&amp;sciodt=0,24&amp;hl=en&amp;num=100 |title=Citations of Akerlof: The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism |accessdate=2011-05-27 |work=[[Google Scholar]] |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has profoundly influenced virtually every field of economics, from industrial organisation and public finance to macroeconomics and contract theory.

===Criticism===
[[Libertarianism|Libertarians]], like William L. Anderson, oppose the regulatory approach proposed by the authors of the paper, observing that some used-car markets haven't broken down even without lemon legislation and that the lemon problem creates entrepreneurial opportunities for alternative marketplaces or customers' knowledgeable friends.&lt;ref&gt;Lemons and the Nobel Prize http://mises.org/library/lemons-and-nobel-prize&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions for a lemon market==
A lemon market will be produced by the following:

# Asymmetry of information, in which no buyers can accurately assess the value of a product through examination before sale is made and all sellers can more accurately assess the value of a product prior to sale
# An incentive exists for the seller to pass off a low-quality product as a higher-quality one
# Sellers have no credible disclosure technology (sellers with a great car have no way to disclose this credibly to buyers)
# Either a continuum of seller qualities exists or the average seller type is sufficiently low (buyers are sufficiently pessimistic about the seller's quality)
# Deficiency of ''effective'' public quality assurances (by reputation or regulation and/or of ''effective'' guarantees/warranties)

==Laws in the United States==
Five years after Akerlof's paper was published, the United States enacted a federal "lemon law" (the [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]]) that protects citizens of all states. There are also state laws regarding "lemons" which vary by state and may not necessarily cover used or leased vehicles. The rights afforded to consumers by "lemon laws" may exceed the warranties expressed in purchase contracts. These state laws provide remedies to consumers for automobiles that repeatedly fail to meet certain standards of quality and performance. "Lemon law" is the common nickname for these laws, but each state has different names for the laws and acts, which may also cover more than just automobiles. In California and federal law, "Lemon Laws" cover anything mechanical.

The federal "lemon law" also provides that the warrantor may be obligated to pay the attorney fees of the party prevailng in a lemon {{Not a typo|law suit}}, as do most state lemon laws. If a car has to be repaired for the same defect four or more times and the problem is still occurring, the car may be deemed to be "a lemon". The defect must substantially hinder the vehicle's use, value, or safety. Purchasers who knowingly purchase a car in "as is" condition accept the defects and void their rights under the "lemon law".

The '''Poem Tree''' was a [[beech]] tree with a poem carved into it by [[Joseph Tubb]], located on Castle Hill at [[Wittenham Clumps]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="NT_visitors"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Poem Tree|url=http://www.earthtrust.org.uk/Our-work/livinghistory/ThePoemTree.aspx|work=The Poem Tree at Wittenham Clumps|publisher=[[Earth Trust]]|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nashford"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nash Ford|first=David|title=The Poem Tree|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/odds/poem_tree.html|work=Royal Berkshire History|publisher=Nash Ford Publishing|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NT_tubb"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Joseph Tubb and the Poem Tree|url=http://www.projecttimescape.co.uk/timescape/research/arts/joseph-tubb|work=The Poem Tree at Wittenham Clumps|publisher=[[Northmoor Trust]]|accessdate=16 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517120117/http://www.projecttimescape.co.uk/timescape/research/arts/joseph-tubb|archivedate=17 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree, which was believed to be around 300 years old, collapsed through a combination of long-standing rot and inclement weather in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/didcot/9855964.Sadness_as_Clumps_poem_tree_falls/ Sadness as Clumps poem tree falls ''Oxford Mail'' 4 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/didcot/9871211.Poet_pens_a_farewell_verse_to_famous_tree/ Poet pens a farewell verse to famous tree by Ben Wilkinson ''Oxford Mail'' 14 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It died in the 1990s and after that, rotted completely while standing.

The poem was carved in the 1840s. A stone, including a transcription and [[rubbing]] of the poem, was erected close to the tree in 1994 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the carving.

==Carving==
Tubb carved the 20-line poem into the tree over two weeks in the summer.&lt;ref name="druidnetwork"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Poem Tree|url=http://druidnetwork.org/en/sacredsites/wittenham/poem.html|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20070123120000/http://druidnetwork.org/en/sacredsites/wittenham/poem.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 January 2007|work=Sacred Places|publisher=[[The Druid Network]]|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking a ladder and a tent to the beech tree, Tubb carved the poem into the tree from memory, regularly forgetting to take the original copy with him.&lt;ref name="NT_tubb" /&gt; Sources vary as to whether the carving took place in 1844 or between 1844 and 1845.&lt;ref name="NT_visitors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NT_tubb" /&gt;

==Poem==
[[File:Poemtree sample.png|thumb|upright|A close-up of the carving. The word "land" (''The various changes that the land befell'') can be seen, below which the end of the word "country" (''Where the low bank the country wide surrounds'') is legible.]]

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;&lt;em&gt;As up the hill with labr'ing steps we tread
Where the twin Clumps their sheltering branches spread
The summit gain'd at ease reclining lay
And all around the wide spread scene survey
Point out each object and instructive tell
The various changes that the land befell
Where the low bank the country wide surrounds
That ancient earthwork form'd old [[Mercia]]'s bounds
In misty distance see the barrow heave
There lies forgotten lonely [[Cwichelm of Wessex|Cwichelm]]'s grave.
&amp;nbsp;
Around this hill the ruthless [[Vikings|Danes]] intrenched
And these fair plains with gory slaughter drench'd
While at our feet where stands that stately tower
In days gone by up rose the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] power
And yonder, there where [[River Thames|Thames]] smooth waters glide
In later days appeared monastic pride.
Within that field where lies the grazing herd
Huge walls were found, some coffins disinter'd
Such is the course of time, the wreck which fate
And awful doom award the earthly great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Inspiration and interpretation==
The poem was inspired by Tubb's fondness of the surrounding landscape, which is described in the first half of the first [[stanza]].&lt;ref name="parishes"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page|first=William|author2=Ditchfield, Peter Hampson |title=Parishes: Little Wittenham|journal=A History of the County of Berkshire|year=1924|volume=4|pages=380–384|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=62732|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the poem, which is also a summary of the location's history,&lt;ref name="NT_tubb" /&gt; was an example of Tubb's repressed creativity&lt;ref name="druidnetwork" /&gt; — his ambition was to be a [[wood carver]] but was pressured into being a maltster through family tradition.&lt;ref name="NT_tubb" /&gt; The "ancient earthwork" at "[[Mercia]]'s bounds" may be [[Grim's Ditch]] or [[The Ridgeway]] (the latter is formed by part of Grim's Ditch). At the time of [[Alfred the Great]], the border between Mercia and [[Wessex]] ran roughly in a line from east to west through the region.&lt;ref name="keynes"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Keynes|first=Simon|title=Alfred's Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=map&amp;id=mapAlfred|work=Maps|publisher=Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=17 June 2010|author2=Piggott, Reginald }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mention of Cwichelm's (or Culchelm's) grave refers to [[Scutchamer Knob]], a [[Round barrow|barrow]] on The Ridgeway near [[Grim's Ditch]],&lt;ref name="NT_tubb" /&gt; approximately {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} south-west of the Poem Tree.  The barrow was originally known as Cwichelmeshlaew or Cwichelm's Barrow, and is historically recorded as the site at which [[Cwichelm of Wessex]] was killed by [[Edwin of Northumbria]] in 636.  Tubb's assertion that the barrow could be seen in the misty distance is plausible; Tim Allen (an Oxford-based archaeologist) suggests that on a clear day the [[Berkshire Downs]] can be viewed from the hills and vice versa.&lt;ref name="timeteam"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Time Team: Season 11 Ep. 9|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRZLmA_l9yA|work=[[Time Team]]|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "smooth waters" of the [[River Thames]] refers to the river running through [[Dorchester-on-Thames]], where the "monastic pride" of the [[Augustinian]] [[Dorchester Abbey]] is mentioned.

The disinterred coffins may refer to an 18th-century discovery of two skeletons at the summit of Round Hill.&lt;ref name="timeteam" /&gt; The slopes of the two hills were used for grazing, where excavations have revealed remains of buildings (including a possible [[Roman villa]]&lt;ref name="timeteam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford_archaeology"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The trenches Around Hill Farm|url=http://thehumanjourney.net/html_pages/microsites/wittenham_clumps/Excavations_2004_trenches.htm|work=The Archaeology of the Wittenhams|publisher=Oxford Archaeology|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Legacy==
In 1965, [[United Kingdom|British]] geographer&lt;ref name="osmaston_independent"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Venables |first=Stephen|title=Henry Osmaston|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/henry-osmaston-6095810.html|accessdate=16 June 2010|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=10 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Osmaston]] took a [[rubbing]] of the poem before it became largely illegible.&lt;ref name="NT_visitors" /&gt;

In the 1980s, the health of the tree began to decline and it died in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="NT_tubb" /&gt; By the time of its collapse in 2012, the poem had become  difficult to read; the few legible letters having been distorted with growth of the tree.&lt;ref name="NT_visitors" /&gt;

In 1994, a plaque and stone were placed nearby to commemorate 150 years since the carving.&lt;ref name="NT_visitors" /&gt;  The plaque, which features a copy of Osmaston's 1965 tracing, is fixed to a large [[Sarsen]] stone.&lt;ref name="NT_tubb" /&gt;

Following its collapse, a crane was used to help make the tree safe but the much decayed trunk disintegrated. A few days later a tribute of flowers including gladioli were left anonymously on the shattered trunk. The remains of the tree have been left in situ to form a natural habitat.

[[File:TheatreGuild.jpg|thumb|Directors of the Theatre Guild in 1923]]
The '''Theatre Guild''' is a [[theatre|theatrical]] society founded in [[New York City]] in 1918 by [[Lawrence Langner]], [[Philip Moeller]], [[Helen Westley]]&lt;ref&gt;Cody, Gabrielle and Sprinchorn, Evert. ''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, Volume 2'', Columbia University Press, p. 1341&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Theresa Helburn]].  Langner's wife, Armina Marshall, then served as a co-director. It evolved out of the work of the [[Washington Square Players]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Pictorial History of the Theatre Guild'' by Lawrence Langner and Armina Marshall. Introd. by Brooks Atkinson. Crown Publishers. 1969&lt;/ref&gt;  

Its original purpose was to produce non-commercial works by [[United States|American]] and foreign [[playwrights]]. It differed from other theaters at the time in that its board of directors shared the responsibility of choosing plays, management, and production.&lt;ref&gt;''Vintage Years Of The Theatre Guild, 1928-1939'' by Roy S. Waldau. Case Western Reserve University Press. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The Theatre Guild contributed greatly to the success of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] from the 1920s throughout the 1970s.

The Guild has produced a total of 228 plays on Broadway, including 18 by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and seven by [[Eugene O'Neill]]. Other major playwrights introduced to theatre-going Americans include [[Robert E. Sherwood]], [[Maxwell Anderson]], [[Sidney Howard]], [[William Saroyan]], and [[Philip Barry]]. In the field of [[musical theatre]], the Guild has promoted works by [[Richard Rodgers]], teamed with both [[Lorenz Hart]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Jule Styne]], and [[Meredith Willson]], all of which have become classics. Under President [[John F. Kennedy]], the Guild was engaged to assemble a U.S. theatre company, headed by [[Helen Hayes]], to tour the capitals of [[Europe]] and [[South America]] with works by [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Thornton Wilder]], and [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to American Theatre''. Oxford University Press. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1968, the Guild became involved in the travel field by taking 25 of its subscribers to European capitals to see plays. In 1975, it instituted its Theatre At Sea program with a 17-day cruise aboard the [[SS Rotterdam|''Rotterdam'']] with Hayes and [[Cyril Ritchard]]. Since then they have hosted more than thirty cruises, each with seven or eight performers. Among them have been [[Alan Arkin]], [[Zoe Caldwell]], [[Anne Jackson]], [[Cherry Jones]], [[Richard Kiley]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Patricia Neal]], [[Lynn Redgrave]], [[Gena Rowlands]], [[Jean Stapleton]], [[Eli Wallach]], and [[Lee Roy Reams]], who served as the program's resident director.

The last Broadway play produced by The Theatre Guild was ''[[State Fair (musical)|State Fair]]'' in 1996.

| data1 = [[File:Crop-Nicolae Ceaucescu 1978.jpg|110px]] [[File:Elena Ceausescu.jpg|110px]]
| data2 = [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] (left), [[President of Romania|President]] of the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] since 1974 (and leader of the country since 1965), and his wife [[Elena Ceaușescu]] (right), were executed following a show trial on 25 December 1989.
}}
The '''trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu''' was a short trial held on 25 December 1989 by an Exceptional Military Tribunal, a [[drumhead court-martial]] created at the request of the Council of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]], resulting in the [[Capital punishment in Romania|death sentence]] and [[execution]] of former [[President of Romania|Romanian President]] and [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party|Romanian Communist Party General Secretary]], [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], and his wife, [[Elena Ceaușescu]].

Marked by irregularities that are typical of [[kangaroo court]]s and [[show trial]]s, the main charge was [[genocide]]—namely, murdering "over 60,000 people" during the [[Romanian Revolution|revolution]] in [[Timișoara]].&lt;ref name="Burakovski273"/&gt; Other sources put the death toll between 689 to 1,200.&lt;ref name="reuters1990"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-28/news/mn-1255_1_senior-officials |title=4 Top Ceausescu Aides Admit Complicity in Genocide: Romania: They are the first senior officials of regime to go on trial before a military court. The four are said to have confessed to all charges |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 28, 1990 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=16 October 2013 |location=Bucharest, Romania}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quigley2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John B.

Before the legal proceedings began, Stănculescu had already selected the spot where the execution would take place—along one side of the wall in the barracks' square.&lt;ref name="Burakovski273"/&gt;

Nicolae Ceaușescu refused to recognize the Tribunal, arguing its lack of constitutional basis and claiming that the revolutionary authorities were part of a Soviet plot.&lt;ref name="Burakovski273"/&gt;

==Arrest==
On 22 December, during the [[Romanian Revolution]], [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Nicolae]] and [[Elena Ceaușescu]] left the Central Committee building in Bucharest by helicopter toward [[Snagov]], from which they left soon after towards Pitești.&lt;ref&gt;Burakovski, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; The helicopter pilot claimed to be in danger of anti-aircraft fire, so he landed on the [[Bucharest]]–[[Târgoviște]] road, near [[Găești]]. They stopped a car driven by a certain Dr. Nicolae Decă, who took them to [[Văcărești, Dâmbovița|Văcăreşti]], after which he informed the local authorities that the Ceaușescus were going toward Târgoviște. The Ceaușescus took another car and told its driver, Nicolae Petrisor, to drive them to Târgoviște. During the trip, the Ceaușescus heard news of the revolution on the car radio (by then the revolutionaries had taken control of the state media), causing Ceaușescu to angrily denounce the revolution as a ''[[coup d'état]]''. Petrisor took the couple to an agricultural center near Târgoviște, where the Ceaușescus were locked in an office and were later arrested by soldiers from a local army garrison.&lt;ref name="Burakovski273"&gt;Burakovski, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dem25dec&gt;{{cite news|last=Demian|first=Sinziana|title=In Romania, Ceausescu's death haunts Christmas|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/091224/romania-nicolae-elena-ceausescu|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=Global Post|date=25 December 2009|location=Cluj Napoca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the tribunal==
As the new authorities heard the news of their apprehension from General [[Andrei Kemenici]], the commander of the army unit, they began to discuss what to do with the Ceaușescus.&lt;ref name="Burakovski273" /&gt; [[Victor Stănculescu]], who was Ceauşescu's last defence minister before going over to the revolution, wanted a quick execution, as did [[Gelu Voican Voiculescu]]. [[Ion Iliescu]], Romania's provisional president, supported holding a trial first.&lt;ref name="Burakovski273" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc25dec&gt;{{cite news|title=Ceausescu execution 'avoided mob lynching'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8430213.stm|accessdate=30 March 2013|publisher=BBC|date=25 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the evening of 24 December, Stănculescu sent the secret code "recourse to the method" to Kemenici, referring to the execution of the Ceaușescus. A ten-member tribunal was formed to try the case.&lt;ref name=nyt23apr /&gt; The members of the panel were all military judges.&lt;ref name=dak2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Kideckel|first=David A.|title=Death of The Father: An Anthropology of The End In Political Authority|year=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-715-8|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3kJQWTZh7AC&amp;pg=PR6|editor=John Borneman|accessdate=31 March 2013|chapter=The Undead:Nicolae Ceauşescu and paternalist politics in Romanian society and culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges==
The charges were published in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'' the day after the execution:&lt;ref&gt;[[Monitorul Oficial]], Anul I, Nr. 3, December 26, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
* Genocide – over 60,000 victims
* Subversion of state power by organizing armed actions against the people and state power.
* Offense of destruction of public property by destroying and damaging buildings, explosions in cities, etc.
* Undermining the national economy.
* Trying to flee the country using funds of over $1 billion deposited in foreign banks.

==Counsel for the defense==
The morning of the trial, prominent lawyer [[Nicu Teodorescu]] was having Christmas breakfast with his family when he was telephoned by an aide to Iliescu, and asked by the National Salvation Front to be the Ceaușescus' defense counsel. He replied that it "would be an interesting challenge"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-24/news/mn-769_1_defense-lawyers|title=Ceausescus Expected to Be Rescued, Lawyer Says|first=From United Press|last=International|date=24 January 1990|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Teodorescu met the couple for the first time in the Târgoviște "court room", when he was given ten minutes to consult with his clients. With so little time to prepare any defense, he tried to explain to them that their best hope of avoiding the death sentence was to plead insanity. However, the Ceaușescus brushed away the idea.

==Trial==
The trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu was very brief, lasting approximately one hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/nicolae-ceausescu-38355|title=Nicolae Ceausescu|website=Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-elsner/trial-and-execution-the-d_b_401497.html|title=Trial and Execution: The Dramatic Deaths of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu|first=Alan|last=Elsner|date=22 July 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/12/24/369593135/25-years-after-death-a-dictator-still-casts-a-shadow-in-romania|title=25 Years After Death, A Dictator Still Casts A Shadow In Romania|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu defended himself by arguing that the Tribunal was against the [[1965 Constitution of Romania]] and that only the [[Great National Assembly]] had the power to depose him. He argued that it was a ''[[coup d'état]]'' organized by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]].&lt;ref name="Burakovski273" /&gt;

Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu were convicted on all charges and condemned to death in a [[Moscow Trials|Stalinist-style trial]].&lt;ref name=impreuna /&gt; At one point, their forcibly-assigned lawyers abandoned their clients' [[legal defense|defense]] and joined with the [[prosecutor]], accusing them of [[capital crime]]s instead of defending them.&lt;ref name=ceausescustenogram&gt;[[:s:ro:Stenograma procesului Ceaușescu]], translated at [[:s:Transcript of the closed trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceauşescu]].&lt;/ref&gt; No [[offer of proof]] was made for the Ceaușescus' alleged [[crime]]s. They were tried based on references, solely by offense-name or [[hearsay]], to criminal acts they had committed in the opinion of prosecutors, or as alleged in press reports. Various irregularities presented themselves, or became apparent post-trial:&lt;ref name=impreuna&gt;[http://adevarul.ro/sfarsitul_ceausestilor/Nicolae_si_Elena_Ceausescu-_-Impreuna_am_luptat-sa_murim_impreuna_0_173983015.html Nicolae și Elena Ceaușescu: „Împreună am luptat, să murim împreună!“&lt;!-- Titlu generat de un robot --&gt;] Adevărul, 19 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ceausescustenogram /&gt;

Before the execution, Nicolae Ceaușescu declared, "We could have been shot without having this masquerade!"&lt;ref name=impreuna /&gt;

==Execution==
Just after the trial, the Ceaușescus were executed at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time&lt;ref name=gua27dec&gt;{{cite news|title=Television shows last hours of the 'anti-Christ'|url=http://century.guardian.co.uk/1980-1989/Story/0,6051,110504,00.html|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a military base outside [[Bucharest]] on 25 December 1989.&lt;ref name=nyt23apr&gt;{{cite news|title=Ceausescu Wept as He Faced Firing Squad, Footage Shows|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/23/world/evolution-in-europe-ceausescu-wept-as-he-faced-firing-squad-footage-shows.html|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 April 1990|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The execution was carried out by a firing squad consisting of elite paratroop regiment soldiers: Captain Ionel Boeru, Sergeant-Major Georghin Octavian and Dorin-Marian Cirlan, while reportedly hundreds of others also volunteered.&lt;ref name=theday23janu&gt;{{cite news|title=120 bullets found in Ceausescus|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gAghAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fHYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2040,4327503&amp;dq=execution+of+nicolae+and+elena+ceau%C5%9Fescu&amp;hl=en|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=The Day|date=23 January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ceaușescus' hands were tied by four soldiers before the execution.&lt;ref name=els23dec&gt;{{cite news|last=Elsner|first=Alan|title=Trial and Execution: The Dramatic Deaths of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-elsner/trial-and-execution-the-d_b_401497.html|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular history]] author [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]] has claimed that, before the sentences were carried out, Elena Ceaușescu screamed, "You sons of bitches!" while being led outside and lined up against the wall; at the same time Nicolae Ceaușescu sang [[The Internationale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montefiore|first=Simon Sebag|title=101 Villains from Vlad the Impaler to Adolf Hitler: History's Monsters|year=2008|publisher=Metro Books|isbn=978-1-4351-0937-7|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firing squad began shooting as soon as the two were in position against a wall. In 1990, a member of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] reported that 120 bullets were found in the couple's bodies.&lt;ref name=theday23janu/&gt; The firing happened too soon for the film crew covering the events to record it in full; only the last round of shots was filmed. 
Others believe the shooting recorded in the trial footage was not from the actual execution but was staged afterwards, with soldiers firing a few more rounds into the corpses a second time, just for the camera. This was probably done to give the footage a more dramatic "climax" since the moment of the actual execution was missed by the film crew.

As the dust settled the cameraman, still filming, was seen walking towards the couple's bodies. Elena had fallen to her right while Nicolae had collapsed where he was. A soldier and a medical doctor then began to approach the bodies to confirm that the Ceaușescus had in fact been successfully executed. The cameraman requested that her blood soaked scarf which had fallen across Elena's head be lifted so her face could be clearly filmed. Similarly, while the doctor was confirming Nicolae Ceaușescu's death he was asked to lift up his head for the camera as well. 

In 1989, Prime Minister [[Petre Roman]] told French television that the execution was carried out quickly due to rumors that loyalists would rescue the couple.&lt;ref name=gua27dec /&gt;

After the execution, the bodies were covered with canvas. The Ceaușescus' corpses were flown to Bucharest and buried five days later in Ghencea Cemetery on 30 December 1989.

The hasty trial and the images of the dead Ceaușescus were videotaped and the footage promptly released in numerous western countries two days after the execution.&lt;ref name=bbconthis&gt;{{cite news|title=On this day|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/25/newsid_2542000/2542623.stm|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, it was also shown on Romanian television.&lt;ref name=bbconthis /&gt; The Ceaușescus were the last people to be executed in Romania before the abolition of capital punishment on 7 January 1990.

==Reactions==
[[Valentin Ceauşescu]], elder son of the Ceauşescus, argued in 2009 that the revolutionary forces should have killed his parents when they had arrested them on 22 December since they did not need any trial.&lt;ref name=kpost24dec&gt;{{cite news|title=Ceausescu fooled by aides, son says|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/world/ceausescu-fooled-by-aides-son-says-55826.html|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making vague comments about the incident, Iliescu stated that it was "quite shameful, but necessary".&lt;ref name=dem25dec/&gt; In a similar vein, Stănculescu told the BBC in 2009 that the trial was "not just, but it was necessary" because the alternative would have been seeing Nicolae [[Lynching|lynched]] on the streets of Bucharest.&lt;ref name=bbc25dec /&gt; 

Several countries criticized the new rulers of Romania after the execution due to lack of public trial. The [[United States]] was the most prominent critic of the trial, stating: "We regret the trial did not take place in an open and public fashion."&lt;ref name=gua27dec /&gt;

{{Donald Trump series}}
The '''Trump Tower meeting''' took place on June 9, 2016 in [[New York City]] between three senior members of the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 Trump campaign]]{{snd}}[[Donald Trump Jr.]], [[Jared Kushner]], and [[Paul Manafort]]{{snd}}and at least five other people, including Russian lawyer [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]]. The meeting was arranged by publicist and long-time Trump acquaintance, [[Rob Goldstone]] on behalf of his client, singer-songwriter [[Emin Agalarov]].&lt;ref name=npr071117&gt;{{cite web |title=Donald Trump Jr.'s Emails About Meeting With Russian Lawyer, Annotated |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/07/11/536670194/donald-trump-jr-s-emails-about-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-annotated |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=July 11, 2017 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was disclosed to U.S. government officials when Kushner filed a revised version of his security clearance form.&lt;ref name="Met during campaign" /&gt;

Donald Trump Jr. made several misleading statements about the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/5351648/2016-trump-tower-meeting-facts/]&lt;/ref&gt; He initially told the press that the meeting was held to discuss adoptions of Russian children by Americans. On July 8, 2017, after news reports stated that Trump Jr. knew the meeting was political, he admitted in a tweet that he had agreed to the meeting with the understanding that he would receive information damaging to [[Hillary Clinton]], and that he was conducting [[opposition research]].&lt;ref name=Apuzzo /&gt; When the ''[[New York Times]]'' was about to report on email exchanges between Goldstone and Trump Jr., Trump Jr. himself admitted that Goldstone had stated in an email to him that the Russian government was involved and that the purpose of the meeting was to get "dirt on Clinton" and that the meeting concerned a "Russian effort to aid the (Trump) campaign."&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/11/media/new-york-times-donald-trump-jr-emails/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="I love it"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Jo |last1=Becker |first2=Adam |last2=Goldman |first3=Matt |last3=Apuzzo |title=Russian Dirt on Clinton?

[[Robert Mueller]], the [[special counsel]] of the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in charge of Russia-related investigations, is investigating the emails and the meeting,&lt;ref name=Prokupecz&gt;{{cite news |first1=Shimon |last1=Prokupecz |first2=Evan |last2=Perez |first3=Pamela |last3=Brown |title=Source: Justice Dept. probe will look at Trump Jr.'s disclosed emails, meeting |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/donald-trump-jr-emails-special-counsel/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=July 11, 2017 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their relation to the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]].

== Background ==
Prior to the Trump Tower meeting, Trump campaign advisor [[George Papadopoulos]] met at least twice with a professor who said he had access to "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails". This occurred before the hacking of the DNC computers had become public knowledge. Papadopoulos later shared this information with at least two other people, including an Australian diplomat to Britain. At a meeting on March 24, 2016, the professor brought along a Russian woman, Olga Polonskaya. Papadopoulos made multiple unsuccessful attempts to set up meetings in Russia between Trump or members of his campaign and Russian officials. He communicated his proposals and interactions to several Trump campaign officials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/who-is-george-papadopoulos/index.html|title=Who is George Papadopoulos?|last=CNN|first=Jeremy Herb and Marshall Cohen,|publisher=CNN|access-date=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017 he pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to the FBI about his actions.

Trump Jr. responded:

=== Purpose ===

Trump Jr. initially told reporters that the meeting had been "primarily about adoptions".&lt;ref name="Met during campaign" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt; He then released a statement saying it had been a "short introductory meeting" concerning "a program about the adoption of Russian children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/15/politics/russia-donald-trump-jr-meeting/index.html|title=The ever-changing story about Trump Jr.'s meeting -- what we know|last=Diamond|first=Jeremy|date=July 16, 2017|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Trump Jr. acknowledged that he went into the meeting expecting to receive opposition research from Veselnitskaya that could hurt Clinton's campaign, adding that none was presented and that the conversation instead focused on the [[Magnitsky Act]].&lt;ref name="Bertrand_8/31/2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name = stunning&gt;{{cite web |first=Callum |last=Borchers |title=Donald Trump Jr.’s stunning admission to the New York Times |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/09/donald-trump-jr-s-stunningly-incriminating-statement-to-the-new-york-times/ |website=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 9, 2017 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gq"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Real Story of Donald Trump Jr. |first=Julia |last=Ioffe |date=June 20, 2018 |publisher=''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/real-story-of-donald-trump-jr |quote=According to one of the participants in the meeting, Don began to realize he wasn't going to be handed what he was hoping for. “The light just went out in his eyes,” the participant told me recently. “He was totally disinterested.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later a statement from Trump Jr.'s lawyer said Veselnitskaya had claimed to have information "that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton" but "it quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-11/trump-s-son-has-offered-shifting-explanations-for-russia-meeting|title=Here Are Trump Jr.’s Shifting Explanations for His Russia Meeting|last=Sink|first=Justin|date=July 11, 2017|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump Jr. said he felt the adoption issue was her "true agenda all along" and the claims of helpful political information were a pretext.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jr-russian-lawyer-what-happened-crimes-legal-name-collusion-steele-dossier-timeline-explained-a7834566.html|title=What happened between Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer?

Veselnitskaya said that she intended to provide allegations to the Trump campaign about a firm connected to [[Bill Browder|William Browder]], a financier who lobbied for the Magnitsky Act.

Two previously undisclosed emails from Rob Goldstone emerged on December 7, as discovered by congressional investigators. The recipients included Trump Jr., Kushner, and Manafort. In a June 14, 2016 email, five days after the meeting, Goldstone forwarded a news story about Russian hacking of Democrats' emails, describing the news as "eerily weird" in light of what had been discussed at Trump Tower.&lt;ref name="Follow-up"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Jim |last1=Sciutto |first2=Manu |last2=Raju |first3=Jeremy |last3=Herb |title=Exclusive: Previously undisclosed emails show follow-up after Trump Tower meeting |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/politics/previously-undisclosed-emails-after-trump-tower-meeting/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=December 7, 2017 |accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery contradicted the initial statement by Trump Jr. that "there was no follow up" after the meeting,&lt;ref name="Met during campaign" /&gt; as well as his September 2017 testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in which he stated: "Rob, Emin and I never discussed the meeting again".&lt;ref name="Follow-up" /&gt;

=== Reactions ===
==== Congressional reactions ====
Democratic Representatives [[Brad Sherman]] and [[Al Green (politician)|Al Green]] sponsored a resolution to impeach President Trump. Sherman argued that Trump Jr.'s emails "add credibility" to the theory that Trump [[Dismissal of James Comey|dismissed James Comey]] as [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation]] as an attempt to derail the ongoing investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mike |last=DeBonis |title=A House Democrat has filed the first articles of impeachment against President Trump |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/07/12/a-house-democrat-has-filed-the-first-articles-of-impeachment-against-president-trump/ |website=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 12, 2017 |accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 2017, the Vice Chairman of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]], Democratic Senator [[Mark Warner]], stated that "This is the first time that the public has seen clear evidence of senior level members of the Trump campaign meeting Russians to try to obtain information that might hurt the campaign of Hillary Clinton".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Pete |last=Grieve |title=Warner: 'Clear evidence' that Trump officials met Russians to get info |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/mark-warner-clear-evidence/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=July 11, 2017 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner also stated that the incident was part of a "continuing pattern" in which Trump officials and members of the Trump campaign have "conveniently forgotten meetings with Russians only when they are then presented with evidence, they have to recant and acknowledge those kind of meetings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donald Jr's meeting with Russians is "clear evidence" of campaign workings |url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/07/10/donald-jrs-meeting-with-russians-is-clea?videoId=372067514 |agency=[[Reuters]]  |date=July 10, 2017 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of the committee, the Republican [[Susan Collins]], stated that Donald Trump Jr. and others who attended the meeting should testify before the committee.&lt;ref name=nyt071017&gt;{{cite news |first=Karen |last=Freifeld |title=Trump Jr. was told of Russian effort to help father's campaign: NY Times |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKBN19V2DO |agency=[[Reuters]]  |date=July 10, 2017 |accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the [[House Intelligence Committee]], described the matter as "a very serious development", and that "It all warrants thorough investigation.

[[George Papadopoulos]] joined Donald Trump's presidential campaign in early March 2016 as a foreign policy advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/03/21/meet-the-men-shaping-donald-trumps-foreign-policy-views/|title=One of Trump’s foreign policy advisers is a 2009 college grad who lists Model UN as a credential| last1=Ryan| first1=Missy| last2=Mufson| first2=Steven|date=March 22, 2016|work=The Washington Post|access-date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks he was approached by a London-based professor with Russian connections, later identified as [[Joseph Mifsud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/george-papadopoulos-who-joseph-mifsud-professor-697441|title=Who is Joseph Mifsud, the professor in the George Papadopoulos investigation?|last=Kutner|first=Max|date=October 31, 2017|work=Newsweek|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mifsud told him that during a recent trip to Russia, he had learned that the Russians were in possession of thousands of stolen emails that were politically damaging to [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/11/13/all-of-the-known-times-the-trump-campaign-met-with-russians |title=All the known times the Trump campaign met with Russians |author=Meg Kelly |date=November 13, 2017 |website=[[WashingtonPost.com]] |access-date=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html|title=How the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political Dirt|website=The New York Times|date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred before there was public knowledge of the [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks|hack of Democratic National Committee]] computers and of [[John Podesta]]'s emails, both of which U.S. intelligence agencies believe were carried out by Russia.&lt;ref name="KnewofOutreach"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-adviser-pleaded-guilty-to-lying-about-russian-contacts/2017/10/30/d525e712-bd7d-11e7-97d9-bdab5a0ab381_story.html |work= The Washington Post | accessdate= October 30, 2017 | date=October 30, 2017| title=Top campaign officials knew of Trump adviser’s outreach to Russia|first1= Rosalind S. |last1=Helderman |first2= Tom |last2=Hamburger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papadopoulos met with Mifsud on March 14, 2016 in Rome, as well March 24 and April 26 in London. At the March 24 meeting Mifsud brought along Olga Polonskaya, a 30-year-old Russian woman from St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/russia-inquiry-trump.html|title='A London Meeting of an Unlikely Group: How a Trump Adviser Came to Learn of Clinton ‘Dirt’'| last1=LaFraniere| first1=Sharon| last2=Kirkpatrick| first2=David| last3=Schwirtz| first3=Michael| last4=Higgins| first4=Andrew| last5=Magra| first5=Iliana| last6=Apuzzo| first6=Matt|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papadopoulos later received an email from Mifsud indicating that Polonskaya was trying to contact him. On April 10 and 11, Papadopoulos contacted Polonskaya asking about a meeting with Russian Ambassador Kislyak, and Polonskaya responded that she had "already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request…As mentioned we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump. The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/11/02/timeline-many-times-george-papadopoulos-tried-connect-trump-campaign-russia/820951001/|title=Who is George Papadopoulos?|last=Steve|first=Reilly|publisher=USA Today|access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papadopoulos  sent emails concerning [[Vladimir Putin]] to at least seven campaign officials. Trump national campaign co-chairman [[Sam Clovis]]&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind S.

Between March and September 2016, Papadopoulos made at least six requests for Trump or representatives of his campaign to meet in Russia with Russian politicians. In May, campaign chairman [[Paul Manafort]] forwarded one such request to his deputy [[Rick Gates (political consultant)|Rick Gates]], saying "We need someone to communicate that (Trump) is not doing these trips. It should be someone low-level in the campaign so as not to send any signal." Gates delegated the task to the campaign's correspondence coordinator, referring to him as "the person responding to all mail of non-importance".&lt;ref name=NBCNewsPlea/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-emails-show-aides-repeated-efforts-to-set-up-russia-meetings/2017/08/14/54d08da6-7dc2-11e7-83c7-5bd5460f0d7e_story.html|title=Trump campaign emails show aide's repeated efforts to set up Russia meetings|last1=Hamburger|first1=Tom|last2=Leonnig|first2=Carol D.|authorlink2=Carol D.

In May 2016, Papadopoulos reportedly revealed Russia's possession of Clinton-related emails at a chance “romantic encounter” with a woman who knew the top [[Australia]]n diplomat to the [[United Kingdom]], [[Alexander Downer]]. Papadopoulos later passed on the tip to him.&lt;ref name="Wroe_1/5/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wroe | first=David | title=The 'romantic encounter' that set off Australia's role in triggering Trump investigation | website=The Age | date=January 5, 2018 | url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/romantic-encounter-set-off-australias-role-in-triggering-donald-trump-investigation-20180105-h0e34r.html | access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a large quantity of wine, Papadopoulos reportedly confirmed to Downer the existence of these emails. After the DNC emails stolen by Russia were published by Wikileaks as an intermediary on July 22, 2016, Australian officials relayed Papadopoulos' statements to American officials. The revelation of Papadopoulos' inside information about Russia's stolen DNC emails was a driving factor in the FBI opening an investigation into the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html|title=How the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political Dirt|last1=LaFraniere|first1=Sharon|last2=Mazzetti|first2=Mark|last3=Apuzzo|first3=Matt|date=December 30, 2017|access-date=January 3, 2018|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papadopoulos was arrested at [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles Airport]] on July 27, 2017, and he has since been cooperating with Special Counsel [[Robert Mueller]] in [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|his investigation]].&lt;ref name=NYTGuilty/&gt; On October 5, 2017, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] to [[making false statements]] to FBI agents relating to contacts he had with agents of the Russian government while working for the Trump campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/file/1007341/download|title=Plea Offer and Defendant's Acceptance|work=United States v.

The '''Vancouver Fringe Festival''' is an annual [[Fringe theatre|alternative theatre festival]] held in Vancouver, [[British Columbia]], Canada established in 1985.&lt;ref name="Province"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vancouver Fringe Fest productions more polished, professional in 30th year |author= Stuart Derdeyn|newspaper=[[The Province|Vancouver Province]] |date=2014-09-02 |url=http://www.theprovince.com/entertainment/Vancouver+Fringe+Fest+productions+more+polished+professional+30th+year/10166031/story.html |accessdate=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is organized and sponsored by the First Vancouver Theatrespace Society, a volunteer [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] society. The festival is usually staged in September at a number of venues around the city. The most recent festival ran from September 7-17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Best+Vancouver+Fringe+Festival/8869152/story.html|title=Best of the Vancouver Fringe Festival|work=Vancouver Sun|first=Mark|last=Lieren-Young|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first Vancouver Fringe Festival was held in 1985. It was centred in [[Mount Pleasant, Vancouver|Mount Pleasant]] and held its opening ceremonies in the parking lot of an IGA. The 220 performances were held in seven venues with 4,000 people in attendance—and only 25 volunteers helping out. Anchor venues in Mount Pleasant included the Western Front, Heritage Hall, and later, for the Fringe Bar, the Mount Pleasant Legion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2009 Vancouver International Fringe Festival Program Guide|url = http://issuu.com/vancouverfringefest/docs/vancouverfringeprogram|website = Issuu|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the festival relocated to [[Commercial Drive, Vancouver|Commercial Drive]]. The Fringe’s first home on the Drive was above the novelty shop where Havana Restaurant is located today. Known as the Production Palace, it was a hub for staff, volunteers, and others. At that time, the festival introduced "bring your own venue", in which [[performer]]s stage [[performance]]s at places other than those provided by the festival organizers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 2001, the Fringe was primarily centralized on [[Granville Island]]. Its opening ceremony that year included a parade around the Island that went against the flow of one way traffic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2012 festival saw an improvised musical based on the works of [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wevancouver.com/arts/bard-on-the-beach-turns-25-1.1138147|title=Bard on the Beach turns 25|work=WE Vancouver|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased professional standards have resulted in the Fringe introducing programs such as its "Dramatic Works Series".&lt;ref name="Province" /&gt;

The Fringe employs an “everyone is welcome” selection technique—the Mainstage shows are literally drawn out of a hat, giving all artists, from novice to veteran, a chance to participate. Vancouver Fringe Festival Mainstage shows feature some of Vancouver’s best venues including the Revue Stage, Performance Works, and the Waterfront Theatre, all situated on and around Granville Island. The Bring Your Own Venue (BYOV) category allows artists to stage original work in unconventional places. The Fringe strives to break down traditional boundaries and encourage open dialogue between audiences and artists by presenting live un-juried, uncensored theatre in an accessible and informal environment. All artists receive 100% of regular box office revenues generated during the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ABOUT THE FRINGE  Vancouver Fringe Festival|url = http://www.vancouverfringe.com/about-the-fringe/|website = www.vancouverfringe.com|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theatre Wire ==
Theatre Wire is a new initiative from the Vancouver Fringe Theatre Society, who also produce the Vancouver Fringe Festival.

Theatre Wire was created to facilitate connections between all the smaller theatre companies in Vancouver. Theatre Wire is a one-stop shop for independent theatre happenings.

In addition to selling tickets and subscriptions to shows, Theatre Wire is also a source for local theatre news, and produces articles about local performing arts history. They are also produced a video series with comedian Sara Bynoe (''Say Wha?: Reading of Deliciously Rotten Writing'') interviewing Vancouver’s theatre personalities, including theatre critic, Colin Thomas and 2015 Jessie Award winner Cameron Mackenzie (Ray Michal Prize for Most Promising New Director).

Funding for Theatre Wire has been provided by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]], the [[Vancouver Foundation]], and the [[British Columbia Arts Council]].

The '''''Women's Journal''''' is currently one of the oldest and longest-running [[women's magazine]]s in the [[Philippines]], having been in publication since 1973. It is published monthly by [[Philippine Journalists]], which also publishes the ''[[People's Journal]]'' and [[People's Journal|''People's Journal Tonight'']]. They are also the publishers of the now-defunct [[Times Journal (Philippines)|''Times Journal'']], a Philippine national daily which existed during the [[Marcos regime]].

The '''''Women's Journal''''' was originally published every Saturday on a weekly basis, from its inception in 1973 until 2007-08 in order to be at par with the Philippine versions of international women's magazines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7912">'''Workers Resistance''' ({{lang-uk|Robitnichi Sprotiv}}) is a [[Trotskyist]] [[political party]] in [[Ukraine]].  It is a member of the [[Committee for a Workers' International]] (CWI). The party was founded in 1994.

==Fraud==
In February 2000, leading members of Workers' Resistance began contacting various [[socialist]] political parties and [[list of left-wing internationals|internationals]] via the [[internet]].  They chose groupings without contacts in Ukraine, and used various invented party names.  Posing as these organisations, they began discussions with them and talked about joint work.  Most of the organisations were keen to develop links, and responded to requests for money to translate and print documents, purchase [[computer]] equipment or maintain an office.

As the fraud progressed, they undertook some poor quality translations, to satisfy their partner organisations.  Some organisations met members of Workers Resistance in person, without suspecting that they were not who they claimed to be.  With the apparent proliferation of socialist groups in Ukraine, the fraudsters began inventing [[polemic]]s between their various front organisations.  This complex web of activity, and the small amounts of money actually obtained, has led to suggestions that the fraud may have been intended to discredit certain groups, or may even have simply been run for entertainment value.

Suspicions grew in several organisations as the complex fraud proved difficult to maintain.  The [[Coordination Council of the Workers Movement]] (a [[Maoist]] organisation in Ukraine) attempted to alert the [[League for the Fourth International]] to the fraud, but were not believed.  The situation was finally exposed in 2003, when a small [[Group of Proletarian Revolutionaries-Collectivists]] informed different left-wing activists and groups about the fraud.

In an attempt to cover their tracks, the fraudsters had produced documents in the names of members of the Coordination Council of the Workers Movement, but people who had met the perpetrators were able to identify them and they soon admitted the fraud.

===CWI response===
The seven individuals involved in the fraud were expelled from the CWI in September 2003 following an investigation by the CWI's International Secretariat which first learned of the allegations against the Ukrainian section earlier in the summer.

On August 29, 2003, the CWI issued a statement on the affair which said, in part:

:In late July and early August, allegations concerning the leadership of the Kiev and Ukrainian organisations of the CWI were brought to our attention. Serious charges of fraud against this leadership in their dealings with many left groups internationally were made and since then CWI representatives have investigated them. Unfortunately, we have found that, in substance, these allegations appear to be true. Indeed, when confronted with these charges, the leadership of the Ukrainian organisation admitted that they had pursued a policy of deception in their dealings with many left groups. This was done, they claim, in order to obtain “information” about these groups, but primarily to gather funds from these organisations.

:Up to this time, the leadership of the CWI and the international secretariat (IS), as well as the international executive committee (IEC), were completely unaware that these methods were being used. They are totally at variance with the longstanding methods, both politically and organisationally, practised by our international. As soon as it was confirmed, by these individuals in Kiev, that these dishonest methods had been used, we took the step of suspending the leadership of the Kiev and Ukrainian organisations. Since then, in a visit to Kiev, an investigation has been conducted by the CWI and we are now in possession of a more detailed picture of what the Ukrainian leadership has done over a period of years in their dealings with other political revolutionary groups.

The statement concluded with the decisions to:

:1. Immediately suspend Oleg Vernik, a member of the IEC of the CWI, and to recommend his expulsion to the next meeting of the IEC. To immediately expel Boris Pastukh, Zakhar Popovich, Alexander Zvorskii, Yuri Baranov, Yaroslav Ganzenko, Alexei Aryabinskii. These individuals are primarily responsible for this shameful incident. They will have the right to appeal against their expulsion to the appropriate bodies.

:2. To suspend immediately the Kiev and Ukrainian organisations. We recognise that within the ranks of the Ukrainian organisation are some very good comrades, some of whom acquiesced to the dishonest methods that were used and some of whom were ignorant of what was done. We intend to recommend to the CIS section of the CWI that the rebuilding of the Ukrainian organisation is undertaken, in conjunction with the IS of the CWI. This will have to be done in such a way as to completely separate the organisation that comes out of this from the methods of the previous leadership, who will have no influence on the direction, deliberations or actions of any Ukrainian or Kiev organisation which adheres to the CWI. A full political discussion will be necessary in Kiev and Ukraine on the perspectives of the CIS organisation as a whole and the CWI, in order to ensure that those who wish to remain in the CWI do so on a clear political and organisational basis, in consonance with the ideas of the CWI.[http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/494/cwi_statement.html]

Since then, Workers Resistance in Ukraine has been reorganized and there has been an attempt to rebuild the party around its remaining members.

===Organisations affected===
Organisations which were affected by the fraud (with the name of the purported Ukrainian party in brackets) include:
*[[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)]] (Communist Struggle Group)
*International Bolshevik Tendency (Young Revolutionary Marxists)
*[[International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party]] (Radical Communists)
*[[Workers Revolutionary Party (UK)|International Committee of the Fourth International (Workers Revolutionary Party)]] (Workers Revolutionary League)
*[[International Trotskyist Opposition]] (Ukrainian Trotskyist Opposition)
*[[International Workers' Committee]] (Ukrainian Workers Committee)
*[[League for a Revolutionary Communist International]] (Workers Power - Young Revolutionary Marxists)

*[[News &amp; Letters]] (Ukraine Workers Group)
*[[Socialist Labor Party]] (Socialist Labor Party of Ukraine)
*[[Workers Liberty]] (Ukrainian Workers Tendency)
*[[World Socialist Movement]] (World Socialist Party)

The International Bolshevik Tendency lobbied events organised by CWI member groups asking for a refund of the money they had donated, but the CWI did not return the money, as they claimed they did not have it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
