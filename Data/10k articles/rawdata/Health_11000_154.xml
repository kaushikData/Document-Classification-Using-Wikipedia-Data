'''Andrew Duncan''', the elder (17 October 1744 – 5 July 1828)
[[FRSE]] [[FRCPE]] [[FSA(Scot)]] was a British physician and professor at [[Edinburgh University]].{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=161}} He was joint founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

==Life==
Duncan was the second son of Andrew Duncan, merchant and shipmaster, of [[Crail]], afterwards of St. Andrews, his mother being a daughter of Professor ''William Vilant'', and related to the Drummonds of Hawthornden. He was born at Pinkerton, near St. Andrews, [[Fife]], on 17 October 1744, and was educated first by Sandy Don of Crail, celebrated in the convivial song of "Crail Town," and afterwards by ''Richard Dick'' of St. Andrews.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=161}}

Duncan proceeded next to [[University of St Andrews]], where he obtained the M.A. degree in 1762. As a youth he was known as "the smiling boy", and his character for good nature was retained through life. Lord Erskine and his brother [[Henry Erskine (lawyer)|Henry Erskine]] were among his school fellows and fast friends through life. In 1762, he entered [[Edinburgh University]] as a medical student, being the pupil of Cullen, [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]], [[Alexander Monro secundus]], [[John Hope (botanist)|Hope]], and Black.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=161}}

Duncan was president of the [[Royal Medical Society]] in 1764, and five times afterwards.
His attachment to the society continued through life; he was its treasurer for many years; and in 1786 a gold medal was voted to him for his services. On the completion of his course of studies in 1768, he went a voyage to China as surgeon of the [[East India Company]]'s ship ''Asia''. Refusing an offer of five hundred guineas to undertake a second voyage, Duncan graduated M.D. at St. Andrews in October 1769, and in May 1770 became a licentiate of the [[Edinburgh College of Physicians]]. In the same year he was an unsuccessful candidate for the professorship of medicine in St. Andrews University.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=161}}

During the absence of Dr. Drummond, professor-elect of medicine at Edinburgh, Duncan was appointed to lecture in 1774–6.  Drummond failing to return, Dr. James Gregory was elected professor, and Duncan started an extra-academical course, as well as a public dispensary,{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=161}} (the first free hospital in Scotland),{{sfn|Waterston|Macmillan Shearer|2006}} which afterwards became the [[Royal Public Dispensary]], incorporated by [[royal charter]] in 1818.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=161}}

In 1773 he lived on Bristo Street in the south of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office directory 1773&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1773, he commenced the publication of ''Medical and Philosophical Commentaries'', a quarterly journal of medicine, at first issued in the name of "a society in Edinburgh", Duncan being named as secretary.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=161}} It was the first medical review journal published regularly in Great Britain.{{sfn|Bettany|Rosner|2004}} The seventh volume was entitled ''Medical Commentaries for the year 1780, collected and published by Andrew Duncan'', and reached a third edition.  The series extended ultimately to twenty volumes, the last issue being in 1795, after which the publication was entitled ''Annals of Medicine'', of which eight volumes were issued. In 1804 it was discontinued in favour of the ''Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal'', edited by his son.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=161}}

Duncan's extra-academical lectures were continued with considerable success till 1790, when he became the president of the [[Edinburgh College of Physicians]]. On Cullen's resignation in that year he was succeeded in the professorship of medicine by Dr. James Gregory, and Duncan followed the latter in the chair of the theory or institutes of medicine (physiology).{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

In 1792, he proposed the erection of a public lunatic asylum in Edinburgh, having first conceived the idea after hearing of the miserable death of [[Robert Fergusson]] in 1774 in the common workhouse. It was not until many difficulties had been surmounted that the project was at last accomplished, and a royal charter was granted in 1807 under which a lunatic asylum was built at Morningside.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

Inspired by a miscarriage of justice, he also delivered the first lectures on [[forensic medicine]] in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and campaigned to establish a chair of [[medical jurisprudence]] there, which was filled by his son, [[Andrew Duncan, the younger]], who followed him into the profession.{{sfn|Forbes1985|p=7}}

In 1808, the freedom of Edinburgh was conferred upon Duncan for his services in the foundation of the dispensary and the asylum. In 1809, he founded the [[Caledonian Horticultural Society]], which, being afterwards incorporated, became of great scientific and practical value. {{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

[[File:Grave of Dr. Andrew Duncan, Buccleuch Church graveyard, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|160px|Duncan's gravestone (centre)]]
In his later years, Duncan was actively occupied in promoting the establishment of a public experimental garden, the scheme for which was actively progressing at his death. In 1819, his son became joint professor with him, and in 1821, Dr. W. P. Alison succeeded to that post, but Duncan continued to do much of the duty to the last. In 1821, on the death of Dr. James Gregory, Duncan became first [[Physician to the King]] in Scotland, having held the same office to the [[Prince of Wales]] for more than thirty years.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

In 1821, Duncan was elected president of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society at its foundation. In 1824, he was again elected president of the Edinburgh College of Physicians.
Although in his later years, he failed to keep up with the progress of physiology, his zeal was unabated, and he discharged many useful offices with extreme punctuality. He used to say that the business of no institution should be hindered by his absence, whether it was forwarded by his presence or not.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

For more than half a century he walked to the top of [[Arthur's Seat]] on May-day morning, accomplishing this for the last time on 1 May 1827. He died at his home, Adam Square in Edinburgh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 5 July 1828, in his eighty-fourth year.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

He bequeathed to the Edinburgh College of Physicians seventy volumes of manuscript notes from the lectures of the founders of the Edinburgh School of Medicine, and a hundred volumes of practical observations on medicine in his own handwriting. A portrait of him by [[Raeburn]] is in the Edinburgh Royal Dispensary, as well as a bust; a full-length portrait was painted in 1825 for the [[Royal Medical Society]] by Watson Gordon.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

==Character assessment==
Duncan was industrious, and a perspicuous rather than a brilliant lecturer. He was generous and hospitable to his pupils and, being naturally gregarious, he founded several clubs, among which the [[Harveian Society]], founded in 1782, was the most notable.
He was its secretary until his death, and never failed to provide its annual meeting with an appropriate address, usually commemorating some deceased ornament of the medical profession. The Esculapian and gymnastic clubs were also of his foundation, and many of his poetical compositions were read or sung at their meetings. He was much loved for his geniality and benevolence.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

==Works==
Duncan's larger works, besides those already mentioned, are:
#‘Elements of Therapeutics,’ 1770, second edition 1773.
#‘Medical Cases,’ 1778, third edition 1784; translated into Latin, Leyden, 1785; translated into French, Paris, 1797.
#An edition of Hoffmann's ‘Practice of Medicine,’ 2 vols. 1783.
#‘The New Dispensatory,’ editions of 1786, 1789, 1791.
#‘Observations on the Distinguishing Symptoms of three different Species of [[Pulmonary consumption]],’ 1813, second edition 1816.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}
#‘The Edinburgh new Dispensatory : containing 1. The Elements of pharmaceutical Chemistry ; 2. The Materia medica; or the natural, pharmaceutical and medical History, of the Substances employed in Medicine ; 3. The pharmaceutical Preparations and Compositions ; including Translations of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia published in 1817, of the Dublin Pharmacopoeia in 1807, and of the London Pharmacopoeia in 1815’. Bell &amp; Bradfute, Edinburgh 9th Edition 1819 [http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:061:2-10611 Digital edition] by the [[University and State Library Düsseldorf]]

In connection with the [[Harveian Society]], Duncan published an oration in praise of [[William Harvey|Harvey]], 1778; and memoirs of [[Alexander Monro (primus)]], 1780; Dr. ''John Parsens'', 1786; [[John Hope (botanist)|Professor Hope]], 1789; [[Alexander Monro (secundus)]], 1818; Sir [[Joseph Banks]], 1821; and Sir [[Henry Raeburn]], 1824.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

Duncan published his ''Opinion'', 1808, and a ''Letter to Dr. James Gregory'', 1811, on the subject of Dr. James Gregory's many controversies. Some of his poetry is included in ''Carminum Rariorum Macaronicorum Delectus'' (Esculapian Society), 1801, second edition enlarged; and ''Miscellaneous Poems, extracted from the Records of the Circulation Club, Edinburgh'', 1818. He also selected and caused to be published ''Monumental Inscriptions selected from Burial Grounds at Edinburgh'', 1815.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=162}}

==Family==
In February 1771, he married Miss Elizabeth Knox, who bore him twelve children. His eldest son, [[Andrew Duncan, the younger|Andrew]], also became a professor at Edinburgh. His third son, Alexander Duncan (1780–1859), became a general in the army and distinguished himself in India.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=161}}

==Grave==
He is buried together with many of his family in a family mausoleum in Buccleuch Churchyard. The Church was built as a Chapel of Ease to resolve overcrowding of the graveyard at its mother church: the parish church of [[St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh]].

As a favour, one of his prodigy students is buried in the tomb, having died during his studies: [[Charles Darwin (1758-1778)]] by blood the uncle of his namesake [[Charles Darwin]] the naturalist, but dying before his birth.

'''Boškov Most Hydro Power Plant''', hereinafter referred to as Boškov Most HPP, is planned to be built in Mala Reka valley in the southernmost part of the [[Mavrovo National Park]]. It will have a total capacity of 70 MW.&lt;ref name="balkanrivers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkanrivers.net/en/key-areas/mavrovo-national-park | title=Dam construction plans put national park at risk | work=Save the blue heart of Europe | accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project threatens the survival of the [[Balkan lynx]].&lt;ref name="bankwatch"&gt;[http://bankwatch.org/sites/default/files/briefing-BoskovMost-6May2014.pdf The hydropower plant Boskov Most.] ''CEE Bankwatch''. May 2014, Retrieved 20 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ([[EBRD]]) agreed in November 2011 to lend EUR 65 million to [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] for the construction of the [[dam]].&lt;ref name="ebrd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebrd.com/pages/project/psd/2011/41979.shtml |title=Project summary - Boskov Most hydro power project |accessdate=20 August 201 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113234244/http://www.ebrd.com/pages/project/psd/2011/41979.shtml |archivedate=2011-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General information==
Boškov Most HPP will be built near the town of [[Debar]] in the western part of the country and will have a generating capacity of 70 MW.&lt;ref name="power"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.power-technology.com/news/newsebrd-to-provide-finance-for-hydro-power-plant-in-macedonia | title=EBRD to provide finance for hydro power plant in Macedonia. | work=Power-technology.com | date=14 November 2011 | accessdate=20 August 2014}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to utilise the [[hydro power]] potential of the [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the river Mala Reka and will include a dam and a [[reservoir]] near the [[village]] of [[Tresonče|Tresonce]].&lt;ref name="ebrd"/&gt; It is estimated that it will produce 117 GW of power per year.&lt;ref name="water"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/news/newsloan-agreed-for-boskov-most-project-macedonia | title=Loan agreed for Boskov Most project, Macedonia. |work=Water Power &amp; Dam Construction | date=14 November 2011 | accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to build the Boskov Most HPP date back to 1983 but it was postponed several times due to financial problems.&lt;ref name="balkaninsight"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Marusic | first1=Sinisa Jakov |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-launches-hydro-power-plant-project | title=Macedonia Signs Deal to Build Hydro Power Plant |work=Balkan insight |date=11 November 2011 | accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011 European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ([[EBRD]]) signed on loaning a country EUR 65 million for the construction of the project.&lt;ref name="ebrd"/&gt; The rest is to be provided by the AD Elektrani na Makedonija (ELEM).&lt;ref name="balkaninsight"/&gt;

ELEM is a 100% [[State ownership|state owned]] electric power utility of Macedonia responsible for [[mining]] and power generation. It was formed in 2005 and currently carries out mining operations in four [[coal mine]]s and operates 1,329 MW of power generating capacity, of which 60% is [[Lignite fired power plant|lignite-fired]] and 40% [[hydropower]].&lt;ref name="ebrd"/&gt;

In 2011 it was estimated that the total cost of the project was to be EUR 84 million however,&lt;ref name="ebrd"/&gt; in 2014 that figure rose to EUR 107 million.&lt;ref name="bankwatch"/&gt;

==The importance of the project for the Macedonian energy sector==
Unfavourable [[energy mix]], strong [[Energy dependence|dependence on energy]] import, obsolete [[Electric power system|energy system]] and inefficiency in energy production and use are the main problems of the Macedonian energy sector.&lt;ref name="elsevier"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ćosić | first1=Boris | first2=Goran | last2=Krajačić |first3=Neven | last3=Duić. |url=http://powerlab.fsb.hr/Neven/pdf/A-100-renewable-energy-system-in-the-year-2050-The-case-of-Macedonia.pdf | title=A 100% renewable energy system in the year 2050: The case of Macedonia. |work=Elsevier | date=29 June 2012 | accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonia [[import]]s roughly a quarter of its annual electricity needs.&lt;ref name="balkaninsight"/&gt; Domestic energy production is based mainly on the low-quality domestic [[lignite]], [[Biomass energy|biomass]] and [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]].&lt;ref name="elsevier"/&gt; The purpose of the Boškov most HPP is to support Macedonia's drive to improve the security and quality of its energy supplies, as well as promoting [[renewable sources]] of energy generation. Once operating, the plant will enable the nation to reduce electricity imports and in addition decrease the [[carbon intensity]] of the Macedonian generation sector.&lt;ref name="ebrd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="power"/&gt;

==Controversial issues==

===Environmental impact===

The [[Mavrovo National Park]] is one of the oldest national parks in [[Europe]], famous for its pristine nature. The park hosts more than 1,000 different plant species. [[Trout]] species, [[Wolf|wolves]], [[bear]]s and [[otter]]s are an important part of the [[ecosystem]]. The park is also a centre of the remaining population of the [[Balkan lynx|Balkan Lynx]], an endangered subspecies of the [[Eurasian lynx|Eurasian Lynx]].&lt;ref name="balkanrivers"/&gt; The territory where it moves is thus a [[critical habitat]] and represents an area where measures for protection and preservation of this species should be undertaken.&lt;ref name="bankwatch"/&gt; Putting any additional stress on this source population may lead to the [[extinction]] of the species.&lt;ref name="balkanrivers"/&gt;

Boškov HPP is designed to produce peak energy which means that the water from Mala Reka river and its [[Tributary|tributaries]] will be diverted into a [[reservoir]] and on demand released once a day. Aside from the fact that the entire valley will suffer from the diversion of the majority of its natural water supplies, it will also result in daily flushes, which have enormous negative impacts on [[biodiversity]] and species populations in the river sections below the HPP.&lt;ref name="bankwatch"/&gt;

===Legal issues===

The [[Environmental impact assessment]] prepared for the project is lacking significant information vital for the precise and objective evaluation of the impact of the project on the environment, specifically data on the [[mammal]]s in the project area and complete absence of the  [[Balkan lynx]] from the study.&lt;ref name="bankwatch"/&gt;

The project is also not in accordance with Law on Nature protection specifically with Article 74, which does not envisage the use of [[natural resource]]s for energy as a part of [[national park]] management and Article 75 which lists the prohibited activities in the national park. Furthermore, the project is not in accordance with the following [[international convention]]s signed and ratified by the government of Macedonia: [[Bern Convention (conservation)|Bern Convention]],  [[Bonn Convention]] and  [[Convention on Biological Diversity|Convention on Biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="bankwatch"/&gt;

===Cancellation of the Project===

After over five years of campaigns against the Boskov Most project, CEE Bankwatch along with its member groups, Macedonian center for environmental research and information, Eko-svest, and Macedonian environmental lawyer association, Front 21/42, finally welcomed the cancellation of the project. &lt;ref&gt;https://bankwatch.org/press_release/destructive-hydropower-project-in-macedonia-loses-its-only-source-of-funding&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, just few days after the [[Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Berne Convention]] decision on [[Mavrovo National Park|Mavrovo]], the [[World Bank]] withdrew its funds from the Lukovo Pole project, thus preventing the project from being realised. 
It took the [[EBRD]] another year to cancel its EUR 65 million loan&lt;ref&gt;https://bankwatch.org/press_release/macedonia-urged-to-suspend-controversial-hydropower-project&lt;/ref&gt; for Boškov Most as well, stating that it fully respects Bern Convention’s recommendation and believes that the project should be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;https://bankwatch.org/press_release/destructive-hydropower-project-in-macedonia-loses-its-only-source-of-funding&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chain smoking''' is the practice of smoking several [[cigarette]]s in succession, sometimes using the ember of a finished cigarette to light the next. The term '''chain smoker''' often also refers to a person who [[tobacco smoking|smokes]] relatively constantly, though not necessarily ''chaining'' each cigarette. The term applies primarily to cigarettes, although it can be used to describe incessant cigar and pipe smoking as well. It is a common form of [[Substance dependence|addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charles |first=Gerras |title=The Encyclopedia of Common Diseases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7NZwYhrBWIC|page=17 |year=1976 |publisher=Rodale Press |isbn=978-0-87857-113-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The use of [[cocaine]] or an [[amphetamine]] with cigarettes can result in chain smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher |first1=Gary L. |last2=Roget |first2=Nancy A. |title=Encyclopedia of Substance Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPJ-39gVHE0C |date=11 November 2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4129-5084-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people chain-smoke when drinking [[Alcoholic drink|alcoholic beverage]]s, because [[ethanol|alcohol]] potentiates [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, leading to [[Reverse tolerance|re-sensitization]] and hence inducing a craving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14622200310001656957 |url=http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/6/1/133.pdf |title=Psychopharmacological interactions between nicotine and ethanol |last1=Rose |first1=J. |last2=Brauer |first2=L. |last3=Behm |first3=F. |last4=Cramblett |first4=M. |journal=Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research |year=2004 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=133–44 |pmid=14982697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which chain smoking is driven by [[nicotine dependence]] has been studied. It does not seem that the amount of nicotine delivered is a significant factor, as the puff volume correlates poorly with the frequency of cigarette consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0091-3057(92)90535-N |title=Effects of smoking abstinence and chain-smoking on puffing topography and diurnal nicotine exposure |last1=Kolonen |first1=S. |last2=Tuomisto |first2=J. |last3=Puustinen |first3=P. |last4=Airaksinen |first4=M. M. |journal=[[Pharmacol Biochem Behav]] |year=1992 |volume=42 |pages=327–32 |issue=2 |pmid=1631188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical use==
Chain-smoking is given as an example of excessive [[Substance dependence|addictive behaviour]] in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helen |first=Keane |title=What's Wrong with Addiction? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqZsDnXS3-cC |date=2002 |page=100 |publisher=Melbourne University Publish |isbn=978-0-522-84991-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be used as a form of [[aversion therapy]] for smokers who are unused to such heavy smoking, inducing them to give up altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cocores |first=James |title=The Clinical Management of Nicotine Dependence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-lrAAAAMAAJ |date=1991 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-0-387-97464-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ventilation==
Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) professionals claim that an airflow of about 1000 cubic feet (28.32 cubic meters) per minute per smoker is required to maintain satisfactory air quality when the smokers are chain smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rock |first=Brian A. |title=Ventilation for Environmental Tobacco Smoke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDupTtFRClkC |date=13 January 2006 |publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=978-0-08-052539-6|page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research confirms that current HVAC systems, while important for general air quality, cannot control exposure to [[Passive smoking|secondhand smoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/fullreport.pdf |page=92 |title=The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General |author=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |year=2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205173605/http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/fullreport.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clitoral erection''' is a physiological phenomenon where the [[clitoris]] becomes enlarged and firm. 

Clitoral erection is the result of a complex interaction of psychological, neural, vascular and endocrine factors, and is usually, though not exclusively, associated with [[sexual arousal]].

==Physiology==
[[Image:Clitoris Anatomy.svg|lang=en|thumb|right|The internal anatomy of the human [[vulva]], with the [[clitoral hood]] and [[labia minora]] indicated as lines.]]

The clitoris is the [[homology (biology)|homologue]] of the [[penis]] in the female. 

The part visible on the outside varies in size from a few millimeters to one centimeter and is located hidden in the [[Labia majora|upper labial]] fold. 

Any type of motion can increase [[blood flow]] to this organ and this results in increased [[Vaginal lubrication|secretions which lubricate]] the [[vagina]]. There are many ways to stimulate the clitoris.

Clitoral erection occurs when the [[Corpus cavernosum clitoridis|corpora cavernosa]], two expandable [[erectile]] structures, become engorged with blood. This may result from any of various [[physiology|physiological]] stimuli, including [[sexual arousal]]. During sexual arousal, arterial blood flow to the clitoris is increased, and trabecular [[smooth muscle]] within the clitoris relaxes allowing blood to engorge the erectile tissues.  The [[ischiocavernosus]] and [[bulbocavernosus muscle]]s contract to compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris to stop drainage of the clitoris, trapping the blood. More specifically, the clitoris has two adjoining erectile tissues corpus cavernosa (corpus cavernosa clitoridis) that form a main body that connects to the glans clitoridis. There is also a strip of erectile tissue (similar to the placement of the [[corpus spongiosum]] in males) running along the ventral surface of the corpus cavernosa main body that connects the glans clitoridis to the commissure of the vestibular bulbs.&lt;ref name=Bono&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bono|first1=Christopher M.|last2=Lin|first2=Vernon W.|title=Spinal Cord Medicine: Principles and Practice|date=May 14, 2014|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|isbn=9781935281771|page=1176|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2n5hTAxdTYC&amp;pg=PT1498&amp;dq=tunica+albuginea+glans+clitoridis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hpgGVbO9D4S6ggSPvYGACQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tunica%20albuginea%20glans%20clitoridis&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clemente|first1=Carmine D.|title=Clemente's Anatomy Dissector|date=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-60831-384-6|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-M4CUkkZB0C&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=clitoral+anatomy+dissector+bulbs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mGtIaw_Jqa&amp;sig=avbmYN_uwKplJzAUoBUfO2BIBEU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fsgEVZvJFMryoASimYLQCQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=clitoral%20anatomy%20dissector%20bulbs&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main body of the corpus cavernosa with a ventral erectile tissue strip make up the shaft, which is connected to the glans clitoridis. The tunica albuginea is a fibrous-elastic sheath, surrounds the shaft and glans clitoridis. The tunica albuginea does not surround the bulbs of vestibule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mulhall|first1=John P.|last2=Incrocci|first2=Luca|last3=Goldstein|first3=Irwin|last4=Rosen|first4=Ray|title=Cancer and Sexual Health|date=Apr 23, 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781607619161|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpIadil3YsQC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=tunica+albuginea+clitoris&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TIaPqJ8qTe&amp;sig=0b5CcpleT2RjyrPYY7PXnyqQFbQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oZIGVfvuEYmqoQTqrIGQDA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tunica%20albuginea%20clitoris&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erectile tissues are composed of endothelium-lined vascular spaces in a trabecular matrix, with the [[endothelium]]-lined vascular spaces surrounded by smooth muscle capable of contraction and relaxation.

During sexual arousal, arterial blood flow to the clitoris is increased, and within the clitoris, the arteries further branch to supply the erectile tissues. The trabecular smooth muscles of the erectile tissue relax increasing blood flow to fill the vascular spaces, expanding the erectile tissues until they are fully engorged with blood.&lt;ref name=Bono/&gt; The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles contract, compressing the dorsal vein of the clitoris.  This compression of the vein restricts drainage of the erectile structures, trapping the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hornstein|first1=Theresa|last2=Schwerin|first2=Jeri|title=Biology Of Women|date=Jan 1, 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781285401027 |pages=62–63 of 816 |edition=5th |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ibgKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63 |accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process stretches the tunica albuginea.  As a result, the clitoris becomes tumescent to accommodate the increased intracavernosus pressure.

The lack of this plexus in the clitoris indicates that while the organ can become tumescent or engorged, it cannot, like the penis become stiffly erect.  The clitoris thus does not really become erect with sexual excitement, but engorged."&lt;ref name=Jansen/&gt; In addition, the tunica albuginea around the glans is thinner than around the shaft in both the clitoris and penis. This gives the glans less firmness relative to the shaft. The extrusion of the [[glans clitoridis]] and thinning of the skin enhances [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensitivity]] to physical contact. After a female has [[orgasm]]ed, the erection usually ends, but this may take time.

'''Constipation in children''' refers to the medical condition of [[constipation]] in children. It is a [[functional gastrointestinal disorder]].

==Characteristics==
Children have different bowel movement patterns than adults. In addition, there is a wide spectrum of normalcy when considering children’s bowel habits.&lt;ref name=Col2015 /&gt; On average, infants have 3-4 bowel movements/day, and toddlers have 2-3 bowel movements per day. At around age 4, children develop an adult-like pattern of bowel movements (1-2 stools/day). Children benefit from scheduled toilet breaks, once early in the morning and 30 minutes after meals.&lt;ref name=walia&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walia R, Mahajan L, Steffen R | title = Recent advances in chronic constipation | journal = Curr Opin Pediatr | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 661–6 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19606041 | doi = 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32832ff241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bharucha&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bharucha AE | title = Constipation | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 709–31 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17643910 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpg.2007.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rome III Criteria for constipation in children helps to define constipation for various age groups.

==Causes==

While it is difficult to assess an exact age at which constipation most commonly arises, children frequently suffer from constipation in conjunction with life-changes. Examples include: toilet training, starting or transferring to a new school, and changes in diet.&lt;ref name=Col2015 /&gt; Especially in infants, changes in formula or transitioning from breast milk to formula can cause constipation. Fortunately, the majority of constipation cases are not tied to a medical disease, and treatment can be focused on simply relieving the symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Congenital causes===
[[Congenital disorder|A number of diseases present at birth]] can result in constipation. They are as a group uncommon with Hirschsprung’s disease (HD) being the most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Constipation: etiology, evaluation and management|last=Wexner|first=Steven|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HD is more common in males than females, affecting 1 out of 5000 babies. In people with HD, specific types of cells called ‘neural crest cells’ fail to migrate to parts of the colon. This causes the affected portion of the colon to be unable to contract and relax to help push out a bowel movement. The affected portion of the colon remains contracted, making it difficult for stool to pass through.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease?source=search_result&amp;search=hirschsprung%20disease%20children&amp;selectedTitle=1~69|title=UpToDate: Constipation|last=Wesson|first=David|date=November 9, 2016|website=UpToDate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern for HD should be raised in a child who has not passed stool during the first 48 hours of life. Milder forms of HD, in which only a small portion of the colon is affected, can present later in childhood as constipation, abdominal pain, and bloating.&lt;ref name="Wesson"/&gt; Similar disorders to HD include anal [[achalasia]] and hypoganglionosis. In hypoganglionosis, there is a low number of neural crest cells, so the colon remains contracted. In anal achalasia, the internal anal sphincter remains contracted, making it difficult for stool to pass. However, there is a normal number of neural crest cells present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are also congenital structural anomalies that can lead to constipation, including anterior displacement of the anus, [[imperforate anus]], strictures, and small left colon syndrome.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anterior displacement of the anus can be diagnosed on physical exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pediatrics|first=American Academy of|date=1986-08-01|title=Congenital Anterior Displacement of Anus|url=http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/content/8/2/38|journal=Pediatrics in Review|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=38–62|doi=10.1542/pir.8-2-38|issn=0191-9601}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease causes constipation because the inappropriate positioning of the anus which make it difficult to pass a bowel movement. Imperforate anus is an anus that ends in a blind pouch and does not connect to the rest of the person's intestines. Small left colon syndrome is a rare disease in which the left side of the babies colon has a small diameter, which makes it difficult for stool to pass. A risk factor for small left colon syndrome is having a mother with diabetes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some symptoms that may indicate an underlying disease include:&lt;ref name=Col2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colombo|first=Jennifer M.|last2=Wassom|first2=Matthew C.|last3=Rosen|first3=John M.|date=2015-09-01|title=Constipation and Encopresis in Childhood|journal=Pediatrics in Review|volume=36|issue=9|pages=392–401; quiz 402|doi=10.1542/pir.36-9-392|issn=1526-3347|pmid=26330473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rome process]] suggests a diagnosis of constipation in children fewer than 4 years old when the child has 2 or more of the following complaints for at least 1 month.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For children older than 4 years, there must be 2 of these complaints for at least 2 months.
* 2 or fewer bowel movements per week
* Passing large bowel movements
* On physical exam, a doctor may find large amounts of feces within the child’s rectum. 
* A child who is already toilet trained has at least 1 accident per week involving a bowel movement. 
* Child demonstrates withholding behavior in which he or she actively tries not to pass a bowel movement. 
* Hard stools
* Pain with defecation.

For children, the degree of constipation may be scored by the ''Leech'' or the ''Barr'' systems:
[[File:Leech scoring areas.jpg|thumb|Areas used for the Leech system of constipation grading.]]
*The Leech system assigns a score of 0 to 5 based on the amount of feces:&lt;ref name="LeechMcHugh1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leech|first1=Susan C.|last2=McHugh|first2=Kieran|last3=Sullivan|first3=P.

:*0: no visible feces 
:*1: scanty feces visible
:*2: mild fecal loading
:*3: moderate fecal loading
:*4: severe fecal loading
:*5: severe fecal loading with bowel dilatation
:These score are assigned separately for the right colon, the left colon and the rectosigmoid colon, resulting in a maximum score of 15. A Leech score of 9 or greater is regarded as positive for constipation.&lt;ref name="LeechMcHugh1999"/&gt;
*The Barr system rates both the amount and consistency of the faeces, and assigns a score separately for the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and rectum. Its maximum score is 22, and a score of 10 or greater is regarded as positive for constipation.&lt;ref name="G.H.2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=G.|first1=Anthony|last2=H.|first2=Kathleen|title=The Role of Diagnostic Tests in Constipation in Children|journal=|year=2012|doi=10.5772/29213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
[[Lactulose]] and milk of magnesia have been compared with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) in children. All had similar side effects, but PEG was more effective at treating constipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1471 |title=Is PEG (Polyethylene Glycol) a more effective laxative than Lactulose in the treatment of a child who is constipated? |work = BestBETs |date = 16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Candy D, Belsey J | title = Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review | journal = Arch.

==Epidemiology==
There is wide variation in the rates of constipation as reported by research in various countries.&lt;ref name="Boronat 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boronat|first1=Alexandre Canon|last2=Ferreira-Maia|first2=Ana Paula|last3=Matijasevich|first3=Alicia|last4=Wang|first4=Yuan-Pang|title=Epidemiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders in children and adolescents: A systematic review|journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology|date=2017|volume=23|issue=21|pages=3915|doi=10.3748/wjg.v23.i21.3915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variation in research data makes it challenging to describe the true global situation.&lt;ref name="Boronat 2017"/&gt;

Approximately 3% of children have constipation, with girls and boys being equally affected.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tabbers|first=M.M.|last2=DiLorenzo|first2=C.|last3=Berger|first3=M.Y.|last4=Faure|first4=C.|last5=Langendam|first5=M.W.|last6=Nurko|first6=S.|last7=Staiano|first7=A.|last8=Vandenplas|first8=Y.|last9=Benninga|first9=M.A.|title=Evaluation and Treatment of Functional Constipation in Infants and Children|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00005176-201402000-00027|journal=Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition|volume=58|issue=2|pages=265–281|doi=10.1097/mpg.0000000000000266}}&lt;/ref&gt; With constipation accounting for approximately 5% of general pediatrician visits and 25% of pediatric gastroenterologist visits, the symptom carries a significant financial impact upon our healthcare system.&lt;ref name=Col2015/&gt;

==Society and culture==
Constipation is often emotionally stressful for children and their caregivers.&lt;ref name="Ferrara 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrara|first1=Lucille R.|last2=Saccomano|first2=Scott J.|title=Constipation in children|journal=The Nurse Practitioner|date=July 2017|volume=42|issue=7|pages=30–34|doi=10.1097/01.NPR.0000520418.32331.6e}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for parents to bring their children to doctors for this condition.&lt;ref name="Ferrara 2017"/&gt; The experience of going to a doctor for this can be stressful.&lt;ref name="Ferrara 2017"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6356">'''Cream skimming''' is a [[pejorative]] [[conceptual metaphor]] used to refer to the perceived business practice of a company providing a product or a service to only the high-value or low-cost customers of that product or service, while disregarding clients that are less profitable for the company.

[[File:Separator, Klosters bruksmuseum.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A cream separator, which uses manual [[centrifugal force]] to separate cream from milk.]]
The term derives from the practice of extracting [[cream]] from fresh milk at a [[dairy]], in which a [[separator (milk)|separator]] draws off the cream (which is lighter, and floats) from fresh or raw milk.  The cream has now been "skimmed" or captured separately from the fresh milk.  

The idea behind the concept of cream skimming in business is that the "cream" – high value or low-cost customers, who are more profitable to serve – would be captured by some suppliers (typically by charging less than the previous higher prices, but still making a profit), leaving the more expensive or harder to service customers without the desired product or service at all or "dumping" them on some default provider, who is left with less of the higher value customers who, in some cases, would have provided extra revenue to subsidize or reduce the cost to service the higher-cost customers, and the loss of the higher value customers might actually require the default provider to have to ''raise'' prices to cover the lost revenue, thus making things worse.

Whether or not the perceived negative effects of cream skimming actually do occur – or only occur in limited circumstances – is a matter of judgment and debate.

==Examples==
The term has been used in relation to the concept of [[school vouchers]] in which it is claimed that the vouchers could be used by parents of "better" students (i.e., students with above average grades who are not disciplinary risks) to move them out of lower performing or substandard [[state school]]s and into less-crowded [[private school|private]] ones, leaving the "worse" students (i.e., students with learning disabilities or who are troublemakers) behind in the state schools, making the situation worse.

For example, it was believed that [[MCI Communications|MCI]] and [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] [[Interexchange carrier|long distance telephone]] companies would end up taking away very high value business and some residential accounts from [[AT&amp;T]], leaving AT&amp;T primarily with higher-cost to service accounts or ones producing less revenue (such as customers in less-densely populated or rural areas), meaning all customers of AT&amp;T would end up paying more.&lt;ref&gt;An example of how it is believed competitors may take advantage of cream skimming off the carrier of last resort in telecommunications, who otherwise would be making monopoly profits, is given by Peter Smith, "Subscribing to Monopoly" in ''Public Policy for the Private Sector'', [[The World Bank]], September, 1995, available at {{cite web |url=http://rru.worldbank.org/documents/publicpolicyjournal/053smith.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618060635/http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PublicPolicyJournal/053smith.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-18 |df= }}, (179K, retrieved March 11, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This could conceivably lead to a [[vicious circle]] as more customers leave the high-price carrier for the lower priced carrier, thus forcing still more price increases to cover the upward spiraling costs of providing service to a shrinking revenue base.  This scenario did not occur, as various technological changes (spurred in part by the availability of competition) eventually lowered the net cost for most long-distance telephone calls.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of how extreme competition in telephone service drove prices down and cream skimming did not occur are given in Martin Ostermayer, Christian Nobs and Darrell Gualco, ''Business: Local Service Market including ILEC and CLEC'', 17 February 1999 at {{cite web |url=http://www.ehrlichorg.com/s99ibm/b0217-02.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227070412/http://www.ehrlichorg.com/s99ibm/b0217-02.doc |archivedate=2004-12-27 |df= }} (Microsoft Word Document, 172K, retrieved 11 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Postal Service]] has a monopoly on the delivery of "non-urgent" first-class mail, where delivery is not time-sensitive.  It also has the exclusive right to use customer-owned mail boxes for placing the customer's mail for delivery.  This means that, even though mail boxes, such as those in the door of a house, or on the curb, or in the front lobby of the customer's building, are owned by the customer, and not owned by the Postal Service, by law only the Postal Service may use them to deliver mail.  This law is in effect because it is believed that were the Postal Service to not have this monopoly, other competing mail carriers would take over the most lucrative parts of the business (e.g. local delivery of bills in dense urban areas), leaving the Postal Service with more expensive urban deliveries and rural service.&lt;ref&gt;An analysis of this particular factor is given in Michael A. Crew and Paul R. Kleindorfer ''Emerging Competition in Postal and Delivery Services'', in Chapter 10, "An Analysis of the Potential of Cream Skimming in the United States Residential Delivery Market" by Robert H. Cohen, William W. Ferguson, John D. Walker and Spyros X. Xenakis.  A sample from this chapter is available from Google Book Search at [https://books.google.com/books?id=4nd-sU4jOE8C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=postal+mail+%22cream+skimming%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ZzMCSiAaay&amp;sig=_bjE4OAqVtUMcekStnVwmHmyeHU&amp;hl=en this link] (Retrieved 11 March 2008)   The same article also appears as a web page on the website of the [[Postal Regulatory Commission]] at http://www.prc.gov/prc-docs/library/refdesk/techpapers/prcstaff/cohen.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Retrieved 14 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VMK-Krone2.jpg| thumb | 250px | Dental technologist building porcelain [[dental bridge]].]]

A '''dental technologist''' (dental laboratory technician) is a member of the dental team who, upon prescription from a dental clinician, constructs custom-made restorative and dental appliances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dentalcouncil.org.nz/Documents/Scopes/ScopesOfPractice_Technicians.pdf Dental Council of New Zealand, ''Notice of Scopes of Practice and Prescribed Qualifications'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122105433/http://www.gdc-uk.org/NR/rdonlyres/6E573762-BD24-418C-A863-7283A05E6A9F/0/ScopeofpracticeApril2009.pdf General Dental Council UK, ''Scopes of Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four major disciplines within dental technology.  These are ''fixed prosthesis'' including [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]] and [[Dental implant|implants]]; ''removable prosthesis'', including [[dentures]] and [[removable partial denture]]s;  ''maxillofacial prosthesis'', including [[ocular prosthesis]] and [[craniofacial prosthesis]]; and ''orthodontics and auxiliaries'', including [[orthodontic technology|orthodontic appliances]] and [[mouthguard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=142 ''Dental technician/dental technologist'' NHS Careers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dentist communicates with the dental technologist with prescriptions, drawings and measurements taken from the patient.  The most important aspect of this is a [[Impression (dental)|dental impression]] into which the technologist flows a [[Plaster#In medicine|gypsum dental stone]] to create a replica of the patient's anatomy known as a dental cast. A technologist can then use this cast for the construction of custom appliances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/content/medical/14275/css/14275_203.htm ''Fabricating Casts'' http://www.tpub.com/content/medical/14275/css/14275_203.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed restorations==
A '''fixed dental restoration''' is an appliance designed to replace a tooth or teeth that may have been lost or damaged by injury, caries or other oral diseases. These restorations are distinguished from other restorations by the fact that once they have been placed by a dentist the patient can not remove them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/6630184/The-Functionally-Fixed-Restoration ''The functional fixed'' https://www.scribd.com/doc/6630184/The-Functionally-Fixed-Restoration]&lt;/ref&gt;
Such Restorations include; crowns, bridges, veneers, fixed implant restorations, inlays and onlays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zitzmann |first1=Nicola Ursula |last2=Hagmann |first2=Edgar |last3=Weiger |first3=Roland |title=What is the prevalence of various types of prosthetic dental restorations in Europe? |journal=Clinical Oral Implants Research |volume=18 |pages=20–33 |year=2007 |pmid=17594367 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0501.2007.01435.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurypoisoned.com/different.html ''Types of Dental Restorations'' http://www.mercurypoisoned.com/different.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removable restorations==
'''Removable restorations''' are dental appliances to replace one or more teeth that have been completely lost.  These restorations ideally remain stable in normal function but can be removed by the patient for cleaning and at night.  Removable restorations are either retained by the patients soft tissue as in full dentures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-3913(83)90228-7 |last1=Jacobson |first1=TE |last2=Krol |first2=AJ |title=A contemporary review of the factors involved in complete denture retention, stability, and support. Part I: retention |journal=The Journal of prosthetic dentistry |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=5–15 |year=1983 |pmid=6337253}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by other teeth as with partial dentures and [[overdenture]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~gsb5/RPD_step_by_step_protocol.pdf ''Removable partial denture design protocol'']&lt;/ref&gt; or on implant attachments as with implant retained overdentures and partial dentures.

==Orthodontics==
Orthodontic technologists make removable orthodontic appliances with wires, springs and screws on prescription from an [[orthodontist]] to either move teeth to form a more harmonious occlusion and aesthetic appearance of teeth or to maintain the position of previously moved teeth.

The '''Federation of European Nutrition Societies (FENS)''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit association]], established in 1979 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPNS%2FPNS37_02%2FS0029665178000208a.pdf&amp;code=29e9ebe17b999810d298f403f4d38dc7 |title= The history of The Nutrition Society |author= Alice M. Coppi |date=1978 |page= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a roof organization for the national [[nutrition]] [[societies]] in Europe, with each country represented by its representative Nutrition Society or Association within FENS.

The aims of FENS are the combination of efforts for the development of research and education in [[Nutrition science|Nutrition Sciences]] and the promotion of the importance of Nutrition for [[public health]] in [[Europe]]. It seeks to do this by coordinating the European nutrition societies at a European level, promoting and disseminating [[research]] and knowledge on nutrition sciences and facilitating nutrition learning and training, as well as scientific exchange across Europe.

FENS conducts every 4 years its main event, the FENS European Nutrition Conference, which is organized by one of the FENS member societies, elected by the FENS General Assembly. All FENS Member [[Society|Societies]] and [[Professional association|Association]]s can take part in the [[bidding]] process for the organization of a FENS ENC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fensnutrition.eu/index.php?p=inicio&amp;sec=statutes |title= Statutes of the Federation of European Nutrition Societies, 3rd update|author= FENS General Assembly |date=2011 |page= 1 (E)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation of European Nutrition Societies is a member of the [[International Union of Nutritional Sciences|International Union of Nutritional Sciences (IUNS)]] &lt;ref&gt;IUNS Adhering Bodies FENS: [http://www.iuns.org/affiliated_bodies/federation-of-european-nutrition-societies-fens IUNS Affiliated Bodies]&lt;/ref&gt; and the official FENS Journal is the “Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism”&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism ([https://www.researchgate.net/journal/1421-9697_Annals_of_Nutrition_and_Metabolism Ann Nutr Metabol)]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Impact factor|IF]] 2014/2015: 2.618)

'''Gynecologic ultrasonography''' or '''gynecologic sonography''' refers to the application of [[medical ultrasonography]] to the female pelvic organs (specifically the [[uterus]], the [[ovaries]], and the [[Fallopian tubes]]) as well as the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], the [[Adnexa of uterus|adnexa]], and the [[Pouch of Douglas]]. The procedure may lead to other medically relevant findings in the pelvis.

==Routes==
[[File:Transvaginal ultrasonography device.png|thumb|Device for both [[vaginal ultrasonography]] and [[abdominal ultrasonography]].]]
[[File:Mirena in optimal place - schematic.png|thumb|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] to check the location of an [[intrauterine device]] (IUD).]]

The examination can be performed by [[transabdominal ultrasonography]], generally  with a full bladder which acts as an [[acoustic window]] to achieve better visualization of pelvis organs, or by [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] with a specifically designed vaginal transducer. Transvaginal imaging utilizes a higher frequency imaging, which gives better resolution of the ovaries, uterus and [[endometrium]] (the fallopian tubes are generally not seen unless distended), but is limited to depth of image penetration, whereas larger lesions reaching into the abdomen are better seen transabdominally.  Having a full bladder for the transabdominal portion of the exam is helpful because sound travels through fluid with less attenuation to better visualize the uterus and ovaries which lies posteriorly to the bladder.  The procedure is by definition [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] when performed transvaginally. Scans are performed by health care professionals called sonographers, or gynecologists trained in ultrasound.

==Applications==
Gynecologic sonography is used extensively:
* to assess pelvic organs,
* to diagnose [[acute appendicitis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Caspi | first1 = B. | last2 = Zbar | first2 = AP. | last3 = Mavor | first3 = E. | last4 = Hagay | first4 = Z. | last5 = Appelman | first5 = Z. | title = The contribution of transvaginal ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: an observational study. | journal = Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–6 |date=Mar 2003 | doi = 10.1002/uog.72 | PMID = 12666223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* to diagnose and manage gynecologic problems including [[endometriosis]], [[leiomyoma]], [[adenomyosis]], ovarian cysts and lesions,
* to identify adnexal masses, including [[ectopic pregnancy]],
* to diagnose gynecologic [[cancer]]
* in infertility treatments to track the response of [[ovarian follicle]]s to [[fertility medication]] (i.e. [[Pergonal]]). However, it often underestimates the true ovarian volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosendahl M, Ernst E, Rasmussen PE, Yding Andersen C |title=True ovarian volume is underestimated by two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound measurement |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 3|pages= 995–998|date=December 2008 |pmid=19108822 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.055 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through transvaginal sonography ovarian cysts can be aspirated. This technique is also used in [[transvaginal oocyte retrieval]] to obtain human eggs ([[oocyte]]s) through sonographic directed transvaginal puncture of ovarian follicles in [[IVF]].

Gynecologic ultrasonography is sometimes [[unnecessary health care|overused]] when it is used to screen for ovarian cancer in women who are not at risk for this cancer.&lt;ref name="ACOGfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 =  American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |author1-link = American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-obstetricians-and-gynecologists/ |accessdate = August 1, 2013}}, which cites

'''Sonohysterography''' is a specialized procedure by which fluid, usually sterile saline (then called '''saline infusion sonography''' or '''SIS'''), is instilled into the uterine cavity, and gynecologic sonography performed at the same time. A review in 2015 came to the conclusion that SIS is highly [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]] in the detection of intrauterine abnormalities in [[subfertile women]], comparable to [[hysteroscopy]]. SIS is highly sensitive and [[sensitivity and specificity|specific]] test in the diagnosis of [[uterine polyp]]s, submucous [[uterine fibroid]]s, [[uterine anomalies]] and [[intrauterine adhesions]] (as part of [[Asherman's syndrome]]), and can be used as a screening tool for subfertile women prior to [[in vitro fertilisation|IVF]] treatment.&lt;ref name="SeshadriEl-Toukhy2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seshadri|first1=S.|last2=El-Toukhy|first2=T.|last3=Douiri|first3=A.|last4=Jayaprakasan|first4=K.|last5=Khalaf|first5=Y.|title=Diagnostic accuracy of saline infusion sonography in the evaluation of uterine cavity abnormalities prior to assisted reproductive techniques: a systematic review and meta-analyses|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=21|issue=2|year=2014|pages=262–274|issn=1355-4786|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu057|pmid=25505226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Africa HIV-AIDS 2002.png|thumb|Africa HIV-AIDS 500px|Prevalence of HIV/AIDS in adult (ages 15–49) populations (1999–2002)]]

{{as of|2012}}, approximately 1,100,000 people in [[Malawi]] are [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-positive]], which represents 10.8% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Because the [[Politics of Malawi|Malawian government]] was initially slow to respond to the epidemic under the leadership of [[Hastings Banda]] (1966–1994), the prevalence of HIV/AIDS increased drastically between 1985, when the disease was first identified in Malawi, and 1993, when HIV prevalence rates were estimated to be as high as 30% among pregnant women.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; The [[Malawian food crisis]] in 2002 resulted, at least in part, from a loss of agricultural productivity due to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Various degrees of government involvement under the leadership of [[Bakili Muluzi]] (1994–2004) and [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] (2004–2012) resulted in a gradual decline in HIV prevalence, and, in 2003, many people living in Malawi gained access to [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral therapy]].&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; [[Condom]]s have become more widely available to the public through non-governmental organizations, and more Malawians are taking advantage of [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing services]].&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt;

Due to several successful [[television]] and [[radio]] campaigns by the [[Politics of Malawi|Malawian government]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; However, many men have adopted [[fatalism|fatalistic attitudes]] in response to the epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, women are [[gender inequality|more likely to be HIV-positive]] than men in Malawi.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; The epidemic has affected [[Sexual intercourse|sexual relationships]] between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease.&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt; In addition, many [[teacher]]s exclude HIV/AIDS from their [[curriculum|curricula]] because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school.&lt;ref name="Fourteen"/&gt; Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of [[orphan]]s in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to [[AIDS orphan|abuse and exploitation]].&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt;

The first case of HIV/AIDS in Malawi was reported at Lilongwe's [[Kamuzu Central Hospital]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=Thirty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Government of Malawi|title=GLOBAL AIDS RESPONSE PROGRESS REPORT: Malawi Country Report for 2010 and 2011|date=2012|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/knowyourresponse/countryprogressreports/2012countries/ce_MW_Narrative_Report%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Hastings Banda]], who was in power at the time, responded with several small-scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS Control Programme, a division of the [[Healthcare in Malawi|Ministry of Health]], to manage the growing epidemic.&lt;ref name=AVERT&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV &amp; AIDS in Malawi|url=http://www.avert.org/hiv-aids-malawi.htm|publisher=AVERT|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banda believed that issues relating to sex, including HIV transmission, should not be addressed in the public sphere; during this time, it was illegal for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly.&lt;ref name=Sixteen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalipeni|first=Ezekiel|author2=Jayati Ghosh|title=Concern and practice among men about HIV/AIDS in low socioeconomic income areas of Lilongwe, Malawi|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2007|volume=64|issue=5|pages=1116–1127|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt;

In 1994, when [[Bakili Muluzi]] became president, he addressed the nation's need for a coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; In 2000, Muluzi introduced another five-year policy known as the National Strategic Framework, but, like Banda's five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan, this plan was largely ineffective.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; In 2001, in response to problems within the National AIDS Control Programme established by Banda, Muluzi created the National AIDS Commission.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Unlike Banda, who prevented the public from accessing information about the epidemic, Muluzi ensured that information about HIV/AIDS was available on the radio and television, in newspapers, and on billboards.&lt;ref name="Sixteen"/&gt; However, despite Muluzi's efforts, HIV prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period, and Malawi experienced an AIDS-related nationwide [[Malawian food crisis|famine]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt;

Malawians gained access to [[antiretroviral drugs]] in 2003, and, with a donation from the [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria]] and the election of new President [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] in 2004, government interventions increased substantially.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; However, soon after his election, Mutharika experienced tensions with Muluzi after implementing an anti-corruption program, which distracted the government from addressing the nation's food and HIV/AIDS-related crises.&lt;ref name=Eleven&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Jayati|author2=Ezekiel Kalipeni|title=Women in Chinsapo, Malawi: Vulnerability and Risk to HIV/AIDS|journal=Journal of Social Aspects of HIV/AIDS|year=2005|volume=2|issue=3|pages=320–32|doi=10.1080/17290376.2005.9724857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these obstacles, Mutharika successfully developed a National AIDS Policy and appointed a Principal Secretary for HIV/AIDS during his presidency.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt;

==Awareness and risk perception==
[[File:PIH worker with disease treatment literature for the community.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Partners in Health]] worker with disease treatment literature in Malawi]]
Despite Malawi's limited health and educational infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many people living in both urban and rural Malawi.&lt;ref name=One&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barden-O'Fallon|first=Janine|author2=Joseph Degraft-Johnson|title=Factors Associated with HIV/AIDS Knowledge and Risk Perception in Rural Malawi|journal=AIDS and Behavior|year=2004|volume=8|issue=2|pages=131–40|doi=10.1023/b:aibe.0000030244.92791.63}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi are most likely to learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, [[health workers]] at local clinics, and female members of their social networks.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.&lt;ref name="Sixteen"/&gt;

Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and education correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated higher levels of knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; Because men typically have [[gender inequality|greater access]] to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands would be less likely to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with [[prostitutes]] and other women from high-risk groups.&lt;ref name="Eleven"/&gt; In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

The aforementioned study by Barden-O'Fallon et al., which surveyed 940 women and 661 men, indicated that, despite their knowledge and awareness, many people in Malawi do not feel [[risk perception|personally susceptible]] to HIV infection.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; On average, only 23% of the adults who were surveyed during this study, both male and female, believed that they were likely to contract HIV and die of AIDS.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; Greater HIV/AIDS awareness among men does not seem to correspond with increased perceived risk; on the other hand, increased levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS do correlate positively to perceived risk among women.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; Another study conducted in rural Malawi between 1998 and 2001 by Kirsten P. Smith et al. indicated that concerns about personal vulnerability to HIV/AIDS declined during this four-year time frame, probably because the increased use of [[HIV prevention|preventative strategies]] gave people a sense of control.&lt;ref name=Twenty-five&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kirsten|author2=Susan Watkins|title=Perceptions of Risk and Strategies for Prevention: Responses to HIV/AIDS in Rural Malawi|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2005|volume=60|pages=649–660|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.06.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many participants in this study claimed that they were "not at all worried" about HIV/AIDS; unless they had simply adopted a fatalistic standpoint towards the epidemic, these respondents probably felt that they had successfully reduced their risk of exposure through personal behavioral changes.&lt;ref name="Twenty-five"/&gt;

==Education==
[[File:HEC Blantyre.JPG|thumb|275px|Health Education Center in Blantyre, Malawi]]
Students in Malawi have expressed high levels of dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students do not believe that the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS-based discrimination]] at school.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt;

Most teachers are required to address [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways.&lt;ref name=Fourteen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kachingwe|first=Sitingawawo|title=Preparing Teachers as HIV/AIDS Prevention Leaders in Malawi: Evidence from Focus Groups|journal=International Electronic Journal of Health Education|date=2005|volume=8|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves.&lt;ref name="Fourteen"/&gt; Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease.&lt;ref name="Fourteen"/&gt; In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny the extent of the epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Fourteen"/&gt;

==Affected groups==
Although the HIV/AIDS epidemic has affected men, women, and children in Malawi, certain factors such as [[sexual orientation]], [[gender]], and age influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through [[heterosexual sex]], but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the [[men who have sex with men|homosexual male population]] in Malawi.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; In addition, women in Malawi are more likely to be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are [[gender inequality|particularly vulnerable]] to HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of [[AIDS orphan|orphans]] in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt;

===Men===
Due to the vast scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV contraction and death from AIDS are inevitable.&lt;ref name=Fifteen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaler|first=Amy|title=AIDS-talk in Everyday Life: The Presence of HIV/AIDS in Men's Informal Conversation in Southern Malawi|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2004|volume=59|issue=2|pages=285–97|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2003.10.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; These men sometimes claim that [[unprotected sex]] is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of [[condom usage|condom use]] during sex with extramarital partners.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring to believe that they have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict [[fidelity]].&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.&lt;ref name="Sixteen"/&gt;

However, despite these widespread feelings of fatalism, some men believe that they can avoid HIV contraction by modifying their personal behaviors.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Men who decide to change their behaviors to reduce their risk of infection are unlikely to use [[condom usage|condoms]] consistently, particularly during marital intercourse; instead, they usually continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations, but alter the ways in which they choose their sexual partners.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; For example, before selecting extramarital sexual partners, men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to the virus.&lt;ref name="Twenty-five"/&gt; Men who choose their sexual partners based on external appearances and peer recommendations often believe that women who violate traditional [[gender norms]] by, for example, wearing modern clothing are more likely to carry HIV, while young girls, who are perceived as sexually inexperienced, are considered "pure."&lt;ref name="Fifteen"/&gt; Because of this perception, many people are concerned that [[schoolchildren]] in Malawi, particularly girls, are becoming exposed to the virus through sexual harassment or abuse by their instructors.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt;

===Women===
According to [[Gender role|traditional gender roles]] in Malawi, men operate primarily in the [[public sector|formal work sector]] and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and [[care work]]; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's [[autonomy]], thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Eleven"/&gt; Even within the home, women often lack [[bargaining power]] because they have limited access to [[education]], [[informal sector|formal employment]], and other resources that could give them a sense of [[Financial independence|financial]] and personal independence.&lt;ref name="Eleven"/&gt; Women who are able to work in the [[formal sector]] typically earn significantly [[Gender pay gap|less money than men]], even when they are completing the same tasks, making it difficult for them to elevate their status.&lt;ref name="Eleven"/&gt;

Many women are convinced that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home.&lt;ref name="Eleven"/&gt; Most women in Malawi do not view [[divorce]] as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse to protect them from the virus by wearing [[condom usage|condoms]] during marital intercourse.&lt;ref name="Eleven"/&gt; Because they lack the education and training needed to seek [[gainful employment]], women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to [[commercial sex|commercial sex work]] for money.&lt;ref name="Eleven"/&gt;

However, despite their vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi believe that they do, to a certain extent, have control over their own health and well-being.&lt;ref name="Twenty-four"/&gt; They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS epidemic has made [[sexual infidelity]] extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact.&lt;ref name="Twenty-four"/&gt; In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be [[AIDS orphan|orphaned]] if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters.&lt;ref name=Twenty-four&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schatz|first=Enid|title='Take Your Mat and Go!': Rural Malawian Women's Strategies in the HIV/AIDS Era|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|year=2005|volume=7|issue=5|pages=479–92|pmid=16864217|doi=10.1080/13691050500151255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk.&lt;ref name="Twenty-four"/&gt; Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ''ankhoswe'', or traditional marriage counselor, and demand [[divorce]] if their husbands refuse to remain [[sexual fidelity|faithful]] and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.&lt;ref name="Twenty-four"/&gt;

===Children===
[[File:Aids Orphans in Malawi.jpeg|thumb|250px|AIDS orphans in Lilongwe, Malawi]]
The number of orphaned children in Malawi has increased dramatically since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death of at least one parent due to HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Twenty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Claudia|title=The Impact of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic on the Education Sector in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Synthesis of the Findings and Recommendations of Three Country Studies (review)|journal=Transformation: Critical Perspectives on Southern Africa|year=2004|volume=54|issue=1|pages=160–63|doi=10.1353/trn.2004.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in [[unprotected sex|unprotected sexual relations]] put their children at increased risk of becoming [[Orphan|double orphans]], or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many [[Orphan|double orphans]] drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt;

When parents die of HIV/AIDS, [[extended family]] members usually become the children's primary [[caregiver]]s: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by [[grandparents]] or other close relatives.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; Extended family members often provide crucial support to HIV/AIDS orphans;&lt;ref name=Four&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampin|first=Amelia|title=The Long-term Impact of HIV and Orphanhood on the Mortality and Physical Well-being of Children in Rural Malawi|journal=AIDS|year=2003|volume=17|issue=3|pages=389–97|doi=10.1097/00002030-200302140-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some sources indicate that extended family members [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|mistreat]] orphans whose parents have died from HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; For example, family members who are unable to support adopted children often arrange [[child marriage|early marriages]] for female orphans, who may then become victims of [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt;

Evidence suggests that schoolchildren in Malawi are at risk of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; Children are particularly vulnerable to [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]] by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of [[sexual assault]], as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have [[informed consent|consented]].&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt; Although most schools have strict policies against [[sexual abuse]], children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many [[school administrators|administrators]] are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.&lt;ref name="Twenty"/&gt;

==Marriage and relationships==
Although couples are starting to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, [[condom usage|condom use]] during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chimbiri|first=Agnes|title=The condom is an ‘intruder’ in marriage: Evidence from rural Malawi|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=2007|volume=64|issue=5|pages=1102–1115|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as [[sex worker]]s, and that condom use during marital sex implies [[infidelity]].&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt; Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: [[sexual pleasure]] and [[procreation|reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt; In a study published in 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about [[sexually transmitted infections]] when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt;

Many different sources of information can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples.&lt;ref name="Twenty-nine"/&gt; After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, people are more likely to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses.&lt;ref name=Twenty-nine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zulu|first=Eliya Msiyaphazi|author2=Gloria Chepngeno|title=Spousal Communication about the Risk of Contracting HIV/AIDS in Rural Malawi|journal=Demographic Research|year=2003|volume=1|pages=247–78|doi=10.4054/demres.2003.s1.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in [[infidelity|extramarital sexual relations]]. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.&lt;ref name="Twenty-nine"/&gt;

==Economic impact==
[[File:Composting in Malawi.jpg|thumb|190px|Farmers with composting materials in Malawi]]
A 2002 study conducted by [[CARE International]] across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi.&lt;ref name=Thirty-one&gt;{{cite book|title=Impact of HIV/AIDS on agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods in the central region of Malawi|date=January 2002|publisher=CARE International|location=Malawi|pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[skilled labor]]ers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, [[labor-intensive]] crops such as [[tobacco]].&lt;ref name=Eight&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorward|first=Andrew |author2=Idrissa Mwale |author3=Rosalba Tuseo|title=Labor Market and Wage Impacts of HIV/AIDS in Rural Malawi|journal=Review of Agricultural Economics|date=2006|volume=28|issue=3|pages=429–39|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9353.2006.00309.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity.&lt;ref name="Thirty-one"/&gt; In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level.&lt;ref name="Thirty-one"/&gt; Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school to work in the fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.&lt;ref name="Eight"/&gt;

[[CARE International]] proposes several strategies that might reduce the destructive economic impact of HIV/AIDS on [[rural households]].&lt;ref name="Thirty-one"/&gt; They recommend introducing new [[technologies]] that improve productivity to allow households affected by HIV/AIDS to continue supporting themselves through agriculture.&lt;ref name="Thirty-one"/&gt; Women in [[patrilineal]]/[[patrilocal]] villages are often unable to support themselves and their children when their husbands die of HIV/AIDS; therefore, helping women acquire traditionally masculine agricultural skills might decrease their vulnerability while improving agricultural productivity at the household and community levels.&lt;ref name="Thirty-one"/&gt; CARE International recommends increasing cooperation at the community level by establishing labor and [[food bank]]s in areas that have been devastated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&lt;ref name="Thirty-one"/&gt; Finally, CARE International highlights the importance of increasing access to information about HIV/AIDS in Malawi to help families prepare for and cope with the economic burdens associated with the epidemic.&lt;ref name="Thirty-one"/&gt;

==Impact on health services==
The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Malawi has been characterized by drastic declines in the number of health workers available to provide treatment and care and increasing strain on health services: more than half of all hospital admissions in Malawi are related to HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Seventeen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=Julia|author2=Jean Marion Aitken |author3=Sarah LeGrand |author4=Biziwick Mwale |title=Equity in health sector responses to HIV/AIDS in Malawi|journal=Regional Network for Equity in Health in Southern Africa (EQUINET)|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Malawi currently faces a [[Health systems by country|significant deficit in human resources]]: only 159 [[Physician|doctors]] were practicing in Malawi in 2007.&lt;ref name=Two&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bemelmans|first=Marielle|author2=Thomas van den Akker |author3=Nathan Ford |author4=Mit Philips |author5=Rony Zachariah |author6=Anthony Harries |author7=Erik Schouten |author8=Katharina Hermann |author9=Beatrice Mwagomba |author10=Moses Massaquoi |title=Providing Universal Access to Antiretroviral Therapy in Thyolo, Malawi through Task Shifting and Decentralization of HIV/AIDS Care|journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health|date=2010|volume=15|issue=12|pages=1413–420 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02649.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]]'s Essential Health Package recommends placing at least three health workers at every health facility in the country, but the vast majority of Malawi's health facilities fail to meet this standard.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

While migration to more developed countries in search of better opportunities, also known as "[[brain drain]]," is partially responsible for the shortage of health care workers in Malawi, many health care workers have been personally affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic; in fact, an average of 48 nurses die of HIV/AIDS in Malawi every year.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; The HIV/AIDS epidemic has resulted in high levels of [[absenteeism]] among health workers in Malawi, who often leave work to spend time with HIV-positive friends or relatives, and the Malawian government has failed to respond to the declining number of full-time employees working in the health sector.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt; Health workers who are not chronically absent frequently abandon their jobs because they are unable to cope with the heavy patient loads or because they are afraid that working in a medical environment will increase their risk of becoming infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt;

Malawi has adopted task shifting strategies to overcome the shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt; Task shifting, which has been successful in many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of [[antiretroviral therapy]].&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt; For example, at [[Thyolo District|Thyolo District Hospital]], health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under [[Healthcare in Malawi|Ministry of Health]] guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt; Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing and counseling]], which relieves nurses of this additional task.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

==Interventions==
Malawi has taken many steps towards slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS, such as increasing access to condoms and improving [[voluntary counseling and testing|testing services]] and treatment options.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Many of these efforts have been funded by [[International aid|international donors]] including the [[World Bank]], the [[Global Fund]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR), and the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS]] (UNAIDS).&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; The World Bank has lent $407.9 million to Malawi, the Global Fund has agreed to give $390 million, and PEPFAR has donated $25 million for prevention and treatment campaigns.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt;

===Antiretroviral therapy===
The number of people using antiretroviral therapy in Malawi has increased dramatically in the past decade: between 2004 and 2011, an estimated 300,000 people gained access to antiretroviral treatment.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; In addition to improving access to antiretroviral therapy, in 2008, Malawi introduced the [[World Health Organization]]'s treatment guidelines for antiretroviral therapy, which improved the quality of treatment available to Malawians.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; However, Malawi's proposal for a new antiretroviral treatment plan in 2011, which would have cost $105 million per year, was rejected by the [[Global Fund]], threatening Malawi's ability to continue expanding access to antiretroviral treatment.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt;

In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began developing a plan to distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt; The Lighthouse, a trust in [[Lilongwe]] that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs at a cost of 2,500 [[Malawian kwacha|kwacha]] per month.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt; Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in [[Blantyre]] provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the [[Chiradzulu District|Chiradzulu]] and [[Thyolo District|Thyolo]] Districts.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt; Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt; In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt; Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt;

Due to the advent of antiretroviral drugs, HIV/AIDS has become a manageable disease for people who can access and afford treatment; however, antiretroviral therapy remains largely unaffordable and inaccessible to most people in Malawi.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt; For example, the South East region of Malawi has disproportionately low access to antiretroviral drugs.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; In many rural areas, poor health infrastructure combined with widespread [[Malawian food crisis|famine]] have made sustained, high-quality antiretroviral therapy difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; In addition, donations from the [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria]] were used to fund antiretroviral therapy programs that distributed medication on a "first-come, first-served" basis, making the drugs more accessible to the male, urban, educated population.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt; Because there are no explicit policies regarding the [[equitable distribution|fair distribution]] of antiretroviral drugs in Malawi, individual health care workers often become responsible for deciding who will receive treatment, which inevitably leads to inequitable distribution.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt;

===Condom distribution===
Although [[condoms]] effectively prevent the sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars and other social locations where they could have a significant impact on HIV prevention.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt;

Non-governmental organizations such as [[Population Services International]] (Malawi), an organization that strives to improve the health of Malawians, and Banja La Mtsogolo, an organization that distributes information and resources related to [[family planning]], have conducted campaigns advertising [[condom usage|condom use]] as an effective form of protection against HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Banja La Mtsogolo provides condoms to both men and women, and has significantly improved the availability of [[female condom|condoms for women]] in particular.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Because of efforts by Population Services International, Banja La Mtsogolo, and many other organizations, condoms have become more widely available to many people in Malawi.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt;

===Voluntary counseling and testing===
People living in areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several psychological barriers when deciding whether to undergo [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|testing for HIV]].&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; For example, people may prefer not to know if they are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict [[monogamy]] and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011.&lt;ref name="AVERT"/&gt; Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.&lt;ref name="Thirty"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9139">The '''health risks of dead bodies''' are dangers related to the improper preparation and disposal of [[cadavers]].  While normal circumstances allow cadavers to be quickly [[Embalming|embalmed]], [[Cremation|cremated]], or [[Burial|buried]], [[List of disasters|natural and man-made disasters]] can quickly overwhelm and/or interrupt the established protocols for dealing with the dead.  Under such circumstances, the [[decomposition]] and [[putrefaction]] of cadavers goes unchecked, and raises a series of health, logistical, and psychological issues. After [[disaster]]s with extensive loss of life due to [[Physical trauma|trauma]] rather than disease&amp;mdash;earthquakes, storms, human conflict, etc.&amp;mdash;many resources are often expended on burying the dead quickly, and applying [[disinfectant]] to bodies for the specific purpose of preventing [[disease]]. Specialists say that spraying is a waste of disinfectant and manpower, that "resources that should be going into establishment of water supply, sanitation, shelter, warmth and hygienic food for the survivors are being applied to digging mass graves", and that "Time and time again, eminent and authoritative experts have pointed out that dead bodies do not constitute a health hazard".&lt;ref name=reliefweb/&gt;

==False risks==
According to health professionals, the fear of spread of disease by bodies killed by trauma rather than disease is not justified. Among others, Steven Rottman, director of the [[UCLA]] [[UCLA School of Public Health|Center for Public Health and Disasters]], said that no scientific evidence exists that bodies of disaster victims increase the risk of [[epidemics]], adding that [[cadaver]]s posed less risk of [[Infectious disease|contagion]] than living people. In disasters involving trauma where there is competition for resources, they should be going into establishment of water supply, [[sanitation]], shelter, warmth and hygienic food for the survivors, not digging mass graves. Spraying is a waste of disinfectant and manpower. Indiscriminate burial of corpses demoralises survivors and the lack of death certificates can cause practical problems to survivors.&lt;ref name=reliefweb&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/iran-islamic-republic/mass-burials-do-more-harm-good-experts |title=Mass burials do more harm than good-experts - Iran (Islamic Republic of) |website=reliefweb|date=30 Dec 2003|author= |accessdate= 30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other considerations which are very important, but not directly relevant to the topic of health risks, include religious and cultural practices, the stench, and the effect on morale.

===Roots of incorrect notion===
The incorrect notion that ''all'' dead bodies inherently cause [[disease]]s is consistent with:
#The incorrect historical [[miasma theory of disease]], which held that diseases are spread by [[Joseph Bazalgette|foul air]]&amp;mdash;in this case fouled by the stench of decomposing corpses.
#Confusion between normal decay processes and signs of disease; and the incorrect idea that [[microorganisms]] responsible for decomposition are dangerous to living people. "Microorganisms involved in the decay process (putrefaction) are not pathogenic".&lt;ref name=PAHO04/&gt;
#After a major disaster disease among survivors is indeed a problem, but is actually due to living in harsh conditions with poor sanitation. "Survivors present a much more important reservoir for disease [than cadavers]".&lt;ref name=PAHO04/&gt;
#Noting that corpses of those who died from certain '''[[contagious disease]]s''' (for example, in epidemics) do, indeed, spread disease, such as the case with [[smallpox]] and the [[1918 flu]], and incorrectly generalising this to all corpses.

According to the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO) "concern that dead bodies are infectious can be considered a 'natural' reaction by persons wanting to protect themselves from disease"  although "the risk that bodies [of those killed in a natural disaster] pose for the public is extremely small".&lt;ref name=PAHO04/&gt;

==Real risks==
Contamination of water supplies by unburied bodies, burial sites, or temporary storage sites may result in the spread of [[gastroenteritis]] from normal intestinal contents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/hygiene/emergencies/deadbodies.pdf Disposal of dead bodies in emergency conditions. WHO Technical Note 8]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a PAHO article on the Infectious Disease Risks From Dead Bodies Following Natural Disasters:&lt;ref name=PAHO04&gt;[http://publications.paho.org/english/dead_bodies.pdf Infectious Disease Risks From Dead Bodies Following Natural Disasters]&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|There is little evidence of microbiological contamination of [[groundwater]] from burial. Where dead bodies have contaminated water supplies, gastroenteritis has been the most notable problem, although communities will rarely use a water supply where they know it to be contaminated by dead bodies. Microorganisms involved in the decay process (putrefaction) are not pathogenic.}}

To those in close contact with the dead, such as rescue workers, there is a health risk from chronic infectious diseases which those killed may have been suffering from and which spread by direct contact, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV, enteric intestinal pathogens, tuberculosis, cholera and others.&lt;ref name=PAHO04/&gt;

The substances [[cadaverine]] and [[putrescine]] are produced during the [[decomposition]] of animal (including human) bodies, and both give off a foul odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Lewis | first =Robert Alan | title =Lewis' Dictionary of Toxicology | publisher =CRC Press | year =1998 | isbn =1-56670-223-2|page=212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--***Have commented out this reference as it seems irrelevant; there are 2 relevant refs not related to alternative medicine, ornithine, or weight loss. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kamhi | first =Ellen, [[Ph.D.]], [[Registered Nurse|RN]], HNC | title =Alternative Medicine Magazine's Definitive Guide to Weight Loss | publisher =Celestial Arts | date =2007 | isbn = 1-58761-259-3|quote=Ornithine is converted by bowel bacteria into a toxic substance called putrescine, which in turn degrades into polyamines, such as spermadine, spermine, and cadaverine (literally meaning "the essence of dead cadavers"). | page =14}}&lt;/ref&gt;***--&gt; They are toxic if massive doses are ingested ([[acute oral toxicity]] of 2&amp;nbsp;g per kg of body weight of pure putrescine in rats, a larger dose for cadaverine); there are no effects at all for a tenth of that dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Til|first1=H.P.|last2=Falke|first2=H.E.|last3=Prinsen|first3=M.K.|last4=Willems|first4=M.I.|title=Acute and subacute toxicity of tyramine, spermidine, spermine, putrescine and cadaverine in rats|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume=35|issue=3–4|year=1997|pages=337–348|issn=0278-6915|doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(97)00121-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While figures for humans are not available, [[Allometry#Drug dose scaling|allometric scaling,]] which takes into account body surface area, is often used to compare doses in different animals, with useful results.&lt;ref name=allometric&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clymer.altervista.org/minor/allometry.html |title=Allometric Scaling Calculator |newspaper=Clymer.altervista.org |date= 13 May 2012 |author= |accessdate= 15 December 2015}} Online allometric scaling calculator, with explanation and source.&lt;/ref&gt; Scaling 2g/kg from rats suggests that a 60&amp;nbsp;kg (132&amp;nbsp;lb) person would be significantly affected by {{Convert|27|g}}&lt;ref&gt;Using allometric calculator cited, with rat weight=0.15kg, usual exponent of 0.75&lt;/ref&gt;  of pure putrescine. For comparison the similar substance [[spermine]], found in [[semen]], is over 3 times as toxic.

Cases where the primary motive for the murders was to facilitate or cover up another [[felony]], like robbery, are also excluded.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

'''List of types of malnutrition''' or '''list of nutritional disorders''' include diseases that results from excessive or inadequate intake of food and nutrients. They come in two broad categories: undernutrition and [[overnutrition]].

==Overnutrition==
{{Main|Overnutrition}}

=== Metabolic ===

[[Obesity#Lifestyle|Obesity]] is caused by eating too many [[calories]] compared to the amount of [[exercise]] the individual is performing, causing a distorted [[energy balance (biology)|energy balance]].  It can lead to diseases such as [[cardiovascular disease#Risk factors|cardiovascular disease]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]]. Obesity is a condition in which the natural energy reserve, stored in the fatty tissue of humans and other mammals, is increased to a point where it is associated with certain health conditions or increased mortality.

The low-cost food that is generally affordable to the poor in affluent nations is low in nutritional value and high in fats, sugars and additives.  In rich countries, therefore, obesity is often a sign of poverty and malnutrition while in poorer countries obesity is more associated with wealth and good nutrition.  Other non-nutritional causes for obesity included: [[sleep]] deprivation, [[stress (biological)|stress]], lack of [[exercise]], and [[heredity]].

Acute [[overeating]] can also be a symptom of an [[eating disorder]].

[[Goitrogen]]ic foods can cause [[goitre]]s by interfering with [[iodine]] uptake.

=== Vitamins and micronutrients ===

[[Vitamin poisoning]] is the condition of overly high storage levels of vitamins, which can lead to toxic symptoms. The medical names of the different conditions are derived from the vitamin involved: an excess of vitamin A, for example, is called "[[hypervitaminosis A]]".

[[Iron overload disorder]]s are diseases caused by the overaccumulation of iron in the body. Organs commonly affected are the liver, heart and endocrine glands in the mouth.

==Deficiencies==

===Proteins/fats/carbohydrates===
* [[Protein-energy malnutrition]]
** [[Kwashiorkor]]
** [[Marasmus]]

===Dietary vitamins and minerals===
* [[Calcium#Applications|Calcium]]
** [[Osteoporosis]]
** [[Rickets]]
** [[Tetany (medical sign)|Tetany]]
* [[Iodine deficiency]]
** [[Goiter]]
* [[Selenium deficiency]]
** [[Keshan disease]]
* [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|Iron deficiency]]
** [[Iron deficiency anemia]]
* [[Zinc]] 
** Growth retardation
* [[Thiamine]] (Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)
** [[Beriberi]]
* [[Niacin]] (Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
** [[Pellagra]]
* [[Vitamin C]]
** [[Scurvy]]
* [[Vitamin D]]
** [[Osteoporosis]]
** [[Rickets]]

[[File:Monoclonal antibodies4.jpg|thumb|[[Cell culture]] vials.]]
[[File:UF Cancer Genetics Complex.JPG|thumb|The [[University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex]] is an integrated medical research facility]]

'''Biomedical research''' (or '''experimental medicine''') encompasses a wide array of research, extending from "[[basic research]]" (also called ''bench science'' or ''bench research''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aamc.org/initiatives/research/334422/basicscience.html |title= Basic Science|author= |date=2016 |website=aamc.org |publisher= [[Association of American Medical Colleges]]|access-date= 12 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; involving fundamental scientific principles that may apply to a [[preclinical research|''preclinical'']] understanding &amp;ndash; to [[clinical research]], which involves studies of people who may be subjects in [[clinical trial]]s. Within this spectrum is [[applied research]], or [[translational research]], conducted to expand knowledge in the field of [[medicine]].

Both clinical and preclinical research phases exist in the pharmaceutical industry's [[Drug pipeline|drug development pipelines]], where the clinical phase is denoted by the term ''clinical trial''. However, only part of the clinical or preclinical research is oriented towards a specific [[medication|pharmaceutical]] purpose. The need for fundamental and mechanism-based understanding, [[medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], [[medical devices]], and non-pharmaceutical therapies means that pharmaceutical research is only a small part of medical research.

The increased longevity of humans over the past century can be significantly attributed to advances resulting from medical research. Among the major benefits of medical research have been [[vaccine]]s for [[measles]] and [[polio]], [[insulin]] treatment for [[diabetes]], classes of [[antibiotic]]s for treating a host of maladies, medication for high [[blood pressure]], improved treatments for [[AIDS]], [[statin]]s and other treatments for [[atherosclerosis]], new surgical techniques such as [[microsurgery]], and increasingly successful treatments for [[cancer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} New, beneficial tests and treatments are expected as a result of the [[Human Genome Project]]. Many challenges remain, however, including the appearance of [[antibiotic resistance]] and the [[obesity epidemic]].

Most of the research in the field is pursued by [[biomedical scientist]]s, but significant contributions are made by other type of [[biologist]]s. Medical research [[human experimentation|on humans]], has to strictly follow the [[medical ethics]] sanctioned in the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] and [[Institutional review board|hospital review board]] where the research is conducted. In all cases, [[research ethics]] are expected.

== Phases of medical research ==

===Basic medical research===
[[File:Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] on [[Long Island]], home to eight scientists awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], is an internationally renowned [[basic research|basic medical research]] institution.]]

Example areas in basic medical research include cellular and [[molecular biology]], medical genetics, immunology, [[neuroscience]], and psychology. Researchers, mainly in universities or government-funded research institutes, aim to establish an understanding of the cellular, molecular and physiological mechanisms of human health and disease.

===Preclinical research===
Preclinical research covers understanding of mechanisms that may lead to clinical research with people. Typically, the work requires no ethical approval, is supervised by scientists rather than [[physician]]s, and is carried out in a university or company, rather than a hospital.

===Clinical research===
[[Clinical research]] is carried out with people as the [[Human subject research|experimental subjects]]. It is generally supervised by physicians and conducted by nurses in a medical setting, such as a hospital or research clinic, and requires ethical approval.

[[Research funding]] in many countries derives from research bodies and private organizations which distribute money for equipment, salaries, and research expenses. In the [[United Kingdom]], funding bodies such as the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] derive their assets from UK tax payers, and distribute revenues to institutions by competitive [[Grant (money)|research grants]]. The [[Wellcome Trust]] is the UK's largest non-governmental source of funds for biomedical research and provides over £600 million per year in grants to scientists and funds for research centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jan/09/henry-wellcome-collection-medicine-man|title=Henry Wellcome: from backwoods boy to medicine man|accessdate=12 June 2011|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, data from ongoing surveys by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) show that federal agencies provided only 44% of the $86 billion spent on basic research in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/data-check-us-government-share-basic-research-funding-falls-below-50|title=Data check: U.S. government share of basic research funding falls below 50%|date=2017-03-09|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health]] and [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] collectively contribute $26.4 billion and $27 billion, which constitute 28% and 29% of the total, respectively. Other significant contributors include [[biotechnology]] companies ($17.9 billion, 19% of total), [[medical devices|medical device]] companies ($9.2 billion, 10% of total), other federal sources, and state and local governments. Foundations and charities, led by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], contributed about 3% of the funding. These funders are attempting to maximize their [[return on investment]] in [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2015/04/How-Do-We-Measure-The-Impact-of-Grand-Challenges#.WqNcrt_I7CI|title=How Do We Measure The Impact of Grand Challenges|last=Buchsbaum|first=Steven|website=Impatient Optimists|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One method proposed to maximize the return on investment in medicine is to fund the development of [[Open-source hardware|open source hardware]] for medical research and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearce|first=J.M.|date=|title=Maximizing returns for public funding of medical research with open-source hardware|url=https://www.academia.edu/35382852/Maximizing_Returns_for_Public_Funding_of_Medical_Research_with_Open_source_Hardware|journal=Health Policy and Technology|volume=6|issue=4|pages=381–382|doi=10.1016/j.hlpt.2017.09.001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The enactment of [[orphan drug]] legislation in some countries has increased funding available to develop drugs meant to treat rare conditions, resulting in breakthroughs that previously were uneconomical to pursue.

===Government-funded biomedical research===
Since the establishment of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the mid-1940s, the main source of U.S. federal support of biomedical research, investment priorities and levels of funding have fluctuated. From 1995 to 2010, NIH support of biomedical research increased from 11 billion to 27 billion &lt;ref name="National Institutes of Health"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov|title=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the jump in federal spending, advancements measured by citations to publications and the number of drugs passed by the FDA remained stagnant over the same time span.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frist|first1=William H.|title=Federal Funding for Biomedical Research|journal=JAMA|date=3 April 2002|volume=287|issue=13|pages=1722|doi=10.1001/jama.287.13.1722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial projections indicate federal spending will remain constant in the near future.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===US federal funding trends===
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the agency that is responsible for management of the lion's share of federal funding of biomedical research.&lt;ref name="National Institutes of Health"/&gt; It funds over 280 areas directly related to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx|title=NIH Categorical Spending -NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT)|website=report.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past century there were two notable periods of NIH support.
From 1995 to 1996 funding increased from $8.877 billion to $9.366 billion,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steinbrook|first1=Robert|title=The NIH Stimulus — The Recovery Act and Biomedical Research|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=9 April 2009|volume=360|issue=15|pages=1479–1481|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0901819}}&lt;/ref&gt; years which represented the start of what is considered the "doubling period" of rapid NIH support.&lt;ref name="National Institutes of Health"/&gt; The second notable period started in 1997 and ended in 2010, a period where the NIH moved to organize research spending for engagement with the scientific community.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Privately (industry) funded biomedical research===
Since 1980 the share of biomedical research funding from industry sources has grown from 32% to 62%,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekelman|first1=Justin E.|last2=Li|first2=Yan|last3=Gross|first3=Cary P.|title=Scope and Impact of Financial Conflicts of Interest in Biomedical Research|journal=JAMA|date=22 January 2003|volume=289|issue=4|pages=454–65|doi=10.1001/jama.289.4.454|pmid=12533125}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has resulted in the development of numerous life-saving medical advances. The relationship between industry and government-funded research in the US has seen great movement over the years. The 1980 Bayh Dole Act was passed by Congress to foster a more constructive relationship between the collaboration of government and industry funded biomedical research. The Bayh Doyle Act gave private corporations the option of applying for government funded grants for biomedical research which in turn allowed the private corporations to license the technology.&lt;ref name="kellogg.northwestern.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alicia Loffler|author2=Scott Stern|title=The Future of the Biomedical Industry in an Era of Globalization|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/biotech/faculty/articles/future_biomedical_industry.pdf|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both government and industry research funding increased rapidly from between the years of 1994–2003; industry saw a compound average annual growth rate of 8.1% a year and slowed only slightly to a compound average annual growth rate of 5.8% from 2003 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dorsey|first1=E. Ray|title=Funding of US Biomedical Research, 2003–2008|journal=JAMA|date=13 January 2010|volume=303|issue=2|pages=137–143|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts of interests===

"Conflict of interest" in the field of medical research has been defined as "a set of conditions in which professional judgment concerning a primary interest (such as a person's welfare or the validity of research) tends to be unduly influenced by a secondary interest (such as financial gain)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Dennis|title=Understanding Financial Conflicts of Interest|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=August 19, 1993|volume=329|pages=573–576|doi=10.1056/nejm199308193290812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulation on industry funded biomedical research has seen great changes since Samuel Hopkins Adams declaration.  In 1906 congress passed the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Significant Dates in U.S. Food and Drug Law History|url=http://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/whatwedo/history/milestones/ucm128305.htm|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912 Congress passed the Shirley Amendment to prohibit the wide dissemination of false information on pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;  The Food and Drug Administration was formally created in 1930 under the McNarey Mapes Amendment to oversee the regulation of Food and Drugs in the United States.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;  In 1962 the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act made it so that before a drug was marketed in the United States the FDA must first approve that the drug was safe.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;  The Kefauver-Harris amendments also mandated that more stringent clinical trials must be performed before a drug is brought to the market.&lt;ref name="mttlr.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=Ariel|title=Pharmaceutical Lemons: Innovation and Regulation in the Drug Industry|url=http://www.mttlr.org/volfourteen/katz.pdf|accessdate=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228233554/http://www.mttlr.org/volfourteen/katz.pdf|archivedate=2014-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kefauver-Harris amendments were met with opposition from industry due to the requirement of lengthier clinical trial periods that would lessen the period of time in which the investor is able to see return on their money.  In the pharmaceutical industry patents are typically granted for a 20-year period of time, and most patent applications are submitted during the early stages of the product development.&lt;ref name="mttlr.org"/&gt;  According to Ariel Katz on average after a patent application is submitted it takes an additional 8 years before the FDA approves a drug for marketing.&lt;ref name="mttlr.org"/&gt;  As such this would leave a company with only 12 years to market the drug to see a return on their investments. After a sharp decline of new drugs entering the US market following the 1962 Kefauver-Harris amendments economist Sam Petlzman concluded that cost of loss of innovation was greater than the savings recognized by consumers no longer purchasing ineffective drugs.&lt;ref name="mttlr.org"/&gt;  In 1984 the Hatch-Waxman Act or the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 was passed by congress.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;  The Hatch-Waxman Act was passed with the idea that giving brand manufacturers the ability to extend their patent by an additional 5 years would create greater incentives for innovation and private sector funding for investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Martha Rumore|title=The Hatch-Waxman Act--25 Years Later: Keeping the Pharmaceutical Scales Balanced|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplement/2009/GenericSupplement0809/Generic-HatchWaxman-0809|website=www.pharmacytimes.com|accessdate=2014|date=August 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship that exists with industry funded biomedical research is that of which industry is the financier for academic institutions which in turn employ scientific investigators to conduct research.  A fear that exists wherein a project is funded by industry is that firms might negate informing the public of negative effects to better promote their product.&lt;ref name="mttlr.org"/&gt;
A list of studies show that public fear of the conflicts of interest that exist when biomedical research is funded by industry can be considered valid after a 2003 publication of "Scope and Impact of Financial Conflicts of Interest in Biomedical Research" in The Journal of American Association of Medicine.   This publication included 37 different studies that met specific criteria to determine whether or not an academic institution or scientific investigator funded by industry had engaged in behavior that could be deduced to be a conflict of interest in the field of biomedical research. Survey results from one study concluded that 43% of scientific investigators employed by a participating academic institution had received research related gifts and discretionary funds from industry sponsors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Another participating institution surveyed showed that 7.6% of investigators were financially tied to research sponsors, including paid speaking engagements (34%), consulting arrangements (33%), advisory board positions (32%) and equity (14%).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  A 1994 study concluded that 58% out of 210 life science companies indicated that investigators were required to withhold information pertaining to their research as to extend the life of the interested companies' patents.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Rules and regulations regarding conflict of interest disclosures are being studied by experts in the biomedical research field to eliminate conflicts of interest that could possibly affect the outcomes of biomedical research.

===History===
The earliest narrative describing a medical trial is found in the [[Book of Daniel]], which says that Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar]] ordered youths of royal blood to eat only red meat and wine for three years, while another group of youths ate only beans and water.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=R.|title=Legumes, lemons and streptomycin: A short history of the clinical trial|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=6 January 2009|volume=180|issue=1|pages=23–24|pmid=19124783|pmc=2612069|doi=10.1503/cmaj.081879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment was intended to determine if a diet of vegetables and water was healthier than a diet of wine and red meat. At the experiment endpoint, the trial accomplished its prerogative: the youths who ate only beans and water were noticeably healthier.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Scientific curiosity to understand health outcomes from varying treatments has been present for centuries, but it was not until the mid-19th century when an organizational platform was created to support and regulate this curiosity. In 1945, Vannevar Bush said that biomedical scientific research was "the pacemaker of technological progress", an idea which contributed to the initiative to found the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1948, a historical benchmark that marked the beginning of a near century substantial investment in biomedical research.&lt;ref name="scienceguide.nl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Research: the pacemaker of progress|url=http://www.scienceguide.nl/201212/basic-research-the-pacemaker-of-progress.aspx|website=scienceguide.nl/|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIH provides more financial support for medical research that any other agency in the world to date and claims responsibility for numerous innovations that have improved global health.&lt;ref name="scienceguide.nl"/&gt; The historical funding of biomedical research has undergone many changes over the past century. Innovations such as the polio vaccine, antibiotics and antipsychotic agents, developed in the early years of the NIH lead to social and political support of the agency. Political initiatives in the early 1990s lead to a doubling of NIH funding, spurring an era of great scientific progress.&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Judith Johson|title=Brief History of NIH Funding: Fact Sheet|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43341.pdf|accessdate=2014|date=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been dramatic changes in the era since the turn of the 21st century to date; roughly around the start of the century, the cost of trials dramatically increased while the rate scientific discoveries did not keep pace.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

Biomedical research spending increased substantially faster than GDP growth over the past decade in the US, between the years of 2003 and 2007 spending increased 14% per year, while GDP growth increased 1% over the same period (both measures adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dorsey|first1=E. Ray|title=Funding of US Biomedical Research, 2003–2008|journal=JAMA|date=13 January 2010|volume=303|issue=2|pages=137|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry, not-for-profit entities, state and federal funding spending combined accounted for an increase in funding from $75.5 billion in 2003 to $101.1 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; Due to the immediacy of federal financing priorities and stagnant corporate spending during the recession, biomedical research spending decreased 2% in real terms in 2008.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; Despite an overall increase of investment in biomedical research, there has been stagnation, and in some areas a marked decline in the number of drug and device approvals over the same time period.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt;

Today, industry sponsored research accounts for 58% of expenditures, NIH for 27% of expenditures, state governments for 5% of expenditures, non NIH-federal sources for 5% of expenditures and not-for-profit entities accounted for 4% of support.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; Federally funded biomedical research expenditures increased nominally, 0.7% (adjusted for inflation), from 2003 to 2007.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; Previous reports showed a stark contrast in federal investment, from 1994 to 2003, federal funding increased 100% (adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt;

The NIH manages the lions-share, over 85%, of federal biomedical research expenditures.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt;  NIH support for biomedical research decreased from $31.8 billion in 2003, to $29.0 billion in 2007, a 25% decline (in real terms adjusted for inflation), while non-NIH federal funding allowed for the maintenance of government financial support levels through the era (the 0.7% four-year increase). Spending from industry-initiated research increased 25% (adjusted for inflation) over the same time period of time, from 2003 to 2007, an increase from $40 billion in 2003, to $58.6 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; Industry sourced expenditures from 1994 to 2003 showed industry sponsored research funding increased 8.1%, a stark contrast to 25% increase in recent years.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt;

Of industry sponsored research, pharmaceutical firm spending was the greatest contributor from all industry sponsored biomedical research spending, but only increased 15% (adjusted for inflation) from 2003 to 2007, while device and biotechnology firms accounted for the majority of the spending.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; The stock performance, a measure that can be an indication of future firm growth or technological direction, has substantially increased for both predominantly medical device and biotechnology producers.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; Contributing factors to this growth are thought to be less rigorous FDA approval requirements for devices as opposed to drugs, lower cost of trials, lower pricing and profitability of products and predictable influence of new technology due to a limited number of competitors.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; Another visible shift during the era was a shift in focus to late stage research trials; formerly dispersed, since 1994 an increasingly large portion of industry-sponsored research was late phase trials rather than early-experimental phases now accounting for the majority of industry sponsored research.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; This shift is attributable to a lower risk investment and a shorter development to market schedule.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; The low risk preference is also reflected in the trend of large pharmaceutical firms acquiring smaller companies that hold patents to newly developed drug or device discoveries which have not yet passed federal regulation (large companies are mitigating their risk by purchasing technology created by smaller companies in early-phase high-risk studies).&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt;  
Medical research support from Universities increased from  $22 billion in 2003 to $27.7 billion in 2007, a 7.8% increase (adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; In 2007 the most heavily funded institutions received 20% of HIN medical research funding, and the top 50 institutions received 58% of NIH medical research funding, the percent of funding allocated to the largest institutions is a trend which has increased only slightly over data from 1994.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt; Relative to federal and private funding, health policy and service research accounted for a nominal amount of sponsored research; health policy and service research was funded $1.8 billion in 2003, which increased to $2.2 billion in 2008.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt;

Stagnant rates of investment from the US government over the past decade, may be in part attributable to challenges that plague the field. To date only two-thirds of published drug trial findings have results that can be re-produced,&lt;ref name="drugabuse.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Improving Reproducibility and Transparency in Biomedical Research|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2013/09/improving-reproducibility-transparency-in-biomedical-research|website=drugabuse.gov|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which raises concerns from a US regulatory standpoint where great investment has been made in research ethics and standards, yet trial results remain inconsistent. Federal agencies have called upon greater regulation to address these problems; a spokesman from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, an agency of the NIH, stated that there is "widespread poor reporting of experimental design in articles and grant applications, that animal research should follow a core set of research parameters, and that a concerted effort by all stakeholders is needed to disseminate best reporting practices and put them into practice".&lt;ref name="drugabuse.gov"/&gt;

===Transparency laws===
Two laws which are both still in effect, one passed in 2006 and the other in 2010, were instrumental in defining funding reporting standards for biomedical research, and defining for the first time reporting regulations that were previously not required. The 2006 Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act mandates that all entities receiving over $25,000 in federal funds must report annual spending reports, including disclosure of executive salaries.&lt;ref name="hrsa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements for Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Implementation|url=http://www.hrsa.gov/grants/ffata.html|website=hrsa.gov|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 amendment to the act mandates that progress reports be submitted along with financial reporting.&lt;ref name="hrsa.gov"/&gt; Data from the federal mandate is managed and made publicly available on usaspending.gov.&lt;ref name="hrsa.gov"/&gt; Aside from the main source, usaspending.gov, other reporting mechanisms exist: Data specifically on biomedical research funding from federal sources is made publicly available by the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), data on health services research, approximately 0.1% of federal funding on biomedical research, is available through the Coalition of Health Services Research, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and the Veterans Health Administration.&lt;ref name="US Biomedical Research 2009"/&gt;

Currently there are not any funding reporting requirements for industry sponsored research, but there has been voluntary movement toward this goal.&lt;ref name="policymed.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry and Non-Profits Join Forces to Accelerate Discovery of Therapies for Alzheimer's, Diabetes, RA, and Lupus|url=http://www.policymed.com/2014/02/nih-industry-and-non-profits-join-forces-to-accelerate-discovery-of-therapies-for-alzheimers-diabetes-ra-and-lupus.html|website=policymed.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, major pharmaceutical stakeholders such as Roche and Johnson and Johnson have made financial information publicly available and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the most prominent professional association for biomedical research companies, has recently begun to provide limited public funding reports.&lt;ref name="policymed.com"/&gt;

==Regulations and guidelines==
Medical research is very highly regulated. National regulatory authorities are appointed in almost every country worldwide to oversee and monitor medical research, such as for the development and distribution of new drugs. In the US the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] oversees new drug development, in Europe the [[European Medicines Agency]] (see also [[EudraLex]]), and in [[Japan]] the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)]]. The [[World Medical Association]] develops the ethical standards for the medical profession, involved in medical research. The most fundamental of them is the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. The [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH) works on the creation of rules and guidelines for the development of new medication, such as the guidelines for [[Good clinical practice|Good Clinical Practice]] (GCP). All ideas of regulation are based on a country's ethical standards code. This is why treatment of a particular disease in one country may not be allowed, but is in another.

==Flaws and vulnerabilities==
A major flaw and vulnerability in biomedical research appears to be the hypercompetition for the resources and positions that are required to conduct science. The competition seems to suppress the creativity, cooperation, risk-taking, and original thinking required to make fundamental discoveries. Other consequences of today's highly pressured environment for research appear to be a substantial number of research publications whose results cannot be replicated, and perverse incentives in research funding that encourage grantee institutions to grow without making sufficient investments in their own faculty and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Albertsa, Marc W.

'''Microinsurance''' is the protection of low-income people (those living on between approximately $1 and $4 per day( below $4)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Allen &amp; Overy LLP |url=http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/files/Short%20guide%20to%20Microinsurance.pdf |title=Microinsurance |publisher=Advocates for International Development |date=2012 |accessdate=20 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220100954/http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/files/Short%20guide%20to%20Microinsurance.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payment proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risks involved. This definition is exactly the same as one might use for regular insurance except for the clearly prescribed target market: low-income people. The target population typically consists of persons ignored by mainstream commercial and social insurance schemes, as well as persons who have not previously had access to appropriate insurance products.

The institutions or set of institutions implementing microinsurance are commonly referred to as a microinsurance scheme.

== Definitions of microinsurance ==

#Micro insurance is insurance with low premiums and low caps / coverage. In this definition, "micro" refers to the small financial transaction that each insurance policy generates.  "General micro insurance product means health insurance contract, any contract covering the belongings, such as, hut, livestock or tools or instruments or any personal accident contract, either on individual or group basis, as per terms stated in Schedule-I appended to these regulations"; and "life microinsurance product" means any term insurance contract with or without return of premium, any endowment insurance contract or health insurance contract, with or without an accident benefit rider, either on individual or group basis, as per terms stated in Schedule-II appended to these regulations as those within defined (low) minimum and maximum caps. The IRDA’s characterization of micro insurance by the product features is further complemented by their definition for microinsurance agents, those appointed by and acting for an insurer, for distribution of microinsurance products (and only those products).
#Microinsurance is a financial arrangement to protect low-income people against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payments proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risk involved.&lt;ref name="Churchill"&gt;{{cite book|author=Churchill C. (ed.)|title=Protecting the Poor: A Microinsurance Compendium|location=Geneva|publisher=ILO|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author of this definition adds that micro-insurance does not refer to: (i) the size of the risk-carrier (some are small and even informal, others very large companies); (ii) the scope of the risk (the risks themselves are by no means "micro" to the households that experience them); (iii) the delivery channel: it can be delivered through a variety of different channels, including small community-based schemes, [[credit unions]] or other types of [[microfinance]] institutions, but also by enormous multinational insurance companies, etc.
#Microinsurance is synonymous to community-based financing arrangements,&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alexander S. Preker |author2=Guy Carrin |author3=David Dror |author4=Melitta Jakab |author5=William Hsiao |author6=Dyna Arhin-Tenkorang |title=Effectiveness of community health financing in meeting the cost of illness|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|location=Geneva|publisher=WHO|year=2002|volume=80|issue=2|pages=143–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; including community health funds, mutual health organizations, [[rural health]] insurance, revolving drugs funds, and community involvement in user-fee management.  Most community financing schemes have evolved in the context of severe economic constraints, political instability, and lack of good governance. The common feature within all, is the active involvement of the community in [[revenue]] collection, [[Pooling (resource management)|pooling]], [[resource allocation]] and, frequently, service provision.
#Microinsurance is the use of insurance as an economic instrument at the "micro" (i.e. smaller than national) level of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dror, D, Jacquier Ch|title=Micro-insurance: Extending Health Insurance to the Excluded|journal=International Social Security Review|location=Geneva|publisher=ISSA|year=1999|volume=52|issue=1|pages=71–97|doi=10.1111/1468-246X.00034}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition integrates the above approaches into one comprehensive conceptual framework.  It was first published in 1999, pre-dating the other three approaches, and has been noted to be the first recorded use of the term "microinsurance".&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;  Under this definition, decisions in microinsurance are made within each unit, (rather than far away, at the level of [[government]]s, [[insurance company|companies]], [[NGO]]s that offer support in operations, etc.).

Insurance functions on the concept of risk pooling, and likewise, regardless of its small unit size and its activities at the level of single communities, so does microinsurance.  Microinsurance links multiple small units into larger structures, creating networks that enhance both insurance functions (through broader risk pools) and support structures for improved governance (i.e. training, data banks, research facilities, access to [[reinsurance]] etc.).  This mechanism is conceived as an autonomous enterprise, independent of permanent external financial lifelines, and its main objective is to pool both risks and resources of whole groups for the purpose of providing financial protection to all members against the financial consequences of mutually determined risks.

The last definition therefore, includes the critical features of the previous three:
# transactions are low-cost (and reflect members’ willingness to pay); 
# clients are essentially low-net-worth (but not necessarily uniformly poor);
# the essential role of the network of microinsurance units is to enhance risk management of the members of the entire pool of microinsurance units over and above what each can do when operating as a stand-alone entity.

== Microinsurance products ==

Microinsurance, like regular insurance, may be offered for a wide variety of risks.  These include both health risks (illness, injury, or death) and property risks (damage or loss).  A wide variety of microinsurance products exist to address these risks, including [[crop insurance]], livestock/cattle insurance, insurance for theft or fire, [[health insurance]], [[term life insurance]], death insurance, [[disability insurance]], insurance for natural disasters, etc.

Microinsurance has made a significant difference in countries like Mali, as Maxime Prud'Homme and Bakary Traoré describe in [https://web.archive.org/web/20100706044627/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/167030/index.en.shtml Innovations in Sikasso]. Still, many countries face continuing challenges. Specifically in Bangladesh, micro health insurance schemes are having trouble with financial and institutional sustainability, Syed Abdul Hamid and Jinnat Ara describe, but things are improving. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100706044108/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166688/index.en.shtml Progress in Bangladesh]

== Microinsurance delivery models ==

One of the greatest challenge for microinsurance is the actual delivery to clients.  Methods and models for doing so vary depending on the organization, institution, and provider involved. As Dubby Mahalanobis states, one must be thorough and careful when making policies, otherwise microinsurance could do more harm than good. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100508042253/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166486/index.en.shtml Tricky challenges] In general, there are four main methods for offering microinsurance&lt;ref name="Churchill"/&gt; the partner-agent model, the provider-driven model, the full-service model, and the community-based model.  Each of these models has their own advantages and disadvantages.

*'''Partner agent model''': A partnership is formed between the micro insurance(partner as MFI) scheme and an agent (insurance companies), and in some cases a third-party healthcare provider.  The microinsurance scheme is responsible for the delivery and marketing of products to the clients, while the agent retains all responsibility for design and development.  In this model, microinsurance schemes benefit from limited risk, but are also disadvantaged in their limited control. [[Micro Insurance Centre]] is an example of an organization using this model.
*'''Full service model''':  The microinsurance scheme is in charge of everything; both the design and delivery of products to the clients, working with external healthcare providers to provide the services.  This model has the advantage of offering microinsurance schemes full control, yet the disadvantage of higher risks.
*'''Provider-driven model''':  The healthcare provider is the microinsurance scheme, and similar to the full-service model, is responsible for all operations, delivery, design, and service.  There is an advantage once more in the amount of control retained, yet disadvantage in the limitations on products and services.
*'''Community-based/mutual model''':  The policyholders or clients are in charge, managing and owning the operations, and working with external healthcare providers to offer services.  This model is advantageous for its ability to design and market products more easily and effectively, yet is disadvantaged by its small size and scope of operations.

==Microinsurance scheme==
A microinsurance scheme is a scheme that uses, among others, an insurance mechanism whose beneficiaries are (at least in part) people excluded from formal social protection schemes, particularly, informal economy workers and their families. The scheme differs from others created to provide legal social protection to formal economy workers. Membership is not compulsory (but can be automatic), and members pay, at least in part, the necessary contributions in order to cover benefits.

The expression "microinsurance scheme" designates either the institution that provides insurance (e.g., a health mutual benefit association) or the set of institutions (in the case of linkages) that provide insurance or the insurance service itself provided by an institution that also handles other activities (e.g., a micro-finance institution).

The use of the mechanism of insurance implies:
*  Prepayment and resource-pooling: the regular prepayment of contributions (before the insured risks occur) that are pooled together.
*  Risk-sharing: the pooled contributions are used to pay a financial compensation to those who are affected by predetermined risks, and those who are not exposed to these risks do not get their contributions back.
*  Guarantee of coverage: a financial compensation for a number of risks, in line with a pre-defined benefits package.

Microinsurance schemes may cover various risks (health, life, etc.); the most frequent microinsurance products are: 
*  Life microinsurance (and retirement savings plans) 
*  Health microinsurance (hospitalisation, primary health care, maternity, etc.) 
*  Disability microinsurance 
*  Property microinsurance – assets, livestock, housing 
*  Crop microinsurance

Dirk Reinhard provides a good list summarising reading pertinent to microinsurance. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100508042303/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/167106/index.en.shtml Small means, massive impact]

== Microinsurance and development ==
Microinsurance is recognized as a useful tool in economic development. As many low-income people do not have access to adequate risk-management tools, they are vulnerable to fall back into poverty in times of hardship, for example when the breadwinner of the family dies, or when high hospital bills force families to take out loans with high interest rates. Furthermore, microinsurance makes it possible for people to take more risks. When farmers are insured against a bad harvest (resulting from drought), they are in a better position to grow crops which give high yields in good years, and bad yields in year of drought. Without the insurance, however, they will be inclined to do the opposite; since they have to safeguard a minimal level of income for themselves and their families,  crops will be grown which are more drought resistant, but which have a much lower yield in good weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Dercon Stefan|title=Risk, Insurance and Poverty: A Review|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nipple''' is a raised region of tissue on the surface of the [[breast]] from which, in females, [[breast milk|milk]] leaves the breast through the [[lactiferous duct]]s to feed an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nipple|title=nipple|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2017|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Hansen|2010|p=80}} The milk can flow through the nipple passively or it can be ejected by [[smooth muscles|smooth]] [[muscular contraction|muscle contractions]] that occur along the ductal system. The nipple is surrounded by the [[areola]] which is often a darker color than the surrounding skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/762857/1/nipple&amp;ti=0|title=nipple - Taber's Online|website=www.tabers.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often called a '''teat''' when referring to non-humans. Teat can also be used to describe the flexible mouthpiece of a [[baby bottle]]. In humans, nipples of both males and females can be stimulated as part of sexual arousal. In many cultures, human female nipples are [[sexualize]]d,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociologytoolbox.com/social-construction-of-the-body/|title=Social Construction of the Body: The Nipple|publisher=sociologytoolbox.com|author=Todd Beer|date=2015-05-12|accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "...regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness."&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewar | first = Gwen | title = The sexualization of girls: Is the popular culture harming our kids? | url = http://www.parentingscience.com/sexualization-of-girls.html | website = parentingscience.com | publisher = Parenting Science | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
[[File:Breast anatomy normal scheme.png|thumb|300px|The breast: cross-section scheme of the [[mammary gland]]: {{ordered list |[[Thoracic wall|Chest wall]] |[[Pectoralis major muscle|Pectoralis muscle]]s |[[Lobe (anatomy)|Lobules]] |'''Nipple''' |[[Areola]] |[[Lactiferous duct|Milk duct]] |[[Adipose tissue|Fatty tissue]] |[[Human skin|Skin]]}}]]

In [[mammal]]s, a nipple (also called mammary papilla or [[teat]]) is a small projection of [[skin]] containing the outlets for 15–20 [[lactiferous duct]]s arranged cylindrically around the tip. [[Marsupial]]s and [[Eutheria|eutherian mammals]] typically have an even number of nipples arranged bilaterally, from as few as two to as many as 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthlife.net/mammals/milk.html |title=The Wonder of Milk |publisher=Earthlife.net |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Sensation--&gt;The skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special [[nerve]]s that are sensitive to certain stimuli: these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting [[integumentary|cutaneous]] [[mechanoreceptor]]s. Mechanoreceptors are identified respectively by Type I slowly-adapting with multiple [[Merkel corpuscle end-organ]]s and Type II slowly-adapting with single [[Ruffini corpuscle end-organ]]s, as well as Type I rapidly-adapting with multiple [[Meissner corpuscle end-organ]]s and Type II rapidly-adapting with single [[Pacinian corpuscle end-organs]]. The dominant nerve supply to the nipple comes from the lateral cutaneous branches of fourth [[intercostal nerve]].&lt;ref&gt;Grabb &amp; Smith's Plastic Surgery 6th edition. Chapter 59 page 593&lt;/ref&gt; The nipple is also used as an anatomical landmark. It marks the T4 (fourth thoracic vertebra) [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]] and rests over the approximate level of the diaphram.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|p=73}}

&lt;!--Blood and lymphatic supply--&gt;The arterial supply to the nipple and breast originates from the anterior intercostal branches of the internal thoracic (mammary) arteries; lateral thoracic artery; and thoracodorsal arteries. The venous vessels parallel the arteries.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|p=80}} The lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|p=80}} The axillary nodes are the apical axillary nodes, the lateral group and the anterior group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Imwold | first = Denise | title = Anatomica's body atlas | publisher = Laurel Glen | location = San Diego, CA | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781571459237 |pages = 286–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of the lymph is drained through the axillary lymph nodes located near the armpit. The rest of the drainage leaves the nipple and breast through infroclavicular, pectoral, or parasternal nodes.

Since nipples change throughout the life span in men and women, the anatomy of the nipple can change and this change may be expected and considered normal.

===In male mammals===&lt;!-- this section is target of [[:Male nipple]] redirect; update that link if you rename this section --&gt;
[[File:Human nipple.jpg|thumb|right|A human male nipple]]
Almost all [[mammals]] have nipples. Why males have nipples has been the subject of scientific research.  Differences among the sexes (called [[sexual dimorphism]]) within a given species are considered by [[evolutionary biologist]]s to be mostly the result of [[sexual selection]], directly or indirectly. For traits where there is no difference among the sexes, evolutionary biologists assume that there has been no advantage to one of the sexes losing the trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Eleanor|title=Why do men have nipples?|journal=Nature News|date=5 August 1999|doi=10.1038/news990805-1|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1999/990805/full/news990805-1.html|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Anna|title=Do Male Dogs Have Nipples?|url=http://www.akc.org/content/dog-care/articles/do-male-dogs-have-nipples/|website=American Kennel Club|language=en|date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simons|first1=Andrew M.|title=Why do men have nipples?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-men-have-nipples/|work=Scientific American|date=January 13, 2003|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function==
{{main|Breast feeding}}
The physiological purpose of nipples is to deliver [[milk]] to the infant, produced in the female [[mammary gland]]s during [[lactation]]. During breastfeeding, nipple stimulation by an [[infant]] will simulate the release of [[oxytocin]] from the [[hypothalamus]]. Oxytocin is a [[hormone]] that increases during pregnancy and acts on the breast to help produce the [[milk-ejection reflex]]. Oxytocin release from the nipple stimulation of the infant causes the uterus to contract even after childbirth.{{sfn|Henry|2016|p=117}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/glossary/#o|title=Glossary - womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017|date=2017-01-10}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong uterine contractions that are caused by the stimulation of the mother's nipples help the uterus contract to clamp down the uterine arteries. These contractions are necessary to prevent [[post-partum hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name=Abedi2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abedi|first1=P|last2=Jahanfar|first2=S|last3=Namvar|first3=F|last4=Lee|first4=J|title=Breastfeeding or nipple stimulation for reducing postpartum haemorrhage in the third stage of labour|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=27 January 2016|volume=1|issue=1|pages=CD010845|pmid=26816300|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010845.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the baby suckles or stimulates the nipple, oxytocin levels rise and small muscles in the breast contract and move the milk through the milk ducts. The result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple. This contraction of milk is called the “let-down reflex.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/files/documents/your-guide-to-breastfeeding.pdf |title=Guide to breastfeeding |website=www.womenshealth.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latching on refers to the baby fastening onto the nipple to breastfeeding. A good attachment is when the bottom of the areola (the area around the nipple) is in the baby's mouth and the nipple is drawn back inside his or her mouth. A poor latch results in insufficient nipple stimulation to create the let down reflex. The nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple. This poor attachment can cause sore and cracked nipples and a reluctance of the mother to continue to breastfeed.&lt;ref name = whgov&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/itsonlynatural/overcoming-challenges/breastfeeding-checklist-how-to-get-good-latch.html|title=Breastfeeding checklist: How to get a good latch | publisher = WomensHealth.gov | accessdate=4 August 2017|date=2017-06-09 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = whgov2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/itsonlynatural/overcoming-challenges/common-questions-about-breastfeeding-pain.html|title=Common questions about breastfeeding and pain | publisher = womenshealth.gov|accessdate=4 August 2017|date=2017-06-09 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the birth of the infant, the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant. If the baby increases nursing time at the nipple, the mammary glands respond to this stimulation by increasing milk production.

==Clinical significance==
===Pain===
Nipple pain can be a disincentive for breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/world_breastfeeding_week_20130730/en/|title=WHO - Breastfeeding: Only 1 in 5 countries fully implement WHO's infant formula Code|website=www.who.int|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sore nipples that progress to cracked nipples is of concern since many woman cease breastfeeding due to the pain. In some instances an ulcer will form on the nipple.&lt;ref name="Sant2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=Kamila Juliana da Silva|last2=Santana|first2=Géssica Silva|last3=Vieira|first3=Tatiana de Oliveira|last4=Santos|first4=Carlos Antônio de Souza Teles|last5=Giugliani|first5=Elsa Regina Justo|last6=Vieira|first6=Graciete Oliveira|title=Prevalence and factors associated with cracked nipples in the first month postpartum|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|volume=16|issue=1|pages=209|year=2016|issn=1471-2393|doi=10.1186/s12884-016-0999-4|pmid=27496088|pmc=4975913}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the development of cracked and sore nipples is the incorrect latching-on of the infant to the nipple. If a nipple appears to be wedge-shaped, white and flattened, this may indicates that the attachment of the infant is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples.&lt;ref name = nhs2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/sore-cracked-nipples-breastfeeding.aspx|title=Sore or cracked nipples when breastfeeding, Pregnancy and baby guide |publisher = National Health Services (UK)|website=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=4 August 2017|date=2017-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Herpes infection of the nipple is painful.{{sfn|Walker|2011|p=533}} Nipple pain can also be caused by excessive [[friction]] of clothing against the nipple that causes a [[Fissure of the nipple|
fissure]].

===Discharge===
Nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast. Discharge from the nipple does not occur in lactating women. And discharge in non-pregnant women or women who are not breasfeeding may not cause concern. Men that have discharge from their nipples are not typical. Discharge from the nipples of men or boys may indicate a problem.  Discharge from the nipples can appear without squeezing or may only be noticeable if the nipples are squeezed. One nipple can have discharge while the other does not. The discharge can be clear, green, bloody, brown or straw-colored. The consistency ct can be thick, thin, sticky or watery.&lt;ref name = medline1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nipple-discharge/basics/definition/sym-20050946|title=Nipple discharge|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases of nipple discharge will clear on their own without treatment. Nipple discharge is most often not cancer (benign), but rarely, it can be a sign of breast cancer. It is important to find out what is causing it and to get treatment. Here are some reasons for nipple discharge:&lt;ref name = medline1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001515.htm|title=Nipple discharge: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pregnancy
* Recent breastfeeding
* Rubbing on the area from a bra or T-shirt
* Injury to the breast
* Infection
* Inflammation and clogging of the breast ducts
* Noncancerous pituitary tumors
* Small growth in the breast that is usually not cancer
* Severe underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
* Fibrocystic breast (normal lumpiness in the breast)
* Use of certain medicines
* Use of certain herbs, such as anise and fennel
* Widening of the milk ducts&lt;ref name = medline1/&gt;

Sometimes, babies can have nipple discharge. This is caused by hormones from the mother before birth. It usually goes away in 2 weeks. Cancers such as Paget disease (a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple) can also cause nipple discharge.&lt;ref name = medline1/&gt;

Nipple discharge that is not normal is bloody, comes from only one nipple, or comes out on its own without squeezing or touching the nipple. Nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it comes out of both nipples or happens when the nipple is squeezed your nipples. Squeezing the nipple to check for discharge can make it worse. Leaving the nipple alone may make the discharge stop.&lt;ref name = medline1/&gt;

Any nipple discharge in a male usually is of more concern. Most of the time a mammogram and an examination of the fluid is done. Oftentimes a biopsy is performed A fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy can be fast and least painful. A very thin, hollow needle and slight suction will be used to remove a small sample from under the nipple. Using a local anesthetic to numb the skin may not be necessary since a thin needle is used for the biopsy. Receiving an injection to prevent pain from the biopsy may be more painful than the biopsy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer-in-men/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html|title=How Is Breast Cancer in Men Diagnosed?|website=www.cancer.org|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some genetically-males develop a condition known as [[gynecomastia]], in which the breast tissue under the nipple develops and grows. Discharge from the nipple can occur. The nipple may swell in some genetically-males possibly due to increased levels of estrogen.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Changes in appearance may be normal or related to disease.
* Inverted nipples - This is normal if the nipples have always been indented inward and can easily point out when touched. If the nipples are pointing in and this is new, this is an unexpected change.
* Skin puckering of the nipple - This can be caused by scar tissue from surgery or an infection. Often, scar tissue forms for no reason. Most of the time this issue does not need treatment. This is an unexpected change. This change can be of concern since puckering of the nipple, or retraction of the nipple can indicate an underlying change in breast tissue that can be cancerous.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|p=83}}
* Nipple is warm to the touch, red or painful - This can be an infection. It is rarely due to breast cancer. 
* Scaly, flaking, itchy nipple - This is most often due to eczema or a bacterial or fungal infection. This change is not expected. flaking, scaly, itchy nipples can be a sign of Paget disease. This is a rare form of breast cancer involving the nipple.
* Thickened skin with large pores - This is called peau d'orange because the skin looks like an orange peel. An infection in the breast or inflammatory breast cancer can cause this problem. This not an expected change.
* Retracted nipples  -  The nipple was raised above the surface but changes begins to pull inward and does not come out when stimulated. This is an expected change it did not exist before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000622.htm|title=Breast skin and nipple changes: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The average projection and size of human female nipples is slightly more than {{convert|3/8|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hussain, L. Rynn, C. Riordan and P. J. Regan, "Nipple-areola reconstruction: outcome assessment"; ''European Journal of Plastic Surgery'', Vol. 26, Num. 7, December, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breast cancer===
Symptoms of [[breast cancer]] can often be seen first by changes of the nipple and areola, although not all women have the same symptoms, and some people do not have any signs or symptoms at all. A person may find out they have breast cancer after a routine [[mammogram]].
Warning signs can be:&lt;ref name = cdcbc/&gt;&lt;ref name = cdc2bc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/resources/features/breastcanceryoungwomen/index.htm|title=Breast Cancer in Young Women|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017|date=October 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* New lump in the nipple, or breast or armpit.
* Thickening or swelling of part of the breast, areola or nipple.
* Irritation or dimpling of breast skin.
* Redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast.
* Pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area.
* Nipple discharge other than breast milk, including blood.
* Any change in the size or the shape of the breast or nipple.
* Pain in any area of the breast.&lt;ref name = cdcbc/&gt;&lt;ref name = cdc2bc/&gt;

Changes in the nipple are not necessarily symptoms or signs of breast cancer. Other conditions of the nipple can mimic the signs and symptoms of breast cancer.&lt;ref name = cdcbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/young_women/bringyourbrave/breast_cancer_young_women/symptoms.htm|title=CDC - Bring Your Brave Campaign - Symptoms of Breast Cancer|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertical transmission===
Some infections are transmitted through the nipple, especially if irritation or injury to the nipple has occurred. In these circumstances, the nipple itself can become infected with Candida that is present in the mouth of the breastfeeding infant. The infant will transmit the infection to the mother. Most of the time, this infection is localized to the area of the nipple. In some cases the infection can can progress to become a full-blown case of mastitis or breast infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/nepal_art.pdf?ua=1 |title=Nepal art |website=www.who.int |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, if the mother has an infection with no nipple cracks or ulcerations, it is still safe to breastfeed the infant.

Herpes infection of the nipple can go unnoticed because the lesions are small but usually are quite painful. Herpes in the newborn is a serious and sometimes fatal infection.{{sfn|Walker|2011|p=533}} Transmission of Hepatitis C and B to the infant can occur if the nipples are cracked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000803.htm|title=Breastfeeding vs. Formula Feeding: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other infections can be transmitted through a break of the skin of the nipple and can infect the infant.

===Surgery===
A nipple-sparing/[[Subcutis|subcutaneous]] mastectomy is a surgical procedure where breast tissue is removed, but the nipple and areola is preserved. This procedure was historically done only prophylactically or with mastectomy for benign disease over fear of increased cancer development in retained areolar ductal tissue. Recent series suggest that it may be an oncologically sound procedure for tumors not in the subareolar position.&lt;ref name="pmid12832974"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gerber B, Krause A, Reimer T, etal |title=Skin-sparing mastectomy with conservation of the nipple-areola complex and autologous reconstruction is an oncologically safe procedure |journal=Ann.

==Society and culture==

===Exposure===
The culture tendency to hide the female nipple under clothing has existed in Western culture since the 1800s.&lt;ref name = bbc1&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30052071|title=Toplessness - the one Victorian taboo that won't go away|date=15 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2017|via=www.bbc.com|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dewar/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As female nipples are often perceived an [[intimate part]], covering them might originate as a Victorian taboo just as was riding side saddle. Exposing the entire breast and nipple is a form of protest for some and a crime for others.&lt;ref name="citypaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/straight-dope/article/13045218/why-are-women-expected-to-keep-their-nipples-covered-breasts|title=Why Are Women Expected to Keep Their Nipples Covered?|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = bbc1/&gt; The exposure of nipples is usually considered [[Modesty|immodest]] and in some instances is viewed as [[lewd]] or [[indecent exposure|indecent]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leder, ''The Body in Medical Thought and Practice'', page 223, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1657-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case in Erie, Pennsylvania concerning the exposure of breasts and nipple proceeded to the Supreme Court in the US.&lt;ref name="SC_Erie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000)|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/529/277/case.html|website=Justia Law|publisher=Justia|accessdate=15 February 2018|language=en|date=March 2000|quote=Nudity cannot be considered an inherent form of expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Erie ordinance was regulating the nipple in public as an act that is committed when a person "'... knowingly or intentionally, ... appears in a state of nudity commits Public Indecency.'" Later in the statute, nudity is further described as an uncovered female nipple. But nipple exposure of a man was not regulated. A commentator expressed this opinion on the statute by noting: "Ponder the significance of that. A man walks around bare-chested and the worst that happens is he won't get served in restaurants. But a woman who goes topless is legally in the same boat as if she'd had sex in public. That may seem crazy, but in the U.S. it's a permissible law. — Cecil Adams"&lt;ref name="citypaper"/&gt;

[[File:Namibie Himba 0716a.jpg|thumb|left | 100px|A Namibian woman]]
The legality around the exposure of nipples are inconsistently  regulated throughout the US. Some states do not allow the visualization of any part of the breast. Other jurisdictions prohibit any female chest anatomy by banning anatomical structures that lie below the top of the areola or nipple. Such is the case in West Virginia and Massachusetts. West Virginia's regulation is very specific and is not likely to be misinterpreted and states: "[The] display of 'any portion of the cleavage of the human female breast exhibited by a dress, blouse, skirt, leotard, bathing suit, or other wearing apparel provided the areola is not exposed, in whole or in part.'"&lt;ref name="citypaper"/&gt;

[[Instagram]] has a 'no nipples' policy with exceptions: material that is not allowed includes "...some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too".&lt;ref name="Instagram_Help"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Guidelines|url=https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119|website=help.instagram.com|publisher=Instagram|accessdate=15 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Instagram had removed images of nursing mothers. Instagram removed images of [[Rihanna]] and had her account cancelled when she posted selfies with nipples. This was incentive for the Twitter campaign #FreeTheNipple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/instagram-clarifies-its-no-nipple-policy/|title=Instagram Clarifies Its No-Nipple Policy|date=17 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent development is the Instagram page that invites users to post images of nipples from both&lt;!--aren't there more than two?--&gt; sexes. The account called @genderless_nipples displays close ups of both the nipples of men and women for the purpose of spotlighting what may be inconsistency.&lt;ref name = genderless&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13852900/genderless-nipples-instagram-censorship-policy|title=Genderless Nipples exposes Instagram's double standard on nudity|first=Amar|last=Toor|date=6 December 2016|website=The Verge|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contributors have found 'a way around' this policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/40170981/art-student-challenges-sexist-ban-on-nipples-on-instagram-with-new-project|title=Art student challenges 'sexist' ban on nipples on Instagram with new project - BBC Newsbeat|date=6 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/09/women-it-s-time-to-reclaim-our-breasts|title=Women, It's Time to Reclaim Our Breasts|first=Emily|last=Shire|date=9 September 2014|publisher=|via=www.thedailybeast.com|newspaper=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has also been struggling to define its nipple policy.&lt;ref name = genderless/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.facebook.com/communitystandards/encouraging-respectful-behavior/|title=Community Standards|website=m.facebook.com|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/10/24/is-facebook-going-to-start-freeing-nipple.html|title=Is Facebook going to start freeing the nipple?|date=24 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[Lina Esco]] made a film entitled ''[[Free The Nipple]]'', which is about "...laws against female toplessness or restrictions on images of female, but not male, nipples", which Esco states is an example of [[sexism]] in society.&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/09/women-it-s-time-to-reclaim-our-breasts.html|title=Women, It's Time to Reclaim Our Breasts|first=Emily|last=Shire|date=9 September 2014|newspaper=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In business===
Some companies and non-profit organisations have used the word ''nipple'' or images of nipples to draw attention to their product or cause.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bedfordandbowery.com/2014/08/this-new-bushwick-bar-is-the-most-literal-boobie-trap-weve-ever-seen/|title=This New Bushwick Bar Is The Most Literal Boobie Trap We've Ever Seen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "nipple" most likely originates as a [[diminutive]] of ''neb'', an [[Old English]] word meaning "beak", "nose", or "face", and which is of [[Proto-Germanic|Germanic origin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Enderby was awarded an [[Honorary Doctorate]] from the [[University of West England]] in December 2000 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to speech and language therapy and to rehabilitation research.&lt;ref name='UWE' /&gt; In 1986 Enderby was awarded the Jacques Parisot Foundation Fellowship Award presented by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/161741/1/EB77_Div-3_eng.pdf |title= 77th Session: DECISIONS AND LIST OF RESOLUTIONS.

===Equal pay activism===
Enderby was the lead claimant in a landmark legal case for equal pay in the [[NHS]] (see [[Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority]]). In 1986 she argued that her work and that of her colleagues, mostly women, was of equal value to clinical psychologists, who were predominantly men. Her employers said the difference in pay could be justified because the two groups bargain separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thompsonstradeunion.law/news/lelr/weekly-issue-121-archive/pay-up |title=PAY UP |publisher=Labour &amp; European Law Review Weekly |date=12 March 2008 |volume=121 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim launched the second longest group action for equal pay for equal work since a 1985 claim by female canteen workers against [[British Coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/landmark-victory-for-women-in-in-fight-for-equal-pay-1265022.html |title=Landmark victory for women in fight for equal pay |author1=Patricia Wynn Davies |date=3 April 1997 |publisher=The Independent|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case involved twenty-six court appearances (including at the European Court of Justice), 2,000 applicants and sixteen test cases.&lt;ref name='Tolpuddle'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolpuddlemartyrs.org.uk/story/tuc-150/post-war-and-heady-days-unions/equal-pay |title=Equal Pay |publisher=Tolpuddle Martyrs |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting compensation cost the government approximately £30 million in back-pay. The Enderby case led the then Labour government to institute a review of pay and grading scales throughout the health service in the form of the [[Agenda for Change]].&lt;ref name='Tolpuddle' /&gt;

A '''perineal tear''' is a laceration of the skin and other soft tissue structures which, in women, separate the vagina from the anus. Perineal tears mainly occur in women as a result of vaginal [[childbirth]], which strains the [[perineum]]. Tears vary widely in severity. The majority are superficial and require no treatment, but severe tears can cause significant bleeding, long-term pain or dysfunction. A perineal tear is distinct from an [[episiotomy]], in which the perineum is intentionally incised to facilitate delivery.

==Anatomy==
In a woman, an anatomical area known as the perineum separates the opening of the vagina from that of the anus. Each opening is surrounded by a wall, and the anal wall is separated from the vaginal wall by a mass of soft tissue including:

* The muscles of the anus ([[corrugator cutis ani]], the [[internal anal sphincter]] and the [[external anal sphincter]])
* The medial muscles of the urogenital region (the [[superficial transverse perineal muscle]], the [[deep transverse perineal muscle]] and [[Bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosus]])
* The medial [[levator ani]] muscles ([[puborectalis]] and [[pubococcygeus]])
* The [[fascia of perineum]], which covers these muscles
* The overlying [[skin]] and [[subcutaneous tissue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Last|first1=R. J.|title=Anatomy Regional and Applied|date=1984|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=London|isbn=0-443-02989-X|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A perineal tear may involve some or all of these structures, which normally aid in supporting the pelvic organs and maintaining faecal continence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finn |first1=Martha |last2=Bowyer |first2=Lucy |last3=Carr |first3=Sandra |last4=O'Connor |first4=Vivienne |last5=Vollenhoven |first5=Beverley |title=Women's Health: A Core Curriculum |date=2005 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Australia |isbn=0-7295-3736-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Tears are classified into four categories:&lt;ref&gt;Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary [http://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/ub/view/Tabers/143773/48/tears_of_the_perineum?q=perineal%20tear tabers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewomens.org.au/PerinealTraumaAssessmentandRepair |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001014558/http://www.thewomens.org.au/PerinealTraumaAssessmentandRepair |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*First-degree tear: laceration is limited to the [[Frenulum labiorum pudendi|fourchette]] and superficial perineal skin or vaginal [[mucosa]] 
*Second-degree tear: laceration extends beyond fourchette, perineal skin and vaginal mucosa to perineal muscles and [[fascia]], but not the anal sphincter
*Third-degree tear: fourchette, perineal skin, vaginal mucosa, muscles, and [[anus|anal sphincter]] are torn; third-degree tears may be further subdivided into three subcategories:&lt;ref&gt;MDConsult [http://www.mdconsult.com mdconsult.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
**3a: partial tear of the external anal sphincter involving less than 50% thickness
**3b: greater than 50% tear of the external anal sphincter
**3c: internal sphincter is torn
*Fourth-degree tear: fourchette, perineal skin, vaginal mucosa, muscles, anal sphincter, and rectal mucosa are torn

==Cause==
In humans and some other primates, the head of the term fetus is so large in comparison to the size of the birth canal that  delivery may result in some degree of trauma.&lt;ref name="RosenbergTrevathan2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Karen|last2=Trevathan|first2=Wenda|title=Birth, obstetrics and human evolution|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|volume=109|issue=11|year=2002|pages=1199–1206|issn=1470-0328|doi=10.1046/j.1471-0528.2002.00010.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the head passes through the pelvis, the soft tissues are stretched and compressed. The risk of severe tear is greatly increased if the fetal head is oriented occiput posterior (face forward), if the mother has not given birth before or if the fetus is large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eskandar|first1=O|last2=Shet|first2=D|title=Risk factors for 3rd and 4th degree perineal tear.|journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|date=February 2009|volume=29|issue=2|pages=119–22|pmid=19274544|doi=10.1080/01443610802665090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Several techniques are used to reduce the risk of tearing, but with little evidence for efficacy. Antenatal digital perineal massage is often advocated, and may reduce the risk of trauma only in nulliparous women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seehusen|first1=DA|last2=Raleigh|first2=M|title=Antenatal perineal massage to prevent birth trauma.|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 March 2014|volume=89|issue=5|pages=335–6|pmid=24695503}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Hands on’ techniques employed by midwives, in which the foetal head is guided through the vagina at a controlled rate have been widely advocated, but their efficacy is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=H|last2=Jayasekara|first2=R|last3=Warland|first3=J|title=The effect of "hands on" techniques on obstetric perineal laceration: A structured review of the literature.|journal=Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives|date=12 March 2015|pmid=25773668|doi=10.1016/j.wombi.2015.02.006|volume=28|pages=194–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterbirth and labouring in water are popular for several reasons, and it has been suggested that by softening the perineum they might reduce the rate of tearing. However, this effect has never been clearly demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nutter |first1=E. |last2=Meyer |first2=S. |last3=Shaw-Battista |first3=J. |last4=Marowitz |first4=A. |title=Waterbirth: an integrative analysis of peer-reviewed literature. |journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health |date=2014 |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=286–319 |pmid=24850284 |doi=10.1111/jmwh.12194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
A 2008 study found that over 85% of women having a vaginal birth sustain some form of perineal trauma, and 60-70% receive stitches.&lt;ref&gt;Kettle, C., &amp; Tohill, S. (2008). Perineal care. Clinical evidence, 2008.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19445799]&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective study of 8,603 vaginal deliveries in 1994 found a third degree tear had been clinically diagnosed in only 50 women (0.6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sultan AH, Kamm MA, Hudson CN | year = 1994 | title = Bartram CI. Third degree obstetric anal sphincter tears: risk factors and outcome of primary repair | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/308/6933/887.short | journal = BMJ | volume = 308 | issue = | pages = 887–91 | doi=10.1136/bmj.308.6933.887}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the same authors used anal endosonography in a consecutive group of 202 deliveries, there was evidence of third degree tears in 35% of first-time mothers and 44% of mothers with previous children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sultan A, Kamm MA, Hudson CN, Thomas JM, Bartram CI | year = 1993 | title = Anal sphincter disruption during vaginal delivery | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 329 | issue = | pages = 1905–1911 | pmid=8247054 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199312233292601}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers are confirmed by other researchers in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fines M, Donnelly V, Behan M, O'Connell PR, O'Herlihy C | year = 1999 | title = Effect of second vaginal delivery on anorectal physiology and faecal continence: a prospective study | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673698112059 | journal = Lancet | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = 983–986 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)11205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that in 2011, first- and second-degree perineal tear was the most common complicating condition for vaginal deliveries in the U.S. among women covered by either private insurance or Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Moore JE, Witt WP, Elixhauser A | title =  Complicating Conditions Associate With Childbirth, by Delivery Method and Payer, 2011. | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #173 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = April 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb173-Childbirth-Delivery-Complications.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Second-degree perineal laceration rates were higher for women covered by private insurance than for women covered by Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Moore JE, Witt WP, Elixhauser A | title =  Complicating Conditions Associate With Childbirth, by Delivery Method and Payer, 2011. | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #173 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = April 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb173-Childbirth-Delivery-Complications.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
First and second degree tears rarely cause long-term problems. Among women who experience a third or fourth degree tear, 60-80% are asymptomatic after 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toglia|first1=Marc|title=Repair of episiotomy and perineal lacerations associated with childbirth|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-episiotomy-and-perineal-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth?source=search_result&amp;search=perineal+laceration&amp;selectedTitle=1~29#H6881188|website=UpToDate|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faecal incontinence, faecal urgency, chronic perineal pain and dyspareunia occur in a minority of patients, but may be permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernando|first1=RJ|last2=Sultan|first2=AH|last3=Kettle|first3=C|last4=Radley|first4=S|last5=Jones|first5=P|last6=O'Brien|first6=PM|title=Repair techniques for obstetric anal sphincter injuries: a randomized controlled trial.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=June 2006|volume=107|issue=6|pages=1261–8|pmid=16738150|doi=10.1097/01.aog.0000218693.24144.bd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms associated with perineal tear are not always due to the tear itself, since there are often other injuries, such as avulsion of pelvic floor muscles, that are not evident on examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lammers|first1=K|last2=Prokop|first2=M|last3=Vierhout|first3=ME|last4=Kluivers|first4=KB|last5=Fütterer|first5=JJ|title=A pictorial overview of pubovisceral muscle avulsions on pelvic floor magnetic resonance imaging.|journal=Insights into imaging|date=August 2013|volume=4|issue=4|pages=431–41|pmid=23756995|doi=10.1007/s13244-013-0261-9|pmc=3731469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are claims that sometimes the perineum is excessively repaired after childbirth, using a so-called "[[The husband stitch|husband stitch]]" and that this can increase vaginal tightness or result in pain during intercourse.&lt;ref name="Vinopal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vinopal|first1=Lauren|title=Are Husbands and Doctors Conspiring to Sew New Moms Up Too Tight?|url=https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/why-parents-fear-husband-stitch/|website=Fatherly|accessdate=15 October 2017|date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pes anserine bursitis''' is an inflammatory condition of the [[Anatomical terminology#Standard terms|medial]] (inner) knee at the [[anserine bursa]], a sub muscular [[synovial bursa|bursa]], just below the [[Pes anserinus (leg)|pes anserinus]].  

==Pathology==
The pes anserinus is the insertion of the conjoined tendons [[sartorius muscle|sartorius]], [[gracilis muscle|gracilis]], and [[semitendinosus]] into the anteromedial proximal [[tibia]].  Theoretically, [[bursitis]] results from stress to this area (e.g. stress may result when an obese individual with anatomic deformity from arthritis ascends or descends stairs).  An occurrence of pes anserine bursitis commonly is characterized by pain, especially when climbing stairs, tenderness, and local swelling.&lt;ref name="Glencross"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/308694-overview|title=Pes Anserine Bursitis|last=Glencross|first=P. Mark|date=20 January 2017|website=Medscape|publisher=WebMD LLC|access-date=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathophysiology===
The etymology of the name relates to the insertion of the conjoined tendons into the anteromedial proximal tibia. From anterior to posterior, the pes anserinus is made up of the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles. The tendon's name, which literally means "goose's foot," was inspired by the pes anserinus's webbed, footlike structure. The conjoined tendon lies superficial to the tibial insertion of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the knee.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Muscles involved===
*[[Sartorius muscle|Sartorius]] aids in knee and hip flexion, as in sitting or climbing; abducts and laterally rotates thigh; innervated by the [[femoral nerve]].&lt;ref name="Saladin"&gt;K. Saladin, ''Anatomy &amp; Physiology 5th Edition'', 2010, McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gracilis muscle|Gracilis]] adducts the hip; flexes and medially rotates tibia at knee; innervated by the [[obturator nerve]].&lt;ref name="Saladin" /&gt;
*[[Semitendinosus]] flexes knee; medially rotates tibia on femur when knee is flexed; medially rotates femur when hip is extended; counteracts forward bending at hips; innervated by [[tibial nerve]] and [[common fibular nerve]].&lt;ref name="Saladin" /&gt;

==Treatment==
Pes anserine bursitis can be treated with a variety of physical therapy treatments, steroids to reduce inflammation, or surgery if necessary.  Physical therapy treatments include therapeutic ultrasound, electrical stimulation (E-stim), rehabilitative exercises, and ice.&lt;ref name=Glencross/&gt; Therapeutic ultrasound and E-stim deliver medication deep to the bursa to reduce inflammation. The rehabilitative exercises are done with the intention of stretching and strengthening the hip abductors, quadriceps, and hamstrings.&lt;ref name=Glencross/&gt; These stretches have the potential to significantly reduce the tension over the pes anserine bursa.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11623">The '''pizza effect''' is a term used especially in [[religious studies]] and [[sociology]] for the phenomenon of elements of a nation or people's culture being transformed or at least more fully embraced elsewhere, then re-imported back to their culture of origin,&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | year=2003 | title = Action dharma: new studies in engaged Buddhism | editor1=Christopher S. Queen | editor2=Charles S. Prebish | editor3=Damien Keown | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-7007-1594-7 | page=33 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WP4RcKcEm2QC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22pizza+effect%22}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or the way in which a community's self-understanding is influenced by (or imposed by, or imported from) foreign sources.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; It is named after the idea that modern [[pizza]] toppings were developed among [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]] [[History of immigration to the United States|in the United States]] (rather than in native Italy, where in its simpler form it was originally looked down upon), and was later exported back to Italy to be interpreted as a delicacy in [[Italian cuisine]].&lt;ref name="dandavats"/&gt;

Related phrases include "hermeneutical feedback loop", "re-enculturation", and "self-orientalization". The term "pizza effect" was coined by the Austrian-born [[Hindu]] [[Dashanami Sampradaya|monk]] and professor of Anthropology at [[Syracuse University]], [[Agehananda Bharati]]&lt;ref name=white/&gt;&lt;ref name=knott/&gt;&lt;ref name="dandavats"&gt;[[Steven J. Rosen]] (Satyaraja Dasa), [http://www.dandavats.com/?p=260 "The Pizza Effect"] (in the context of [[Krishna Consciousness]])

== Examples ==
The original examples given by Agehananda Bharati mostly had to do with popularity and status:
*The [[Apu trilogy]] films of [[Satyajit Ray]], which were flops in India before they were given prizes in [[Western countries]] and re-evaluated as classics of the [[Indian cinema]]&lt;ref name="expat"&gt;
{{citation | author=Agehananda Bharati | contribution=Indian Expatriates in North America and neo-Hindu Movements | year=1980 | title = The Communication of Ideas | editor1=Vinayshil Gautam | editor2= J.

&lt;/ref&gt;
*The popularity in India of movements like those of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] and [[ISKCON]] based on their popularity in the west&lt;ref name="expat" /&gt;
*The popularity of [[yoga]], several [[List of Hindu gurus and saints|gurus]], and some other Indian systems and teachings following their popularity in the west&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
*The exalted status of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in Hinduism, where, although it was always highly regarded, it gained its current prominence only following Western attempts to identify a single canonical "Hindu Bible"&lt;ref name="ab70" /&gt;

Analyst [[Mark Sedgwick]] wrote that [[Islamist terrorism]], and specifically [[suicide bombing]], can be seen as examples, beginning as isolated interpretations of the concept of [[shahid]], or martyrdom, then being re-exported to the greater Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Day of the Dead]] parade in Mexico City was inspired by an event in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', which was fictional at the time of the film's production. &lt;ref&gt;David Agren, October 30, 2016, The Gaurdian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/day-of-the-dead-parade-james-bond-mexico-city Mexico City's James Bond-inspired Day of the Dead parade gets mixed reviews], retrieved October 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], were influenced by Eastern religions, then placed their headquarters in [[Adyar, Chennai]], from where they spread their views within India.&lt;ref name="knott"&gt;{{citation | year=2000 | title = Hinduism: a very short introduction | author1=Kim Knott | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-285387-5 | page=78 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv8XK_GU9icC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Buddhist modernism]] or "Protestant Buddhism" was developed by Westerners, who according to scholar Stephen Jenkins, "mistook it for an indigenous Sri Lankan product", and they in turn influenced [[Sri Lankan Buddhist]] [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], who, along with the Theosophical Society, was instrumental in spreading Buddhism in both India and the West.&lt;ref name="blackships"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvi}}

According to scholar Kim Knott, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] "was not very interested in religion until he went to London to study law, where he studied the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in English in [[Sir Edwin Arnold]]'s translation, and this deeply influenced his spiritual outlook."&lt;ref name="knott" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious thought of [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes), which was taken up by 19th-century Europeans such as [[Ernest Renan]], and thereby regained popularity during the [[Nahda]], the Islamic renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Teppanyaki]], a Western-influenced style created in Japan, popular in the U.S.

[[Salsa music]]: the first salsa bands were mainly [[Puerto Ricans]] who moved to New York in the 1930s.

[[Haoqiu zhuan]], a Chinese novel. James St. André, author of "Modern Translation Theory and Past Translation Practice: European Translations of the ''Haoqiu zhuan''", wrote that in China the novel was originally "considered second-rate fiction and stood in danger of being completely forgotten with changes in literary taste in the early twentieth century."&lt;ref name="StAndrep39"&gt;St. André, James. "Modern Translation Theory and Past Translation Practice: European Translations of the ''Haoqiu zhuan''" (Chapter 2). In: Chan, Leo Tak-hung (editor).

[https://books.google.com/books?id=o5oPBC2AfgAC&amp;pg=PA39 39].&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the fact there had been interest in translating the novel into English "gave life and fame" to ''Haoqiu zhuan'' and therefore affected its standing in China.&lt;ref name="StAndrep39" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholar David Miller wrote that Westerners were responsible for "…the renewed interest in the four [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishads]], as texts in themselves apart from the endless number of commentaries that have been written by Indians to interpret and to systematize the texts," and that due to this interest, "Indian scholars have also served up that menu, often in a less appetizing way than their Western counterparts. In so doing they have missed the very life force or essence of Indian ethical traditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| year = 1981| author1 = Miller | first1 = D.| jstor = 40014933| publisher = Blackwell Publishing| issue = 2| pages = 186–198| title = Sources of Hindu Ethical Studies_ a Critical Review| journal = The Journal of Religious Ethics| volume = 9| doi = 10.2307/40014933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Scholar Jørn Borup wrote about an "inverted pizza-effect", when a society's modification of another culture gets further re-modified by that same society, such as European philosophers including [[Martin Heidegger]] "appear to have been significantly inspired by [[Eastern thought]] - an Eastern thought itself presented through "[[Protestant]]" or [[Western culture|"Western" eyes]]. This transformation is naturally not a unique phenomenon in [[religious studies]], where interpretations, re-interpretations and inventions are seen as common characteristics of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=2004 | title = Zen and the Art of Inverting Orientalism | author1=Jørn Borup | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | isbn=3-11-017698-X | page=477 | url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/9783110211702.3.451}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jenkins noted that the feedback phenomenon could continue; in the case of pizza, he wrote that the return of pizza to Italy again influenced [[American cuisine]]: "...pizza-loving American tourists, [[Tourism in Italy|going to Italy]] in the millions, sought out authentic Italian pizza. Italians, responding to this demand, developed [[pizzeria]]s to meet American expectations. Delighted with their discovery of "authentic" Italian pizza, Americans subsequently developed chains of "authentic" Italian brick-oven pizzerias. Hence, Americans met their own reflection in the other and were delighted."&lt;ref name="blackships" /&gt;{{rp|81}}

Jim Douglas, familiar with Bharati's thesis, applied it to black blues originating in the United States before 1960. The music of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, etc. went over to England, where it was embraced by other musicians (especially white men playing electric guitar). Then, this re-packaged blues came back to the US presented by the Rolling Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin,  etc. in the late 1960s where it was embraced by baby boomers (who had never heard of Robert Johnson, etc.). Later, some of these American baby boomers discovered the roots of the British blues-rock in the recordings of the original American blues artists.

[[File:Prawle point view east.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The eastwards view from Prawle Point]]
'''Prawle Point''' ({{lang-oe|Prǣwhyll}}, "lookout hill") is a [[coastal headland]] in south [[Devon]], [[England]]

It is the southernmost point of Devon.

Access is from the village of [[East Prawle]] along a single-track road, at the end of which a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] car park is present.

At the point itself, there are high cliffs.

The [[National Coastwatch Institution]] has a station at the point

The area around the point is a noted area for [[cirl bunting]], a localised bird in Britain, while the area has also attracted many rare [[vagrancy in birds|vagrant]] birds including Britain's second [[chestnut-sided warbler]].

The point is included within the [[Prawle Point and Start Point Site of Special Scientific Interest]].

Many ships have been wrecked at Prawle Point, the most recent being in December, 1992, when the ship ''Demetrios'', formerly the ''Long Lin'' from China was being towed by a tug from Dunkirk to a Mediterranean scrapyard. During terrible gales in the [[English Channel]], the tow broke and the ''Demetrios'' drifted helplessly. The ship struck the rocks at Prawle Point on 18 December, breaking her back in a few hours. The wreck attracted huge crowds for many weeks, and eventually a local salvage company cut up the ship and towed away the remains to [[Plymouth]]. However, the cost of scrapping the ship sent them into [[liquidation]]. Some remains were, however left over and are still visible today.

'''Presbycusis''' (also spelled '''presbyacusis''', from Greek ''presbys'' "old" + ''akousis'' "hearing"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=presbycousis Presbycousis]&lt;/ref&gt;), or '''age-related [[hearing loss]]''', is the cumulative effect of aging on [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. It is a progressive and irreversible bilateral symmetrical age-related [[sensorineural hearing loss]] resulting from degeneration of the [[cochlea]] or associated structures of the inner ear or auditory nerves. The hearing loss is most marked at higher frequencies. Hearing loss that accumulates with age but is caused by factors other than normal aging ([[nosocusis]] and [[sociocusis]]) is not presbycusis, although differentiating the individual effects of distinct causes of hearing loss can be difficult.

The cause of presbycusis is a combination of genetics, cumulative environmental exposures and pathophysiological changes related to aging.  At present there are no preventative measures known; treatment is by hearing aid or surgical implant.

Presbycusis is the most common cause of hearing loss, afflicting one out of three persons by age 65, and one out of two by age 75. Presbycusis is the second most common illness next to [[arthritis]] in aged people.

Many vertebrates such as fish, birds and amphibians do not suffer presbycusis in old age as they are able to regenerate their [[cochlea]]r sensory cells, whereas mammals including humans have genetically lost this regenerative ability.

Primary symptoms:
*sounds or speech becoming dull, muffled or attenuated
*need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources
*difficulty using the [[telephone]]
*loss of [[Sound localization|directionality of sound]]
*difficulty [[Speech perception|understanding speech]], especially women and children
*difficulty in speech discrimination against background noise ([[cocktail party effect]])
Secondary symptoms:
*[[hyperacusis]], heightened sensitivity to certain volumes and frequencies of sound, resulting from "recruitment"
*[[tinnitus]], ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present
Usually occurs after age 50, but deterioration in hearing has been found to start very early, from about the age of 18 years. The [[List of ISO standards|ISO standard]] 7029 shows expected threshold changes due purely to age for carefully screened populations (i.e. excluding those with ear disease, noise exposure etc.), based on a meta-analysis of published data.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Robinson and G.J. Sutton "Age effect in hearing – a comparative analysis of published threshold data." Audiology 1979; 18(4): YOLO  320-334 [http://www.isa-audiology.org/periodicals/1971-2001_Audiology/1979,%20%20Audiology,%20%20Vol.%20%2018/No.%204%20%20%28265-352%29/Robinson%20Sutton,%20%20Audiology,%20%201979.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Van Eyken, G. Van Camp, L. Van Laer, "The Complexity of Age-Related Hearing Impairment: Contributing Environmental and Genetic Factors", Audiol Neurotol 2007;12:345-358 [http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=pdf&amp;file=000106478]&lt;/ref&gt; Age affects high frequencies more than low, and men more than women. One early consequence is that even young adults may lose the ability to hear very high frequency tones above 15 or 16&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=HiFreqAudiometry2014&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rodriguez Valiente A, Trinidad A, Garcia Berrocal JR, Gorriz C, Ramirez Camacho R | title = Review: Extended high-frequency (9–20 kHz) audiometry reference thresholds in healthy subjects | journal = Int J Audiol | volume = 53 | issue = 8 | pages = 531–545 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24749665 | doi = 10.3109/14992027.2014.893375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, age-related hearing loss may only become noticeable later in life. The effects of age can be exacerbated by [[noise health effects|exposure to environmental noise]], whether at work or in leisure time (shooting, music, etc.). This is [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) and is distinct from presbycusis. A second exacerbating factor is exposure to ototoxic drugs and chemicals.

Over time, the detection of high-pitched sounds becomes more difficult, and speech perception is affected, particularly of [[sibilant]]s and [[fricative]]s. Patients typically express a decreased ability to understand speech. Once the loss has progressed to the 2–4&amp;nbsp;kHz range, there is increased difficulty understanding consonants. Both ears tend to be affected. The impact of presbycusis on communication depends on both the severity of the condition and the communication partner.&lt;ref name="Huang &amp; Tang 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Qi|last2=Tang|first2=Jianguo|title=Age-related hearing loss or presbycusis|journal=European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology|date=13 May 2010|volume=267|issue=8|pages=1179–1191|doi=10.1007/s00405-010-1270-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Causes==
{{See also|Hearing loss#Causes}}
The aging process has three distinct components: physiologic degeneration, extrinsic damage (nosocusis), and intrinsic damage (sociocusis). These factors are superimposed on a genetic substrate, and may be overshadowed by general age-related susceptibility to diseases and disorders.

Hearing loss is only weakly correlated with age. In preindustrial and non-industrial societies, persons retain their hearing into old age.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In the Framingham cohort study, only 10% of the variability of hearing with age could be explained by age-related physiologic deterioration.  Within family groups, heredity factors were dominant; across family groups, other, presumably sociocusis and nosocusis factors were dominant.

* [[Heredity]]: factors like early aging of the cochlea and susceptibility of the cochlea for drug insults are genetically determined.
* Oxidative stress
* General inflammatory conditions

===Sociocusis===
* Sociocusis is the condition of those who have hearing loss attributed to continuous noise exposures, unrelated to their job or occupation. This exposure to these stimuli is frequent, and are often considered common "background noises" that affect the hearing abilities of individuals. Examples of sociocusis-related stimuli are the continuous noises from traffic, home appliances, music, television, and radio. The accumulated exposure to these noises over many years can lead to a condition similar to pure presbycusis.

===Nosocusis===
Nosocusis factors are those that can cause hearing loss, which are not noise-based and separate from pure presbycusis. They may include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age-Related Hearing Loss|url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/Pages/Age-Related-Hearing-Loss.aspx|website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders|publisher=NIH|accessdate=17 November 2014|ref=NIH Pub. No. 14-4235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ototoxicity|Ototoxic drugs]]: Ingestion of ototoxic drugs like [[aspirin]] may hasten the process of presbycusis.
* vascular degeneration
** [[Atherosclerosis]]: May diminish vascularity of the cochlea, thereby reducing its oxygen supply.
*** [[Dietary habits]]: Increased intake of [[saturated fat]] may accelerate atherosclerotic changes in old age.
*** [[Smoking]]: Is postulated to accentuate atherosclerotic changes in blood vessels aggravating presbycusis.
** [[Diabetes mellitus and deafness|Diabetes]]: May cause vasculitis and endothelial proliferation in the blood vessels of the cochlea, thereby reducing its blood supply.
** [[Hypertension]]: causes potent vascular changes, like reduction in blood supply to the cochlea, thereby aggravating presbycusis.

However, a recent study found that diabetes, atherosclerosis and hypertension had no correlation to presbycusis, suggesting that these are nosocusis (acquired hearing loss) factors, not intrinsic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oh|first=In-Hwan|last2=Lee|first2=Jong Hoon|last3=Park|first3=Dong Choon|last4=Kim|first4=MyungGu|last5=Chung|first5=Ji Hyun|last6=Kim|first6=Sang Hoon|last7=Yeo|first7=Seung Geun|date=2014-12-30|title=Hearing Loss as a Function of Aging and Diabetes Mellitus: A Cross Sectional Study|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0116161|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=12|pages=e116161|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0116161|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4280139|pmid=25549095|bibcode=2014PLoSO...9k6161O}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
==Pathophysiology==
Examples of microscopic changes seen in this condition are hair cell degeneration of the [[cochlea]] and giant [[stereocilia (inner ear)|stereocilia]]ry degeneration.

There are four pathological phenotypes of presbycusis:
* Sensory: characterised by degeneration of the [[organ of Corti]], the sensory organ for hearing. Located within the scala media, it contains hair cells with stereocilia, which extend to the tectorial membrane. The organ's outer hair cells play a significant role in the amplification of sound and is extremely sensitive to external and internal factors. If the outer hair cells are damaged, they do not regenerate. This results in a loss of sensitivity of hearing, as well as an abnormal perceived loudness in the aspect of the tonotopic spectrum that the damaged cells serve.
* Neural: characterised by degeneration of cells of the [[spiral ganglion]].
* Strial/metabolic: characterised by atrophy of ''[[stria vascularis]]'' in all turns of cochlea. Located in the lateral wall of the cochlea, the stria vascularis contains sodium-potassium-ATPase pumps that are responsible for producing the endolymph resting potential. As individuals age, a loss of capillaries leads to the endolympatic potential becoming harder to maintain, which brings a decrease in cochlear potential.
* Cochlear conductive: due to stiffening of the [[basilar membrane]] thus affecting its movement.  This type of pathology has not been verified as contributing to presbycusis.

In addition there are two other types:
* Mixed
* Indeterminate

The shape of the audiogram categorizes abrupt high-frequency loss (sensory phenotype) or flat loss (strial phenotype).

The mainstay of SNHL is strial, with only about 5% of cases being sensory{{dubious|date=November 2015}}. This type of presbycusis is manifested by a low-frequency hearing loss, with unimpaired speech recognition.

Classically, audiograms in neural presbycusis show a moderate downward slope into higher frequencies with a gradual worsening over time. A severe loss in speech discrimination is often described, out of proportion to the threshold loss, making amplification difficult due to poor comprehension.

The audiogram associated with sensory presbycusis is thought to show a sharply sloping high-frequency loss extending beyond the speech frequency range, and clinical evaluation reveals a slow, symmetric, and bilateral progression of hearing loss.

==Diagnosis==
Hearing loss is classified as mild, moderate, severe or profound. Pure-tone audiometry for air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000 and 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz is traditionally used to classify the degree of hearing loss in each ear.  Normal hearing thresholds are considered to be 25&amp;nbsp;dB sensitivity, though it has been proposed that this threshold is too high, and that 15&amp;nbsp;dB (about half as loud) is more typical.  Mild hearing loss is thresholds of 25–45&amp;nbsp;dB; moderate hearing loss is thresholds of 45–65&amp;nbsp;dB; severe hearing loss is thresholds of 65–85&amp;nbsp;dB; and profound hearing loss thresholds are greater than 85&amp;nbsp;dB.

Tinnitus occurring in only one ear should prompt the clinician to initiate further evaluation for other etiologies. In addition, the presence of a pulse-synchronous rushing sound may require additional imaging to exclude vascular disorders.

===Otoscopy===
{{main|Otoscopy}}
An examination of the external ear canal and tympanic membrane performed by a medical doctor, otolaryngologist, or audiologist using an otoscope, a visual instrument inserted into the ear. This also allows some inspection of the middle ear through the translucent tympanic membrane.

===Tympanometry===
{{main|Tympanometry}}
A test administered by a medical doctor, otolaryngologist or audiologist of the tympanic membrane and middle ear function using a tympanometer, an air-pressure/sound wave instrument inserted into the ear canal.  The result is a tympanogram showing ear canal volume, middle ear pressure and eardrum compliance. Normal middle ear function (Type A tympanogram) with a hearing loss may suggest presbycusis. Type B and Type C tympanograms indicate an abnormality inside the ear and therefore may have an additional affect on the hearing.

===Laboratory studies===
This may include a blood or other sera test for inflammatory markers such as those for autoinflammatory diseases.

===Audiometry===
{{main|Audiometry}}
A hearing test administered by a [[physician|medical doctor]], [[otolaryngologist]] (ENT) or [[audiologist]] including [[pure tone audiometry]] and speech recognition may be used to determine the extent and nature of hearing loss, and distinguish presbycusis from other kinds of hearing loss. Otoacoustic emissions and evoked response testing may be used to test for audio neuropathy. The diagnosis of a sensorineural pattern hearing loss is made through audiometry, which shows a significant hearing loss without the "air-bone gap" that is characteristic of conductive hearing disturbances. In other words, air conduction is equal to bone conduction. Persons with cochlear deficits fail [[otoacoustic emissions]] testing, while persons with 8th cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve) deficits fail [[auditory brainstem response]] testing.

====Presbycusis audiogram====

===Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)===
{{main|Magnetic resonance imaging}}
As part of differential diagnosis, an MRI scan may be done to check for vascular anomalies, tumors, and structural problems like enlarged mastoids. MRI and other types of scan cannot directly detect or measure age-related hearing loss.

==Treatment==
{{Main|Sensorineural hearing loss#Treatment}}
At present, presbycusis, being primarily sensorineural in nature, cannot be prevented, ameliorated or cured.  Treatment options fall into three categories: pharmacological, surgical and management.

*There are no approved or recommended pharmaceutical treatments for presbycusis.

===Cochlear implant===
In cases of severe or profound hearing loss, a surgical [[cochlear implant]] is possible. This is an electronic device that replaces the cochlea of the inner ear.  Electrodes are typically inserted through the round window of the cochlea, into the fluid-filled scala tympani. They stimulate the peripheral axons of the primary auditory neurons, which then send information to the brain via the auditory nerve. The cochlea is tonotopically mapped in a spiral fashion, with lower frequencies localizing at the apex of the cochlea, and high frequencies at the base of the cochlea, near the oval and round windows. With age, comes a loss in distinction of frequencies, especially higher ones. The electrodes of the implant are designed to stimulate the array of nerve fibers that previously responded to different frequencies accurately. It is important to note that due to spatial constraints, the cochlear implant may not be inserted all the way into the cochlear apex. It provides a different kind of sound spectrum than natural hearing, but may enable the recipient to recognize speech and environmental sounds.

===Middle ear implants===
These are surgically implanted hearing aids inserted onto the middle ear. These aids work by directly vibrating the ossicles, and are cosmetically favorable due to their hidden nature.

===Management===
*Hearing aids help improve hearing of many elderly.  Hearing aids can now be tuned to specific frequency ranges of hearing loss.
*[[Aural rehabilitation]] for the affected person and their communication partners may reduce the impact on communication. Techniques such as squarely facing the affected person, enunciating, ensuring adequate light, minimizing noise in the environment, and using contextual cues are used to improve comprehension.&lt;ref name="Huang &amp; Tang 2010" /&gt;

==Research==

===Pharmaceuticals===
Pharmacological treatment options are limited, and remain clinically unproven. Among these are the water-soluble [[coenzyme Q10]] formulation, the prescription drug [[Tanakan]], and combination antioxidant therapy.

*In a study performed in 2010, it was found that the water-soluble formulation of coenzyme Q10 ([[CoQ10]]) caused a significant improvement in liminar tonal audiometry of the air and bone thresholds at 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz, 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz, and 8000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Salami |author2=R. Mora |author3=M. Dellepiane |author4=G. Manini |author5=V. Santomauro |author6=L. Barettini |author7=L. Guastini |title= Water-soluble Coenzyme Q10 Formulation (Q-TER(®)) in the Treatment of Presbycusis|journal= Acta Oto-Laryngologica|year= 2010|pmid= 20443731|doi=10.3109/00016481003727590|volume=130|issue=10|pages=1154–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Antioxidant]] therapy – age-related hearing loss was reduced in animal models with a combination agent comprising six antioxidant agents that target four sites within the oxidative pathway: L-cysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide, ribose-cysteine, NW-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, vitamin B12, folate, and ascorbic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heman-Ackah et.al.|first1=Selena|title=A combination antioxidant therapy prevents age-related hearing loss in C57BL/6 mice|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|date=Sep 2010|volume=143|issue=3|pages=429–434}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that these supplements attenuate the decline of cochlear structure due to prolonged oxidative stress. However, more recent studies have had conflicting results. In 2012, a study was done with CBA/J female mice. They were placed on an antioxidant-rich diet for 24 months consisting of vitamins A, C, E, L-carnitine, and α-lipoic acid. While this increased the inner ear's antioxidant capacity, the actual hearing loss was unaffected. Therefore, in this study, antioxidants were shown not to improve presbycusis mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Su-Hua Sha, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306450/ "Antioxidant-enriched diet does not delay the progression of age-related hearing loss"], 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*The effects of the pharmaceutical drug [[Tanakan]] were observed when treating tympanophonia in elderly women.&lt;ref name="Boboshko2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mlu Boboshko |author2=MV Efimova |author3=IV Savenko |title= Modern Aspects of Diagnosis of Presbycusis and Its Treatment in Elderly Patients|journal= Vestnik Otorinolaringologii|year= 2011|pmid= 21512480|issue=2|pages=23–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanakan was found to decrease the intensity of tympanitis and improve speech and hearing in aged patients, giving rise to the idea of recommending treatment with it to elderly patients with presbycusis or normal tonal hearing.&lt;ref name="Boboshko2011"/&gt;
*AM-111, an otoprotective peptide, was shown in a chinchilla study to rescue and protect against hearing loss following impulse noise trauma. AM-111 acts as a cell-permeable inhibitor of [[JNK]]-mediated apoptosis. IP injections or local injections into membrane of the round window were given, and permanent threshold shifts (PTS) were measured three weeks after impulse noise exposure. AM-111 animals had significantly lower PTS, implicating AM-111 as a possible protective agent against JNK-mediated cochlear cell death and against permanent hearing deficits after noise trauma.&lt;ref&gt;JK Coleman, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16839720 "AM-111 protects against permanent hearing loss from impulse noise trauma"], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant substance Ebselen was observed to reduce hearing loss in a study done in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;J Kil, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17030476 "Ebselen treatment reduces noise induced hearing loss via the mimicry and induction of glutathione peroxidase."], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It has been previously shown that noise trauma correlates with decreases in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, which has been linked to loss of the outer hair cells. GPx1, an isoform of GPx, is predominantly expressed in stria vascularis, cochlea, spiral ligament, organ of Corti, and spiral ganglion cells. The stria vascularis displayed significant decreases in GPx1 immunoreactivity and increased swelling following noise exposure in rats. There was also significant outer hair cell loss in the cochlea within five hours of noise exposure. Administration of Ebselen before and after the noise stimulus reduced stria vascularis swelling as well as cochlear outer hair cell loss. This implicates Ebselen as a supplement for GPx1 in the outer hair cell degradation mechanism of hearing loss. This treatment is currently in active clinical trials.
*A γ-secretase inhibitor of Notch signaling was shown to induce new hair cells and partially recover hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;Mitzutari Kunio, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312009531 "Notch Inhibition Induces Cochlear Hair Cell Regeneration and Recovery of Hearing after Acoustic Trauma."], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory hair cell loss is permanent damage due to the inability of these cells to regenerate. Therefore, deafness due to this pathology is viewed as irreversible. Hair cell development is mediated by Notch signaling, which exerts lateral inhibition onto hair cells. Notch signaling in supporting hair cells leads to prevention of differentiation in surrounding hair cells. After identifying a potent γ-secretase inhibitor selective for stimulating differentiation in inner ear stem cells, it was administered in acoustically injured mice. The animals who received the injury and treatment displayed an increased hair cell number and stimulated hearing recovery. This suggests that γ-secretase inhibition of Notch signaling can be a potential pharmacological therapy in approaching what was previously viewed as permeant deafness.

===Stem cell therapy===
*A fetal thymus graft, or rejuvenation of the recipient immunity by inoculation of young [[CD4+ T cells]], also prevents presbycusis as well as up-regulation of the interleukin 1 receptor type II gene ([[IL1R2]]) in [[CD4+ T cells]] and degeneration of the spiral ganglion in [[Samp1]] mice, a murine model of human senescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H Iwai |author2=M. Inaba |title= Fetal Thymus Graft Prevents Age-related Hearing Loss and up Regulation of the IL-1 Receptor Type II Gene in CD4(+) T Cells|journal= Journal of Neuroimmunology|year= 2012|pmid= 22652460|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2012.05.007|volume=250|issue=1–2|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology remains years or even decades away from human application.

==Popular culture==
{{See also|The Mosquito}}
Abilities of young people to hear high frequency tones inaudible to those over 25 or so has led to the development of technologies to disperse groups of young people around shops ([[The Mosquito]]), and development of a cell phone ringtone, [[Teen Buzz]], for students to use in school, that older people cannot hear. In September 2006 this technique was used to make a dance track called 'Buzzin'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/5382324.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Wales &amp;#124; South East Wales &amp;#124; Secret alarm becomes dance track |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track had two melodies, one that everyone could hear and one that only younger people could hear.
==Animals==
Many vertebrates such as fish, birds and amphibians do not suffer presbycusis in old age as they are able to regenerate their [[cochlea]]r sensory cells, whereas mammals including humans have genetically lost this ability.&lt;ref name="Rubel2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.heares.2012.12.014 |title=Review: A brief history of hair cell regeneration research and speculations on the future |year=2013 |last1=Rubel |first1=Edwin W.|last2=Furrer |first2=Stephanie A. |last3=Stone |first3=Jennifer S. |journal=Hearing Research |volume=297 |issue= |pages=42–51 |pmid=23321648 |pmc=3657556}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of laboratories worldwide are conducting comparative studies of birds and mammals that aim to find the differences in regenerative capacity, with a view to developing new treatments for human hearing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-41325339|title=Owls hold secret to ageless ears|author=Helen Briggs|work= BBC News|date=20 September 2017|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7325">'''Pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis''' is a disease caused by chronic poisoning found in humans and other animals caused by ingesting poisonous plants which contain the natural chemical compounds known as [[pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s.&lt;ref name=Merck&gt;''The Merck Veterinary Manual''.

Web.  15 November&lt;/ref&gt;  Pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis can result in damage to the liver, kidneys, heart, brain, smooth muscles, lungs, DNA, lesions all over the body, and could be a potential cause of cancer.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rizk&gt;Rizk, Abdel-Fattah M., ''Naturally Occurring Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids''.  Doah: CRC Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  Pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis is known by many other names such as "Pictow Disease" in Canada and "Winton Disease" in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Hirono&gt;Hirono, I.  ''Naturally Occurring Carcinogens of Plant Origin''.

==Plant types and causes==
[[File:Amsinckia intermedia 2003-03-04.jpg|thumb|Yellow tarweed (''[[Amsinckia intermedia]]''); a plant which causes pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis when eaten by animals.]]
Pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis is caused by the consumption of one or more of the 200 known plant species containing the toxic pyrrolizine alkaloids found all over the world today.&lt;ref name=Hirono/&gt;    Established as the most common source of this illness are plants such as  ragwort (''[[Senecio jacobaea]]''), woolly groundsels (''Senecio redellii'', ''[[Senecio longilobus]]''), rattleweed (''[[Crotalaria retusa]]''), and seeds of yellow tarweed (''[[Amsinckia intermedia]]'').&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt; There are 30 known pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are [[hepatotoxic]], meaning they cause injury to the liver.&lt;ref name=Rizk/&gt;  Although animals innately know to give these toxic plants a wide berth while grazing, in extreme drought conditions animals have been known to ingest them as a source of minimal protein.  Animals can also be poisoned if the toxic plant material is in pellets, or harvested with grain.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;&lt;ref name=Talcott&gt;Talcott P: Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Poisoning. In: Robinson NE (ed): ''Current Therapy in Equine Medicine'', 5th Edition. Philadelphia, W.B. Saunders Co., 2003, pp. 788-790&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequency and exposure==

===Humans===
Pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis poisoning in the United States has remained moderately rare among humans.  The most common reports are the outcome of the misuse of medicinal home remedies, or the alkaloids are present in food and drink substances such as milk and honey when the animal carriers were exposed to the toxins.  In other countries, mass human poisonings have occurred when cereal crops used were infected with seeds containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids.&lt;ref name=BBB/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOG&gt;World Health Organization, Environmental Health Criteria 80.  Geneva:  World Health Organization, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Culvenor&gt;Culvenor, C.C., Edgar J.A. Smith L.W., "Pubmed."  Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids in honey from Echium Plantagineum L.  USA.gov, 2009.  Web.  17 September&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magnuson&gt;Magnuson, Bernadene.  "ExtoxNet FAQs"  Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids.    EXTOXNET FAQ Team, 1997.  Web.  20 October&lt;/ref&gt;

Infants and young children are most likely to acquire pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis because of their intrinsic nature to put everything they find into their mouths.  However, anyone who consumes one of the mentioned toxic plants is susceptible to the disease.&lt;ref name=WHOG/&gt;

The typical case of pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis toxicity ends in liver damage that ranges from severe to moderate, as well as damage to other organs. The longevity of the disease is wide ranging from 2 weeks to 2 years subsequent to when the poison was ingested.  The patient's recovery results may be as diverse as the permanence.  Some have recovered as if they were never affected by pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis poisoning if the damage to the liver was not too severe, and others have died from it.&lt;ref name=BBB/&gt;

The severity of pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis depends on how much of the poisonous plant was consumed in a height, age, and weight to the amount of substance ingested ratio.  The only difference in the symptoms will be how prominent they are depending on the above ratio.  Symptoms include:&lt;ref name=Rizk/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBB/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/p/plant_poisoning_pyrrolizidine_alkaloids/intro.htm Plant poisoning - Pyrrolizidine alkaloids], wrongdiagnosis.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dull dragging ache in the right upper abdomen
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Liver problems
* Acute upper gastric pain
* Prominent dilated veins on the abdominal wall
* Fever
* Jaundice
* Pulmonary edema
* Pleural effusions
* Lung damage
* Lesions all over the body
* Hypertrophy of the right ventricle of the heart
* Damage to the kidneys

To stop the spread and severity of pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis the first step is to remove the poisonous plant from the source.  Once the plant has been removed, the alkaloids can be extracted with [[chloroform]].  However, [[ethyl acetate]] is a handy and less toxic substitute.&lt;ref name=Rizk/&gt;  Depending on the severity of the toxicity and how long the person has been exposed to the disease, there may be no means of treatment and fatality may occur.

==Prevention==

The only known technique of prevention is to avoid ingesting the poisonous alkaloids.  Some methods of control have been [[defoliation]] in areas in both Oregon and California.  Also mass relocation efforts of moths, flea beetles and seed flies have been made in hopes that they will eat the toxic plants and help control the population of the plants.  This manner of alkaloid control has been met with variable success.  Because sheep and goats have such a high immunity to the toxicity of the alkaloids they are commonly used to graze on the plants to control them.  However, this method has its risks unless sheep meant for early slaughter are used.  Before hay cutting in the spring is the optimal time frame for annual herbicide applications which have also enhanced the destruction of the alkaloids.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheeke&gt;Cheeke, P.R. Symposium on Pyrrolizidine (Senecio) Alkaloids: Toxicity, Metabolism, and Poisonous Plant Control Measures&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
During the 1970s, Dr. Mohan developed computer-aided systems for automated [[dosimetry]] and record-and-verify systems. Subsequently, in the 1980s and 1990s, he was a leader in researching newer methods of radiation treatments such as 3-D conformal [[radiation therapy]], intensity modulation radiation therapy, and in the 2000s, [[proton therapy]].&lt;ref name="astro1"/&gt; His research activities include intensity-modulated radiotherapy, [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo techniques]] and image-guided radiotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aapm.org/org/history/2003AwardsCeremonyProgram.asp#Mohan |title=AAPM 2003 Awards Ceremony |publisher=Aapm.org |date=2003-08-11 |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Mohan is the author or co-author of nearly 200 papers, book chapters and publications in proceedings of conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aapm.org/org/history/2003AwardsCeremonyProgram.asp |title=AAPM 2003 Awards Ceremony |publisher=Aapm.org |date=2003-08-11 |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been the principal investigator, co-PI or co-investigator on numerous grants from the National Cancer Institute and research projects sponsored by industry.

Dr. Mohan was the Chairman of the Department of Radiation Physics at [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center|The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]] and is currently a principal investigator at MD Anderson researching the optimization of proton therapy.

In 1983, Dr. Mohan was part of the team at the computer services department of [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]] which helped the F.B.I. track down one of the earliest groups of computer hackers, [[The 414s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismlab.usf.edu/isec/files/Computers_%20The%20414%20Gang%20Strikes%20Again%20--%20Printout%20--%20TIME.pdf |format=PDF |title=Computers: The 414 Gang Strikes Again |publisher=Ismlab.usf.edu |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
== Education ==
In 1969, Dr. Mohan received his PhD in physics from [[Duke University]].  Prior to that he received BS and MS degrees in physics from [[Panjab University, Chandigarh|Punjab University]]. Dr. Mohan was a 1965 recipient of a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Fellowship]].

==Definition of health outcomes==

Routine health outcomes measurement is the process of examining whether or not interventions are associated with change (for better or worse) in the patient's health status.  This change can be directly measured (e.g. by rating scales used by the clinician or patient) or assumed by the use of proxy measurement (e.g. a blood test result).  Interventions can be direct (e.g. medication) or indirect (e.g. change in the process of health care like integration care by different specialists).
Some definitions of health outcomes measurement stipulate that the population or group has to be defined (different outcomes are expected for different people &amp; conditions). A strong example is that of Australia’s New South Wales Health Department: health outcome is 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"change in the health of an individual, group of people or population which is attributable to an intervention or series of interventions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/NB92067 |title=The NSW Health Outcomes program |year=1992 |author1=Frommer, Michael |author2=Rubin, George |author3=Lyle, David |journal=New South Wales Public Health Bulletin |volume=3 |pages=135 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In its purest form, measurement of health outcomes implies identifying the context (diagnosis, demographics etc.), measuring health status before an intervention is carried out, measuring the intervention, measuring health status again and then plausibly relating the change to the intervention.

==Health outcomes measurement and evidence-based practice==

[[Evidence-based practice]] describes a healthcare system in which evidence from published studies, often mediated by [[systematic reviews]] or processed into [[medical guideline]]s is incorporated into clinical practice. The flow of information is one way; from research to practice. However many interventions by health systems and treatments by their staff have never been, or cannot easily be, subject to research study. Of the rest, quite a lot is from research that is graded as low quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guyatt GH, Oxman AD, Kunz R, Vist GE, Falck-Ytter Y, Schünemann HJ |title=What is "quality of evidence" and why is it important to clinicians? |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7651 |pages=995–8 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18456631 |pmc=2364804 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39490.551019.BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; All health staff intervene in their patients on the basis of both information from research evidence and from their own experience. The latter is personal, subjective and strongly influenced by stark instances which may not be representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malterud K |title=The art and science of clinical knowledge: evidence beyond measures and numbers |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9279 |pages=397–400 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11502338 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05548-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when information on these interventions and their outcomes are collected systematically it becomes "practice-based evidence"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horn SD, Gassaway J |title=Practice-based evidence study design for comparative effectiveness research |journal=[[Medical Care (journal)|Medical Care]] |volume=45 |issue=10 Supl 2 |pages=S50–7 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17909384 |doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e318070c07b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can complement that from academic research. To date, such initiatives have been largely confined to primary care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ryan JG |title=Practice-Based Research Networking for Growing the Evidence to Substantiate Primary Care Medicine |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=180–1 |date=1 March 2004|pmid=15083861 |pmc=1466650 |url=http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15083861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and rheumatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pincus T, Sokka T |title=Evidence-based practice and practice-based evidence |journal=Nature Clinical Practice Rheumatology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=114–5 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16932666 |doi=10.1038/ncprheum0131}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of practice-based evidence is found in the evaluation of a simple intervention like a medication. [[Efficacy]] is the degree with which it can improve patients in randomised controlled trials– the epitome of evidence-based practice. [[Effectiveness]] is the degree with which the same drug improves patients in the uncontrolled hurly-burly of everyday practice; data which are much more difficult to come by. Routine health outcomes measurement has the potential to provide such evidence.

The information required for practice-based evidence is of three sorts: context (e.g. [[case mix]]), intervention (treatment) and outcomes (change).&lt;ref&gt;Pawson R, Tilley N. Realistic Evaluation. London: Sage Publications Ltd; 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Some mental health services are developing a practice-based evidence culture with the routine measurement of clinical outcomes&lt;ref name="Callaly"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Callaly T, Hallebone EL |title=Introducing the routine use of outcomes measurement to mental health services |journal=Australian Health Review |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=43–50 |year=2001 |pmid=11357741 |doi=10.1071/AH010043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;[http://outcomesdatamart.mh.state.oh.us/Screen1/odmhFirstScreen.jsp Ohio Mental Health Datamart]&lt;/ref&gt; and creating [[behavioral health outcomes management]] programs.

==History of routine health outcomes measurement==

=== Florence Nightingale ===
An early example of a routine clinical outcomes system was set up by [[Florence Nightingale]] in the [[Crimean War]]. The outcome under study was death. The context was the season and the cause of death– wounds, infections and any other cause. The interventions were nursing and administrative. She arrived just before the barracks in Scutari were accepting the first soldiers wounded at the battle of Inkerman in November 1854, and mortality was already high. She was appalled at the disorganisation and standards of hygiene and set about cleaning and reorganisation. However, mortality continued to rise. It was only after the sewers were cleared and ventilation improved in March 1856 that mortality fell. On return to the UK she reflected on these data and produced new sorts of chart (she had trained in mathematics rather than "worsted work and practising quadrilles") to show that it was most likely that these excess deaths were caused by living conditions rather than, as she initially believed, poor nutrition. She also showed that soldiers in peacetime also had an excess mortality over other young men, presumably from the same causes. Her reputation was damaged, however, when she and William Farr, Registrar General, collaborated in producing a table which appeared to show a mortality in London hospitals of over 90% compared with less than 13% in Margate. They had made an elementary error in the denominator; the true rate for London hospitals was actually 9% for admitted patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iezzoni LI |title=100 apples divided by 15 red herrings: a cautionary tale from the mid-19th century on comparing hospital mortality rates |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=124 |issue=12 |pages=1079–85 |date=15 June 1996|pmid=8633823 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8633823 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-124-12-199606150-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was never too keen on hospital mortality figures as outcome measures anyway:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If the function of a hospital were to kill the sick, statistical comparisons of this nature would be admissible. As, however, its proper function is to restore the sick to health as speedily as possible, the elements which really give information as to whether this is done or not, are those which show the proportion of sick restored to health, and the average time which has been required for this object…"&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale F. Notes on Hospitals. 3rded. London: Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green; 1863&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here she presaged the next key figure in the development of routine outcomes measurement

=== Ernest Amory Codman ===
Codman was a Boston orthopaedic surgeon who developed the "end result idea". At its core was 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The common sense notion that every hospital should follow every patient it treats, long enough to determine whether or not the treatment has been successful, and then to inquire 'if not, why not?' with a view of preventing similar failures in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Codman EA. The Shoulder. Rupture of the supraspinatus tendon and other lesions in or about the subacromial bursa. Privately published 1934 Reprint 1965 Malabar, Florida: Kreiger;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He is said to have first articulated this idea to his gynaecologist colleague and Chicagoan Franklin H Martin, who later founded the American College of Surgeons, in a Hansom Cab journey from Frimley Park, Surrey, UK in the summer of 1910. He put this idea into practice in Massachusetts General Hospital.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Each patient who entered the operating room was provided with a 5-inch by 8-inch card on which the operating surgeon filled out the details of the case before and after surgery. This card was brought up 1 year later, the patient was examined, and the previous years' treatment was then evaluated based on the patient's condition. This system enabled the hospital and the public to evaluate the results of treatments and to provide comparisons among individual surgeons and different hospitals"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaska SC, Weinstein JN |title=Historical perspective. Ernest Amory Codman, 1869-1940. A pioneer of evidence-based medicine: the end result idea |journal=Spine |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=629–33 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9530796 |doi=10.1097/00007632-199803010-00019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He was able to demonstrate his own patients’ outcomes and those of some of his colleagues but unaccountably this system was not embraced by his colleagues. Frustrated by their resistance, he provoked an uproar at a public meeting and thus fell dramatically from favour in the hospital and at Harvard, where he held a teaching post, and he was only able to fully realize the idea in his own, struggling small private hospital&lt;ref&gt;Codman EA. A study in hospital efficiency. As demonstrated by the case report of the first five years of a private hospital. Published privately 1817. Reprinted 1996 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations Oakbrook Terrace, IL, USA:&lt;/ref&gt; although some colleagues continued with it at the larger hospitals. He died in 1940 disappointed that his dream of publicly available outcomes data was not even on the horizon, but hoped that posterity would vindicate him.

=== Avedis Donabedian ===
In a classic 1966 paper, [[Avedis Donabedian]], the renowned public health pioneer, described three distinct aspects of quality in health care: outcome, process and structure (in that order in the original paper).&lt;ref name="Donabedian"&gt;Donabedian A. Evaluating the quality of medical care. Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly 1966;44:166-206&lt;/ref&gt; He had misgivings about solely using outcomes as a measure of quality, but concluded that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Outcomes, by and large, remain the ultimate validation of the effectiveness and quality of medical care."&lt;ref name="Donabedian"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;He may have muddied the waters a bit when discussing patient satisfaction with treatment (usually regarded as a measure of process) as an outcome, but more importantly it has become apparent that his three-aspect model has been subverted into what is called the "structure-process-outcomes" model, a directional, putatively causal chain that he never originally described. This subversion has been the justification for repeated attempts to improve process and thus outcomes by reorganizing the structure of health care, wittily described by Oxman et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oxman AD, Sackett DL, Chalmers I, Prescott TE |title=A surrealistic mega-analysis of redisorganization theories |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=98 |issue=12 |pages=563–8 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16319441 |pmc=1299350 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.98.12.563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donabedian himself cautioned that outcomes measurement cannot distinguish efficacy from effectiveness: (outcomes may be poor because the right treatment is badly applied or the wrong treatment is carried out well), that outcomes measurement must always take into account context (factors other than the intervention may be very important in determining outcomes), and also that the most important outcomes may be the least easy to measure, so easily  measured but irrelevant outcomes are chosen (e.g. mortality instead of disability).

==Mortality as an outcome measure==
Perhaps because of instances of scandalously poor care (for example at the Bristol Royal Infirmary 1984-1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090811143745/http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/ |archivedate=2009-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) mortality data have become more and more openly available as a proxy for other health outcomes in hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk/mortalityintro.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and even for individual surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bridgewater B |title=Mortality data in adult cardiac surgery for named surgeons: retrospective examination of prospectively collected data on coronary artery surgery and aortic valve replacement |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7490 |pages=506–10 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15746131 |pmc=552809 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7490.506 |author2=Adult Cardiac Surgeons of North West England}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Florence Nightingale’s astringent judgement and Donabedian’s reservations retain their full force for most health services, where routine non-mortal health outcomes measurement remains the most appropriate method.

==Principles of routine health outcomes measurement==
#All three dimensions (context, intervention as well as outcomes) must be measured. It is not possible to understand outcomes data without all three of these.
#Different perspectives on outcomes need to be acknowledged. For instance, patients, carers and clinical staff may have different views of what outcomes are important, how you would measure them, and even which were desirable&lt;ref&gt;Long A, Jefferson J. The significance of outcomes within European health sector reforms: towards the development of an outcomes culture. International Journal of Public Administration, 1999;22(3):385-424&lt;/ref&gt;
#Prospective and repeated measurement of health status is superior to retrospective measurement of change such as Clinical Global Impressions.&lt;ref&gt;NIMH Early Clinical Drug Evaluation PRB. Clinical global impressions. In: Guy W, editor. ECDEU Assessment manual for psychopharmacology, revised. US Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service, Alcohol Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, NIMH Psychopharmacology Research Branch; 1976. p. 217-22&lt;/ref&gt; The latter relies on memory and may not be possible if the rater changes.
#The [[reliability (statistics)]] and [[validity (statistics)]] of any measure of health status must be known so that their impact on the assessment of health outcomes can be taken into account. In mental health services these values may be quite low, especially when carried out routinely by staff rather than by trained researchers, and when using short measures that are feasible in everyday practice.
#Data collected must be fed back to them to maximize data quality, reliability and validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Lusignan S, Stephens PN, Adal N, Majeed A |title=Does Feedback Improve the Quality of Computerized Medical Records in Primary Care? |journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=395–401 |year=2002 |pmid=12087120 |pmc=346626 |doi=10.1197/jamia.M1023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feedback should be of content (e.g. relationship of outcomes to context and interventions) and of process (data quality of all three dimensions)

==Current status of routine health outcomes measurement==
'''Why is routine health outcomes measurement so rare?''' One can find reports of routine health outcomes measurement in many medical specialties and in many countries. However, the vast majority of these reports are by or about enthusiasts who have set up essentially local systems, with little connection with other similar systems elsewhere, even down the street. In order to realise the full benefits of an outcomes measurement system we need large-scale implementation using standardised methods with data from high proportions of suitable healthcare episodes being trapped. In order to analyse change in health status (health outcomes) we also need data on context, as recommended by Donabedian&lt;ref name="Donabedian" /&gt; and others, and data on the interventions being used, all in a standardised manner. Such large-scale systems are only at present evident in the field of mental health services, and only well developed in two locations: Ohio&lt;ref name="Callaly" /&gt; and Australia,&lt;ref name="Ohio" /&gt; even though in both of these data on context and interventions are much less prominent than data on outcomes. The major challenge for health outcomes measurement is now the development of usable and discriminatory categories of interventions and treatments, especially in the field of mental health.

==Benefits of routine health outcomes measurement==
Aspirations include the following benefits

*Aggregated data
**Can form the basis of effectiveness data that complement efficacy data. This could show the actual benefits in everyday clinical practice of interventions previously tested by randomised clinical trials, or the benefits of interventions that have not been or cannot be tested in [[Randomized Controlled Trial]]s and [[systematic review]]s
**Can identify hazardous interventions that are only apparent in large datasets
**Can be used to show differences between clinical services with similar [[case mix]] and thus stimulate search for testable hypotheses that might explain these differences and lead to improvements in treatment or management
**Can be used to compare the outcomes of treatment and care from different perspectives– e.g. clinical staff and patient
*Data about individual patients
**Can be used to track changes during treatment over periods of time too long to be amenable to memory by an individual patient or clinician, and especially when more than one clinician or team is involved
**Can, especially when different perspectives are available, be used in discussions between patients, clinicians and carers about progress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stewart M |title=Service user and significant other versions of the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales |journal=Australasian Psychiatry |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=156–63 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19296275 |doi=10.1080/10398560802596116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Can be used to speed up and crispen clinical meetings&lt;ref&gt;Stewart M. Making the HoNOS(CA) clinically useful: A strategy for making the HoNOS, HoNOSCA, and HoNOS65+ useful to the clinical team. 2nd Australasian Mental Health Outcomes Conference; 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks of routine health outcomes measurement==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
#If attempts are made to purchase or commission health services using outcomes data, bias may be introduced that will negate the benefits, especially in the service provider produces the outcomes measurement. See [[Goodhart's law|Goodhart's Law]]
#Inadequate attention may be paid to the analysis of context data, such as case mix, leading to dubious conclusions.
#If data are not fed back to clinicians participating then data quality (and quantity) is likely to fall below the thresholds necessary for reasonable interpretation.
#If only a small proportion of episodes of health care have completed outcomes data, then these data may not be representative of all episodes, although the threshold for this effect will vary from service to service, measure to measure.
#Some risks of bias, widely foretold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bilsker D, Goldner EM |title=Routine outcome measurement by mental health-care providers: is it worth doing? |journal=Lancet |volume=360 |issue=9346 |pages=1689–90 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12457807 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11610-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; are proving to be insubstantial but need guarding against

==Practical issues in routine health outcomes measurement==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Experience suggests that the following factors are necessary for routine health outcomes measurement
#an electronic patient record system with easy extraction from data warehouse. Entry of outcomes data can then become part of the everyday entry of clinical data. Without this, aggregate data analysis and feedback is very difficult indeed.
#resources and staff time set aside for training and receiving feedback
#resources and personnel to extract, analyse and proactively present outcomes, casemix and, where available, intervention data to clinical teams
#regular reports on data quality as part of a performance management process by senior managers can supplement, but not replace, feedback

The '''Safe to Sleep''' campaign, formerly known as the '''Back to Sleep''' campaign,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichd.nih.gov/SIDS/Pages/sids.aspx Safe to Sleep Public Education Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; is an initiative backed by the US [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) at the US [[National Institutes of Health]] to encourage parents to have their [[infants]] sleep on their backs ([[supine position]]) to reduce the risk of [[sudden infant death syndrome]], or SIDS. Since "Safe to Sleep" was launched in 1994, the incidence of SIDS has declined by more than 50%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichd.nih.gov/sids/ NICHD Back to Sleep Campaign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1992, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) issued the recommendation that babies sleep on their backs or sides to reduce the risk of SIDS (a statement that was later revised in 1996 to say that only the back was safest).  NICHD launched the "Back to Sleep" campaign in 1994 to spread the message.

The campaign was successful in that it significantly reduced the percentage of babies sleeping on their stomachs ([[prone position]]). It was found, however, that a significant portion of [[African-American]] babies were still sleeping on their stomachs; in 1999, an African-American baby was 2.2 times more likely to die of SIDS than a white baby. Thus, then [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] of [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]] [[Donna Shalala]] and [[Tipper Gore]] refocused the "Back to Sleep" campaign on minority babies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/1999pres/991026.html 1999.10.26:"Back to Sleep" Campaign Seeks to Reduce Incidence of SIDS in African American Populations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign===
In 1985 Davies reported that in Hong Kong, where the common Chinese habit was for [[supine position|supine infant sleep position]] (face up), SIDS was a rare problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davies DP |title=Cot death in Hong Kong: a rare problem? |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8468 |pages=1346–9 |date=December 1985 |pmid=2866397 |url= http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(85)92637-6 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(85)92637-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the Netherlands started a campaign advising parents to place their newborn infants to sleep on their backs (supine position) instead of their stomachs (prone position).&lt;ref name=pmc1446204&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Högberg U |author2=Bergström E |title=Suffocated prone: the iatrogenic tragedy of SIDS |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=527–31 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10754964 |pmc=1446204 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10754964 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.4.527}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by infant supine sleep position campaigns in the United Kingdom (as "Back to Sleep"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/26/back-to-sleep-sudden-infant-death-syndrome-cot-death-peter-fleming |title=Back to sleep: the doctor who helped stem a cot death epidemic |work=The Guardian |date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), New Zealand, and Australia in 1991, the U.S. and Sweden in 1992, and Canada in 1993.&lt;ref name=pmc1446204/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rusen ID |author2=Liu S |author3=Sauve R |author4=Joseph KS |author5=Kramer MS |title=Sudden infant death syndrome in Canada: trends in rates and risk factors, 1985–1998 |journal=Chronic Dis Can |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15298482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and it is theorized that some infants have a brain-stem defect which increases their risk of being unable to arouse from SWS (also called deep sleep) and therefore have an increased risk of SIDS due to their decreased ability to arouse from SWS.&lt;ref name=Kattwinkel06/&gt;

Summary Data 1992. http://dccwww.bumc.bu.edu/ChimeNisp/NISP_Data.asp updated: 09/04/07&lt;/ref&gt; was conducted to determine the usual position in which U.S. mothers placed their babies to sleep: lateral (side), prone (stomach), supine (back), other, or no usual position. According to the 1992 NISP survey, 13.0% of U.S. infants were positioned in the supine position for sleep.&lt;ref name="dccwww.bumc.bu.edu"/&gt; According to the 2006 NISP survey 75.7% of infants were positioned in the supine position to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;National Infant Sleep Position Household Survey.

==Biography==
Karwah's father was a doctor.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; She met her future husband, James Harris, at a mutual friend's in 2013 after both had recently ended previous relationships.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; They began dating shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

===Ebola work===
[[File:Salome Karwah Time cover.jpg|thumb|200px|Time magazine's 2014 "Person of the Year" with Karwah on the cover.]]
One year after Karwah and Harris began dating, the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic]] struck Liberia, as well as neighboring [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]], in 2014.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Her family was among the first to become ill with ebola during the summer of 2014.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Her father was the first to die from ebola, which ultimately killed both her parents and seven other relatives.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Karwah, her sister, Josephine, her mother, and Harris were all soon stricken with ebola as well.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Salome, Harris and Josephine Karwah were all placed in a Doctors Without Borders medical unit in [[Monrovia]] with other ebola patients to be treated.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Salome Karwah's priority was to care for her sister, Josephine Manly, who was pregnant at the time she contracted ebola.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Salome cared for Josephine, who nearly died, by changing her clothes and cleaning fluids that contained ebola. She withheld the news of their mother's death from Josephine, fearing that it would have a detrimental effect on her health.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

By September 2014, both the Karwah sisters had recovered, determined free of the disease, and discharged from the hospital.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Salome Karwah was released from the ebola unit on August 28, 2014.&lt;ref name=npr2/&gt; Karwah's boyfriend, James Harris, also recovered and was released from the medical unit a few days later.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; The staff at Doctors Without Borders (MSF) had noticed that Karwah and Harris had both shown an ability to care for other ebola victims, regardless of the risk to their own health, while they had been patients.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Shortly after their discharge from the hospital, MSF hired them to serve as mental health counselors in their ebola units.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian2/&gt; Salome Karwah returned to the unit, this time as a counselor and nurse, one month after her release.&lt;ref name=npr2/&gt; As survivors, she and Harris had developed a natural immunity to that particular strain of ebola.&lt;ref name=npr2/&gt;

Karwah, who was interviewed on her work by ''[[NPR]]'' in 2014, recalled that "It was not hard to come back [to the Ebola treatment center]. Of course I lost my two parents here...but if I can help someone survive, I will be very happy."&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr2&gt;{{cite news |first=Rebecca|last=Hersher |title=Producer's Notebook: Coming home from Monrovia to confusion and fear |url=http://kunr.org/post/producers-notebook-coming-home-monrovia-confusion-and-fear#stream/0 |work=[[NPR]] |publisher= |date=2014-10-25 |accessdate=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained at the unit until the end of the ebola epidemic.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr2/&gt;

In October 2014, Karwah wrote a guest piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'' noting that helping others with ebola brought meaning to her life.&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Salome|last=Karwah |title=I survived Ebola for a reason – to help others recover |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/12/ebola-survivor-now-i-am-helping-others-fight-the-disease |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= |date=2014-10-11 |accessdate=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same essay, Karwah reiterated that "if someone has Ebola, it isn’t good to stigmatize them, because you don’t know who is next in line to contract the virus."&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

''[[Time magazine]]'' named Salome Karwah as its co-[[Person of the Year]], alongside several other "ebola fighters".&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt; She appeared on the worldwide cover of ''Time'' in December 2014 just months after being released from the hospital.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt;

Harris and Karwah became engaged. They were married to January 2016 while Karwah was pregnant with their third child, who was born a few months later.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; In the summer of 2016, Karwah became pregnant with their fourth child, which they agreed would be their last.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; The couple, who were religious but already had three small children, thought of having an abortion, but chose to keep the baby.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

===Passing from complications of child birth===
Salome Karwah went through a difficult pregnancy. In February 2017, Karwah underwent a [[caesarean section]] though she was suffering from [[high blood pressure]] at the time.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Although she had high blood pressure, Karwah was discharged from [[Eternal Love Winning Africa Hospital]] (ELWA) on the outskirts of Monrovia several days after undergoing the cesarean.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; She and Harris returned to their home to care for their new infant son, Jeremiah Solomon Karwah, and their other children.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Karwah continued to feel unwell, exhibit spikes in blood pressure, and confided to family members that staff at ELWA hospital had neglected her complications.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Just hours after arriving home, Karwah collapsed and began foaming from her mouth.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

Her husband rushed her back to ELWA hospital on the night of February 19, 2017.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; However, the hospital's doctor who specialized in treating ebola survivors was not on duty at the time.  Another doctor refused to treat Karwah, who remained in the car for "three hours"  while suffering from convulsions and seizures.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian2/&gt; Harris eventually went to the emergency room himself and brought out a wheelchair to bring his wife into the hospital.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; According to Harris, the doctor and nurses on duty still refused to see or touch Karwah, telling him that he would have to take her to another hospital. Harris gave his account to NPR in an interview, saying ""[The doctor] was checking [[Facebook]]...I had to rush into the emergency room myself to get a wheelchair, but I was struggling to take her from the car to put her in it.

He managed to contact an [[epidemiologist]] named Dr. Mosoka Fallah, who arrived at ELWA three hours later and finally admitted Karwah to the hospital.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Despite his efforts, Salome Karwah, who had survived ebola, died from complications of child birth on February 21, 2017, at the age of 28, just four days after giving birth.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian2/&gt; She was survived by her husband and their four children, including the youngest, Jeremiah Solomon Karwah.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

The mistaken belief that ebola survivors can still transmit ebola remains widespread across the country, including among medical staff, which may have contributed to Karwah's death.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; According to the ''[[Associated Press]]'', the country's chief medical officer, Dr. Francis Kateh, echoed this falsehood when he told reporters that "the hospital knew she had Ebola and they operated on her, which put them at more risk."&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;

Tributes came in from around the world, including her former employer, Médecins Sans Frontières, who wrote in a statement, "Salome's own experience of Ebola gave her incredible empathy for the patients that she worked so hard to care for...Our many staff who remember working with her speak of her strength and compassion, but also of her smile...She made a huge contribution to MSF's work at the height of the outbreak in [[Monrovia]]."&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; Ella Watson-Stryker, a MDF health promoter and colleague of Karwah, told ''Time'' magazine of the shock of her death, "To survive Ebola and then die in the larger yet silent epidemic of health system failure … I have no words."&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt;

'''School social work in Hungary''' aims to provide services to children and their families to ensure that they have the opportunity to complete their education. Aid is particularly focused on impoverished areas with higher proportions of at-risk children and youth.

==History==
The first steps toward school social work in Hungary were taken after [[World War I]], when school nurses (referred to as green cross nurses by Emőke Bányai) started working at schools in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Bányai, E. (2000). Az iskolai szociális munka és lehetőségei az ezredfordulón Magyarországon. In: Háló, August, pp.&amp;nbsp;3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to that of a present-day [[social work]]er, they pursued individual case work and aided families in the field and at school. The nurses had a college or university degree in education and belonged to the staff of the school, with the scope of their duties shaped according to its needs. The nurses offered family care services mainly for families residing in the slums of Budapest in order to prevent academic failure and school dropout.&lt;ref&gt;Pik, K. (1994). A ferencvárosi Gyermekjóléti Szolgálatról. Család, gyermek ifjúság, No. 5, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following [[World War II]], the Hungarian political elite declared that education was the primary requirement for child protection. The first significant change in child protection took place in 1964, when teachers were appointed child protection workers in the kindergartens and schools of Budapest. Elements similar to those in the work of school social workers appeared in the scope of activities of family care workers employed by educational advisory services, which were launched in 1967. In 1975, child protection supervisors were appointed to advise child protection workers at schools. Such child protection supervision functioned until 1985. 
 
Employees of family-care centres established in the mid-1980s developed a committed social worker identity. They made regular contacts with local schools, kindergartens, and offered various services to the children, parents and teachers. As a form of youth protection, a so-called afternoon-care system was functioning in the 1970s and 1980s with elements resembling present-day social work. 
 
Social and economic changes taking place in the late 1980s and the consequent increase in the [[Unemployment|rate of unemployment]], declassing and dramatic impoverishment of certain [[Group (sociology)|social groups]], changes in [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] and values, and the related emergence and extension of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behaviour]] challenged schools. It became apparent that these sudden and intensely rising problems were preventing schools from fulfilling their basic tasks, and could not be addressed by traditional educational tools. Child protection workers, whose positions were filled by teachers, did not have the qualifications or the time necessary for the management of complicated cases. Finally, schools stated their claim to employ professionals who provide personal social services for pupils, parents and staff members.&lt;ref&gt;Fiszter, E. (1994). Hetedik féléves terepgyakorlat a ferencvárosi gyermekjóléti szolgálatnál. (manuscript)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolutions of the 1990s==
To resolve the problems which had arisen, three basic concepts were developed by the early 1990s:  the appointment of dedicated full- and part-time child protection workers, specialized schools for underprivileged areas with large numbers of at-risk children, and teams of social workers based in local child care centres.

===Appointing teachers to the duty of child protection===

====Employment of child protection workers====
The management of some schools sought to enhanced child protection service by partially or wholly freeing the workdays of teachers willing and suited to the task of assisting troubled children and their families. Teachers so appointed usually did not have proper qualifications nor were they sufficiently equipped (with an interview room, telephone and supervision). As they were expected to act according to the interests of the school which employed them, it was difficult for them to advocate for the children and their families against the school administration. Colleagues often overwhelmed them with feelings of frustration and unreasonable demands, and they were frequently called to serve as substitute teachers on their days off.&lt;ref&gt;Bányai, E. (2006). Az oktatási, nevelési intézmények gyermekvédelmi szolgáltatásainak jellemzői, a szociális szolgáltatások kapcsolódási lehetőségei, fejlesztési hangsúlyai a gyermekszegénység csökkentése érdekében. Gyerekesély Füzetek&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment of independent child protection workers====
To improve upon the above model, child protection workers were separated from schools in the early 1990s and employed by the Educational Service Cabinet, in districts XV and XVI of Budapest. Their assignment and supervision was made by  the educational department of the local government. This ended the conflict of loyalties but it continued to use educational means and an educational approach. The model was criticized as it continued to employ people who were teachers by training, rather than social workers; and as a government employee the [[school social worker]] could not stand against the [[state school]]s administration. 
 
Despite these problems, the employment of child protection workers remained standard practice at schools.

===Internal school social work===
Alternative schools established in the early 1990s sought to provide education satisfying the individual needs of children coming from underprivileged social backgrounds and being unable to manage in a traditional school. In these schools, educational and social work overlap; the educational concept requires the staff to utilize social expertise in educational work. Success of the model is presumably due to the staff's awareness in handling problems that pupils face outside school and a supporting attitude toward pupils. Despite facing some of the same issues of conflict of interest, such schools continue to employ school social workers even when traditional schools ceased to offer services. Both the need among the pupils and the academic mission of the alternative schools legitimized the role of the school social worker.

===External school social work===
Recognizing the important role that schools played in child and youth protection work, the first school social work teams in Hungary were formed in the early 1990s (Gedeon 1996). Social services provided by external experts were introduced in several schools at the same time. On the basis of such work launched in autumn 1991 from a local child care centre to a school in District VII of Budapest, a team was set up with the help of the local government in 1992. In District VIII, it was also a child care centre that posted a school social worker to a local school. In 1993, the Child Protection Group initiated services in District XI. At the outset, the group belonged to the Educational Service Centre, and later was converted into a [[child welfare]] centre (Bányai 2009, Molnár 2009, Mihály 1991). These were distinguished from the independent child protection workers under the educational department of the local government. 
 
Perhaps the best-known experimental project carrying out "external" school social work was the "Ferencváros" Network of School Social Workers. The network was started in summer 1992. Later it was renamed "Ferencváros" White Raven Child Welfare Service. In District IX of Budapest, the local government promoted the establishment of the child welfare service in 1992. The concept was developed by Dr Mihaly and her colleagues. The main principle on which they stood was: "Child protection must be removed from schools, but it must not be handed over to the system of authorities. A child protection system independent form authorities has to be created" (Dr Mihaly, 2008). It is a characteristic of the model that it considers the community surrounding the school, including the network of supporting organizations. They aspired to create and run a region-based child protection system. The social worker did not want to take up the child protection worker's duties, but focused on the role of a mediator, co-ordinator, and "catalyst". Working with pupils was reduced, since social workers were on duty at schools only once a week. The range of activities covered group work, organizing club sessions, summer camping and playrooms, and offering [[Homework|homework help]] – instead of doing [[Case management (mental health)|case management]] for individuals. Furthermore, they worked with families and were entitled to offer them financial and in-kind assistance. A structure of services different from that of the traditional school social work evolved due to the lack of modern child protection services and institutions providing customized care for clients in Hungary. In particular, services were offered to families to prevent children from being removed from their birth parents, as there was no basic child welfare services separate from the operation of authorities. "Ferencváros" Child Welfare Service attempted to fill this gap.

This work led to the Child Welfare Act that came into effect in November 1997. After the law came into effect, the "Ferencváros" Child Welfare Service underwent a transformation: child welfare activities began to outweigh school social work, which had previously been of primary importance. The Child Welfare Act created new conditions for the operation of the other networks of school social workers and child welfare services as well, easing the burden on local governments. As a consequence, classical school social work became overshadowed by the corrective tasks of child welfare. As since 1996, Annex 1 of Act LXII of 1996 have been obliging schools to employ a part-time child protection worker, schools should have increased capability of support for students. However, in practice schools continued to give this work to teachers without adequate qualifications.

==Post-2000==
Since 2004, school social work has been expanding, with increasing employment. Child welfare services also focus more on school social work. Since the national register of school social workers is currently being prepared,{{when|date=November 2018}} exact data is unavailable.{{update inline|date=November 2018}}

At present, there are three main approaches to school social work in Hungary:
#Internal school social work or the so-called traditional model
#External school social work or the Ferencváros model
#The Pécs model
Employing teachers as child protection workers is no longer a viable option following the introduction of [[Academic degree|university degree]] programmes in social work and social education, which provided qualified professionals.

===Traditional model===
In the internal or traditional model, the school social worker's employer is the administrator of the school. The school social worker offers various social services while present at the school, and is familiar with its functioning. The social worker may form a team with a school doctor or nurse, but generally does not have supervision or team case management available. This model is applied mainly by schools maintained by {{abbr|NGOs|non-government organizations}} (e.g.: Burattino Általános - és Szakképző Iskola, Forrás Szakiskola, Gandhi Gimnázium, Világ Világossága Alapítvány), but a few such state schools also exist (e.g.: Radnóti Szakközépiskola in the city of Pécs, Éltes Mátyás Iskola, Magyarmecskei Általános Iskola). The first school social work programmes in Hungary followed this model.

===External model===
In the external or Ferencváros model, school social work is delivered to the by external suppliers through networks. Each colleague assists 4–5 schools (or kindergartens), with weekly service available for a relatively short time to each school. Group and community work overshadows individual case management. Qualified professionals are aided by supervision and team case management. External school social work is implemented mainly by state-run child welfare services (e.g.: II. kerületi Gyermekjóléti Központ, Újbudai Humán Szolgáltató Központ Gyermekjóléti Szolgálata, Sopron, Szombathely, Nyíregyháza), but there are some NGO-run services as well (e.g. Periféria Egyesület).

Programmes based on the external model were set back by the Child Protection Act, since the act promoted the corrective child protection activities of the services. However, new emphasis was placed on school social work after the 2003 consensus conference of child welfare services, which found only 14 percent of services carried out school social work in 2005. Strengths of the model are the employment of professionals with adequate qualifications and the support of networks. Critics of the model blame the departure from the conceptional framework of the traditional model (Bányai 2006), and the so-called "schedule of attendance", which means that a school social worker spends only a few hours a week at a particular school.

===The Pécs model===
{{main|The Pécs Model of School Social Work}}
The Pécs model, which was formed in 2006, combines the advantages of the previous two models. The school social worker assists one school per day with social services and attends weekly team case management meetings. A network of professionals offers support in supervision and individual counselling, case management, standardized paperwork and registration of clients, etc. The school social worker is employed by an NGO independent from both the school and the child welfare system, and is thus less biased by organizational hierarchy.

Conceptually, the framework uses modern ecological models applied to child-oriented school social work. The school social worker applies a preventive approach to find solutions to pupils' problems, using individual casework, social group work and community work, considering both the environment and the complexity of the personality, and seeks solutions with the help of a multidisciplinary team (Máté 2008). This model is applied by the Network of School Social Workers of INDIT Közalapítvány at six schools. The model co-operates closely with youth supporting programs outside schools. Moreover, INDIT Közalapítván itself runs youth-supporting programmes such as Youth Office "Alternative" (the first youth-supporting programme in Hungary located in a [[shopping mall]]), Street Social Work Service and the Party Service (a [[harm reduction]] programme for party-goers). Integration of the above programmes into one organization makes it possible for INDIT to reach school-dropouts and truants.

==Education and professional associations==
Standardized training and active associations are of crucial importance to forming a cohesive profession. It is standard practice for school social workers in Hungary to have a university or college degree in social work or social education. These two professions, rooted in different cultures [social work from the United States and social education from Germany], have developed quite similarly and are nearly identical in scope.

There are some regional variances depending on the type of degree programmes available in the area. At Bárczi Gusztáv Gyógypedagógiai Főiskola, psychoeducators for specialized child protection work have been trained since 1973. From 1985 several degree programmes for general child protection have been accredited. ELTE ([[University of Budapest|Eötvös Loránd University]] of Budapest) launched a postgraduate degree programme in [[social policy]] in 1985. Hungarian colleges and universities started undergraduate programmes in general social work in 1989 and in social education in 1990. Requirements of qualification of undergraduate programmes in [[social studies]] (social policy, social work, social education) were issued in 1996 (Government Decree on Requirements of Qualification of Undergraduate University Degree Programmes in Social Studies 6/1996 [January 18], Annex 2) (Bucsy 2005). Courses on school social work were introduced to the above programmes. Dr. István Budai at Vitéz János Tanítóképző Főiskola (Vitéz János Teacher Training College) in 1991 and Emőke Bányai at ELTE in 1993 were the first to teach this subject. According to the results of a study carried out in 2009, school social work is currently taught at eleven university departments of social work and at six departments of social education. School social work is part of [[undergraduate degree]] programmes at most faculties training social professionals, which demonstrates the importance of the subject. However, there have yet to be any graduate-level programs in Hungary, though [[Kodolányi János University of Applied Sciences]] plans to launch a one-year master programme in school social work. The first Hungarian school social work textbook was published in 1993 by the Vitéz János Tanítóképző Főiskola (Vitéz János Teacher Training College of Esztergom) and the Óvóképző Főiskola (Preschool Teacher Training College of Hajdúböszörmény) and was edited by István Budai. The book was published under the title ''Papers on child welfare I. – School social work''.

The Hungarian School Social Worker Association was founded at a conference organized by Kodolányi János University of Applied Sciences on November 30, 2007, in Székesfehérvár. Objectives of the association are:
*to knit Hungarian school social professionals together
*to serve as a scientific and professional basis for school social workers and as an organization representing their interests
*to improve the life quality of children and youth living in Hungary by means of spreading school social work across the country. 
The association intends to participate in the codification of regulations controlling school social work. As part of the above policy formulation and [[Law|law making]] process, the association is ready to contribute to defining the conditions and protocol for school social work and to the improvement of finances.

In [[United States healthcare]], '''service excellence''' is the ability of the [[Health professional|provider]] to consistently meet and manage patient expectations.  Clinical [[excellence]] must be the priority for any health care system.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Brian|title=Service Excellence in healthcare|journal=Quality in Health|year=1992|volume=1|pages=S42-S44|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the best [[healthcare]] systems combine professional (clinical) service excellence with outstanding personal service.  Although health care in the United States is touted as the “world’s largest [[service industry]],” the [[Service quality|quality]] of the service is infrequently discussed in [[medical literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kenargy|first=John|author2=Donald Berwick |author3=Miles Shore |title=Service Quality in Health Care|journal=JAMA|year=1999|volume=281|issue=7|pages=661–665|doi=10.1001/jama.281.7.661}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, many questions regarding service excellence in healthcare largely remain unanswered.

Service excellence in healthcare is difficult to define and better described as a “I know when I receive it, or perhaps more frequently, I know when I have not.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Robert|title=Towards a better understanding of service excellence|journal=Managing Service Quality|year=2004|volume=14|issue=2/3|pages=129–133|doi=10.1108/09604520410528554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Robert Johnson ([[Institute of Customer Service]]), service excellence has four key elements: delivering the promise of quality healthcare, providing a personal touch, doing a more than adequate job and resolving problems well.

In order to achieve these elements, healthcare institutions, in particular, must be concerned with reducing the drivers of dissatisfaction, and providing exceptional healthcare.  According to the federal [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ), exceptional healthcare is defined as “doing the right thing, at the right time, for the right person, and having the best quality result [outcome].”&lt;ref name=Michelli&gt;{{cite book|last=Michelli|first=Joseph|title=Prescription of Excellence|year=2011|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|pages=45–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the past decade, healthcare has been receiving increased attention not only because of unsustainable costs, but also because of an emphasis on quality of care improvement.&lt;ref name=Crow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crow|first=R|author2=H gage |author3=S Hampson |author4=J Hart |author5=A Kimber |title=The measurement of satisfaction with healthcare: a systematic review of the literature|journal=Health Technology Assessment|year=2002|volume=6|issue=32|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Institutions are now attempting to measure and compare quality outcomes, as well as report them in both the consumer press and peer reviews literature to the delight of some and the consternation of others.&lt;ref name="Thom Mayer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Thom|author2=Robert Cates |title=Service Excellence in Health Care|journal=JAMA|date=6 October 1999|volume=282|issue=13|pages=1281–1283|doi=10.1001/jama.282.13.1281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Managers of healthcare delivery systems endeavor to provide the highest possible care achievable.&lt;ref name=MOeller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moeller|first=Johannes|title=The EFQM Excellence Model. German experiences with the EFQM approach in health care|journal=International Journal of Quality in Health Care|year=2001|volume=13|issue=1|pages=45–49|doi=10.1093/intqhc/13.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inherent to this goal is the need for evaluation of the quality of the health services provided.  Measuring [[patient satisfaction]] is an indirect measure of quality, and can pose some difficult challenges to individuals attempting to assess quality.&lt;ref name="Michelli"/&gt; One difficulty is that in healthcare it is difficult to assess a patient’s outcome after receiving care compared to the outcome they would have had with a different provider.  The most important problem is establishing a definition of “satisfaction.” Because the definition of satisfaction can vary from patient to patient, many institutions have created surveys asking patients to rate the quality of the services they have received.  This method of evaluation is extremely subjective, and many factors unrelated to the quality of care (the topic of interest) can affect the results. For example, a review of 37 studies addressing different methods of satisfaction evaluation found that phone interview increased the response rate by 30%.&lt;ref name=Crow /&gt;  Additionally, mailing surveys resulted in more criticism and less satisfaction.  Some speculate that this is due to the anonymity and a lack of pressure for socially acceptable responses.  Mailing surveys also results in more variability in response than a phone survey with patients either feeling really satisfied or dissatisfied.  Even the timing of administration of the survey can have a major effect on the results. The literature of the studies in this area suggests further research needs to be conducted on this topic. Crow et al. also point out that if patients are not constrained by outside factors, the selection of which healthcare facility to receive care in is an objective measurement of a their satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Crow /&gt;  When satisfaction is low, a service failure has occurred.

=== Service Failure ===
Every patient has a basic assumption that the healthcare services they seek, and pay for, will meet their expectations. If these expectations are met then they are satisfied. Moreover, if these expectations are exceeded the patient is delighted, and much more likely to recommend the healthcare institution to friends and family members. However, when these expectations are not met the patient is much more likely to share this disappointment with more than just their immediate circle.
Service failures are inevitable, but anticipating service failures can significantly affect patient [[customer satisfaction|satisfaction]].&lt;ref name=Frottler&gt;{{cite book|last=Frottler|first=M|title=R Ford, C Heaton|year=2009|publisher=Health Administration Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=359–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A measure of a well-managed organization is whether they work hard to plan for, prevent, identify, and correct any and all service failures. These steps are key because if a patient experiences a service failure early in their encounters with a healthcare institutions, it’s likely to weigh more heavily on their decisions to return to the healthcare institution.  More important, however, is whether the service failure is corrected because patients are not very tolerant of poor [[service recovery]].&lt;ref name="Frottler"/&gt;  Meaning, if a patient experiences the same service failure twice it is likely this patient will be lost to the institution forever.  A study conducted by Bowen and Johnson suggests that this is true because patients are more angered by the belief that the system in which the service failure occurred remains unchanged than their dissatisfaction with the service itself.&lt;ref name="Frottler"/&gt;   In other words, patients are put off by a healthcare organization that makes no efforts to correct its mistakes.
Learning the sources of service failures is not only important to the customer, but it is also important to the bottom line.

=== Sources of Service Failure ===
Every point in the healthcare experience has a potential to result in a service failure. For example, if a health service takes longer than a patient expects, or if a service does have the outcome the patient was anticipating, a service failure has occurred. Even the setting or environment in which the care is being provided can affect a service failure. Perhaps surprisingly, patients themselves can contribute to service failures by failing to read signage or correctly completing required forms.  Finally, rude, untrained, or poorly trained staff members can bring about a service failure. Thus, the service product, setting, delivery system, and staff must be carefully managed to minimize the likelihood of a service failure.&lt;ref name="Frottler"/&gt;  If a healthcare institution does not make changes in response to a service failure, it fails twice:
* once because it was unable to meet the basic expectations of the patient, and 
* the second time because it did not resolve the circumstances that lead to the service failure.&lt;ref name="Frottler"/&gt;  This can be difficult to accomplish because it is the patient who defines the quality of the experience, and by association the nature and severity of the service failure. However, regardless of the cause of the failure it can lead to Patient Defection.

=== Patient Defection ===
Decreasing service failures and focusing on service excellence can decrease patient defection (leaving one healthcare institution for another). Having a solid service recovery plan when service failures do occur is key to ensuing an excellent healthcare experience for every patient.  Service failures resulting in patient defection do not only derail the goal of service excellence, but they affect the bottom line.&lt;ref name="Frottler"/&gt;   A Study performed by Reichheld and Sasser found that reducing patient defection by 5% can raise profits between 25%-85%.&lt;ref name="Frottler"/&gt;

== Programs focusing on Service Excellence in Healthcare ==
Often there is a gap between what an organization wants to do and what the employees actually do, so many times many institutions set up infrastructure to focus on service excellence.&lt;ref name=Crotts&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crotts|first=John C|author2=Duncan Dickson |author3=Robert Ford |title=Aligning organizational processes with mission: The case of service excellence|journal=Academy of Management Executive|year=2005|volume=19|issue=3|pages=54–68|doi=10.5465/ame.2005.18733215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an effort to provide patients with the highest possible quality of clinical care, the [[National Institute of Clinical Excellence|National institute of clinical excellence (NICE)]] was created.&lt;ref name=Rawlins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawlins|first=Micheal|title=In pursuit of quality: The National Institute for Clinical Excellence|journal=Lancet|date=27 March 1999|volume=353|pages=1079–1082|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(99)02381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This program attempts to provide health professionals in the [[National Health Service|United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS)]] with the skills they need to provide high-quality cost-effective clinical care by focusing on Service Excellence. These efforts are not unique to the [[United Kingdom]]. In Prescription for Excellence, [[Joseph Michelli]] gives a detailed review of the steps [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Cente]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r has taken to provide service excellence in healthcare.&lt;ref name="Michelli"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Service excellence in healthcare has been found to have unintended adverse effects: 
* Higher patient satisfaction has been found to be associated with higher overall health care and prescription drug expenditures, and increased mortality.&lt;ref name=Fenton2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenton|first=Joshua J. |title=The Cost of Satisfaction: A National Study of Patient Satisfaction, Health Care Utilization, Expenditures, and Mortality|journal=Arch Intern Med|date=12 March 2012|volume=152|pages=405–411|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.1662}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Focus on patient satisfaction metrics has redistributed resources from medical care to patient amenities, such as "valet parking, live music, custom-order room-service meals, and flat-screen televisions.&lt;ref name=Robbins2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Alexandra |title=The Problem With Satisfied Patients|journal=The Atlantic|date=17 April 2015|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/the-problem-with-satisfied-patients/390684/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Severe [[achondroplasia]] with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans''' (SADDAN), is a very rare genetic disorder. This disorder is one that affects bone growth and is characterized by skeletal, brain, and skin abnormalities.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Those affected by the disorder are severely short in height and commonly possess shorter arms and legs.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In addition, the bones of the legs are often bowed and the affected have smaller chests with shorter rib bones, along with curved collarbones.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Other symptoms of the disorder include broad fingers and extra folds of skin on the arms and legs.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Developmentally, many individuals who suffer from the disorder show a higher level in delays and disability. Seizures are also common due to structural abnormalities of the brain.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Those affected may also suffer with [[apnea]], the slowing or loss of breath for short periods of time.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

Many of the features of SADDAN are similar to those seen in other skeletal disorders, specifically [[achondroplasia]] and [[thanatophoric dysplasia]].
Achondroplasia is a form of short-limbed [[dwarfism]]. This type of dwarfism is caused by the inability of the cartilage of the skeleton to ossify and turn to bone.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; [[Acanthosis nigricans]] is a skin condition in which areas of the skin is of a dark and velvety discoloration, often seen in the body folds and creases such as the armpits, groin, and neck.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Within those affected by SADDAN, acanthosis nigricans develops early on, usually in infancy or early childhood.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

==Genetic Inheritance ==

The mutated gene responsible for the disorder is the [[Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3|FGFR3]] gene, more specifically; a Lys650Met missense mutation of the FGFR3 gene is what causes SADDAN.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; This gene codes for the instructions of a protein that is integral in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Mutations of this gene cause the protein to be overly active, causing many characteristics of this disorder.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

SADDAN is an [[Autosome|autosomal]] dominant genetic disorder.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Autosomal means that the gene responsible for the mutation and disorder is found on a non-sex chromosome and that either the mother or father can pass on the gene, while dominant means that only one copy of the gene is required for the individual to have the disorder.

Fortunately the disorder is very rare and has only been described in a few number of cases worldwide.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; While the disorder can be genetically inherited, no instances of inheritance have been recorded as of yet. Rather, of the few cases documented, the individual affected by the disorder is affected as a product of a random mutation, also called a de novo mutation, of the FGFR3 gene only, not by inheritance of the mutated gene.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

==Diagnosis and Management==

Medical diagnosis is required. Clinical tests can be performed, as well as molecular genetic testing. The available tests include:

Sequence analysis of the entire coding region&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;
* Severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN) - Sanger Sequencing: Diagnosis, Mutation Confirmation, Pre-symptomatic, Risk Assessment, Screening 
* Craniosynostosis: Diagnosis
* Invitae FGFR3-Related Disorders Test: Pre-symptomatic, Diagnosis, Therapeutic management

Mutation scanning of select exons&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;
* Skeletal Dysplasia Panel: Diagnosis, Prognostic

Sequence analysis of select exons&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;
* Severe Achondroplasia with Developmental Delay and Acanthosis Nigricans (SADDAN, FGFR3): Diagnosis, Mutation Confirmation, Risk Assessment
* Severe Achondroplasia, Developmental Delay, Acanthosis Nigricans: Diagnosis, Mutation Confirmation

Deletion/duplication analysis&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;
* Invitae FGFR3-Related Disorders Test: Pre-symptomatic, Diagnosis, Therapeutic management

Life with SADDAN is manageable, although therapy, surgery, and lifelong doctor surveillance may be required.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

A '''spermatozoon''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|p|ɜr|m|æ|t|ə|ˈ|z|oʊ|ə|n}}, alternate spelling '''spermatozoön'''; plural '''spermatozoa'''; from {{lang-grc|σπέρμα}} "seed" and {{lang-grc|ζῷον}} "living being") is a motile [[sperm]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]], or moving form of the [[ploidy|haploid]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] that is the male [[gamete]]. A spermatozoon [[Fertilization|joins]] an [[ovum]] to form a [[zygote]]. (A zygote is a single cell, with a complete set of [[chromosome]]s, that normally develops into an [[embryo]].)
 
Sperm cells contribute approximately half of the nuclear [[gene|genetic information]] to the [[diploid]] offspring (excluding, in most cases, [[mitochondrial DNA]]). In mammals, the [[sex]] of the offspring is determined by the sperm cell: a spermatozoon bearing a [[X chromosome]] will lead to a [[female]] (XX) offspring, while one bearing a [[Y chromosome]] will lead to a [[male]] (XY) offspring. Sperm cells were first observed in [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]'s laboratory in 1677.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/genetics_reproduction/timeline.html|title=Timeline: Assisted reproduction and birth control|accessdate=2006-04-06 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mammalian spermatozoon structure, function, and size==

===Humans===
The human sperm cell is the reproductive cell in males and will only survive in warm environments; once it leaves the male body the sperm's survival likelihood is reduced and it may die, thereby decreasing the total [[sperm quality]]. Sperm cells come in two types, "female" and "male". Sperm cells that give rise to female (XX) offspring after fertilization differ in that they carry an X-chromosome, while sperm cells that give rise to male (XY) offspring carry a Y-chromosome.

A human sperm cell consists of a flat, disc shaped head 5.1&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] by 3.1&amp;nbsp;µm and a tail 50&amp;nbsp;µm long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=D.J.|title=Human sperm accumulation near surfaces: a simulation study|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|year=2009|volume=621|page=295|doi=10.1017/S0022112008004953|url=http://eprints.maths.ox.ac.uk/860/1/human_sperm.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2012|bibcode=2009JFM...621..289S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tail [[Eukaryotic flagellum|flagellate]]s, which propels the sperm cell (at about 1–3&amp;nbsp;mm/minute in humans) by whipping in an elliptical cone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ishijima | first1 = Sumio | last2 = Oshio | first2 = Shigeru | last3 = Mohri | first3 = Hideo | year = 1986 | title = ''Flagellar movement of human spermatozoa'' | url = | journal = Gamete Research | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 185–197 | doi = 10.1002/mrd.1120130302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sperm have an olfactory  [[Olfactory_receptor#Expression|guidance mechanism]], and after reaching the Fallopian tubes, must undergo a period of capacitation before penetration of the ovum.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Giojalas.[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laura_Giojalas/publication/7173327_Sperm_guidance_in_mammals_-_An_unpaved_road_to_the_egg/links/00b7d51b71d7b54d05000000/Sperm-guidance-in-mammals-An-unpaved-road-to-the-egg.pdf?origin=publication_detail Sperm guidance in mammals]  ''Nature Reviews: molecular cell biology''.

'''Head:''' It has a compact nucleus with only chromatic substance and is surrounded by only a thin rim of cytoplasm. Above the nucleus lies a cap-like structure called the ''acrosome'', formed by modification of the Golgi body, which secretes the enzyme '''spermlysin ''(hyaluronidase, corona-penetrating enzyme, zona eyesin, or aerosin.)''''' On the surface of the head lies a decapacitating substance which is removed before fertilisation.

'''Neck:''' It is the smallest part (0.03 ×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m), and has a proximal and distal centriole. The proximal centriole enters into the egg during fertilisation and starts the first cleavage division of the egg, which has no centriole. The distal centriole gives rise to the axial filament which forms the tail and has a (9+2) arrangement. A transitory membrane called the ''Manchette'' lies in the middle piece.

'''Middle piece:''' It has 10–14 spirals of mitochondria surrounding the axial filament in the cytoplasm. It provides motility, and hence is called the powerhouse of the sperm.  It also has a ring centriole (annulus) with unknown function.

'''Tail:''' It is the longest part (50×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m), having an axial filament surrounded by cytoplasm and plasma membrane, but at the posterior end the axial filament is naked.

[[Semen]] has an alkaline nature and the spermatozoa do not reach full motility (hypermotility) until they reach the [[vagina]], where the alkaline pH is neutralized by acidic vaginal fluids.  This gradual process takes 20–30 minutes. During this period, [[fibrinogen]] from the [[seminal vesicle]]s forms a clot, securing and protecting the sperm.

===DNA damage and repair===
DNA damages present in spermatozoa in the period after [[meiosis]] but before [[Human fertilization|fertilization]] may be repaired in the fertilized egg, but if not repaired, can have serious deleterious effects on fertility and the developing embryo.

===Avoidance of immune system response===

[[Glycoprotein]] molecules on the surface of ejaculated sperm cells are recognized by all human female immune systems, and interpreted as a signal that the cell should not be rejected. The female immune system might otherwise attack sperm in the [[reproductive tract]]. The specific glycoproteins coating sperm cells are also utilized by some cancerous and bacterial cells, some parasitic worms, and HIV-infected white blood cells, thereby avoiding an immune response from the [[Host (biology)|host organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7143889.stm|title=Sperm clue to 'disease immunity'|date=2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[blood-testis barrier]], maintained by the tight junctions between the [[Sertoli cell]]s of the seminiferous tubules, prevents communication between the forming spermatozoa in the testis and the blood vessels (and immune cells circulating within them) within the [[Interstitial fluid|interstitial space]]. This prevents them from eliciting an immune response. The blood-testis barrier is also important in preventing toxic substances from disrupting spermatogenesis.

===Animals===
Fertilization relies on spermatozoa for most sexually reproductive animals.

Some species of [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] produce the largest known spermatozoon found in nature.&lt;ref name="Pitnick1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitnick|first1=S|last2=Spicer|first2=GS|last3=Markow|first3=TA|title=How long is a giant sperm?|journal=Nature|date=11 May 1995|volume=375|issue=6527|pages=109|doi=10.1038/375109a0|pmid=7753164|bibcode=1995Natur.375Q.109P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitnick|first1=S|last2=Markow|first2=TA|title=Large-male advantages associated with costs of sperm production in Drosophila hydei, a species with giant sperm.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=27 September 1994|volume=91|issue=20|pages=9277–81|pmid=7937755|doi=10.1073/pnas.91.20.9277|pmc=44795|bibcode=1994PNAS...91.9277P}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' produces sperm that can be up to 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=K.W.|editor1-last=Demerec|editor1-first=M.|title=Biology of Drosophila|date=1950|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|pages=1–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its relative ''[[Drosophila bifurca]]'' produces the largest known spermatozoon, measuring over 58&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref name=Pitnick1995 /&gt; In Drosophila melanogaster, the entire sperm, tail included, gets incorporated into the [[oocyte]] [[cytoplasm]], however, for Drosophila bifurca only a small portion of the tail enters the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pitnick | first1 = S. | last2 = Spicer | first2 = G.

The wood mouse ''[[Apodemus sylvaticus]]'' possesses spermatozoa with falciform morphology. Another characteristic which makes these gametocytes unique is the presence of an apical hook on the sperm head. This hook is used to attach to the hooks or to the flagella of other spermatozoa. Aggregation is caused by these attachments and mobile trains result. These trains provide improved motility in the female reproductive tract and are a means by which fertilization is promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = H | last2 = Dvoráková| first2 = K | last3 = Jenkins| first3 = N| last4 = Breed| first4 = W| year = 2002 | title = Exceptional sperm cooperation in Wood Mouse | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/114/1/moorhd1.pdf| journal = Nature | volume = 418 | issue = | pages = 174–177 | doi=10.1038/nature00832 | pmid=12110888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The postmeiotic phase of mouse spermatogenesis is very sensitive to environmental [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] agents, because as male germ cells form mature spermatozoa they progressively lose the ability to repair DNA damage.&lt;ref name="pmid18282746"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchetti F, Wyrobek AJ |title=DNA repair decline during mouse spermiogenesis results in the accumulation of heritable DNA damage |journal=DNA Repair |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=572–81 |year=2008 |pmid=18282746 |doi=10.1016/j.dnarep.2007.12.011 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irradiation of male mice during late spermatogenesis can induce damage that persists for at least 7 days in the fertilizing spermatozoa, and disruption of maternal DNA double-strand break repair pathways increases spermatozoa-derived chromosomal aberrations.&lt;ref name="pmid17978187"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchetti F, Essers J, Kanaar R, Wyrobek AJ |title=Disruption of maternal DNA repair increases sperm-derived chromosomal aberrations |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=104 |issue=45 |pages=17725–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17978187 |pmc=2077046 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0705257104 |url=|bibcode=2007PNAS..10417725M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Treatment of male mice with [[melphalan]], a bifunctional alkylating agent frequently employed in chemotherapy, induces DNA lesions during meiosis that may persist in an unrepaired state as germ cells progress though DNA repair-competent phases of spermatogenic development.&lt;ref name="pmid25567288"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchetti F, Bishop J, Gingerich J, Wyrobek AJ |title=Meiotic interstrand DNA damage escapes paternal repair and causes chromosomal aberrations in the zygote by maternal misrepair |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=5 |issue= |pages=7689 |year=2015 |pmid=25567288 |pmc=4286742 |doi=10.1038/srep07689 |url=|bibcode=2015NatSR...5E7689M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such unrepaired DNA damages in spermatozoa, after fertilization, can lead to offspring with various abnormalities.

[[Sea urchin]]s such as ''[[Arbacia punctulata]]'' are ideal organisms to use in sperm research, they spawn large numbers of sperm into the sea, making them well-suited as [[model organism]]s for experiments.

===Plants, algae and fungi===
The [[gametophyte]]s of [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s and some [[gymnosperm]]s produce motile [[sperm]] cells, contrary to [[pollen]] grains employed in most gymnosperms and all [[angiosperm]]s. This renders sexual reproduction in the absence of [[water]] impossible, since water is a necessary medium for sperm and egg to meet. Algae and lower plant sperm cells are often multi-flagellated (see image) and thus morphologically different from animal spermatozoa.

Some algae and fungi produce non-motile sperm cells, called spermatia. In higher plants and some algae and fungi, fertilization involves the migration of the sperm nucleus through a fertilization tube (e.g. [[pollen tube]] in higher plants) to reach the egg cell.

==Spermatozoa production in mammals==
{{Main|Spermatogenesis}}
Spermatozoa are produced in the [[seminiferous tubule]]s of the [[testes]] in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called [[spermatogonia]] divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. During [[copulation]] the [[cloaca]] or [[vagina]] gets [[insemination|inseminat]]ed, and then the spermatozoa move through [[chemotaxis]] to the ovum inside a [[Fallopian tube]] or the [[uterus]].

==Spermatozoa activation==
{{main|Acrosome reaction}}
[[Image:Acrosome reaction diagram en.svg|thumb|440px|left|Acrosome reaction on a [[sea urchin]] cell]]
Approaching the egg cell is a rather complex, multistep process of [[chemotaxis]] guided by different chemical substances/stimuli on individual levels of phylogeny. One of the most significant, common signaling characters of the event is that a prototype of professional chemotaxis receptors, [[formyl peptide receptor]] (60,000 receptor/cell) as well as the activator ability of its ligand formyl Met-Leu-Phe have been demonstrated in the surface membrane even in the case of human sperms.&lt;ref name=Gnessi1986&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Gnessi L, Fabbri A, Silvestroni L, Moretti C, Fraioli F, Pert CB, Isidori A | year = 1986 | title = Evidence for the presence of specific receptors for N-formyl chemotactic peptides on human spermatozoa.| journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism| volume = 63| pages = 841–6| pmid =3018025 |doi = 10.1210/jcem-63-4-841| url = | issue = 4 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Mammalian sperm cells become even more active when they approach an egg cell in a process called '''sperm activation'''. Sperm activation has been shown to be caused by [[calcium]] [[ionophores]] ''[[in vitro]]'', [[progesterone]] released by nearby [[cumulus cells]] and binding to [[ZP3]] of the [[zona pellucida]].  The [[cumulus cells]] are embedded in a gel-like substance made primarily of hyaluronic acid, and developed in the ovary with the egg and support it as it grows.

The initial change is called "hyperactivation", which causes a change in spermatozoa motility. They swim faster and their tail movements become more forceful and erratic.

A recent discovery links hyperactivation to a sudden influx of calcium ion into the tails.  The whip-like tail (flagellum) of the sperm is studded with [[ion channel]]s formed by proteins called [[CatSper]].  These channels are selective, allowing only calcium ions to pass.  The opening of CatSper channels is responsible for the influx of calcium.  The sudden rise in calcium levels causes the flagellum to form deeper bends, propelling the sperm more forcefully through the viscous environment. Sperm hyperactivity is necessary for breaking through two physical barriers that protect the egg from fertilization.

The second process in sperm activation is the [[acrosome reaction]]. This involves releasing the contents of the acrosome, which disperse, and the exposure of enzymes attached to the inner acrosomal membrane of the sperm.  This occurs after the sperm first meets the egg.  This lock-and-key type mechanism is species-specific and prevents the sperm and egg of different species from fusing.  There is some evidence that this binding is what triggers the [[acrosome]] to release the enzymes that allow the sperm to fuse with the egg.

ZP3, one of the proteins that make up the zona pellucida, then binds to a partner molecule on the sperm.  Enzymes on the inner acrosomal membrane digest the zona pellucida.  After the sperm penetrates the zona pellucida, part of the sperm's cell membrane then [[fertilization|fuses]] with the egg cell's membrane, and the contents of the head diffuse into the egg.

Upon penetration, the oocyte is said to have become [[Ovum activation|activated]]. It undergoes its secondary meiotic division, and the two haploid nuclei (paternal and maternal) fuse to form a [[zygote]]. In order to prevent [[polyspermy]] and minimise the possibility of producing a [[Triploidy|triploid]] zygote, several changes to the egg's zona pellucida renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg.

==Artificial storage==
Spermatozoa can be stored in diluents such as the ''Illini Variable Temperature'' (IVT) diluent, which have been reported to be able to preserve high fertility of spermatozoa for over seven days.&lt;ref name=Watson1993&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = P. F. | title = The potential impact of sperm encapsulation technology on the importance of timing of artificial insemination: A perspective in the light of published work | journal = Reproduction, Fertility and Development | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 691–9 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1071/RD9930691 | pmid=9627729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IVT diluent is composed of several salts, sugars and antibacterial agents and gassed with [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=Watson1993/&gt;

[[Semen cryopreservation]] can be used for far longer storage durations. For human spermatozoa, the longest reported successful storage with this method is 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planer.com/company/news/older-news-stories/335-child-born-after-21-year-semen-storage-using-planer-controlled-rate-freezer-.html Planer NEWS and Press Releases &gt; Child born after 21 year semen storage using Planer controlled rate freezer] 14/10/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spire St Anthony's Hospital''' is a private [[hospital]] in [[North Cheam]], formerly in the county of [[Surrey]], now in the [[London Borough of Sutton]]. The hospital is part of the [[Spire Healthcare]] group, the second largest provider of private healthcare in the United Kingdom. It was formerly owned and operated by the [[Daughters of the Cross]] of Liege, a [[Roman Catholic]] religious order. It is located on the junction between the [[A24 road|A24]] and Gander Green Lane.&lt;ref name="scts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scts.org/patients/hospitals/centre.aspx?id=17&amp;name=st_anthonys_hospital|title=St Anthony's Hospital: London Road NORTH CHEAM SM3 9DW|publisher=Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain &amp; Ireland|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
St Anthony's was founded in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanthonys.org.uk/about-st-anthonys|title=About St. Anthony's |publisher=St. Anthony's Hospital|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its location, once the site of North Cheam House, was purchased by the Daughters of the Cross for £4,625. By 1914 the Daughters of the Cross had replaced North Cheam House, erecting a building of three storeys and 163-foot frontage.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanthonys.org.uk/about-st-anthonys/the-history-of-st-anthonys|title=The History of St. Anthony's|publisher=St. Anthony's Hospital|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital operated a 'pay-by-your-means' policy until 1948, when the [[National Health Service]] was formed, causing St Anthony's to begin accepting public patients with funding from the NHS. In the early 1970s, St. Anthony's NHS contract was withdrawn and the hospital reverted to private status.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Responding to this change in status, it developed a speciality for [[cardiac surgery]]&lt;ref name="scts"/&gt; and moved to a smaller purpose-built facility opened by [[Miles Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk]] in October 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/stanthonyscheam.html|title=St Anthony's Hospital|publisher=Lost Hospitals of London|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the Daughters of the Cross formed St. Raphael's Hospice,&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; a registered charity providing specialist medical and nursing care for those with cancer and other serious illnesses and support for the families of the afflicted.&lt;ref name="straphael's"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straphaelshospice.org.uk/|title=St Raphael's Hospice, Sutton, Merton: nursing care for patients with cancer or a serious illnesses|publisher=St. Raphael's Hospice|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, a decline in the membership of the Daughters of the Cross, coupled with the advanced age of many of its members, led the order to seek to divest itself of responsibility for the hospital and hospice.&lt;ref name=LocalGuardFeb2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/topstories/9509636.Nuns_step_down_from_running_hospital_after_100_years/r/ |title=Nuns step down from running St Anthony's Hospital and St Raphael's Hospice |date= 2 February 2012 |first=Sophia |last=Sleigh |work=Your Local Guardian |publisher=Newsquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; After obtaining a management consultancy's advice,&lt;ref name=LocalGuardFeb2012/&gt; they decided to try to sell the hospital but retain ownership of the hospice.

In June 2013 they appealed to [[Holy See|Vatican]] officials to prevent the sale, and [[Paul Burstow]], the member of parliament for Sutton and Cheam, said he would seek to have the [[Foreign Office]] direct an embassy official to bring the issue to the Vatican's attention.&lt;ref name="vatican"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/10500045.Fight_for_St_Raphael_s_future_escalated_to_the_Vatican/|title=Fight for St. Raphael's future escalated to the Vatican| work=Sutton Guardian|first=Sophia |last=Sleigh| publisher=[[Newsquest]]|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, Burstow presented a [[:wikt:petition|petition]] to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], signed by over 7,000 people, requesting government help in blocking the sale. Opponents of the sale hoped for formation of a new Catholic charity to take over the hospital and hospice.&lt;ref name=WimbledonGuardNv2013/&gt; In March 2014, it was announced that they were to be sold to Spire Healthcare.&lt;ref name="spire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/11115900.St_Anthony_s_Hospital_sold_by_nuns_to_private_company/?ref=mr |title=St Anthony's Hospital sold by nuns to private company (From Sutton Guardian) |publisher=Suttonguardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility==
Spire St Anthony's is a 92-bed private hospital. It provides routine and complex [[surgery]] and has an 8-bed [[intensive care]] unit.&lt;ref name=RCNPub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rcnpublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.7748/ns2013.08.27.49.6.s4 |title=Hospital campaigners hope pontiff will block sale|journal=Nursing Standard |date=7 August 2013 |number=49 |volume= 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanthonys.org.uk/ |title=St. Anthony's Hospital website|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spire St Anthony’s offers a wide range of treatments from diagnostic imaging to major surgery covering a range of specialities including orthopaedics, neurosurgery, paediatric day cases, cardiology and cardiac surgery. They have continually invested in development projects to ensure a high standard of accommodation and facilities including six state of the art integrated theatres suites, incorporating three [[laminar flow]] and one hybrid theatre. They have also invested in a dedicated physiotherapy suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/15673989.Spire_St_Anthony___s_Hospital_launch_new_sports_clinic/|title=Spire St Anthony’s Hospital launch new sports clinic|date=21 November 2017|publisher=Sutton Guardian|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The associated St. Raphael's Hospice is operated as a [[charitable organization|charity]]; it employs 53 nurses.&lt;ref name="RCNPub" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2568">'''Streff syndrome''' is a [[visual perception|vision]] condition primarily exhibited by children under periods of visual or [[emotional stress]]. 
==Presentation==
Frequently patients will have reduced [[stereopsis]], large accommodative lag on dynamic [[retinoscopy]], and a reduced visual field (tubular or spiral field). Streff Syndrome was first described in 1962 by an [[optometrist]], Dr. John Streff as Non-malingering syndrome. In 1962, Dr. Streff and Dr. Richard Apell expanded the concept to add early adaptive syndrome as a precursor to Streff syndrome. Dr. Streff believed the visual changes were induced by stress from reading. There is dispute on the taxonomy of functional [[vision defect]]s. Some research indicates that Streff syndrome may be caused by a dysfunction in the [[magnocellular pathway]] of the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s.&lt;ref name="Nimesh"&gt;Nimesh P.  The use of frequency doubling technology to determine magnocellular pathway deficiencies. Journal of Behavioral Optometry, Volume 15. Number 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; These cells are only 10% of the retinal nerve cells and register [[motion detection]]. 
[http://www.optometry.umsl.edu/ce/apellstreff.html Early Adaptive Syndrome]
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}
==Treatment==
Most optometrists agree that Streff syndrome is a generalized reduction in visual performance that is not caused by structural damage. It is a disease involving vision distress primarily of the accommodation system. Hans Selye described stress, distress and eustress. It is most common in girls ages 8 to 14. Hand held reading material is often positioned excessively close. Reading aloud shows signs of elevated pitch and stumbling over common words. History of homework avoidance and falling class performance are often present. If the patient is directed to read aloud and +.50 lenses are then used, there is usually a dramatic improvement as observed by patient and parent. Abnormal results on color vision or visual field testing is not uncommon. Visual field often presents as constricted 'tubular' at multiple test distances. The poor visual performance is understood as distress, and treatments are usually to provide the patient with low powered [[reading glasses]]. The "relaxing" nature of reading glasses is believed to reduce the near vision stress and allow normal function. The emotional effects of chronic near vision stress are also reduced.
The "non-Malingering" name is a refutation that the patient is malingering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21402">'''Symptom targeted intervention''' (STI) is a clinical program being used in medical settings to help patients who struggle with symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]] or [[Compliance (medicine)|adherence]] to treatment plans but who are not interested in receiving outpatient [[mental health]] treatment. STI is an individualized therapeutic model and clinical program that teaches patients brief, effective ways to cope with difficult thoughts, feelings, and behaviors using evidence-based interventions. Its individualized engagement process employs techniques from [[Solution focused brief therapy|solution-focused therapy]], using a [[Carl Rogers|Rogerian]], patient-centered philosophy. This engagement process ensures that even challenging, at-risk, and non-adherent patients are able to participate.

[[Social worker]]s and other [[mental health professional|mental health practitioner]]s and medical professionals use STI to assist patients with a number of specific concerns, from [[Sleep disorder|sleep]] and [[Psychological stress|stress]] to [[pain management]], relationships and mood management. STI’s coping tools are [[cognitive-behavioral|cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[mindfulness]] interventions that have been condensed and modified to make them user friendly and effective in brief sessions. After meeting with the clinician, the patient takes charge, performing interventions at home through assignments that extend and reinforce learning.

Using STI, the clinician helps the patient identify the most problematic symptom of the depression (such as depressed mood, [[insomnia]], anxiety, [[rumination (psychology)|rumination]], [[irritability]], [[negative thinking]], [[social isolation]]), then together the clinician and patient address that symptom using STI’s evidence-based selection of brief [[cognitive therapy|cognitive]], [[behavioral therapy|behavioral]], and [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] techniques. The emphasis is on keeping interactions brief since mental health treatment in the [[primary care]] setting is typically time limited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2008.04.001 |title=Psychological interventions for major depression in primary care: A meta-analytic review of randomized controlled trials |year=2008 |last1=Bortolotti |first1=Biancamaria |last2=Menchetti |first2=Marco |last3=Bellini |first3=Francesca |last4=Montaguti |first4=Milena Barbara |last5=Berardi |first5=Domenico |journal=General Hospital Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=293–302 |pmid=18585531}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although the [[Collaborative Care]] and [[Integrated care|Integrated Care]] models provides hope for improved and expanded mental health services in the primary care setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.289.23.3145 |title=Educational and Organizational Interventions to Improve the Management of Depression in Primary Care: A Systematic Review |year=2003 |last1=Gilbody |first1=S. |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=23 |pages=3145–51 |pmid=12813120 |last2=Whitty |first2=P |last3=Grimshaw |first3=J |last4=Thomas |first4=R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As patients learn better coping skills, they become more engaged with their treatment and more [[Compliance (medicine)|adherent]] to doctors’ recommendations.

STI also gives [[social worker]]s ways to uncover their clinical strengths and tools to continue to work with resistant patients. With STI training, clinicians learn a nuanced approach to all patients, even those who resist help, since often those are the individuals who need help most. After learning STI, clinicians report that they are more likely to approach rather than avoid difficult patient situations.

==Origins==
[[File:Melissa McCool.png|thumb|Melissa McCool, creator of STI]]
STI was created in 2009 by [[LCSW|licensed clinical social worker (LCSW)]] [[Melissa McCool]] to give clinicians a toolkit for helping depressed patients who cannot or will not seek [[outpatient]] [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17168058 |year=2006 |last1=Roberts |first1=J |last2=Johnstone |first2=S |title=Screening and treating depression: Patient preferences and implications for social workers |volume=20 |issue=13 |pages=43, 47–9 |journal=Nephrology News &amp; Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCool originally developed STI for patients with [[chronic kidney disease|end-stage renal disease (ESRD)]]. Patients with ESRD and other chronic diseases often suffer from depression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ki.2008.222 |title=Depression and end-stage renal disease: A therapeutic challenge |year=2008 |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Fredric O |last2=Wuerth |first2=Diane |last3=Troidle |first3=Laura K |last4=Finkelstein |first4=Susan H |journal=Kidney International |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=843–5 |pmid=18794813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it often goes undiagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00310-0 |title=Depression in patients with chronic renal disease |year=2002 |last1=Kimmel |first1=Paul L |journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=951–6 |pmid=12377308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that at least 25% of [[dialysis]] patients have clinical depression and at least 35% have symptoms that put them at risk for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2215/CJN.00030505 |title=Temporal Relation among Depression Symptoms, Cardiovascular Disease Events, and Mortality in End-Stage Renal Disease: Contribution of Reverse Causality |year=2006 |last1=Boulware |first1=L.

New York: Springer Publishing Company. {{ISBN|978-0-8261-1942-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual premise for STI is based on [[systems psychology|systems theory]], which considers a system as a set of interacting and independent parts. If depression is a system consisting of various symptoms, when one of the symptoms improves, the entire trajectory of the depressive episode is transformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.66.6.939 |title=Dynamic systems theory as a paradigm for the study of change in psychotherapy: An application to cognitive therapy for depression |year=1998 |last1=Hayes |first1=Adele M. |last2=Strauss |first2=Jennifer L. |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=939–47 |pmid=9874907}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, STI is related to [[Murray Bowen|Bowen’s]] [[systemic therapy|systemic theory]] and its interactional dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dallos |first1=R |last2=Draper |first2=R |year=2010 |title= [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6427.2007.00371_2.x/abstract An introduction to family therapy: systemic theory and practice] |page=34 |publisher=Open University Press |isbn=978-0-335-23801-9|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6427.2007.00371_2.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using STI, the patient and clinician focus on one element, or symptom, helping the patient avoid feeling overwhelmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0005-7967(01)00098-5 |title=Rumination and social problem-solving in depression |year=2002 |last1=Watkins |first1=Ed |last2=Baracaia |first2=Simona |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1179–89 |pmid=12375726}}&lt;/ref&gt; by multiple problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291707002206 |title=Experimental evidence for a motivational origin of cognitive impairment in major depression |year=2007 |last1=Scheurich |first1=A. |last2=Fellgiebel |first2=A. |last3=Schermuly |first3=I. |last4=Bauer |first4=S. |last5=Wölfges |first5=R. |last6=Müller |first6=M. J. |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=38 |issue=2 |pmid=18005498 |pages=237–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel process is also in effect: Clinicians may be similarly overwhelmed by attempting to tackle multiple symptoms in their depressed patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Formica |first1=Michael J. |year=2009 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/enlightened-living/200901/the-me-in-you-parallel-process-in-psychotherapy |title=The me in you: parallel process in psychotherapy |work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Also central to STI is the cognitive triangle, which illustrates how one’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected and dependent upon one another. If a behavior changes, thoughts and feelings change; if a thought changes, behaviors and feelings change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beck |first1=JS |year=1995 |title= [http://www.beckinstitute.org/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-books Cognitive therapy: Basics and beyond] |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-0-89862-847-0}}{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of treatments for anxiety and depression in dialysis patients cited STI as an economical way to alleviate depression using brief, in-clinic sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Feroze Usama |author2=Martin David |author3=Kalantar-Zadeh Kamyar |author4=Kim Jun Chul |author5=Reina-Patton Astrid |author6=Kopple Joel D | year = 2012 | title = Anxiety and depression in maintenance dialysis patients: Preliminary data of a cross-sectional study and brief literature review | url = http://www.jrnjournal.org/article/S1051-2276%2811%2900199-3/abstract | journal = Journal of Renal Nutrition | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 207–10 | doi = 10.1053/j.jrn.2011.10.009 |pmid=22200444 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review that considered measures of quality of life in patients with ESRD noted that STI’s techniques are promising and productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naik Nimish |author2=Hess Rachel |author3=Unruh Mark | year = 2012 | title = Measurement of health-related quality of life in the care of patients with ESRD: Isn't this the metric that matters? | journal = Seminars in Dialysis | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 439–44 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-139X.2012.01110.x |pmid=22809006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; STI was included in a 2013 review of best practices for effective screening and managing depression in dialysis patients.&lt;ref&gt;Erdley, Shiloh D. (2013) [http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations_sp2/33 "Problem-solving therapy for depressed older hemodialysis patients: A pilot randomized trial".] ''Doctorate in Social Work (DSW) Dissertations'' Paper 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 article about ways that social workers can ease chronically ill patients’ burdens and effectively address their emotional challenges, Joseph R. Merighi, PhD, MSW, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Social Work, describes STI as “an innovative, brief, and patient-centered approach that modifies cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness techniques to make them user-friendly for patients and brief in their delivery.” The article’s author adds that STI is “used by the leading dialysis providers and has become the standard of care.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson Kate | year = 2014 | title = Nephrology Social Work: Caring for the Emotional Needs of Dialysis Patients | url = http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/091514p20.shtml | journal = Social Work Today | volume = 14 | issue = 5| page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

STI is now being used by medical social workers in a range of settings across the United States, who have reported positive results.&lt;ref&gt;Scotto, Pandora (2012) "Symptom Targeted Intervention: a worthwhile venture for both patient and social worker," ''RenaLink''.&lt;/ref&gt; To teach social workers STI’s techniques, trainings are held across the country, led by [[Melissa McCool|Ms. McCool]] and her colleagues, in person as well as through online webinars. Nephrology social workers who participated in a 2014 study of the effectiveness of STI webinar trainings found the trainings to be very useful and wanted them to continue.&lt;ref&gt;McCool, Melissa; Boyd, Shaun; Aebel-Groesch, Kathy; Gonzalez, Teresa; Evans, Deborah (2014) [http://www.nephrologynews.com/articles/110201-symptom-targeted-intervention-webinar-trainings-feedback-from-participants "Symptom targeted intervention webinar trainings: Feedback from participants".] ''Nephrology News and Issues'', June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

STI is used by medical practices and [[accountable care organization|Accountable Care Organization]]s (ACOs) for [[population health]] management and in [[integrated care]] and [[chronic care]]. STI provides curriculum, training, clinical assessment tools, and treatment plans for these organizations through 20 min win, a system that allows patient issues, identified in required biopsychosocial care plans, to be addressed in 20-minute sessions.

==Research==
In 2011, STI was assessed by [[nephrology]] social workers in 17 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Melissa |last1=McCool |first2=Stephanie |last2=Johnstone |first3=Renata |last3=Sledge |first4=Beth |last4=Witten |first5=Michelle |last5=Contillo |first6=Kathryn |last6=Aebel-Groesch |first7=Jim |last7=Hafner |journal=Nephrology News and Issues |pmid=21608458 |url=http://www.nephrology-digital.com/201105/201105/17/0 |year=2011 |title=The promise of symptom-targeted intervention to manage depression in dialysis patients—part 1 |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=32–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sledge Renata, Aebel-Groesch Kathryn, McCool Melissa, Johnstone Stephanie, Witten Beth, Contillo M, Hafner James | year = | title = The promise of Symptom Targeted Intervention (STI) in improving mood and quality of life outcomes in dialysis patients—part 2 | url = http://www.nephrology-digital.com/201106/#&amp;pageSet=13 | journal = Nephrology News and Issues | volume = 25 | issue = 7| pages = 24–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results suggested that STI further enhances existing social work skills in identifying, treating, and tracking outcomes of patient issues requiring clinical intervention. Most of the social workers spent 1.5 hours over a six-week period using STI to address symptoms of depression with a patient. This short period of intervention led to a reported improvement in physical component summary and mental component summary scores (part of the [[SF-36|Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)]] patient evaluation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/mos_core_36item.html 36-Item Short Form Survey from the RAND Medical Outcomes Study]&lt;/ref&gt;) in 51% and 64% of patients, respectively, and improvement in [[List of diagnostic classification and rating scales used in psychiatry|CES-D]] scores in 72.1% of patients. In 2013, a pilot program showed that using STI's techniques helped increase patients' adherence to treatment recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, Stephanie (2013). [http://www.renalbusiness.com/articles/2013/10/helping-patients-manage-treatment-recommendations.aspx "Helping patients manage treatment recommendations".] ''Renal Business Today.''&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

A 2013 study with [[DaVita]] Clinical Research, published at the National Kidney Foundation meeting in April 2014, showed statistically significant improvements in quality of life and depression scores for patients receiving STI. There were 91 participants in the study.  Statistically significant improvement occurred in KDQOL-36 mental component scores (p &lt; 0.001), physical component scores (p = 0.042), as well as burden (p &lt; 0.001) and effects (p = 0.001) domain scores. Statistically significant improvement also occurred in patients' CES-D 10 scores (p &lt; 0.001).&lt;ref&gt;Boyd S, Dunn D, Aebel-Groesch K, Evans D, Gonzalez T, Burgess M, Howard T, Mutell R, McCool M (2014). [http://www.davitaclinicalresearch.com/publication/treating-depression-in-the-dialysis-setting-validating-symptom-targeted-intervention-2 "Treating depression in the dialysis setting: validating Symptom Targeted Intervention".] DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc./STI Innovations.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an ongoing study conducted by [[Fresenius Medical Care|Fresenius]] Medical Care, the use of STI, along with other clinical interventions, was shown to decrease missed treatments, decrease hospitalizations and improve quality of life indicators and depression scores. The baseline number of missed treatment rate (per month) was 1.7 (±1.3) vs. 0.9 (±1.0) post-intervention (p &lt; 0.0001). The number of hospitalization was 0.4 (±0.8) vs. 0.2 (±0.8) per month for pre- and post-intervention, respectively, (p = 0.07). Significant improvement was found in CES-D 10 and KDQOL-36 domain scores except for physical component scores. Sleep-quality barriers and stressors also indicated significant improvement (except for restless legs and stressors related to health symptoms or loss/grief). Preliminary results indicated that an intensive social worker-initiated intervention program was able to reduce unexcused missed treatments in the short term (three months). Indicators of quality of life and well-being that potentially contributed to the non-adherent behavior also improved, which may help sustain the favorable results over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone S, Li N, Maddux F, Weissman-Hunt A, Quintana D, Lacson Jr. E (2014) [http://esrdnet5.org/Files/Patient-Services/PE-LAN/2014/MissedTreatments2014/MT-Adherence.aspx  "Social worker-driven program to reduce hemodialysis therapy non-adherence".] Fresenius Medical Care North America.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of a 2015 study by [[Melissa McCool|Ms. McCool]] and colleagues at [[DaVita]] HealthCare Partners suggested that implementation of a social worker-based STI clinical program targeting improved quality of life for in-center hemodialysis patients led to health improvements due to increased adherence to the prescribed dialysis treatment regimen in the least-compliant patients.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd S, Aebel-Groesch K, Dunn D, Remington J, McCool M, Benner D. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150530012209/http://ww2.aievolution.com/nkf1501/index.cfm?do=abs.viewAbs&amp;abs=1351 "Symptom Targeted Intervention Decreased Missed Treatment in Hemodialysis Patients"]. National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Meeting, Charlotte, NC, March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A poster presenting the results received best poster award at the [[National Kidney Foundation]] spring 2015 meeting. A pilot study using STI with transplant patients at the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] was completed in 2014, and a poster presenting the results was included in the British Renal Society's annual meeting in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;McCool M, Rathjen M, Boyd B (2015) [http://www.postersessiononline.com/173580348_eu/congresos/brs2015/aula/-P_125_brs2015.pdf "Qualitative pilot study on the value of Symptom Targeted Intervention (STI) in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety with renal and transplant patients, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh".] British Renal Society Annual Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies are under way on the effectiveness of STI in patients with a variety of chronic diseases, including an ongoing multi-center IRB-approved research study involving the University of Maryland, University of Utah, and University of Minnesota, on the use of STI with solid organ transplant recipients.

'''Tumescence''' is the quality or state of being tumescent or swollen. Tumescence usually refers to the normal engorgement with [[blood]] ([[vascular congestion]]) of the [[erectile tissue]]s, marking [[sexual excitation]], and possible readiness for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. The tumescent sexual organ in men is the [[penis]] and in women is the [[clitoris]].

==Terminology==
'''Detumescence''' is the reversal of this process, by which blood leaves the erectile tissue, returning to the flaccid state.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Anthony J, Lue Tom F, "Chapter 38. Male Sexual Dysfunction" (Chapter). Tanagho EA, McAninch JW: ''Smith's General Urology'', 17th ed: http://m-learning.zju.edu.cn/G2S/eWebEditor/uploadfile/20130618163042768.doc.&lt;/ref&gt; Something that causes an [[erection]] is sometimes referred to as a tumefier (tumefyer) or tumescer.&lt;ref&gt;McFarlane, Gordon A., and Alastair M. Sammon. "A prepaid healthcare scheme in rural Africa." Tropical doctor 30.3 (2000): 151-154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nocturnal penile tumescence testing ==
Regularly, men who experience [[erectile dysfunction]] are given a [[nocturnal penile tumescence]] (NPT) test, usually over a three-day period. Such a test detects the presence of an erection occurring during sleep using either:
# a small portable computer connected to two bands placed around the shaft of the penis which records penile tumescence,
# a band of paper tape with perforations (similar to [[coil stamp|coil postage stamp]]s) that is fit snugly around the shaft of the penis and will break at the perforations during penile tumescence.

The goal of nocturnal penile tumescence testing is to determine whether a man can experience an erection while sleeping after reporting he is unable to experience an erection while awake. If a man does obtain an erection while sleeping, but cannot obtain one while awake, a psychological cause or a medication side effect is usually suspected. Otherwise, if a man does not obtain an erection in either state, a [[physiology|physiological]] cause is usually suspected. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">'''Vaginal contractions''' are [[muscle contraction|contraction]]s of the [[pelvic muscles]] surrounding the [[vagina]], especially the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]. Vaginal contractions are generally an involuntary muscular response to [[sexual stimulation]], including [[sexual arousal]], and are commonly most intense during [[sexual stimulation]] and culminating in [[orgasm]]. Though usually an involuntary response, some women can control the muscles of the vagina to perform vaginal contractions at will. Vaginal contractions enhance the sexual experience and pleasure for both parties during sexual intercourse.

In a 1982 study, pelvic contractions of 11 women who manually self-stimulated to orgasm were monitored using an anal probe and a vaginal probe simultaneously. Near the perceived start of orgasm, a series of regular contractions began in 9 of the women, with anal and vaginal contractions synchronizing with each other. Three of the women's orgasms consistently included only a series of regular contractions; for six other women, orgasms consistently continued beyond the regular series with additional irregular contractions. Two women had no regular contractions during reported orgasms. The women showed marked differences in orgasm duration and the number of contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7181645 |year=1982 |last1=Bohlen |first1=JG | last2=Held |first2=JP | last3=Sanderson |first3=MO | last4=Ahlgren |first4=A | title=The female orgasm: pelvic contractions |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=367–86 |journal= Arch Sex Behav| doi=10.1007/bf01541570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 study confirmed these results, but concluded that some women experience their orgasm regularly without contractions and some report having contractions during orgasm only occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochvíl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |journal=Ceskoslovenska psychiatrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginal contractions are caused by both the activity of certain brain regions and the release of the hormone oxytocin. It has been suggested that vaginal contractions during orgasm can increase the chances of pregnancy as they transport sperm up the reproductive tract from the vagina to the oviducts, which decreases the distance it has to travel. Additionally, when the woman is fertile sperm is only transported to the side of the dominant ovary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why Women Have Orgasms: An Evolutionary Analysis|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-012-9967-x|journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior|date = 2012-06-26|issn = 0004-0002|pages = 1127–1143|volume = 41|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s10508-012-9967-x|language = en|first = David A.|last = Puts|first2 = Khytam|last2 = Dawood|first3 = Lisa L. M.|last3 = Welling|pmid=22733154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involuntary vaginal contractions may arise from non-sexual causes. Involuntary spasm of the muscles around the vagina, usually caused by anxiety, can result in [[vaginismus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000141441.41178.6b |title=Botulinum Toxin in the Treatment of Refractory Vaginismus |year=2004 |last1=Ghazizadeh |first1=Shirin |last2=Nikzad |first2=Masoomeh |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |volume=104 |issue=5, Part 1 |pages=922–925}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginal contractions should not be confused with [[uterine contraction]]s.

The '''Western Cape Department of Health''' is a [[government department|department]] of the [[Government of the Western Cape]], responsible for providing [[public healthcare]] to the population of the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]].

The political head of the department is the [[Minister of Health (Western Cape)|Provincial Minister of Health]]; {{asof|2015|lc=on}} this is [[Nomafrench Mbombo]] of the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andisiwe |last=Makinana |title=Zille cracks whip in Cabinet reshuffle |newspaper=City Press |date=31 December 2014 |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Zille-cracks-whip-in-Cabinet-reshuffle-20141231 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative head is the Superintendent-General of Health; {{asof|2010|lc=on}} this was Professor Craig Househam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/gov_employees/52796 |title=Prof. Keith Craig Househam |publisher=Western Cape Government |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 2010/11 financial year, the department had 27,993 employees and a budget of [[South African rand|R]]11,962,863,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/other/2010/3/vote_06a.pdf |chapter=Vote 6: Department of Health |title=Budget 2010: Estimates of Provincial Expenditure |isbn=978-0-621-39119-0 |publisher=Western Cape Provincial Treasury |location=Cape Town |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospitals==
In the Western Cape there are 428 public [[primary care]] facilities ([[clinic]]s and community health centres), some operated by the Department of Health, while others are operated by the [[City of Cape Town]] and funded by transfer payments from the department.&lt;ref name="rep-serv"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Annual Report 2008/9 |url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/Text/2009/11/annual_report_2008-09_health.pdf |page=14  |publisher=Western Cape Department of Health |location=Cape Town |date=28 August 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public [[secondary care]] services are provided by 32 district hospitals, six regional hospitals, and three central hospitals (which also provide tertiary care; see below).&lt;ref name="rep-serv" /&gt;

Three central hospitals in [[Cape Town]] provide [[tertiary care]]; these are [[Groote Schuur Hospital]], [[Tygerberg Hospital]], and [[Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital]]. They take specialist [[Referral (medicine)|referrals]] from other hospitals across the province, and in many cases from other provinces or even other African countries.

The department also runs various specialised facilities, including six [[tuberculosis]] hospitals, four [[psychiatric hospital]]s, and a [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] centre.

The '''Wisconsin WIC Association''', founded in 1998, is an [[United States|American]] [[professional association]] with a mission to support and promote [[Wisconsin]]'s [[WIC]] (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children) program as well as assist the National WIC Association in ensuring continual program existence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/10/02/government-shutdown-9-million-moms-and-babies-at-risk-as-wic-program-halts/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2011/08/15/state-refusal-to-pursue-wic-grant-under-fire/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1973, Wisconsin became a pilot state for the WIC Program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/wic&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2014}} By 1974, with a budget of $350,000 and total participation of 1,300: WIC operated in Green Bay Area Free clinic, Menominee Tribe, and Great Lakes Intertribal Council. By 1980, WIC had expanded to over 55 projects, including the State’s two major urban locations Milwaukee and Madison. By 1990, the majority of the current WIC Program was in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/24wicfood$.htm "WIC Program: Foodcost"], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2014}}  Divided into 5 regions and WIC services were being provided in nearly every county of Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wicprograms.org/state/wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt; As WIC expanded, it became increasingly more difficult to maintain contact and communication with the numerous WIC projects throughout the state. Recognizing that, on June 30, 1998 a group of like-minded individuals met together resulting in the formation of Wisconsin WIC Association (WWA).

==Function== 
The WWA organizes meetings and projects by WIC employees, politicians, and community members to encourage funding, grant dispersal, and educational programs related to the WIC.
