      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14651">'''Advanced nuclear''' is an emerging area of the energy industry focused on designing and commercializing next generation reactors for nuclear energy production. Encompassing more comprehensive and radical technological innovations and design advancements, these innovations aim to dramatically improve performance and eliminate known problems associated with the existing generation [[nuclear reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (Gen I and Gen II) currently in use around the world.

The earliest Gen I and Gen II nuclear reactors built utilized the [[light-water reactor]] design in one of three variants: the [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR), the [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR), and the [[supercritical water reactor]] (SCWR). The use of the light-water design (i.e. using regular water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and not [[heavy water]], &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) as both its coolant and [[neutron moderator]] but needing a plentiful supply) in all commercial reactors was a trade-off that enabled the industry to leverage the purchasing clout of Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]], who was keen on procuring nuclear-powered submarines for the Navy, to grow quickly. The choice, however, imposed a riskier design that many argued was not optimized for terrestrial energy, bringing both competitive advantages as well as fateful disadvantages to the initial development and subsequent growth of the commercial nuclear power fleet. Despite operating to the military's exacting specifications and winning praise and massive contracts from government buyers, the industry quickly earned the distrust of the public. (See the [[Anti-nuclear movement]].)

[[Generation III reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s contain yet further incremental refinements to aspects of [[Generation II reactor|Generation II]] [[nuclear reactor]] designs but were not very popular. Improvements were developed for [[Nuclear fuel|fuel technology]], [[thermal efficiency]], to safety systems to reduce maintenance and capital costs. The first Generation III reactor was [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant|Kashiwazaki 6]] (an [[Advanced boiling water reactor|ABWR]]) in 1996 but the declining support for the underlying Generation II light-water design, caused relatively few third generation reactors to be built. 

[[Generation IV reactor|Generation IV]] designs are the first generation where innovator in Advanced Nuclear technologies are exploring paradigm shifts in methodologies. Gen IV projects encompass not just innovative nuclear fission concepts, like the [[Molten salt reactor]], [[Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and [[High temperature gas cooled reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, but also [[Fusion power]] and even Low Energy Nuclear Reactors (LENR), which generate heat through a series of controlled chemical reactions that then cause a nuclear bond to shift, which results in heat output. Gen IV is still in development as of 2017, and are not expected to start entering commercial operation until after 2020.
[[File:ORNL Alvin Weinberg MSRE 6Kh.jpg|thumb|ORNL director Alvin Weinberg notes the 6,000 hour of molten salt reactor experiment full-power operation in 1968.]]
Some of the different reactor design ideas being explored and developed for Advanced nuclear reactors, now thought of as [[Generation IV reactor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ('''Gen IV''') today were actually first conceived within the National Labs back in the 1960s. Several of these concepts, including [[Alvin M. Weinberg]]'s [[Molten salt reactor]] (MSR) developed at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), even had the benefit of being prototyped and tested over a period of time. Weinberg's MSR became the first reactor to run on Uranium 233 in 1968 and logged more than 13,000 hours at "full power" before being shut down in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ornl.gov/blog/ornl-review/time-warp-molten-salt-reactor-experiment-alvin-weinberg-s-magnum-opus|title=Time Warp: Molten Salt Reactor Experiment—Alvin Weinberg’s magnum opus {{!}} ORNL|website=www.ornl.gov|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the concept of using a molten salt brew that acts both as the fuel and the "containment" of the reaction by using the ionic bonds of the salt to capture and contain the heat generated from the nuclear reaction, thereby dispensing with the need for expensive containment structures and eliminating much of risk and cost, remains of keen interest to those exploring Advanced nuclear technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orr, Jr.|first=Robert|date=September 2013|title=The Molten Salt Reactor: Nuclear Energy Without Fear?|url=|journal=Infinite Energy|volume=Issue 111|pages=35-36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The birth of a new industry ==
In November 2015, the Obama White House hosted a Summit on Nuclear Energy to examine the role of nuclear energy in reducing carbon emissions as part of its efforts to combat the threat of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nei.org/News-Media/Media-Room/News-Releases/White-House-Summit-Spotlights-Nuclear-Energy-s-Val|title=White House Summit Spotlights Nuclear Energy's Value in Climate Change Fight|last=|first=|date=November 5, 2015|website=www.nei.org|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; January 2016, the first "Advanced Nuclear Summit and Showcase" was held in Washington, D.C., hosted by [[Third Way (United States)|Third Way]], in partnership with the [[Idaho National Laboratory]] (INL), [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (ANL), and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdway.org/events/advanced-nuclear-summit|title=Advanced Nuclear Summit &amp; Showcase|website=Third Way|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was also attended by a bi-partisan group of senators—[[Lisa Murkowski]] (R-AK), [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D-RI), [[Mike Crapo]] (R-ID) and [[Cory Booker]] (D-NJ)—along with representatives from more than 150 organizations to show support for advancing nuclear innovation in the U.S. According to Third Way, Advanced Nuclear technologies are developing more rapidly than most experts expected and, as of 2015, there were 48 companies, start-ups or projects with funding of more than $1.3 billion in private capital working to "build the next generation of nuclear reactors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-advanced-nuclear-industry|title=The Advanced Nuclear Industry|website=Third Way|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like the growth in technological innovation in other parts of the energy industry, which has seen the emergence of hydraulic fracturing as a means of extracting methane from shale formations where previously it was unavailable and improvements in solar panel efficiency and wind turbine efficiency, there's been a resurgence of interest in nuclear from younger engineers, physics Ph.Ds and investors seeking scale-level solutions to meeting global energy need with non-carbon-emitting energy. (See for example [[Transatomic Power]], whose website says "We at Transatomic Power are nuclear engineers with a new approach for electricity generation. We started this company because we believe it is possible to power the world while helping it thrive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transatomicpower.com/|title=Homepage - Transatomic|website=Transatomic|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Despite the reported $1.3 billion in private funding, in fact experts worry that the lack of federal support for nuclear innovation in the U.S., means that most of the critical design and development work in Advanced Nuclear reactors is now being done in India, Russia, China, Canada, France, Japan, Korea and even Saudi Arabia, where in 2010 a royal decree said: "The development of atomic energy is essential to meet the Kingdom's growing requirements for energy to generate electricity, produce desalinated water and reduce reliance on depleting hydrocarbon resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/saudi-arabia.aspx|title=Nuclear Power in Saudi Arabia - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia will be investing $80 billion in nuclear development over the next decade or two. India, Russia and China have all made enormous investments in support of their country's nuclear energy capabilities and, in 1983 Russia became the first country to put a Molten Salt Reactor, the [[BN-600 reactor]] online, which it did without much fanfare in the aftermath of its [[Chernobyl disaster]]. India, which "published about twice the number of papers on thorium as its nearest competitors, during each of the years from 2002 to 2006"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=srikumar|date=September 2010|title=Thorium Utilisation for Sustainable Supply of Nuclear Energy (pdf)|url=http://www1.phys.vt.edu/~kimballton/gem-star/workshop/presentations/banerjee.pdf|journal=Virginia Tech|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is expected to complete the world's first Advanced Thorium Molten Salt Reactor in late 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/10/india-has-almost-finished-the-worlds-first-advanced-thorium-nuclear-reactor/|title=India Has Almost Finished The World’s First Advanced Thorium Nuclear Reactor|website=The Daily Caller|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; even while it is already in the process of building the next six reactors taking the advances even further, and hopes to provide as much as 25% of its future electricity needs with clean advanced nuclear energy, utilizing its abundant thorium reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theenergycollective.com/dan-yurman/2398307/india-goes-large-plans-build-next-round-reactors|title=India Goes Large in Plans to Build Next Round of Reactors - The Energy Collective|date=2017-02-13|work=The Energy Collective|accessdate=2017-07-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not to be outdone, China plans to spend $570 billion building more than 60 nuclear power plants over the next decade, with a portion of this to develop its Advanced Nuclear capabilities,[http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/study-us-losing-ground-russia-china-nuclear-power-20467] positioning itself to be the "Amazon.com" of nuclear commerce, according to Kenneth Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/study-us-losing-ground-russia-china-nuclear-power-20467|title=Study: U.S. "Losing Ground" To Russia And China On Nuclear Power|last=Follett|first=Andrew|website=The National Interest|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Global Nexus Initiative (GNI) found that, with the U.S. practically ignoring the needs of those working on Advanced Nuclear, the U.S. will lose significant competitive advantage within the energy industry as well as forego geopolitical influence by allowing its nuclear power industry to stagnate and fall behind, even while fossil fuels become increasingly supplanted by clean alternatives. Richard Meserve, former Chairman of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and a member of the GNI study working group, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;“This report draws attention to nuclear power’s geopolitical dimension, which often is overlooked in the debate. The nuclear rules are shaped by the countries with the largest market share, and traditional leaders like the US will soon be overtaken by China and Russia. There is a danger that the U.S. will lose the capacity to influence the global norms for safety, security and non-proliferation. There thus are national security issues at stake.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalnexusinitiative.org/uncategorized/nuclear-energys-role-in-fighting-climate-change-under-threat/|title=Nuclear Energy’s Role in Fighting Climate Change Under Threat – GNI|website=globalnexusinitiative.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Fighting an uphill battle to change a bad reputation ==
Despite having funded the birth of nuclear age, the U.S. has not chosen to fund the refining work needed to optimize nuclear reactors for terrestrial energy. Into this void, the Generation IV International Forum, founded in 2001, has stepped, as "a co-operative international endeavor . . . to carry out the research and development needed to establish the feasibility and performance capabilities of the next generation nuclear energy systems." There are currently ten active members: [[Canada]], [[China]], the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom), [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]]. The non-active members are [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Whether this framework will enable the job to get done is yet to be seen.

The global race is on to design and commercialize cheaper, safer, and more efficient nuclear reactors to provide clean energy to the world. Even though many of the original ideas, technologies and research came out of the U.S.'s early investments in nuclear research and the work of thousands of American nuclear physicists and engineers laboring in the National Laboratories and nuclear industry in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, whatever patents and [[Intellectual property]] protections there were have long been expired. Now anyone anywhere can look at the achievements of people like [[Alvin M. Weinberg]] and start to develop the perfect thorium molten salt reactor. Already it is evident that Russia, India and China have been investing heavily in such efforts. American entrepreneurs, while appearing to be up for the challenge, are handicapped by having no clear government support, no federal funding, no regulatory pathway and very little in the way public support for their search for technological solutions that could unleash a vast new [[clean energy]] industry, producing jobs and retaining geopolitical influence on nuclear performance and safety standards, while simultaneously contributing to our solution for climate change. Even with growing bipartisan support for maintaining a robust and innovative nuclear industry in the face of all of these challenges, the lingering opposition of the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] makes the work of America's Advanced Nuclear entrepreneurs an uphill battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.energyxxi.org/nuclear|title=Nuclear|date=2014-08-15|work=Global Energy Institute|accessdate=2017-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Americans in France''' consists of immigrants and expatriates from the [[United States]] as well as French people of American ancestry. Immigration to [[France]] from the United States date back to the 19th century and according to the American embassy in Paris, as of 2010, there are about 100,000 American citizens residing in France.

==History==
===19th Century===
Unofficial figures indicate that up to 50,000 free blacks emigrated to Paris from [[Louisiana]] in the decades after [[Napoleon]] sold the territory to the United States in 1803.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080123.PARIS23/TPStory/specialTravel]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paris]] was the art capital of the world in the nineteenth century and has attracted painters, sculptors, and architects from around the world including the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ampa/hd_ampa.htm Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - Americans in Paris, 1860–1900]", ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art''&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades following the [[American Civil War]], hundreds of Americans joined the throngs headed to Paris. American artists, who formed the largest contingent of foreign painters and sculptors in Paris, were only one segment of the capital's extensive American colony, which also included writers, businessmen, diplomats, and others in more-or-less permanent residence.

Many American artists stayed together, and enclaves of them developed on the [[Left Bank]], along the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs and near the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] and the [[Académie Julian]]'s headquarters. Although some lived in Paris for long periods—even the rest of their lives—most insisted on identifying themselves as American.

===20th to 21st Century===
====World War I and the Aftermath====
{{See also|Negrophilia}}
[[File:American Expeditionary Force Baker Mission.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Officers of the American Expeditionary Forces and the Baker mission]]
During the [[United States campaigns in World War I]] the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] fought in France alongside British and French allied forces in the last year of the war, against [[German Empire|Imperial]] [[German Army (German Empire)|German forces]]. The first 14,000 U.S. infantry troops landed in France at the port of [[Saint Nazaire]] and by May 1918 over one million U.S. troops were stationed in France,  half of them being on the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;Pershing, ''My Experiences in the World War'' (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of World War I, when about 200,000 were brought over to fight, Paris began to have an [[African-American]] community. Ninety per cent of these soldiers were from the [[American South]].&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/&gt; France was viewed by many African Americans as a welcome change after incidents of [[racism in the United States]]. Beginning in the 1920s, U.S. intellectuals, painters, writers, and tourists were drawn to French art, literature, philosophy, theatre, cinema, fashion, wines, and cuisine. It was during this time that [[jazz]] was introduced to the French and black culture was born in Paris.

====World War II====
{{See also|German military administration in occupied France during World War II}}
When France officially declared war on Germany in September 1939, as a response to the [[Invasion of Poland|Third Reich's invasion of Poland]], an estimated 30,000 Americans lived in or near Paris.&lt;ref name="Roots"&gt;"[http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/americans-wartime-paris/ Americans in Wartime Paris]", ''Bonjour Paris''&lt;/ref&gt; Although that declaration was followed by roughly nine-months of what often was called the "phony war" or "drôle de guerre," the inevitability of coming conflict led most of those expatriates to leave France while they could.

In June 1940, the inevitable occurred with massive German attacks and after scarcely three weeks of battle, Nazi troops marched uncontested through the gates of Paris and some 5,000 Americans still were in the French capital. For various reasons, such as family ties and professional obligations, they had chosen to remain in Paris.
At that moment, the United States was not at war, however, and not militarily allied with anyone. It was still a neutral nation. German occupying forces were legally obligated to treat U.S. citizens better than French nationals even though many were bi-nationals with French passports as well as American ones.

Americans who stayed in the capital endured most of the shortages and hardships of their French neighbors but to some extent for nearly a year and a half they were not imprisoned by German occupying authorities. However, their lives were not easy and often tragic, in particular for [[African-American]]s and [[Jewish American]]s who were frequently singled out by the Nazis for harsher than normal treatment. Because the United States still remained neutral, the German occupying forces at first allowed long-standing institutions in the French capital such as the American hospital, the American library, the American church, the American Chamber of Commerce as well as various others of a commercial or charitable nature to remain open.

When the United States entered the war, it led to a clamp down on U.S. citizens in German-occupied northern France. Many were rounded up and sent to internment camps. Those who were not still were obligated to report regularly to German occupying authorities or French police. Internments applied initially only to men although, in September, 1942, German authorities began to intern American women as well.

====Aftermath of the War to Present Day====
Many American students have been flocking to France for further education following the aftermath of the Second World War. In 2007-2008, more than 17,000 Americans studied in France as undergraduate and graduate students, a number which represented a 46 percent increase since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.usa.campusfrance.org/en/page/why-france Study in France - Why France? ]", ''Campus France''&lt;/ref&gt; For majority of Americans, France is the country that first comes to mind when retiring abroad. Among the reasons were the scenery and the climate as well as France being a cultural leader of the world.&lt;ref name="Roots2"&gt;"[http://parisunraveled.com/ Paris Unraveled]", ''Study Abroad Guide'', January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
The [[American Church in Paris]] is the first American church established outside the United States. It started in 1814, when American Protestants started worshipping together in different homes around Paris. The first sanctuary was built in 1857, on rue de Berri.&lt;ref&gt;''Friendly Adventures'', by Joseph Wilson Cochran, published 1931&lt;/ref&gt; The American Church continues to minister to many Anglophone Protestants in Paris, both American and other English speaking communities, with multicultural programming, and a congregation of over nearly 40 nations and 35 Christian denominations.

Similarly, [[American Cathedral in Paris]] has served the American community since the 1830s, when services were organized in the garden pavilion of the [[Hôtel Matignon]]. A parish was formally established in 1859 and the first church building consecrated in 1864 on Rue Bayard.

==Education==
Every year, some 17,000 American students travel to Paris, France to spend a semester or an academic year abroad, hundreds more participate in the Teaching Assistant Program in France, and still others go to France to work or to study independently of an American university program.

The [[American School of Paris]], founded in 1946 shortly after the end of [[World War II]], is the oldest American school in Europe.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/m/a/os/1399.htm|title=France, Paris: American School of Paris|work=Office of Overseas Schools, U.S. Department of State|location=Washington, DC|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=April 17, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419014445/http://www.state.gov/m/a/os/1399.htm|archivedate=April 19, 2008|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school provides an American model of education to students from nearly 50 nations, 50% being American. Instruction is in English, and all students study French, either as a first or second language.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france.english-schools.org/american-school-of-paris.htm|title=American School of Paris: Profile|work=france.english-schools.org|accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Graduate School in Paris]] is a not-for-profit organization and it is recognized in France by the Ministry of Higher Education as a private institution of Higher Learning, and offers programs that are accredited in the United States.

There is also the [[American School of Grenoble]].

'''Arab Christians''' ({{lang-ar|مسيحيون عرب}} ''Masīḥiyyūn ʿArab'') are [[Arabs]] of the [[Christian]] faith.&lt;ref name="PharesIntro"&gt;{{cite web|first=Walid|last=Phares|author-link=Walid Phares|url=http://www.arabicbible.com/christian/intro_arab_christians.htm|title=Arab Christians: An Introduction|publisher=Arabic Bible Outreach Ministry|date=2001|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041105161338/http://www.arabicbible.com/christian/intro_arab_christians.htm|archivedate=5 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are descended from ancient Arab Christian clans that did not convert to [[Islam]], such as the [[Kahlan]]i [[Qahtanite]] tribes of [[Ancient history of Yemen|Yemen]] (i.e., [[Ghassanids]], and [[Banu Judham]]) who settled in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]], as well as Arabized Christians, such as [[Melkite]]s and [[Antiochian Greek Christians]]. Arab Christians, forming [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Greek Orthodox]] and [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] communities, are estimated to be 520,000&lt;ref name=middleeast/&gt;–703,000&lt;ref name=ewtn/&gt; in Syria, 221,000 in [[Jordan]],&lt;ref name="Abouna2015"/&gt; 134,130&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; in Israel and around 50,000 in Palestine. There is also a sizable Arab Christian Orthodox community in Lebanon and marginal communities in Iraq, Turkey and Egypt. Emigrants from Arab Christian (including [[Melkite]]-[[Antiochian Greek Christians]]) communities make up a significant proportion of the Middle Eastern diaspora, with sizable population concentrations across the [[Americas]], most notably in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demographics|url=http://www.aaiusa.org/demographics|work=Arab American Institute|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Arab tribes to adopt Christianity were likely [[Nabataeans]] and [[Ghassanids]]. During the fifth and sixth centuries, the Ghassanids, who at first adopted [[monophysitism]], formed one of the most powerful confederations allied to Christian Byzantium, being a buffer against the pagan tribes of Arabia. The last king of the [[Lakhmids]], [[al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir]], a client of the [[Sasanian Empire]] in the late sixth century, also converted to Christianity (in this case, to the Nestorian sect).&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Hitti. ''History of the Arabs''. 6th ed.; Macmillan and St. Martin's Press, 1967, pp. 78–84 (on the Ghassanids and Lakhmids) and pp. 87–108 (on Yemen and the Hijaz).&lt;/ref&gt; Arab Christians played important roles in [[al-Nahda]] movement in modern times, and because Arab Christians formed the educated [[upper class]] and the [[bourgeoisie]],&lt;ref name="Radai2008"&gt;{{cite journal |format=PDF |last=Radai |first=Itamar |url=http://weblaw.haifa.ac.il/he/faculty/kedar/lecdb/general/421.pdf|title=The collapse of the Palestinian-Arab middle class in 1948: The case of Qatamon|journal=Middle Eastern Studies |volume=43 |issue=6 |year=2008 |pages=961–982 |issn=0026-3206 |doi=10.1080/00263200701568352|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have had a significant impact in politics, business and culture of the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name="Teague2010"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael|last=Teague|url=http://www.aljadid.com/content/new-christian-question|title=The New Christian Question|journal=Al Jadid Magazine|year=2010|volume=16|issue=62|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pacini1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pacini|first=Andrea|title=Christian Communities in the Arab Middle East: The Challenge of the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMfYAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=38, 55|isbn=978-0-19-829388-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today Arab Christians still play important roles in the Arab world, and Christians are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/don-belt/pope-to-arab-christians-k_b_203943.html|title=Pope to Arab Christians: Keep the Faith|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab Christians are not the only [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christian group in the Middle East]], with significant ''non-Arab'' indigenous Christian communities of [[Assyro-Chaldeans]], [[Arameans]], [[Armenians]] and others. Although sometimes classified as "Arab Christians", the largest Middle Eastern Christian groups of [[Maronites]] and [[Copts]] often claim ''non-Arab'' ethnicity: a significant proportion of Maronites [[Phoenicianism|claim descent from the ancient Phoenicians]] while Copts also eschew an Arab identity, preferring an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalcopticassembly.com/showart.php?main_id=1724|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714155247/http://nationalcopticassembly.com/showart.php?main_id=1724|archivedate=2011-07-14|title=Coptic assembly of America - Reactions in the Egyptian Press To a Lecture Delivered by a Coptic Bishop In Hudson Institute|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of Arab Christians}}

===Classic antiquity===
[[File:Jubail Church.jpg|thumb|[[Jubail Church]] is a 4th-century church building near [[Jubail]], Saudi Arabia. It originally belonged to the [[Church of the East]], an ancient [[Nestorian]] branch of [[Eastern Christianity]] in the Middle East. It is one of the oldest churches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.&amp;nbsp;Langfeldt, "Recently Discovered Early Christian Monuments in Northeastern Arabia", ''Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy'', '''5''' (1994), 32–60 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0471.1994.tb00054.x/abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Arab Christians are [[Indigenous peoples]] of [[Western Asia]], with a presence there predating the seventh-century [[Early Muslim conquests]] in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. There were many Arab tribes which adhered to Christianity beginning with the 1st century, including the Nabateans and the Ghassanids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George|last=Khoury|url=http://www.melkite.com/origins.html|title=The Origins of Middle Eastern Arab Christianity|publisher=melkite.com|date=22 January 1997|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010222111643/http://www.melkite.com/origins.html|archivedate=22 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabateans were possibly among the first Arab tribes to arrive to the [[Southern Levant]] in the very late first millennium BC. The Nabataeans initially adopted pagan beliefs, but they became Christians by the time of the Byzantine period around the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rimon|first=Ofra|title=The Nabateans in the Negev |url=http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/archeology/ExhibitionC_eng.aspx?id=9|publisher=[[Hecht Museum]]|accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Arab invaders, who soon pressed forward into their seats found the remnants of the Nabataeans transformed into peasants. Their lands were divided between the new Qahtanite Arab tribal kingdoms of the Byzantine vassals, the [[Ghassanids]] and the [[Himyarite Kingdom]], the [[Kindah]] in North Arabia.

The tribes of [[Tayy]], [[Banu Abdul Qays]], and [[Taghlib]] are also known to have included many Christians in the pre-Islamic period. The southern Arabian city of [[Najran]] was a center of Arabian Christianity, made famous by the persecution by one of the kings of Yemen, Dhu Nawas, who was himself an enthusiastic convert to [[Judaism]]. The leader of the Arabs of Najran during the period of persecution, al-Ḥārith, was canonized by the [[Catholic Church]] as [[Arethas (martyr)|Arethas]]. Some modern scholars suggest that [[Philip the Arab]] was the first Christian emperor of Rome.&lt;ref name="Parry 1999 37" /&gt; By the fourth century, a significant number of Christians occupied the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

The [[New Testament]] has a biblical account of Arab conversion to Christianity recorded in the book of Acts. When [[Saint Peter]] preaches to the people of Jerusalem, they ask, "And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? [. . .] both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians—we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God." (Acts 2:8, 11, [[English Standard Version]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Arab Christians are thus one of the oldest Christian communities.

The first mention of Christianity in Arabia occurs in the New Testament as the Apostle Paul refers to his journey in Arabia following his conversion (Galatians 1: 15-17). Later, [[Eusebius]] discusses a bishop named Beryllus in the see of [[Bosra#History|Bostra]], the site of a [[synod]] c. 240 and two [[Councils of Arabia]]. Christians existed in Arab lands from at least the 3rd century onward.&lt;ref name="Parry 1999 37"&gt;{{cite book | last = Parry | first = Ken | editor-first = David |editor-last=Melling | title = The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | year = 1999 | location = Malden, MA | isbn =0-631-23203-6 | page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there were Christian influences coming from [[Ethiopia]] in particular in pre-Islamic times, and some [[Hejaz]]is, including a cousin of [[Muhammad]]'s wife [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]], according to some sources, adopted this faith, while some Ethiopian Christians may have lived in Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Hitti, History of the Arabs, 6th ed. (Macmillan and St. Martin's Press, 1967, pp. 78-84 (on the Ghassanids and Lakhmids) and pp. 87-108 (on Yemen and the Hijaz).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic era===
[[File:Saint Abo of Tiflis.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian [[martyr]] [[Saint Abo]], the patron saint of [[Tbilisi]]|left]]
Following the fall of large portions of former Byzantine and Sasanian provinces to the Arab armies, a large indigenous Christian population of varying ethnicities came under Arab Muslim dominance. Historically, a number of minority Christian sects were persecuted as [[heresy in Christianity|heretic]] under Byzantine rule (such as [[Non-Chalcedonianism|non-Chalcedonians]]). As Muslim army commanders expanded their empire and attacked countries in Asia, North Africa and southern Europe, they would offer three conditions to their enemies: convert to Islam, or pay jizyah (tax) every year, or face war to death. Those who refused war and refused to convert were deemed to have agreed to pay jizya.&lt;ref&gt;Sabet, Amr (2006), ''The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences'' 24:4, Oxford; page 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, Majid (2010). ''War and Peace in the Law of Islam'', Johns Hopkins University Press; pages 162–224; {{ISBN|978-1-58477-695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common agreement that after the rapid expansion of Islam from the 7th century onward, many Christians chose not to convert to Islam. Many scholars and intellectuals like [[Edward Said]] believed Christians in the Arab world have made significant contributions to the Arab civilization since the 7th century AD and still do. Some of the top poets at certain times were Arab Christians, and many Arab (and non-Arab) Christians were physicians, writers, government officials, and people of literature.

Under Arab Muslim rule, Christians were protected and began to enjoy more religious freedom under initial Arab Muslim occupation, than they had under Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox Christian) rule,{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} but they were also often a target of persecution. As "[[People of the Book]]", Christians in the region were accorded certain rights under [[sharia|Islamic law]] to practice their religion (including having Christian law used for rulings, settlements or sentences in court). In contrast to [[Muslim]]s, who paid the [[zakat]] tax, they paid the [[jizya]], an obligatory tax. The jizya was not levied on slaves, women, children, monks, the old, the sick,&lt;ref&gt;Shahid Alam, Articulating Group Differences: A Variety of Autocentrisms, Journal of Science and Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seed, Patricia.

The Holy Quran. Medina: King Fahd Holy Qur-an Printing Complex.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, non-Muslim citizens were permitted to practice their faith, to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy, to be entitled to Muslim state's protection from outside aggression, to be exempted from [[military service]] and the zakat.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;[[John Esposito|John Louis Esposito]], ''Islam the Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, 15 January 1998, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 10, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Abdullah Yusuf (1991).

=== Role in al-Nahda ===
[[File:Khalil Gibran.jpg|thumb|upright|Renowned Lebanese poet and writer [[Khalil Gibran]]]]
The Renaissance of Arab culture or ''[[al-Nahda]]'' was a cultural renaissance that began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it began in the wake of the exit of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] from the [[Levant]] in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Gran|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/568/cu1.htm|title=Tahtawi in Paris|journal=Al-Ahram Weekly Online|issue=568|date=January 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030624173715/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/568/cu1.htm|archivedate=24 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beirut]], [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]] were the main centers of the renaissance and this led to the establishment of schools, universities, Arab theater and printing presses. It also led to the renewal of literary, linguistic and poetic distinctiveness. The emergence of a politically active movement known as the "association" was accompanied by the birth of the idea of Arab nationalism and the demand for reformation of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The emergence of the idea of Arab independence and reformation, led to the calling of the establishment of modern states based on the European-style.

Because Arab Christians formed the educated and bourgeois classes,&lt;ref name="Radai2008"/&gt; they have had a significant impact in politics, business and culture of the Arab World. Some of the most influential Arab nationalists were Arab Christians, and is noteworthy for example, in the press sound Anjoa founder of the «mirror the Middle» in 1879 and the Secretary of Saal founder of the Journal of Law and George Michael Knight founder of the «Egyptian newspaper» in 1888 and Alexander Shalhoub founder of the Journal of the Sultanate in 1897 and [[Saleem Takla]] and his brother Bishara Takla founding the [[Al-Ahram]] newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrill, A.

Many non-Arab Christians suffered a religiously motivated [[Genocide]] at the hands of the Ottomans and their allies in the [[Assyrian genocide]] and the [[Great Famine of Mount Lebanon]] during [[World War I]], which ran in conjunction with the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the [[Greek genocide]].

===Modern era===
Some of the most influential Arab nationalists were Arab Christians, like [[Syrians|Syrian]] intellectual [[Constantin Zureiq]]. Several Arab Christians edited the leading newspapers in Mandatory Palestine including ''[[Falastin (newspaper)|Falastin]]'', edited by the Isa brothers ([[Issa El-Issa]]), and ''[[Al-Karmil (newspaper)|Al-Karmil]]'', which was edited by [[Najib Nassar]]. [[Khalil al-Sakakini]], a prominent Jerusalemite, was also an Arab Orthodox, as was [[George Antonius]], author of ''[[The Arab Awakening]].''

During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], a number of Arab Greek Orthodox communities were affected, including [[al-Bassa]], [[Ramla]], [[Lod]], [[Safed]], [[Kafr Bir'im]], [[Iqrit]], [[Tarbikha]], [[Eilabun]]. In addition around 20,000 Christians fled Haifa, 20,000 fled West Jerusalem, 700 fled Acre and 10,000 fled Jaffa.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} However prominent members remained such as [[Tawfik Toubi]], [[Emile Touma]] and [[Emile Habibi]] and they went on to be leaders of the [[communism|Communist party]] in Israel. [[George Habash]], founder of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] was Arab Christian.

The suicide bomber [[Jules Jammal]], a Syrian military officer, who blew himself up while ramming a French ship, was also an Arab Christian.

Many Palestinian Christians were also active in the formation and governing of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] since 1994.

With the events of the [[Arab Winter]], the Syrian Arab Christian community was heavily hit in line with other Christian communities of Syria, being a victimized by the war and specifically targeted as minority by the Jihadist forces. Many Christians, including Arab Christians, were displaced or fled Syria on the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]].

==Demographics==
===Middle East===
====Egypt====
{{further information|Christianity in Egypt}}
If one excludes the Copts who adhere to an [[ancient Egypt]]ian heritage, the numbers of the Greek Orthodox Church adherents in Egypt, who are ethnically Greek and possibly Arab, is rather small - on the order of several thousands each. There are several isolated Greek Orthodox communities, largely composed of Arabs, in the Sinai Peninsula, though the rest of Egypt also has tiny numbers of other than Copts minorities.

Most Egyptian Christians are [[Copts]], who are mainly members of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. Although Copts in Egypt speak [[Egyptian Arabic]], many of them do not consider themselves to be ethnically Arabs, but rather descendants of the ancient Egyptians. The Copts constitute the largest population of Christians in the [[Middle East]], numbering between 8,000,000 and 15,000,000. The liturgical language of the Copts, the [[Coptic language]], is a direct descendant of the [[Egyptian language]]. Coptic remains the liturgical language of all Coptic churches.

====Iraq====
{{further information|Christianity in Iraq}}
[[File:Badger 1852 Church in Mosul East side.jpg|thumb|Interior of a church in [[Mosul]], 1852.]]
Christianity has a presence in Iraq dating to the first century, and [[Syriac Christianity]], the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac alphabet]] evolved in [[Assyria]] in northern Iraq.
The Arab Christian community in Iraq is relatively small, and further dwindled due to the Iraq War to just several thousands. Most Arab Christians in Iraq belong traditionally to Greek Orthodox and Catholic Churches (excluding the [[Chaldean Christians]]) and are concentrated in major cities such as [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] and [[Mosul]].

The vast majority of the remaining 450,000 to 900,000 Christians in Iraq&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Assyrian people]], who follow [[Syriac Christianity]], most notably the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]] and [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]]. More than two-thirds of Iraqi Christians have fled or immigrated to other countries{{which|date=September 2014}} this century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guide: Christians in the Middle East|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15239529|accessdate=16 November 2011|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2014}}. In the 1987 Iraq census there were 1.4 million Christians in a population of 22 million but the numbers had fallen to 800-900,000 by the outbreak of the 2003 war due to emigration (Irinnews 2006 and BBC article 2010).

While there has been voluntary relocation of many Assyrian Christian families to the [[Assyrian homeland]] in northern Iraq, recent reporting indicates that the overall Christian population may have dropped by as much as 50 percent since the fall of [[Ba'athist Iraq]] in 2003, with many fleeing to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon (2010 est.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant persecution and displacement of Iraqi Christians in [[Mosul]] and other areas held by [[ISIS]] occurred from 2014 onwards, with Christian houses identified with the [[Nun (letter)|Arabic letter "N"]] for "[[Nasrani (Arabic term for Christian)|Nasrani]]" (Christian).&lt;ref&gt;Euronews [http://www.euronews.com/2014/07/22/how-an-arabic-letter-was-reclaimed-to-support-iraqs-persecuted-christians-n ن: How an Arabic letter was reclaimed to support Iraq's persecuted Christians]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baptists in Israel are concentrated in the north of the country, and have four churches in the [[Nazareth]] area, and a [[Nazareth Evangelical Theological Seminary (NETS)|seminary]].

====Lebanon====
{{further information|Christianity in Lebanon}}
Lebanon holds the largest number of Christians in the Arab world proportionally and falls just behind Egypt in absolute numbers. About 350,000 of Christians in Lebanon are Arab Christians and Melchites, while the most dominant group are [[Maronites]] with about 1 million population, whose Arab identity is somewhat disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, M. ''Hybridity, OR the Cultural Logic of Globalization''. p119. Temple University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians formed about 40% of Lebanese citizens after 1920.&lt;ref name="web.macam.ac.il"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lebanese census of 1932 revisited. Who are the Lebanese?|url=http://web.macam.ac.il/~arnon/Int-ME/extra/LEBANESE%20CENSUS%201932.htm|work=yes|publisher=Source: British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, Nov99, Vol. 26 Issue 2, p219, 23p|accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact number of Christians in modern Lebanon is uncertain because no official census has been made in Lebanon since 1932. Lebanese Christians belong mostly to the [[Maronite Church|Maronite]] and [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]] Churches, with sizable minorities belonging to the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. The community of [[Armenians in Lebanon]] is the most politically and demographically significant in the Middle East. Lebanese Christians are the only Christians in the Middle East with a sizable political role in the country. The Lebanese constitution requires that the Lebanese president, half of the cabinet, and half of the parliament follow one of the various Lebanese Christian rites.

While most Maronites claim pre-Arab origins in the region, with relation to [[Mardaites]] and perhaps even Phoenicians of the ancient times, there is no question Arabization of this population, taking place over centuries of Muslim rule and Arab domination in the region. The indigenous Western Aramaic language among the Maronites was abandoned as a spoken tongue by the end of the Middle Ages, making this community also to adopt elements of Arab culture from their Arab Christian and Arab Muslim neighbours. Nevertheless, many Maronites still strongly point out their unique origins, separate from Arab peoples, and predating the Arab migrations to the region. Some Maronites tend to oppose such divergence opinions, and actually see themselves as part of the Arab nation, defined by the Pan-Arab identity. There are even voices aiming to link Maronites with Arabs by bloodline. For example, according to [[Kamal Salibi]] some Maronites may have been descended from an Arabian tribe, who immigrated thousands of years ago from the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Salibi maintains, "It is very possible that the Maronites, as a community of Arabian origin, were among the last Arabian Christian tribes to arrive in Syria before Islam".&lt;ref name="Salibi, Kamal 1988. p. 89"&gt;Salibi, Kamal., A house of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered., University of California Press., Berkeley, 1988. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Palestine ====
{{further information|Christianity in Palestine}}
[[File:Mirjam von Abellin.jpg|thumb|[[Mariam Baouardy|Mariam of Bethlehem]]]]
Most of the [[Palestinian Christians]] identify themselves as Arab Christians culturally and linguistically, some of whom claim descent from the Christian [[Ghassanid]] Arabs and Greeks who settled in the region. Between 36,000-50,000 Christians live in the Palestinian Authority, most of whom belong to the Orthodox (Greek Orthodox and Arab Orthodox) and Catholic (including Melchite) churches. The majority of Palestinian Christians live in the [[Bethlehem]], [[Ramallah]] and [[Nablus]] areas.&lt;ref name=box&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Reuters|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE5491FH20090510|first=Joseph|last=Nasr|title=FACTBOX - Christians in Israel, West Bank and Gaza|date=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Palestinian Arab Christians hold high-ranking positions in Palestinian society, particularly at the political and social levels.

====Syria====
{{further information|Christianity in Syria}}
[[File:Sednaya Mary.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic depicting Mary holding an Arabic text, [[Our Lady of Saidnaya Monastery]], a Greek Orthodox Church in [[Sednaya]], Syria]]

In Syria, according to the 1960 census which recorded just over 4.5 million inhabitants, Christians formed just under 15% of the population (or 675,000). This represents a decline from 20% in 1937, when the population was 3,350.00. The combined population of Syrian and Lebanon in 1910 was estimated at 30% in a population of3.5 million. Since 1960 the population of Syria has increased five-fold, but the Christian population only 3.5 times. Due to political reasons, no newer census has been taken since. Most recent estimates prior to the [[Syrian civil war]] suggested that overall Christians comprised about 10% of the overall population of Syrian 23 million citizens, due to having lower birth rates and higher emigration rates than their Muslim compatriots.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy.html CIA World Factbook, ''People and Society: Syria'']&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a sizeable share of Syrian Christians hold on to their ethnic [[Antiochian Greeks|Antiochian Greek]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] (particularly in the north east), and [[Armenians|Armenian]] origins, with a major recent influx of Assyrian Iraqi Christian refugees into these communities after massacres in Turkey and Iraq during and after WWI and then post-2003. Due to the Syrian civil war, a large number of Christians [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|fled]] the country to Lebanon, Jordan and Europe, though major share of the population still resides in Syria (some being internally displaced).

[[File:John-of-Damascus 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John of Damascus]], an Arab [[monk]] and [[presbyter]], 7th century (Greek [[icon]])]]
The Arab Christians of Syria are [[Greek Orthodox]] and [[Greek Catholic]] (Melkites) as well as some Latin Rite Roman Catholics. Non-Arab Syrian Christians include [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] (mainly in the north east), [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]]-[[Arameans]], [[Greeks]] and [[Armenians]]. The largest Christian denomination in Syria is the Greek Orthodox church,&lt;ref name=USDS /&gt; some of whom are Arab Christians, followed in second place by the Syrian Orthodox, many of whose followers espouse an [[Aramean]] or [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] identity.  The appellation "Greek" refers to the [[liturgy]] they use, sometimes used to refer to the ancestry and ethnicity of the members, however not all members are of Greek ancestry; in fact the Arabic word used is "Rum", which means "Byzantines", or Eastern Romans. Overall, the term is generally used to refer mostly to the Greek liturgy, and the Greek Orthodox denomination in Syria. Arabic is now its main liturgical language. [[Melkite Church]] is another major religious denomination of Arabized Christians in Syria. [[Melkites]], the followers of the [[Greek Catholic Church]] form another major group.

Though religious freedom is allowed in the Syrian Arab Republic, all citizens of Syria including Christians, are subject to the Shari'a-based personal status laws regulating child custody, inheritance, and adoption.&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71432.htm|title=Syria|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of divorce, a woman loses the right to custody of her sons when they reach the age of thirteen and her daughters when they reach the age of fifteen, regardless of religion.&lt;ref name=USDS/&gt;

====Turkey====
{{further information|Christianity in Turkey}}
[[Antiochian Greeks]] who mostly live in [[Hatay Province]], are one of the Arabic-speaking communities in Turkey, their number approximately 18,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/R1HJSB,2,0,Christen_in_der_islamischen_Welt.html Christen in der islamischen Welt – Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte (APuZ 26/2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; They are [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]]. However, they are sometimes known as Arab Christians, primarily because of their language. [[Antioch]] (capital of Hatay Province) is also historical capital of [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]]. Turkey is also home to a number of non Arab [[Armenians in Turkey|Armenians]] (who number around 70,000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armenian in Istanbul: Diaspora in Turkey welcomes the setting of relations and waits more steps from both countries|first=Sara|last=Khojoyan|url=http://armenianow.com/news/10672/armenian_in_istanbul_diaspora_in_t |agency=ArmeniaNow.com|date=16 October 2009|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greeks in Turkey|Greeks]] (who number around 5,000 not including Antiochian Greeks) and [[Assyrians in Turkey|Assyrian Christians]] in the south east.

====Arabian Peninsula====
[[Christianity in Kuwait|Kuwait's native Christian]] population exists, though is essentially small. There are between 259 and 400 Christian Kuwaiti citizens.&lt;ref name=ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/country,,,ANNUALREPORT,KWT,,3ae6a88954,0.html |title=International Religious Freedom Report |work=[[US State Department]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rel/&gt;&lt;ref name="num"&gt;{{cite web |first=Nihal |last=Sharaf |url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/RSS/tabid/69/smid/414/ArticleID/147658/Default.aspx|title='Christians Enjoy Religious Freedom': Church-State ties excellent |work=Arabia Times |year=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125518/http://www.arabtimesonline.com/RSS/tabid/69/smid/414/ArticleID/147658/Default.aspx|archivedate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, there were 259 Christian Kuwaitis residing in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=rel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stat.paci.gov.kw/arabicreports/#DataTabPlace:ColumnChartEduAge |title=Nationality By Religion and Nationality|publisher=Government of Kuwait|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Kuwaitis can be divided into two groups. The first group includes the earliest Kuwaiti Christians, who originated from [[Iraq]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="num"/&gt; They have assimilated into Kuwaiti society, like their Muslim counterparts, and tend to speak Arabic with a [[Kuwaiti Arabic|Kuwaiti dialect]]; their [[Kuwaiti cuisine|food]] and [[Culture of Kuwait|culture]] are also predominantly Kuwaiti. The make up roughly a quarter of Kuwait's Christian population. The rest (roughly three-quarters) of Christian Kuwaitis make up the second group. They are more recent arrivals in the 1950s and 1960s, mostly Kuwaitis of Palestinian ancestry who were forced out of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] after 1948.&lt;ref name="num"/&gt; There are also smaller numbers who originally hail from [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="num"/&gt; This second group is not as assimilated as the first group, as their [[Levantine cuisine|food]], [[Levant#Culture|culture]], and [[Levantine Arabic|Arabic dialect]] still retain a [[Levant]] feel. However, they are just as patriotic as the former group, and tend to be proud of their adopted homeland, with many serving in the army, police, civil, and foreign service. Most of Kuwait's citizen Christians belong to 12 large families, with the Shammas (from Turkey) and the Shuhaibar (from Palestine) families being some of the more prominent ones.&lt;ref name="num"/&gt;

[[Christianity in Bahrain|Native Christians]] who hold Bahraini citizenship number approximately 1,000 persons.&lt;ref name=2010Census&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census2010.gov.bh/results_en.php|title=2010 Census Results|accessdate=June 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320104234/http://www.census2010.gov.bh/results_en.php|archive-date=20 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Christians are originally from [[Iraq]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Jordan]], with a small minority having lived in Bahrain for many centuries; the majority have been living as Bahraini citizens for less than a century. There are also smaller numbers of native Christians who originally hail from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[India]].

The majority of Christian Bahraini citizens tend to be [[Orthodox Christian]]s, with the largest church by membership being the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. They enjoy many equal religious and social freedom. Bahrain has Christian members in the Bahraini government.

===North Africa===
{{further|Christianity in Algeria|Christianity in Morocco|Christianity in Libya|Christianity in Tunisia}}
There are tiny communities of [[Roman Catholics]] in [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Libya]], and [[Morocco]] due to colonial rule - French rule for Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, Spanish rule for Morocco and Western Sahara, and Italian rule for Libya. Most Christians in [[North Africa]] are foreign missionaries, immigrant workers, and people of [[Pied-Noir|French]], Spanish, and Italian colonial descent. The North African Christians of Berber or Arab descent mostly converted during the modern era or under and after [[France|French]] [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=7ly4DgtT3LkC&amp;pg=PA653&amp;dq=Moroccan+christianity&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1AOzVIOpOcm0ygPF-IKYAw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Moroccan%20christianity&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity: J-O|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldreview.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreview.info/content/rising-numbers-christians-islamic-countries-could-pose-threat-social-order|title=Rising numbers of Christians in Islamic countries could pose threat to social order|publisher=World Review|date=2013|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320051546/http://www.worldreview.info/content/rising-numbers-christians-islamic-countries-could-pose-threat-social-order|archivedate=20 March 2016|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, many more Maghrebi Christians of Arab or Berber descent live in [[France]] than in North Africa, due to the exodus of the ''[[pieds-noirs]]'' in the 1960s. [[Charles de Foucauld]] was renowned for his missions in North Africa among Muslims, including African Arabs.

===Diaspora===
{{further information|Christian emigration}}
Hundreds of thousands of Arab Christians also live in the [[diaspora]], outside of the Middle East. They reside in such countries as [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Mexico]], the [[United States]] and [[Venezuela]] among them. There are also many Arab Christians in [[Europe]], especially in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] (due to its historical connections with [[Lebanon]] and North Africa), and [[Spain]] (due to its historical connections with northern Morocco), and to a lesser extent in [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Among those, across Europe and the Americas, an estimated 400,000 Arab Christians are living in the [[Palestinian diaspora]].

==Doctrine==
Like Arab Muslims, Arab Christians refer to God as [[Allah]], as an Arabic word for "God".&lt;ref name=Georgep70&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1L7sx_pR3_EC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=allah+god+christians+arabic&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=allah%20god%20christians%20arabic&amp;f=false |title=Is the Father of Jesus the God of Muhammad?: understanding the differences between Christianity and Islam|author=Timothy George|publisher=Zondervan|year=2002|ISBN=978-0-310-24748-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kayep9&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K392AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=allah+%22arab+jews%22+arabic&amp;dq=allah+%22arab+jews%22+arabic&amp;cd=7|title=The colors of Jews: Racial Politics and Radical Diasporism|author=Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz|edition=Illustrated, annotated|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-253-21927-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term Allah in Arab Christian churches predates [[Islam]] by several centuries.&lt;ref name=Georgep70/&gt; In more recent times (especially since the mid-19th century), some Arab Christians from the Levant region have been converted from these native, traditional churches to more recent [[Protestant]] ones, most notably [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] churches. This is mostly due to an influx of [[Western world|Western]], predominantly [[United States|American]] Evangelical, [[missionaries]].

==Affiliated communities==
The Arab Christians largely belong to the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem]] or [[Antiochian Eastern-Orthodox]] and [[Antiochian Oriental-Orthodox]] Churches, though there are also adherents to other churches: [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]], [[Latin Catholic Church]] and [[Protestant Church]]es.

===Melkites===
Arabized [[Melkite]] societies in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Palestine, trace their roots to Greek and Aramaic-speaking Byzantine Christians. They are also generally included under the definition of Arab Christians, although this label is not universally accepted by all.

===Greek Orthodox===
[[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], also known as [[Rûm]], Orthodox [[Christian]] communities, part of the [[Rum Millet|Rūm Millet]], which have existed in Southern [[Anatolia]] (Turkey) and [[Syria (region)|Syrian region]] since the early years of Christianity: they are generally affiliated along geographic lines either to the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antiochian]] ("Northern") or [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalemite]] ("Southern") [[Patriarchate|patriarchal]] jurisdictions.

====Rum Christians====
Many members of the Northern Antiochian communities still call themselves [[Rûm]] which literally means "Roman", or "Asian Greek" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]. In that particular context, the term ''"Rûm"'' is used in preference to ''"Yāvāni"'' or ''"Ionani"'' which means "European-[[wikt:Greek|Greek]]" or [[Ionia]]n in [[Biblical Hebrew]] (borrowed from Old Persian ''Yavan'' = Greece) and Classical Arabic. Some members of the community also call themselves "Melkites", which literally means ''"monarchists"'' or ''"supporters of the emperor"'' in [[Semitic languages]] (a reference to their past allegiance to [[Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] imperial rule), but, in the modern era, the term tends to be more commonly used by followers of the [[Greek Catholic]] church.

====Orthodox Church of Jerusalem====
{{main article|Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Arab Orthodox Society}}
Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem is an autocephalous Orthodox Church within the wider communion of Orthodox Christianity. The [[Arab Orthodox Society]] exists in [[Jerusalem]] and is one of the oldest and largest is the [[Arab Orthodox Benevolent Society]] in Beit Jala, Palestine.

There have been numerous disputes between the Arab and the Greek leadership of the church in Jerusalem from the Mandate onwards. Jordan encouraged the Greeks to open the Brotherhood to Arab members of the community between 1948 and 1967 when the [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|West Bank was under Jordanian rule]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Land and political disputes have also been common since 1967, with the Greek priests portrayed as collaborators with Israel. Land disputes include the sale of St. John's property in the Christian quarter on April 11, 1990, the transfer of fifty [[dunam]]s near [[Mar Elias Monastery|Mar Elias]] monastery, and the sale of two hotels and twenty-seven stores on [[Omar Bin Al-Khattab]] square near the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. A dispute between the [[Palestinian Authority]] and the Greek [[Patriarch Irenaios]] led to the Patriarch being pushed aside because of accusations of a real estate deal with Israel.

====Orthodox Church of Alexandria====
[[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] is an autocephalous Byzantine Rite jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Church, having the African continent as its canonical territory. It is commonly called the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria to distinguish it from the Oriental Orthodox Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria. Members of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate were once known as Melkites, because they remained in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople after the schism that followed the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The Orthodox Christian community of Egypt is thus unaffiliated with Copts and does mostly adhere to an Arab identity.

===Evangelic adherents===
Some Arab Christians are a more recent end result of Evangelization.&lt;ref name="Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background"/&gt;

==Question of identity==
Arab Christians include descendants of ancient Arab tribes, who were among the first Christian converts, as well as some recent adherents of Christianity. Sometimes, however, the issue of self-identification arises regarding specific Christian communities across the Arab world.

===Assyrians===
{{main article|Assyrian people}}
The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], form the majority of Christians in [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]], south-east [[Turkey]] and north-west [[Iran]]. They are specifically defined as ''non-Arab'' [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] ethnic group, including by the governments of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Israel and Turkey.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Assyrians practice their own native dialects of [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-[[Aramaic]] language, in addition to also sometimes speaking local Arabic, Turkish or Farsi dialects. Despite their ancient pre-Arabic roots and distinct linguo-cultural identities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.cambriapress.com/abi/9781604975833abi.pdf|title=New book announcement: Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans Intercommunal Relations on the Periphery of the Ottoman Empire|publisher=Cambria Press|date= |accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assyrians are sometimes erroneously referred by Western sources as "Christians of the Arab World" or "Arabic Christians", creating confusion about their identity &lt;ref&gt;[http://conference.osu.eu/globalization/publ/08-bohac.pdf "In spite of the widespread geographical imaginations of the Middle East as an Arabic and Islamic monolith, supported by Western mass media and some Middle Eastern states high politicians, the Middle East is quite a heterogeneous region. This region comprises numerous ethnic national, religious, linguistic or ethno-religious groups."] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Assyrians were also wrongly related as "Arab Christians" by pan-Arabist movements and Arab-Islamic regimes.&lt;ref name="PharesIntro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://conference.osu.eu/globalization/publ/08-bohac.pdf "Assyrians are an ethnically, linguistically and religiously distinct minority in the Middle Eastern region."] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ascent of the nationalist [[Ba'ath party]] in Iraq in 1963 Assyrian Christians were referred to as "Arab Christians" by Arab nationalists who denied the existence of a distinct Assyrian identity, despite Assyrians speaking the ''pre-Arab'' [[Aramaic language]] and being a pre-Arab indigenous people of [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n heritage with a 5,000-year history in the region (see [[Assyrian continuity]]). In 1972 a law was passed to use [[Syriac language]] in public schools and in media, shortly afterwards however Syriac was banned and Arabic was imposed on Syriac language magazines and newspapers.&lt;ref name="fred"&gt;[http://www.nineveh.com/IndigenousPeopleinDistress.html Indigenous People in Distress], Fred Aprim&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the 1977 census, Assyrians were being incorrectly referred to as either Arabs or [[Kurds]]. Assyrian Christians were forced to deny their identity as [[Assyrian nationalism]] was harshly punished. One example of this "[[Arabization]]" program was Iraqi deputy prime minister, [[Tariq Aziz]], an Assyrian member of the [[Chaldean Catholic]] faith who changed his surname from ''Mikhael Youhana'' upon joining the Baath Party.&lt;ref name=assyrianbar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=J.

By the 1990s Assyrians were exempt from the [[Oil-for-Food program]] and did not receive their monthly food rations.&lt;ref name="assyrianbar"/&gt; Many Assyrians were expelled from their villages in northern Iraq, others were forced to replace their Mesopotamian or Syriac names with Arab ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813002800/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CUSCIS%2C%2CIRQ%2C%2C3f520de14%2C0.html |archivedate=13 August 2011 |publisher=United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services |accessdate=16 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They likewise pointed out that Arab nationalist groups have wrongly included Assyrian-Americans in their head count of Arab Americans, in order to bolster their political clout in Washington. Some [[Arab American]] groups have imported this denial of Assyrian identity to the United States. In 2001, a coalition of Assyrian-Chaldean and Maronite church organizations, wrote to the [[Arab-American Institute]], to reprimand them for claiming that Assyrians were Arabs. They asked the Arab-American Institute "to cease and desist from portraying Assyrians and Maronites of past and present as Arabs, and from speaking on behalf of Assyrians and Maronites."&lt;ref name=assyrianbar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/releases/caamletter.htm|title=Coalition of American Assyrians and Maronites Rebukes Arab American Institute|publisher=Assyrian International News Agency|date=27 October 2001|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maronites===
{{further information|Maronites}}
At the March 1936 Congress of the Coast and Four Districts, the Muslim leadership at this conference made the declaration that Lebanon was an Arab country, indistinguishable from its Arab neighbors. In the April 1936 Beirut municipal elections, Christian Maronite and Muslim Politicians were divided along Phoenician and Arab lines in concern of whether the Lebanese coast should be claimed by Syria or given to Lebanon, increasing the already mounting tensions between the two communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0d1SnaKLQ9QC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Maronites+and+Phoenicianism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WnKO0psjqM&amp;sig=yB1CN6LDofTukRZLO8eZkc22pbA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=okV9S8C0Koay0gTIk5jLBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&amp;q=Christian%20and%20Muslim&amp;f=false |title=Reviving Phoenicia: The Search for Identity in Lebanon|publisher=I.B.Tauris |date=2004 |author=Asher Kauffman |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanese nationalism, which rejects Arab identity, has found a strong support among some Maronites and even other Orthodox Christians. However, this form of nationalism, nicknamed [[Phoenicianism]], never developed into an integrated ideology led by key thinkers, but there are a few who stood out more than others: [[Charles Corm]], [[Michel Chiha]], and [[Said Aql]] in their promotion of Phoenicianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0d1SnaKLQ9QC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Maronites+and+Phoenicianism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WnKO0psjqM&amp;sig=yB1CN6LDofTukRZLO8eZkc22pbA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=okV9S8C0Koay0gTIk5jLBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Phoenician%20narrative&amp;f=false |title=Reviving Phoenicia: The Search for Identity in Lebanon|publisher=I.B.Tauris |date=2004 |author=Asher Kauffman |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post civil-war Lebanon, since the [[Taif Agreement]], politically Phoenicianism, as an alternate to Arabism, has been restricted to a small group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0d1SnaKLQ9QC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Maronites+and+Phoenicianism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WnKO0psjqM&amp;sig=yB1CN6LDofTukRZLO8eZkc22pbA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=okV9S8C0Koay0gTIk5jLBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=restricted%20to%20a%20small%20group&amp;f=false |title=Reviving Phoenicia: The Search for Identity in Lebanon|publisher=I.B.Tauris|date=2004 |author=Asher Kauffman |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoeniciansm is deeply disputed by some scholars, who have on occasion tried to convince these claims are false and to embrace and accept the Arab identity instead.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oak3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Said+Aql&amp;ei=X_BzSJffLoHIigHs-s31Bw&amp;sig=ACfU3U1ILWYsistac9QAr9Y4WQoAT_Yutw|title=The Middle East: From Transition to Development|publisher=Brill Archive |date=1985 |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemal Salibi, ''A House of Many Mansions''.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict of ideas of an identity is believed to be one of the main pivotal disputes between the Muslim and Maronite Christian populations of Lebanon and what mainly divides the country from national unity.&lt;ref name="mountlebanon.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountlebanon.org/theidentityoflebanon.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727094149/http://www.mountlebanon.org/theidentityoflebanon.htm|archivedate=2011-07-27 |title=The Identity of Lebanon |publisher=Mountlebanon.org |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's generalized that Muslims focus more on the Arab identity of Lebanese history and culture whereas Christians focus on the pre-arabized &amp; non-Arab spectrum of the Lebanese identity and rather refrain from the Arab specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountlebanon.org |title=Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Catholic Church: Easton, Pennsylvania &amp; Kfarsghab, Lebanon |publisher=Mountlebanon.org |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a final session of the Lebanese Parliament, a [[Marada]] Maronite MP states his identity as an Arab: "I, the Maronite Christian Lebanese Arab, grandson of Patriarch Estefan Doueihy, declare my pride to be a part of our people's resistance in the South. Can one renounce what guarantees his rights?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2009/12/11/the-vote-of-confidence-debate-final-session/ |title=The vote of confidence debate – final session |location=LB |publisher=Ya Libnan |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aramean identity===
{{Main article|Arameans in Israel}}
A number of [[Syriac Christianity|Syrian Christians]], mainly adherents of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Syriac Catholic Church]] in [[Syria]] adhere to an [[Aramean]] identity harking back to ancient [[Aramea]] which encompassed most of what is today modern Syria. They are now almost exclusively Arabic speaking, though small numbers still retain their native [[Western Aramaic]] tongue. Many use the term [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]]-[[Aramean]] to describe themselves, and have their own [[Aramean flag]] and migrant communities from Syria (particularly in [[Scandinavia]] have their own football and sports teams.

In contrast to most Arab Christians in Israel, a handful of Arabic-speaking Christian Israelis do not consider themselves Arab, noting their non-Arab, Aramean ancestry as a source. This is especially evident in the Maronite-dominated city of [[Jish]] in Galilee, where Aramean nationalists have been trying to resurrect Aramaic as a spoken language. In September 2014, Israel recognized the "Aramean" ethnic identity, in which Arabic-speaking Christians of Israel, with Aramean affinity, can now register as "Aramean" rather than Arab. This recognition comes after about seven years of activity by the Aramean Christian Foundation in Israel, led by [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Major Shadi Khalloul Risho and the Israeli Christian Recruitment Forum, headed by [[Father Gabriel Naddaf]] of the Greek-Orthodox Church and Major Ihab Shlayan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/24936/Default.aspx |title=Israeli Christians Officially Recognized as Arameans, Not Arabs|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aramean ethnic identity can be given to Aramaic-speaking adherents of five Christian Eastern Syriac churches in Israel, including the [[Maronite Church]], [[Greek Orthodox]] Church, [[Greek Catholic]] Church, [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] Church and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|quote=The Interior Ministry contended that in order to be recognized as Aramean, one should be conversant in the Aramaic language, and come from the Maronite, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Syriac Catholic or Orthodox Aramaic factions, the i24 news outlet reported.|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-christians-may-define-themselves-as-aramean/|title=Israeli Christians may define themselves as Aramean|first=Lazar|last=Berman|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-registration of Arameans began in October 2014, and first will be applied to 200 [[Maronites in Israel|Maronite]] families of Jish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.616299|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917165653/http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.616299|archivedate=2014-09-17|title=Israel Recognizes Aramean Minority in Israel as Separate Nationality|work=Haaretz |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had already requested such recognition; in further future it is expected to apply to up to 10,000 Israeli citizens, formerly registered as Arab Christians. According to Shadi Khalloul, one of the initiators of the move, "All Christians from the 133,000 Christians who live in Israel and belong to one of the Eastern churches can now be listed as a Aramean...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Yori|last=Yalon|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=20169 |title='Aramean' officially recognized as nationality in Israel|work=Israel Hayom|date=17 September 2014|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was met also with opposition by large parts of the Arab Christian society and was denounced by the Greek Orthodox Christian Patriarchate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Christian-News/Israeli-Greek-Orthodox-Denounce-Move-to-Differentiate-Christians-from-Arabs-376493|title=Israeli Greek Orthodox Church denounces Aramaic Christian nationality|work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pan-Syrian identity===
Although the majority of the followers of [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] and [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Catholic]] Churches in the Levant adhere to Arab nationalism, some politicians reject [[Arabism]], such as the [[secular]] Greek Orthodox [[Antun Saadeh]], founder of the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party|SSNP]], who was executed for advocating the abolition of the Lebanese state by the [[Kataeb]] led government in the 1940s. Saadeh rejected [[Arab Nationalism]] (the idea that the speakers of the [[Arabic language]] form a single, unified nation), and argued instead for the creation of the state of [[United Syrian Nation or Natural Syria]] encompassing the [[Fertile Crescent]]. Saadeh rejected both language and religion as defining characteristics of a nation, and instead argued that nations develop through the common development of a people inhabiting a specific geographical region. He was thus a strong opponent of both Arab nationalism and [[Pan-Islamism]]. He argued that Syria was historically, culturally, and geographically distinct from the rest of the Arab world, which he divided into four parts.  He traced Syrian history as a distinct entity back to the [[Phoenicians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Amorites]], [[Arameans]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssnp.org/new/library/saadeh/principles/ |title=المكتبة السورية القومية الاجتماعية |publisher=Ssnp.Com |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic studies==

===Relation of Levantine populations to Phoenicians===
A study in the genetic marker of the Phoenicians led by [[Pierre Zalloua]], showed that the Phoenician genetic marker was found in 1 out of 17 males in the region surrounding the Mediterranean and Phoenician trading centers such as the [[Levant]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Malta]]. The study focused on the male [[Y-chromosome]] of a sample of 1,330 males from the [[Mediterranean]]. [[Colin Groves]], biological anthropologist of the Australian National University in Canberra says that the study does not suggest that the Phoenicians were restricted to a certain place, but that their [[DNA]] still lingers 3,000 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/89591997.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604072549/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/89591997.html|archivedate=2011-06-04 |title=Photo: Phoenician Blood Endures 3,000 Years, DNA Study Shows |work=National Geographic |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7700356.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=DNA legacy of ancient seafarers |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |first=Paul |last=Rincon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lebanon, almost one-third of the population carry the Phoenician gene in their DNA. This Phoenician signature is distributed equally among different groups (both Christians and Muslims) in Lebanon and that the overall genetic makeup of the Lebanese was found to be similar across various backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7791389.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Divided Lebanon's common genes |date=20 December 2008 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |first=Natalia |last=Antelava}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenician gene in this study refers to [[haplogroup J2]] plus the [[haplotypes]] PCS1+ to PCS6+, however the study also states that the Phoenicians also likely had other [[haplogroups]].&lt;ref name="ZallouaPlatt2008"&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|url=http://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdf/S0002-9297(08)00547-8.pdf|last1=Zalloua|first1=Pierre A.|display-authors=etal|title=Identifying Genetic Traces of Historical Expansions: Phoenician Footprints in the Mediterranean|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=83 |issue=5 |year=2008 |pages=633–642|issn=0002-9297|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.10.012|accessdate=16 August 2016|pmid=18976729|pmc=2668035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the study found that the J2 ("old levantine haplogroup") was found in an "unusually high proportion" (about 20-30%) among Levantine people such as the Syrians, Lebanese and the Palestinians.&lt;ref name=reuters1009/&gt; The ancestor [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|haplogroup J]] is common to about 50% of the Arabic-speaking people of the Southwest Asian portion of the Middle East.&lt;ref name=reuters1009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/09/12/lifestyle-phoenicians-dna-dc-idUKL0559096520070912?sp=true|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018192325/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/09/12/lifestyle-phoenicians-dna-dc-idUKL0559096520070912?sp=true|archivedate=2012-10-18 |title=In Lebanon DNA may yet heal rifts |publisher=Reuters |date=10 September 2007|accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arbeid Adelt''' (AA; English: ''Labour Is Ennobling''), full name '''Algemeen Nederlandsche Vrouwenvereeniging Arbeid Adelt''', was a women's rights organisation active in the [[Netherlands]] from 1871 to 1953. It was the first nationwide women's organisation in the Netherlands.

== Origins ==
The organisation was founded by [[Betsy Perk]]. It was inspired by the debate over women's access to education and different professions, which had been initiated in the Netherlands by [[Mienette Storm-van der Chijs]] in the 1860s. The purpose of the organisation was to work for more access to education and professions for women, and to actively support women to support themselves professionally.  

In 1870 women had started to craft and sell products for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. Betsy Perk saw this as an opportunity to encourage more women to sell their work. In October 1871 she founded the 'Algemeen Nederlandsche Vrouwenvereeniging Arbeid Adelt' (General Dutch Women's Association Arbeid Adelt) along with its own magazine, ''Onze Roeping'' (Our Calling). The association mostly focused their efforts on unmarried women from the higher classes. In December 1871, an exhibition was organised in [[Delft]] where women's crafts could be bought. The names of the makers were presented along the items, which was a new phenomenon and was meant to highlight the fact that these women were craftsmen willing to make profit, too. The exhibition became successful and was even visited by the Dutch Queen [[Sophie of Württemberg]], who became a patron of the association. 

== Split and reunification ==
In April 1872 a fight between board members caused a split within the association. Part of the members decided to found the 'Vereniging Tesselschade', named after [[Maria Tesselschade Roemers Visscher]]. This organisation wished to focus more on the support of less-well-off women, who were allowed to sell their works anonymously. This was contrary to what Betsy Perk stood for, as she wanted wealthier women to make a name for themselves by selling products under their own name. 

Both associations decided to join forces again in 1947, after a successful exhibition on needlework. Due to discussions about organisational issues the groups didn't actually fuse until 1953. From then on, the association became known as Tesselschade-Arbeid Adelt, and still exists today. TAA, among other things, has several shops throughout the Netherlands where women can sell their articles. The association also has two funds, one for female students (the Betsy Perk-Opleidingsfonds) and one for (retired) craftswomen who can't support themselves anymore (the Zegers Veeckenfonds).

'''Aristocracy of Norway''' refers to [[Modern history|modern]] and [[Medieval Ages|medieval]] [[aristocracy]] in [[Norway]]. Additionally, there have been economical, political, and military élites that{{mdash}}relating to the main lines of [[History of Norway|Norway's history]]{{mdash}}are generally accepted as nominal predecessors of the aforementioned. Since the 16th century, modern aristocracy is known as nobility ({{lang-no|adel}}).

The very first aristocracy in today's Norway appeared during the [[Bronze Age]] (1800 BC{{ndash}}500 BC). This bronze aristocracy consisted of several regional élites, whose earliest known existence dates to 1500 BC. Via similar structures in the Iron Age (400 BC{{ndash}}793 AD), these entities would reappear as [[Petty kingdoms of Norway|petty kingdoms]] before and during the [[Viking Age|Age of Vikings]] (793{{ndash}}1066). Beside a chieftain or petty king, each kingdom had its own aristocracy.

Between 872 and 1050, during the so-called [[Unification of Norway|unification process]], the first national aristocracy began to develop. Regional monarchs and aristocrats who recognised King [[Harald Fairhair|Harald I]] as their [[high king]], would normally receive [[vassal]]age [[Royal and noble ranks|titles]] like [[Earl]]. Those who refused were defeated or chose to migrate to [[Iceland]], establishing an aristocratic, [[Icelandic Commonwealth|clan-ruled state]] there. The subsequent [[Lendmann|lendman]] aristocracy in Norway{{mdash}}powerful feudal lords and their families{{mdash}}ruled their respective regions with great autonomy. Their status was by no means equal to that of modern nobles; they were nearly half royal. For example, [[Ingibiorg Finnsdottir|Ingebjørg Finnsdottir]] of the Arnmødling dynasty was married to King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]]. During the [[Civil war era in Norway|civil war era]] (1130{{ndash}}1240) the old lendmen were severely weakened, and many disappeared. This aristocracy was ultimately defeated by King [[Sverre of Norway|Sverre I]] and the [[Birkebeiner|Birchlegs]], subsequently being replaced by supporters of Sverre.

Primarily between the 9th and 13th centuries, the aristocracy was not limited to mainland [[Norway]], but appeared in and ruled parts of the [[British Isles]] as well as [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Kingdoms, city states, and other types of entities, for example the [[Kingdom of Dublin]], were established or possessed either by Norwegians or by native vassals. Other territories, for example [[Shetland]] and the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]], were directly absorbed into the kingdom. For example, the [[Earl of Orkney]] was a Norwegian nobleman.

The nobility{{mdash}}known as [[hird]] and then as knights and squires{{mdash}}was institutionalised during the formation of the Norwegian state in the 13th century. Originally granted an advisory function as servants of the king, the nobility grew into becoming a great political factor. Their land and their armed forces, and also their legal power as members of the [[Riksråd|Council of the Realm]], made the nobility remarkably independent from the king. At its height, the council had the power to recognise or choose inheritors of or pretenders to the Throne. In 1440, they dethroned King [[Eric of Pomerania|Eric III]]. The council even chose its own leaders as regents, among others [[Sigurd Jonsson (regent)|Sigurd Jonsson of Sudreim]]. This aristocratic power, which also involved the church, lasted until the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], when the king illegally abolished the council in 1536. This would nearly remove all of the nobility's political foundation, leaving them with mainly administrative and ceremonial functions. Subsequent immigration of [[Danish nobility|Danish nobles]] (who thus became Norwegian nobles) would further marginalise the position of natives. In the 17th century, the old nobility consisted almost entirely of Danes.

After 1661, when [[absolute monarchy]] was introduced, the old nobility was gradually replaced by a new. This consisted mainly of [[Citizen|merchants and officials]] who had recently been ennobled but also of foreign nobles who were naturalised. Dominant elements in the new nobility were the [[Nobles of the Robe|office nobility]] (noble status by holding high civilian or military offices) and{{mdash}}especially prominent in the 18th century{{mdash}}the [[Briefadel|letter nobility]] (noble status via [[letters patent]] in return for military or artistic achievements or monetary donations). Based on the 1665 ''Lex Regia'', which stated that the king was to be ''revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, [...] except God alone'', the king had his hands free to develop a new and loyal aristocracy to honour his absolute reign. The nobilities in [[Denmark–Norway|Denmark and Norway]] could, likewise, bask in the glory of one of the most monarchial states in Europe. The titles of baron and count were introduced in 1671, and in 1709 and 1710, [[List of marquises in Norway|two marquisates]] (the only ones in Scandinavia) were created. Additionally, hundreds of families were ennobled, i.e., without titles. Demonstrating his omnipotence, the monarch could even revert noble status [[Void (law)|ab initio]], as if ennoblement had never happened, and elevate dead humans to the estate of nobles. A rich aristocratic culture developed during this epoch, for example family names like Gyldenpalm (lit. 'Golden Palm'), Svanenhielm (lit. 'Swan Helm'), and Tordenskiold (lit. 'Thunder Shield'), many of them containing [[Nobiliary particle|particles]] like French ''de'' and German ''von''. Likewise, excessive creation of [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] boosted [[Norwegian heraldry|heraldic culture and praxis]], including [[visual arts]].

The 1814 [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution]] forbade the creation of new nobility, including [[countship]]s, [[feudal barony|baronies]], family estates, and [[fee tail]]s. The 1821 [[Nobility Law (Norway)|Nobility Law]] initiated a long-range abolition of the nobility as an official estate, a process in which current bearers were allowed to keep their status and possible titles as well as some privileges for the rest of their lifetime. The last legally noble Norwegians died in the early 20th century. Many Norwegians who had noble status in Norway had it in Denmark, too, where they remained officially noble.

During the 19th century, members of noble families continued to hold political and social power, for example [[Severin Løvenskiold]] as [[Governor-general of Norway]] and [[Peder Anker]] and [[Mathias Sommerhielm]] as [[List of heads of government of Norway|Prime Minister]]. Aristocrats were active in Norway's independence movement in 1905, and it has been claimed the union with Sweden was dissolved thanks to a 'genuinely aristocratic wave'. Baron [[Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg|Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg's]] personal effors contributed to Norway gaining sovereignty of the arctic archipelago [[Svalbard]] in 1920. From 1912 to 1918, [[Bredo Henrik von Munthe af Morgenstierne]] was [[List of rectors for the University of Oslo|Rector]] of the [[University of Oslo]]. When Norway co-founded and entered [[NATO]], ambassador [[Wilhelm Morgenstierne]] represented the kingdom when US President [[Henry Truman|Truman]] signed the treaty in 1949. Whilst they now acted as individuals rather than a unified estate, these and many other noblemen played a significant public rôle, mainly until the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1940{{ndash}}1945).

Today, Norway has approximately 10-15 families who were formerly recognised as noble by [[List of Norwegian monarchs|Norwegian kings]]. These include [[Anker (noble family)|Anker]], [[Aubert (noble family)|Aubert]], [[Falsen (noble family)|Falsen]], [[Galtung (noble family)|Galtung]], [[Huitfeldt (noble family)|Huitfeldt]], [[Knagenhjelm (noble family)|Knagenhjelm]], [[Løvenskiold]], [[Munthe af Morgenstierne (noble family)|Munthe af Morgenstierne]], [[Treschow (Dano-Norwegian family)|Treschow]], [[Werenskiold (noble family)|Werenskiold]], and the [[Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg]]. In addition, there are nonnoble families who descend patrilineally from individuals who once had personal (nonhereditary) noble status, for example the [[Paus]] family and several families of the void ''ab initio'' office nobility. There is even [[foreign nobility in Norway]], mainly Norwegian families originating in other countries and who have or had noble status there.

== Primeval aristocracy ==
[[File:Vikingshipkils.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Oseberg ship]] was part of a 9th-century burial.]]

=== Genesis ===
The earliest times in today's [[Norway]] (c. 10000 BC{{spaced ndash}}c. 1800 BC) had a relatively flat [[social structure]], often based on [[kinship]]. People were [[Hunting|hunters]] and [[Hunter-gatherer|gatherer]]s who moved over distances in small parties.

However, in the latest part of the [[Stone Age]], some time before 4000 BC, permanent settlements were established in gradually increasing numbers.&lt;ref name="Lillehammer 1994 52-79"/&gt; Before and parallelly with the introduction of [[agriculture]] c. 2500 BC, [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherer societies]] became larger [[Tribute|tribute societies]] with elements of [[Social stratification|stratification]]. Transition to agriculture was both a condition for and triggered the genesis of the very first [[aristocracy]] on the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]]. The first known aristocracy appeared no later than c. 1500 BC.

Comparatively, transition to agriculture happened c. 9000 BC in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and c. 4000 BC in the [[British Isles]]. The most obvious reason for Scandinavia's relatively late transition is the [[Last glacial period|Weichsel glaciation]], i.e. the latest [[ice age]]. Norway was almost wholly covered by ice until c. 7000 BC, and most of the ice sheet was not melted until c. 6000 BC.

=== Bronze Age ===
[[File:Gravhauge1.jpg|thumb|Burial mound in [[Western Norway]].]]
[[File:Solvogn.jpg|thumb|The [[Trundholm sun chariot|Sun Chariot]], [[Denmark]], confirms consumption of luxury goods.]]

The first known aristocracy in today's [[Norway]] existed in the [[Bronze Age]] (c. 1800 BC{{spaced ndash}}c. 500 BC) and no later than c. 1500 BC. For this reason, it is called a bronze aristocracy ({{lang-no|bronsearistokrati}}).&lt;ref name="Johansen 2000 86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lillehammer 1994 109"/&gt; During this age, settlements became more [[Social stratification|divided into classes]] as a new dimension appeared: [[Socioeconomics|socio-economical differences]].

Based on access to and physical control of natural resources, such as [[fur]]s, [[walrus ivory|walrus teeth]], and other goods that were desired by foreigners, a social élite was able to acquire foreign metals. [[Bronze]] is essential in this regard. By importing bronze, which they also established a [[monopoly]] on, leading persons and their families would not only express their power but even strengthen and increase it. Bronze was also militarily important. It enabled a limited number of possessors to make weapons stronger than those of stone, and unlike the latter, broken bronze weapons could be melted and reshaped. Common people continued to use tools and weapons of stone during the whole age.

Through trade and cultural exchange, the bronze aristocracy was part of the contemporary civilisation in [[Europe]], despite being placed in the geographical outskirts of it.&lt;ref name="Johansen 2000 139"/&gt; Continental impulses, for example new religious customs and decorative design, arrived relatively early.&lt;ref name="Johansen 2000 146"/&gt;

Although there was an established aristocracy, the pyramidal social structure is not similar to the [[feudalism|feudal system]] of the much later [[Middle Ages|Medieval Age]]. Beside other factors, it has been suggested that agricultural production was insufficient to supply an élite that itself did not participate. In general, it is considered as unlikely that the élite possessed total power.&lt;ref name="Johansen 2000 136-137"/&gt; Furthermore, power may not only have been based on weapons. Also religious and ancestral factors are important when explaining how certain persons or families managed to maintain authority for generations. For example, impressive burial mounds could consolidate imaginations of a clan's right to an area.

The bronze aristocracy is known primarily through [[Tumulus|burial mounds]], for example a mound (c. 1200 BC) in Jåsund, [[Western Norway]], where an apparently mighty man was buried together with a big bronze sword. Other mounds were filled with bronze weapons and bronze artefacts, for example rings, necklaces, and decorative daggers. The biggest mounds could be up to 8–9 metres in height and 40 metres in diameter.&lt;ref name="Johansen 2000 93"/&gt; A construction like this required the work of ten men for about four weeks.&lt;ref name="Johansen 2000 95"/&gt;

The bronze aristocracy faced a challenge when the position of bronze was taken over by [[iron]]. Unlike bronze, which remained an aristocratically controlled metal through the whole age, iron was found in rich amounts in the nature, especially in bogs, and was thus owned and used by broader layers of the population.&lt;ref name="Johansen 2000 252"/&gt;

=== Early and Late Iron Age ===
[[File:Noble Women Oseberg Viking Ship Norway.JPG|thumb|Oseberg skeletal remains of an aristocrat and perhaps her female servant or slave.]]

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] examination of graves of the [[Iron Age|Early Iron Age]] (c. 400 BC{{spaced ndash}}c. AD 500) has revealed three distinct [[Social stratification|social strata]]. Ordinary farmers were cremated and buried in simple, flat graves. (Whilst this sort of burial had existed in the [[Bronze Age]], too, the cremation part was a recently imported custom from Continental Europe&amp;mdash;and not imposed on ordinary farmers in particular.) Grand farmers and aristocrats were buried together with [[grave goods]], while chieftains were buried in [[Tumulus|mounds]].&lt;ref name="Lillehammer 1994 179"/&gt; Grave goods of this age are dominated by iron artefacts.

In this age, the aristocracy had begun to [[Slavery|enslave]] humans. The use of forced labor in agricultural production made the aristocracy able to spend more resources on military activities, increasing their capacity to control their [[Tribute|tax-paying]] subjects, to defend their territory, and even to expand it. However, [[thrall]]s were not an aristocratic privilege. In principle, all free men could hold thralls. A thrall was the rightless property of his or her owner. The text ''[[Rígsþula]]'' identifies three distinct classes and describes extensively how they evolved: chieftains, farmers, and thralls.&lt;ref name="Sigurdsson/Riisøy 2011 30"/&gt; Religion was used to explain and justify thralldom, but the original motivation was rather economical.

Furthermore, the aristocracy [[Human sacrifice|sacrificed]] humans to be placed in graves of deceased aristocrats. Also this custom was related to religion, i.e. imaginations of [[Afterlife|life after death]]. Contemporary sources as well as archaeological remains document this custom. For example, [[Arab]] traveller [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] (fl. 10th century) documented that a female slave was killed for this purpose in a Nordic burial in Russia.

At the beginning of the Late Iron Age (c. 500{{spaced ndash}}c. 793; in Norway known as the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] Age), there were several changes in Nordic culture: for example the deterioration of the quality of works of art and [[syncopation]] of the spoken language. Burial customs in several regions were drastically simplified: stone coffins (stones placed together as a coffin protecting the body within a grave or a [[tumulus]]) were no longer used, and tumuli became smaller or were replaced by flat graves. Also grave goods appear to have been lesser in amount than before.

Some historians have interpreted these changes negatively.&lt;ref name="Johansen 2000 144 249 251"/&gt; Some suggest that they were caused by plague or interregional conflict, while others believe that the smaller number of tumuli reflects the consolidation of aristocratic power, which meant that large and splendid monuments were no longer necessary.

=== Hird ===
[[File:Jorund arneson seal.PNG|thumb|Seal of 14th-century [[Sysselmann]] Jørund Arnason.]]

The hird was divided into three classes, of which the first had three ranks. The first class was ''hirdmann'' with ''lendmann'' as the 1st rank, ''skutilsvein'' as the 2nd rank, and ordinary ''hirdmann'' as the 3rd rank. Below them were the classes ''gjest'' and ''kjertesvein''.&lt;ref name="SNL hird"&gt;Store norske leksikon: [http://www.snl.no/hird Hird]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SNL skutilsvein"&gt;Store norske leksikon: [http://www.snl.no/skutilsvein Skutilsvein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SNL huskar"&gt;Store norske leksikon: [http://www.snl.no/huskar Huskar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lendmen, having the first rank in the group of hirdmen, had the right to hold 40 armed [[housecarl]]s, to advise the King, and to receive an annual payment from the King. They normally also held the highest offices in the state. The foundation for their rights was the military duty which their title imposed.

Kjertesveins were young men of good family who served as pages at the court, and gjests constituted a guard and police corps. In addition, there was a fourth group known as housecarls, but it remains uncertain whether they were considered a part of or rather served the hird.

The hird's organisation is described in the ''[[Konungs skuggsjá|King’s Mirror]]'' and the ''[[Hirdskraa|Codex of the Hird]]''.

The system of hirdmen&amp;mdash;regional and local representatives for the King&amp;mdash;was stronger and lasted longer in the tributary lands [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]], [[Iceland]], and the [[Faroe Islands]], and also in [[Jämtland|Jemtland]],&lt;ref name="SNL hird"/&gt; originally an independent farmer republic which Norwegian kings used much time and efforts to gain control over.

=== Knighthood ===
[[File:Håkon Magnusson.JPG|thumb|Sculpture of [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon Magnusson]], [[Duke]] of [[Oslo]], of [[Oppland]], of [[Ryfylke]], of the [[Faroe Islands]], and of [[Shetland]]; later Haakon V.]]

During the second half of the 13th century continental European court culture began to gain influence in Norway. In 1277 the King introduced continental titles in the hird: lendmen were called barons, and skutilsveins were called ''ridder''. Both were then styled ''Herr'' ({{lang-en|Lord}}). In 1308 King [[Håkon V of Norway|Håkon V]] abolished the lendman/baron institution, and it was probably also during his reign that the aristocracy seems to have been restructured into two classes: ''ridder'' ({{lang-en|knight}}) and ''væpner'' ({{lang-en|squire}}).

It is difficult to determinate exactly how many knights and squires there were in the 14th and the early 15th century. When King Haakon V signed a peace treaty with the Danish king in 1309, it was sealed by 29 Norwegian knights and squires. King Haakon promised that additional 270 knights and squires would give their written recognition. This were perhaps the approximate number of knights and squires at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Aschehougs Norgeshistorie, vol. III, p. 189 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black Death ===
The [[Black Death]], which came to Norway around 1349, was bad for the nobility. In addition to the loss of their own members, about two thirds of the population were killed by the plague, and the reduction in available manpower for agriculture caused an economic crisis.

The aristocracy was reduced from about 600 families or 3,600 people before 1350 to about 200 families or 1,000 people in 1450.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The value of land was reduced by 50%&amp;ndash;75%, and the land rent was reduced by up to 75%, except in relatively populous central districts like [[Akershus]] and [[Båhus]], where the reduction was about 40%. The [[tithe]] also reduced by 60%&amp;ndash;70%.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Both before and after the plague, Norwegian noblemen were unusually dependent on the King compared with noblemen in other countries. Mountainous Norway has never been conducive to large land estates of continental size. As a consequence of the tremendous reduction in land-related income following the plague, it became even more necessary than before to enter royal service.

Militarily, the Black Death was a catastrophe. As lower and local noblemen were killed by the plague, the recruitment of officers and troop leaders was equally reduced. Having lost their economic base (reduced income of taxes etc.) and their economic guarantees from the King, local aristocrats could often not fulfil their military duties.

=== Fiefs and fortresses ===
[[File:Bohus fästning.jpg|thumb|The [[Bohus Fortress|Båhus Fortress]].]]

The system of royally controlled [[fief]]s was established in 1308, replacing the originally more independent [[lendmann|lendmen]]. There were two types of medieval fiefs:

To the first belonged castle fiefs (Norwegian: ''slottslen'') or main fiefs (Norwegian: ''hovedlen''), to which the King appointed lords, and under them petty fiefs (Norwegian: ''smålen''), which had varying connections with their respective castle fief. In the 15th century, there were approximately fifty fiefs in Norway. In the late 16th century and the early 17th century, there were four permanent castle fiefs and approximately thirty small. Thereafter, the amount of petty fiefs was reduced in favour of bigger and more stable main fiefs. Lords of castle fief resided in the biggest cities, where the royal farms or the castles were located.&lt;ref name="SNL-len"/&gt;

The second type were estate fiefs (Norwegian: ''godslen''), i.e. private, noble estates that constituted independent areas of jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="SNL-len"&gt;Store norske leksikon: [http://snl.no/len len] at ''snl.no''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, nobles were active in the Kingdom's military defence, in which fortresses had a central position. In the early 14th century, the [[Vardøhus Fortress|Fortress of Vardøhus]] in Northern Norway was constructed due to conflicts with the Russian [[Novgorod Republic|Republic of Novgorod]] and as protection against robbery raids of the [[Karelians]]. The fortresses [[Bohus Fortress|Bohus]] and [[Akershus Fortress|Akershus]] in Eastern Norway were established approximately at the same time. An earlier fortress was [[Bergenhus Fortress|Bergenhus]] in Western Norway. There would usually be one or more fiefs attached to each fortress. All fortresses were mainly under the command of nobles, who held the military title of [[høvedsmann]].

=== Time of greatness ===
&lt;!--&gt;[[File:Carl-II-Sweden.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Expressing the aristocratic power of the High Medieval Age, the nobleman [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson (Bonde)]] was elected [[List of Norwegian monarchs|King of Norway]] as well as [[List of Swedish monarchs|King of Sweden]].&lt;br&gt;Photo: Jacob Truedson Demitz]]&lt;!--&gt;
[[File:Austrattborgen1.jpg|thumb|[[Austrått|Austrått Fortress]].&lt;!--Forsvarsverk/festning/borg er ikke manor/palace.--&gt;]]

During the 14th century members of the [[hird]] continued in various directions. The lower parts of the hird lost importance and disappeared. The upper parts, especially the former [[Lendmann|lendmen]], became the nucleus of the nobility of the [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval Age]]: the [[Knight]]hood ({{lang-no|Ridderskapet}}). They stood close to the King, and as such they received seats in the [[Riksråd|Council of the Kingdom]] as well as [[fief]]s, and some had even family connections to the royal house. There was a significant social distance between the Knighthood and ordinary noblemen.

The Council of the Kingdom was the Kingdom's governing institution, consisting of members of the upper secular and the upper clerical aristocracy, including the [[Archdiocese of Nidaros|Archbishop]]. Originally, in the 13th century, having had an advisory function as the King's council, the Council became remarkably independent from the King during the 15th century. At its height it had the power to choose or to recognise pretenders to the Throne, and it demanded an [[Haandfæstning|electoral charter]] from each new king. Sometimes it even chose its own leaders as regents (Norwegian: ''drottsete'' or ''riksforstander''), among others [[Sigurd Jonsson (regent)|Sigurd Jonsson (Stjerne) to Sudreim]] and [[Jon Svaleson Smør|Jon Svaleson (Smør)]].

In Norway as well as in [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], it was in this period that the idea and the principle of ''riksråd constitutionalism'' had arisen, i.e. that the Council was considered as the real foundation of sovereignty. Although kings were formal heads of state, the Council was powerful. Their power and active rulership, especially as regents, have caused historians characterise this state as de facto a republic of the nobility (Norwegian: ''adelsrepublikk'').

This aristocratic power lasted until the [[Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], when the King in 1536 illegally abolished the Council. The reign of aristocrats was over when Archbishop [[Olav Engelbrektsson]], who was also noble, the Council's president and the Regent of Norway, left the Kingdom in 1537.

=== Between reformation and absolutism ===
[[File:Ludvig Munk til Nørlund.jpg|thumb|[[Ludvig Munk|Ludvig Ludvigsen Munk of Nørholm]].]]

Following the abolition of the Norwegian [[Riksråd|Council of the Kingdom]] in 1536, which de facto ceased to exist in 1537, the nobility in Norway lost most of its formal political foundation. The Danish Council of the Kingdom took over the governing of Norway. However, the nobility in Norway, now confined to more administrative and ceremonial functions, continued to take part in the country's official life, especially at homages to new kings.

Having defeated the aristocratic and besides Roman Catholic resistance in Norway, the King in [[Copenhagen]] sought to secure and consolidate his control in the Kingdom. Strategical actions would further weaken the nobility in Norway.

First of all, the King sent Danish noblemen to Norway in order to administer the country and to fill civilian and military offices. Norwegian noblemen were deliberately under-represented when new high officials were appointed. Whilst this was a part of the King's tactics, also the lack of Norwegian noblemen with qualified education&amp;mdash;Norway did not have a university&amp;mdash;was a reason for that the King had to send foreigners. The educational sector was considerably better developed in [[Schleswig|Sleswick]] and [[Holstein|Holsatia]], plus in [[Germany]], so only nobles who sent their children to foreign universities could hope to keep or obtain high offices.

Secondly, during the 16th century the system of independent, family-possessed estates as power centra, like [[Austrått]], was ultimately replaced in favour of fiefs to which the King himself appointed lords. A few Norwegian noblemen were given such fiefs, for example Knight [[Trond Torleivsson Benkestok]], Lord to [[Bergenhus Fortress]], but over time these would find themselves possessed almost exclusively by immigrants. Nevertheless, during the 17th century fiefs were transformed into high offices. Also they were considered too risky for the King.

Thirdly, in 1628 the King instituted a national army of soldiers recruited directly from the estate of farmers. At the same time technical development made traditional military methods outdated. As a result, the nobility was defunctionalised in this aspect.

=== Absolutism ===
In 1660, when Denmark's estates were gathered in [[Copenhagen]], King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] declared military state of emergency and closed the capital city, thus preventing the nobility from boycotting the assembly by leaving. The nobility was forced to surrender. In the following days, Denmark was transformed from an [[elective monarchy]] into an hereditary. On 17 October, the 1648 ''[[Haandfæstning|håndfestning]]'' was returned to the King, and on 18 October, the King was hailed as an hereditary monarch. On 10 January 1661, the [[Sovereignty Act|Absolute and Hereditary Monarchy Act]] ({{lang-no|Enevoldsarveregjeringsakten}}) introduced [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. In Denmark, the [[Riksråd|Council of the Kingdom]] faced the same destiny as the Norwegian Council had done in 1536: abolition. The noble monarchy ({{lang-no|adelsmonarki}}) had come to an end.

Formally a hereditary kingdom since old ages, Norway was not affected by Denmark's transition to the same. However, also Norway was affected by absolutism. On 7 August 1661 in [[Oslo|Christiania]], representatives of the Norwegian nobility signed the Sovereignty Act.&lt;ref&gt;Aktstykker til de norske stændermøders historie, volum III 1, pagina 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction===
[[File:Faroes030417-nasa(2).jpg|thumb|The Faroe Islands in Norway.]]

The native aristocracy was extensively reduced during the last part of the Late Medieval Age. Several factors may explain this.

An important factor is that families did not produce a sufficient amount of male descendants. As noble status was inherited patrilineally, the lack of men lead to families’ extinction. A reason is that noblemen as warriors were exposed to greater risks than the population in general and therefore died in a young age and without issue.

Another factor is that the Norwegian nobility to a large extent married persons of the estate of commoners. So-called unequal marriages, of which there came to be many especially in lower parts of nobility, led (after 1582 and 1591) to the loss of noble status, noble estates, and similar. In an application to the King in 1591, the nobility requested that since it ‘[...] often [happens] that noblemen here in Norway marry unfree women, and their children inherit his estate, [...] which is the nobility to reduction and shame [...]’,&lt;ref&gt;Aktstykker til de norske stændermøders historie 1548–1661, volum I 1–2, pagina 114.&lt;/ref&gt; their children should not inherit noble status or noble estate.

It is also a factor that noble status not automatically was inherited. If a family for generations no longer provided services to the King, they could due to oblivion lose their position. An example is the [[Tordenstjerne (noble family)|Tordenstjerne]] family, whose members in the 16th century were squires, but who due to political and military inactivity in the 17th century had to get their noble status confirmed in the 18th century.

It is often claimed that the old nobility ‘died out’ in the Late Medieval Age. This is mostly but not entirely correct. The term ‘extinction’ includes not only families dying out physically, but also disappearance from the written sources of formerly noble families which had lost their political power and importance. This has even obscured the link between the such families before and in the 16th century and their farmer descendants who appear in sources beginning in the late 17th century. In other words, families of the old nobility may in actuality have survived without knowing it or being able to prove it.

The nobility of the 16th century was of a marginal size, thus being socially more exclusive, but also politically more vulnerable. For example, after the Reformation in 1536, the number of nobles was reduced from approximately 800 and to approximately 400, i.e. under 0.2 percent of the population and approximately 1/7 of the size of the Danish nobility. After 1536, only 15 percent of Norwegian land was in noble possession.
=== Women and women's rights ===
[[File:Görvel Fadersdotter (Sparre) (1517-1605).jpg|thumb|[[Görvel Fadersdotter (Sparre)|Gørvel Fadersdotter of Giske]].]]

There are a few examples of medieval noblewomen who acted with considerable de facto independence. Prominent are Lady [[Inger Ottesdotter Rømer|Ingegjerd Ottesdotter Rømer of Austrått]] and Lady [[Görvel Fadersdotter (Sparre)|Gørvel Fadersdotter (Sparre) of Giske]]. It is, however, important to know that they acted as so-called 'pseudo men', i.e. in the formal rôle of a man (usually their deceased husband's, father's or brother's).&lt;ref name="Sandvik page113"&gt;Sandvik 1999, page 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Legally, there was no such thing as formal female rôles.

In general, noblewomen had larger economical freedom than women of unfree estate. Whilst the Land Law of 1274 and the Town Law of 1276 gave farmer women and burgher women only limited control of their assets, noblewomen could buy and sell as much as they pleased.&lt;ref name="Sandvik page113"/&gt; This estate-based discrimination would last until the Land Law (including the Norwegian Code of 1604, which was mostly a Danish translation) was replaced by the [[Norwegian Code]] of 1687, a law that made all non-widowed women legally minor, regardless of their birth. (Some minor restrictions were introduced in 1604, when Norwegian law, granting unmarried women financial independence from their 21st year, was adjusted to match Danish law, which imposed lifelong guardianship on women and their fortune.)&lt;ref name="Sandvik page113"/&gt;

The noble privileges of 1582 decreed that a noblewoman who married a non-noble man should lose all her hereditary land to her nearest co-inheritor, for example her brother. The rule was designed with the intention of keeping noble land in noble hand, which would strengthen the nobility's power base.

=== Iceland ===
In 1262, [[Gissur Þorvaldsson]] († 1268) was given the title [[Earl of Iceland]], indicating and imposing that he should rule [[Iceland]] on behalf of [[Norway|Norway's]] king. It is known that approximately 20&amp;ndash;30 Icelandic men had the title of knight in the following centuries, among others Eiríkur Sveinbjarnarson in Vatnsfjörður († 1342) and Arnfinnur Þorsteinsson († 1433).&lt;ref&gt;Ólason, Páll Eggert (1948): ''Íslenzkar æviskrár Frá landnámstímum til ársloka 1940'' Volum 1, pagina 421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Safn til sögu Íslands og Íslendzkra Bókmenta að fornu og nýju'' Volum 9, pagina 103. Published in 1886.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1457, King [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] ennobled Björn Þorleifsson. The same honour had been granted Torfi Arason in 1450. Björn was ''hirðstjóri'' (a high royal official) in Iceland and as well the richest man in this part of Norway.

In 1488, King [[John of Denmark|John]] ennobled Eggert Eggertsson, Lawspeaker ({{lang-no|lagmann}}) of [[Viken, Norway|Viken]] in mainland Norway. His son was Hans Eggertsson (fl. 1522), city administrator ({{lang-no|rådmann}}) of [[Bergen]], and the latter's son was Eggert Hansson, Lawspeaker ({{lang-is|lögmaður}}) of Iceland (fl. 1517&amp;ndash;1563). This family is known as [[Norbagge (noble family)|Norbagge]] today.&lt;ref name="SNL Norbagge"&gt;''[[Store norske leksikon]]:'' [http://snl.no/Norbagge Norbagge] at ''snl.no''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1620 at the [[Althing]], Jón Magnússon the Elder, let a [[letters patent]] of 1457 be read, originally given to his aforementioned ancestor Björn Þorleifsson. King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] recognised his noble status. It is claimed that Jón was the last Norwegian nobleman in this part of Norway. The era of the nobility in Iceland ended in 1661 with the introduction of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] in Norway.

[[File:Mariakirken Oslo.jpeg|thumb|Attemptive reconstructional drawing of [[St Mary's Church, Oslo|St Mary's Church]].]]
[[File:Mariakrk1.JPG|thumb|Remains of St Mary's Church.]]

Members of the [[royal clergy]] ({{lang-no|kongelig kapellgeistlighet}}), i.e. the clergy of the King's own chapels, which were subordinate only to the King and largely independent of the Church hierarchy in Norway, belonged to the secular aristocracy by virtue of their offices in the service of the King.

In a royal proclamation of 22 June 1300&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist.uib.no/grunnfag/kjelder/1300_gave.htm Gave- og stadfestingsbrev fra kong Håkon Magnusson til Mariakirken i Oslo]&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] granted [[St Mary's Church, Oslo]]&amp;mdash;the royal chapel&amp;mdash;numerous privileges and decreed that "the learned man who is or becomes its [[dean (religion)|dean]]" (i.e. the provost) ''[[ex officio]]'' would have the rank of a [[lendmann|lendman]], whilst priests with [[prebend]]s (i.e. the [[Canon (priest)|canons]]) would have the rank of a Knight, the vicars and deacons would have the rank of an (ordinary) ''hirdmann'', and other clerics would have the rank of a ''kjertesvein''; the clergy of this church thus received extraordinarily high aristocratic ranks, according to [[Sverre Bagge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sverre Bagge]]: «[https://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/673/Kanslerembedet%20og%20Mariakirken%20i%20Oslo%201314%20-%201350.pdf;jsessionid=0C29B9C52A6CCE9B0F04438EF8E0D9BE.bora-uib_worker?sequence=1 Kanslerembedet og Mariakirken i Oslo]», ''Oslo bispedømme 900 år'', Universitetsforlaget, Oslo 1975, pp. 143-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sverre Bagge]]: ''Den kongelige kapellgeistlighet 1150–1319'', Universitetsforlaget, 1976, {{ISBN|9788200014584}}, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1314 King Haakon decreed that the provost of St Mary's Church would also hold the office of [[Chancellor]] ({{lang-no|Norges Rikes kansler}}) and Keeper of the Great Seal ‘for eternity’, and with some interruptions the office of Chancellor was tied to the office of provost of St Mary's Church until some years after the Reformation in 1536. One of the other priests (typically a canon) would serve as Vice-Chancellor according to the royal letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/perl/middelalder/regest_vise_tekst.prl?b=3139&amp;s=n&amp;str=oslo Regesta Norvegica, Vol. 3 No. 905], Dokpro&lt;/ref&gt; The main Great Seal was brought to Denmark in 1398, but the Chancellor kept an older version of the seal that was used until the 16th century. The vicars of St Mary's Church probably had a higher position than elsewhere due to their extraordinary aristocratic rank. In 1348 King [[Haakon VI of Norway|Haakon VI]] found it necessary to stress that the canons had higher rank in every aspect and they alone should administer the estate of their church.&lt;ref&gt;Bagge 1976 p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

St Mary's Church was an important political institution until the Reformation era, as it was the seat of government in Norway, although from the late 14th century effectively subordinate to the central government administration in Copenhagen and increasingly concerned only with matters relating to the legal field.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Fischer, ''Mariakirken i Oslo: Harald Hårdrådes katedral og riksstyrets sete'', Oslo, Foreningen til fortidsminnesmerkers bevaring, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Andreas Munch]] has described the royal clergy as a counterweight to the (regular) secular aristocracy with a stronger loyalty to the king and a stronger service element than both the (regular) secular and the clerical aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Bagge 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chapter (religion)|cathedral chapter]] of St Mary's Church ceased to exist as a separate institution when it was merged with the chapter of [[St. Hallvard's Cathedral|Oslo Cathedral]] in 1545, although its clergy retained their prebends.

Most of the royal clergy&amp;mdash;especially those who rose to its upper echelons, such as canon and provost&amp;mdash;were recruited from the lower nobility and sometimes even from the higher nobility.

In the years following the Reformation, this royal clergy gradually disappeared, as the entire church hierarchy came directly under the King's control. Some remnants of the institution survived for some time; for example the estate of the provost of St Mary's Church (''Mariakirkens prostigods'') was customarily given as a fief to the Chancellor of Norway until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Domkapitel," in ''[[Norsk historisk leksikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Olufsson (1500&amp;ndash;1570), who was a canon at St Mary's Church before and after the Reformation and who held the [[prebend]] of [[Dillevik]] that included the income of 43 ecclesiastical properties, is regarded as the probable progenitor of the still extant [[Paus]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stian Herlofsen Finne-Grønn]] (1943).

[[File:Erkebispegården Trondheim 01.jpg|thumb|[[Archbishop's Palace, Trondheim|The Archbishop's palace]] in today's [[Trondheim]].|alt=]]

The [[clergy]] ({{lang-no|geistlighet}}) was one of normally three [[Estates of the realm|estates]] in the Norwegian [[Feudalism|feudal system]]. Together with the King and the secular aristocracy, the Archbishop and the clerical aristocracy constituted the power class in the Kingdom. Until the [[Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein|Reformation]] in 1536 this aristocracy operated and developed in parallel with the secular aristocracy.

It was in the years after the death of King [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf 'the Holy']] in 1030 that [[Norway]] was finally Christianised, whereby the Church gradually began to play a political rôle. Already in 1163 the [[Norwegian Law of Succession|Law of Succession]] stated that [[List of Norwegian monarchs|Norwegian kings]] were no longer [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] [[monarch]]s but [[vassal]]s holding Norway as a fief from Saint Olaf alias the [[Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae|Eternal King of Norway]]. This invention gave the Church bigger control of the royal power, not least because the King had to proclaim loyalty to the [[Pope]]. King [[Magnus V of Norway|Magnus V]] (1156&amp;ndash;1184) was as such the first of Norway's kings to use the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] '[[by the Grace of God]]'. Nevertheless, this law of succession would last only for a century, when a new and for kings more independent law of succession was introduced.

The Church was actively involved in the [[Civil war era in Norway|civil war era]] (1130&amp;ndash;1240), in which they were allies of the established aristocracy and supported throne [[pretender]]s who were (alleged) descendants of 'Olaf the Holy'. Ultimately the Church supported [[Magnus V of Norway|Magnus Erlingsson]] (1156&amp;ndash;1184), the son of [[Earl]] [[Erling Skakke|Erling Ormsson]] and [[Princess]] [[Kristin Sigurdsdatter|Kristin Sigurdsdotter]].

In 1184, having defeated King Magnus, [[Sverre of Norway|Sverre Sigurdsson]] became King of Norway. Subsequently, Sverre demanded that the Archbishop should be subordinate to the King. As a result of this King Sverre was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]]. In [[Denmark]] exiled Archbishop Eirik, plus the majority of bishops, arranged a [[resistance movement]] known as the [[Bagler]]s. They managed to re-occupy and control parts of [[Eastern Norway]], from where they represented a permanent threat to King Sverre. Upon King Sverre's death in 1202 a it became possible to find a compromise between Sverre's supporters, the [[Birkebeiner|Birchlegs]], and the Archbishop. In 1217 they managed to agree upon a king: King [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon IV]], a paternal grandson of King Sverre.

During the 13th century there were power struggles between the Church and the King. Several disagreements were temporarily solved with the [[Concordat of Tunsberg]] ({{lang-no|Sættargjerden}}) of 1277. This concordat granted the clerical aristocracy several rights and privileges or confirmed existing ones, for example the freedom to trade and the freedom from paying [[Leidang|lething]]. The same concordat gave the Archbishop the right to have 100 sveins (armed pages), whilst each bishop could have 40.

=== Bishops ===
[[File:SkalholtInWinter.jpg|thumb|[[Skálholt]], centre of the former [[Diocese of Skálholt]].]]

There were ten [[dioceses|bishops]] under the [[Archdiocese of Nidaros|Archbishop of Nidaros]], namely:

* [[Ancient Diocese of Bergen|Bishop of Bergen]]
* [[Ancient Diocese of Stavanger|Bishop of Stavanger]]
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo|Bishop of Oslo]]
* [[Ancient Diocese of Hamar|Bishop of Hamar]]
* [[Diocese of Garðar|Bishop of Garðar]] ([[Greenland]])
* [[Diocese of Skálholt|Bishop of Skálholt]] ([[Iceland]])
* [[Diocese of Hólar|Bishop of Hólar]] (Iceland)
* [[Ancient Diocese of the Faroe Islands|Bishop of Kirkjubøur]] ([[Faroe Islands]])
* [[Diocese of Kirkwall|Bishop of Kirkwall]] ([[Orkney|Orkney Islands]])
* [[Diocese of the Isles|Bishop of Mann and the Isles]] ([[Isle of Man|Mann]] and the [[Hebrides|Isles]])

=== Canons ===
[[File:Stavanger Dom03.jpg|thumb|The [[Stavanger Cathedral|Cathedral of Stavanger]], former residence of the [[Ancient Diocese of Stavanger|Bishop of Stavanger]] and twelve canons.]]

[[Canon (priest)|Canons]] ({{lang-no|kannik}}) were priests who were also attached to one of the [[diocese]]s in Norway.

Canons were recruited primarily from the secular aristocracy. Whilst most canons came from the lower nobility, several belonged to the higher nobility by birth. The latter were sons of [[knight]]s and even of [[Riksråd|Councillors of the Kingdom]]. Examples are Jakob Matsson of the [[Rømer (noble family)|Rømer]] family, Henrik Nilsson of the [[Gyldenløve (noble family)|Gyldenløve]] family, and Elling Pedersson of the [[Oxe (noble family)|Oxe]] family.

In the 13th century canons were [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] ''Sira'' (compare with English [[Sir]]).&lt;ref name="SNL-sira"&gt;''[[Store norske leksikon]]'': [http://snl.no/sira/tittel Sira &amp;ndash; tittel]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Priests ===
Priests ({{lang-no|prest}}) constituted the local level of the clergy.

Originally a [[Style (manner of address)|style]] for [[Canon (priest)|canons]] in the 13th century, priests were styled ''Sira'' in and after the 14th century.&lt;ref name="SNL-sira"/&gt; Subsequently, ''Sira'' was replaced by ''Herr''. ''Sira'' and ''Herr'' were used in combination with the given name only, e.g. 'Sira Eirik'.

=== Setesveins ===
{{Main|Setesvein}}

[[File:Norway - Hjelmsøya.png|thumb|[[Hjelmsøya]] in [[Finnmark]], where a setesvein named Sakse lived.]]

Beside the clerical hierarchy, the [[Archdiocese of Nidaros|Archbishop of Nidaros]] had his own organisation of officers and servants.

Regional representatives of the Archbishop, [[setesvein]]s (not to be confused with the noble title of ''skutilsvein'') were seated mainly along the coast of [[Western Norway|Western]] and [[Northern Norway]] as well as in [[Iceland]]. A register of 1533 shows that there were at least 69 setesveins at this time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Their function was to administer the land estate of and to collect the taxes belonging to the Archbishop, and they also traded partly themselves and partly on behalf of the Archbishop.&lt;ref name="Ytreberg17"&gt;Ytreberg, N.A. (1981): ''Nordlandske handelssteder'', pagina 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Norway, a typical location of setesveins was a central position with immediate control of the lucrative fisheries.

Some setesveins belonged to the secular aristocracy too, usually by birth.&lt;ref name="Ytreberg17"/&gt;

After the [[Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein|Reformation]] in 1536, when King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] prohibited the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the Archbishop went into exile, the King punished setesveins who had supported the Archbishop.&lt;ref name="Ytreberg17"/&gt; Many of them had their houses robbed as the King and his soldiers raided the coast.

In Northern Norway ex-setesveins and their descendants were known as ''page nobility'' ({{lang-no|knapeadel}}).

== Modern aristocracy ==

[[File:Fritzøehus.jpg|thumb|[[Fritzøehus]], palace of the [[Treschow (Dano-Norwegian family)|Treschow]] family.|alt=]]

The modern aristocracy is known as [[nobility|adel]] ({{lang-en|nobility}}). The parts of the nobility that are regarded as new in [[Norway]] consisted of immigrated persons and families of the old [[Danish nobility|nobility of Denmark]], of recently ennobled persons and families in Norway as well as in [[Denmark]], and of persons and families whose (claimed) noble status was confirmed or&amp;mdash;for foreigners&amp;mdash;naturalised by the King.

An absolute monarch since 1660, the King could ennoble and for that sake remove the noble status of anyone he wished and&amp;mdash;unlike earlier&amp;mdash;without approval from the [[Riksråd|Council of the Kingdom]]. He could even elevate dead humans to the estate of nobles. For example, four days after his death in 1781, Hans Eilersen Hagerup was ennobled under the name [[Gyldenpalm (noble family)|de Gyldenpalm]]. This made as well his legitimate children and other patrilineal descendants noble.

In particular there were two ways of receiving noble status: via an [[office]] (informally known as ''office nobility'') and via a [[letters patent]] (informally known as ''letter nobility'').

On 25 May 1671 King [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] created 31 counts and barons. As such two classes were created in addition to the class of nobles: the ''class of barons'' (Norwegian: ''friherrestand'') and the ''class of counts'' (Norwegian: ''grevestand''). A noble was per definition untitled, and barons and counts did not belong to the class of nobles, but to their respective classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Den danske Vitruvius 1 tab026 - Kroner.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, all three constituted the ''estate'' of nobles. Barons and counts could be either titular or feudal. The latter constituted the ''feudal nobility'' ({{lang-no|lensadel}}). On 22 April 1709 King [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV]] introduced the title of marquis.

The introduction of the titles of count and baron was controversial in the old nobility, who were old enemies of royal absolutism and whom the titles sought to outrank. One reaction was the anonymously published theatre play ''[[Grevens og Friherrens Komedie|Comedy of the Count and the Baron]]'', written in 1675.

===Office nobility===
[[File:Dano-Norwegian Decree on the Order of Precedence of 1699.jpg|thumb|Copy of the front of the ''Decree on the Order of Precedence of 1699.]]
[[File:The Coronation of Christian VI, 1731..JPG|thumb|Nobles at the 1731 coronation of King [[Christian VI of Denmark|Christian VI]].]]

A minor but nevertheless considerable element of the modern aristocracy was the office nobility (Norwegian: ''embetsadel'' or ''embedsadel'', also called ''rangadel''). It was introduced in 1679 and would, with extensive reductions during the 18th century, last until 1814.

A person holding a high-ranking office within one of the highest classes of rank automatically received ennoblement for himself, for his wife, and for his legitimate children, and for decades this status was normally hereditable for his patrilineal and legitimate descendants.&lt;ref name="SNL rangadel"&gt;[[Store norske leksikon]]: [http://www.snl.no/rangadel Rangadel]&lt;/ref&gt; However, basically all such ennoblements were annulled when King [[Christian VI of Denmark|Christian VI]], tired of his father's generosity, acceded to the throne in 1730, and only those who received a special recognition after making an application retained their noble status. The office nobility as such was not abolished. Subsequent royal decrees introduced a more restrictive policy, under which noble status dependent on offices was limited to the person concerned, to his wife, and to his legitimate children.
The Decree on the Order of Precedence of 1671 was radical, for the first time deciding that the nobility did not automatically have the highest rank in the Kingdom. It stated explicitly that the nobility should enjoy their traditional rank above other estates and subjects ''unless'' the latter were specified in the order of precedence. In other words, any person within the rank stood above noble persons outside this. The Noble Privileges of 1661 had stated the opposite, namely that the nobility should enjoy rank and honour above all others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Aktstykker til de norske stændermøders historie 1548–1661, volum III–2, paginæ 275–278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the Letter of Privileges of 11 February 1679 introduced automatical noble status for the highest members of the order of precedence. As such the office nobility had been established. The letter stated explicitly that these persons of rank as well as wife and children should enjoy all privileges and benefits that others of the nobility had in the present and in the future, and it was also stressed that they should be honoured, respected, and regarded equally with nobles of birth.

The office nobility has later been considered with lesser regard, and for example the ''[[Danmarks Adels Aarbog|Yearbook of the Danish Nobility]]'' does not include such persons and families.

Examples:

* [[Mathias de Tonsberg]], who was automatically ennobled in 1704 when he became Councillor of the State ({{lang-no|etatsråd}}).&lt;ref name="MTonsberg"&gt;[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]: [http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Mats_De_Tonsberg/utdypning Mats De Tonsberg] at ''snl.no''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hans Eilersen Hagerup]], who was automatically ennobled in 1761 when he became General Commissioner of War.&lt;ref name="SNL-HHGyldenpalm"&gt;[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]: [http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Hans_Hagerup_Gyldenpalm/utdypning Hans Hagerup Gyldenpalm] at ''snl.no''.&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1781 he was even ennobled by letter.)

===Letter nobility===
[[File:Adelsbrev von Munthe af Morgenstierne.png|thumb|[[Letters patent|Letter of nobility]] of the [[Munthe af Morgenstierne (noble family)|Munthe af Morgenstierne]] family.]]

Beginning already in the [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval Age]] but especially associated with the late 17th century and the 18th century, it became customary to ennoble persons by [[letters patent]] ({{lang-no|adelsbrev}}) for significant military or artistic achievements, and there were also persons who were ennobled in this way after making monetary donations. These are informally known as ''letter nobility'' ({{lang-no|brevadel}}).

One of the earliest known letters patent is from 1458, given to Sjøfar and Nils Sigurdssøner, by King [[Eric of Pomerania|Eric III]]. The patent included all of their descendants, both through male and female-descendancy where ennoblement was given to "these and their legitimate children, their descendants and their relatives, each after the other". The heraldic name of their descendants are called the Rosensværds. As this patent was given prior to the restrictions generally imposed on the unpatented-nobility in 1582 and 1592, The Rosensværds are thus exempt from the later rule that stated that nobility should only pass through male-lines, witch ensures that every Rosensværd, whether they descend from Sjøfar or Niels Siggurdzønner through their fathers or their mothers, are born nobles regardless and their children and so forth also nobles, even if a Rosensword should marry a commoner. This Was due to the fact that King Eric in the patent "gave shield, helmet, freedom and salvation" to all their descendants, both and unborn alike, "each after the other", without excluding any descendant, regardless of who they married.

Other families are [[Rosenvinge (noble family)|Rosenvinge]] and [[Tordenstjerne (noble family)|Tordenstjerne]], both ennobled in 1505. However, the custom of ennobling by letters patent increased drastically in the late 17th century and the 18th century, when numerous persons and families received such noble status. They were a part of the King's plan of creating a new and loyal nobility replacing the old, who until 1660 had been political enemies of the King. However, letters patent given (unofficially: sold) among others to rich merchants were also a lucrative source of income for the Kings, whose many wars at times lead to a big need for money.

Examples:

* Kurt Sørensen was for bravery in battle ennobled under the name [[Adeler]].
* [[Ludvig Holberg]], a famous writer, was ennobled as a baron for his merits and by bequeathing his fortune to the [[Sorø Academy]].
* Joachim Geelmuyden, the son of a priest and the grandson of a tradesman, held many titles and offices in the Dano-Norwegian state and was subsequently ennobled under the name [[Gyldenkrantz]].

===Feudal nobility===
[[File:Rosendal.jpg|thumb|[[Rosendal, Norway|Rosendal]], originally a feudal barony.&lt;br&gt;Photographer: Nynorsk Wikipedia user ''Ekko'']]
[[File:Marcus Gerhard Rosencrone.jpg|thumb|Norwegian-born [[Marcus Gerhard af Rosencrone]] (1738&amp;ndash;1811), [[Count of Rosencrone]]; Prime Minister of the Dano-Norwegian Gehejme Government.]]

With feudal barons and feudal counts one saw the introduction of a neo-feudal structure in Norway. These modern fiefs were ruled with conditioned independence by noble families, and they were hereditable. Feudal lords were equipped with extensive rights and duties. On the other hand, a fief was formally a ''[[Dominium|dominium directum]]'' of the King. It would as such return to the Crown when a title became extinct (see for example [[Barony Rosendal|Barony of Rosendal]]) or when a feudal lord was sentenced for disloyalty (see for example [[Peder Griffenfeld|Countship of Griffenfeld]]).

The main architect behind the new system of barons and counts, introduced in 1671, was [[Peder Griffenfeld|Peder Schumacher]], who himself was ennobled as Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld in 1671 and created [[Countship of Griffenfeld|Count of Griffenfeld]] in 1673. In 1675 the citizens of [[Tønsberg]] lost their independence, and the city was merged into the Countship. Griffenfeld had been granted the sole right to all [[mining]] and [[hunting]] within the Countship. He could appoint judges, arrest and charge inhabitants, and punish sentenced criminals. He could appoint priests to all churches, which he owned. Several duties were imposed on the Count's subjects. For example, cotters ({{lang-no|husmann}}) under the Count had to work for him without payment.

Whilst these new politics could bring fundamental changes to each area concerned, the effect and the consequences remained limited in Norway in general, as originally only two countships and one barony were created. These included only a small amount of the Norwegian population. Divided into counties ({{lang-no|amt}}), the rest of Norway was under direct royal administration.

=== Huguenot immigration ===
Lutheran Evangelical kingdoms, [[Denmark–Norway|Denmark and Norway]] welcomed [[Huguenot]]s who had escaped from [[France]] following the 1685 revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]. Huguenots were greeted with several privileges, and some even achieved noble status and/or titles. One was [[Jean Henri Huguetan Gyldensteen|Jean Henri Huguetan]] (1665&amp;ndash;1749) from [[Lyon]], who was created [[Countship of Gyldensteen|Count of Gyldensteen]] in 1717.

=== Increasing influence of Norwegians ===
During the 18th century, Norwegian-born noblemen and burghers rose to prominence within the Dano-Norwegian state.

=== Introduction of the ''stavnsbånd'' ===
{{Main|Stavnsbånd}}
In 1733 King [[Christian VI of Denmark|Christian VI]] introduced the system of ''[[stavnsbånd]]''&amp;mdash;a [[serfdom]]-like institution&amp;mdash;in [[Denmark]]. This was introduced following an agricultural crisis that lead people to leave the [[Rural area|countryside]] and move into towns. The system would last until after 1788.

The stavnsbånd was not introduced in [[Norway]], where all men had been free since the [[Norse religion|Old Norse heathen]] ''[[Slavery|trelldom]]'' was fought and abolished by the [[Roman Catholicism in Norway|Roman Catholic Church]].

During the de facto reign of [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] between 1770 and 1772 the power of the nobility in [[Denmark–Norway|Denmark and Norway]] was challenged. Whilst he did not mind creating himself and his friend [[Enevold Brandt|Brandt]] feudal counts, Struensee was an enemy of the hereditary aristocracy, which he sought to replace with a merit-based system of government. A part of his reforms Struensee abolished noble privileges and decided that state employments should be based on a person's qualifications only.

In a [[Coup d'état|counter-coup]] on 17 January 1772 [[Ove Høegh-Guldberg]], [[Hans Henrik von Eickstedt]], [[Georg Ludwig von Köller-Banner]] and others had Struensee arrested. In a following trial he was sentenced to death. On 28 April ex-counts Brandt and Struensee were executed; first their right hands were cut off, whereafter they were beheaded and had their bodies [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawn and quartered]].

The [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway]] of 1814, which had been established in the spirit of the principles of the [[French Revolution]] and greatly influenced by the [[Constitution of the United States of America]], forbade the creation of new nobility, including [[countship]]s, [[feudal baronies|baronies]], family estates ({{lang-no|stamhus}}), and [[fee tail]]s ({{lang-no|fideikommiss}}). Beside being in accordance with the contemporary political ideology, the prohibition effectively removed the possibility for Norway's king, who after 1814 also was Sweden's king, to create a nobility of Swedes and loyal Norwegians.

The [[Nobility Law (Norway)|Nobility Law]] of 1821 (Norwegian: ''Adelsloven'') initiated a long-range abolition of all noble titles and privileges, while the current nobility were allowed to keep their noble status, possible titles and in some cases also privileges for the rest of their lifetime. Under the Nobility Law, nobles who for themselves and their children wished to present a claim to nobility before the [[Stortinget|Norwegian parliament]] were required to provide documentation confirming their noble status. Representatives of eighteen noble families submitted their claims to the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigerust.net/adel/adel1824_innstilling.html Adelskomitéens innstilling og Stortingets beslutning i saken angående anmeldelser og reklamasjoner av adelige rettigheter, juli 1824] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717053800/http://www.vigerust.net/adel/adel1824_innstilling.html |date=2011-07-17 }} at vigerust.no.{{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815 and in 1818, the Parliament had passed the same law, and it was both times vetoed by the King.&lt;ref&gt;Johan Ernst Sars, ''Norges politiske historie 1815&amp;ndash;1885'' Supplement to ''[[Verdens Gang (1868–1923)|Verdens Gang]]'', Kristiania: Andersen, 1904, {{OCLC|2179638}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XolAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Adelsloven&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qPTTTvyXG-aLiALY3ridDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Adelsloven&amp;f=false p. 52]&lt;/ref&gt; The King did not possess a third veto, so he had to approve the law in 1821. Shortly afterwards, the King suggested the creation of a new nobility, but the attempt was rejected by the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Roald: [http://www.stortinget1905.no/popup/pdf/oversiktsartikkel.pdf STORTINGET OG UNIONEN 1814–1905]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Norwegians who had noble status in Norway had noble status also in Denmark and thus remained noble. This and the fact that many Norwegian nobles did not live in the country may have contributed to reduced resistance to the Nobility Law. However, there was resistance, which found its most significant expression in [[Severin Løvenskiold]], who had fought against the democracy and who worked for stopping the Nobility Law.&lt;ref&gt;Store norske leksikon: [http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Severin_L%C3%B8venskiold/utdypning Severin Løvenskiold – utdypning (NBL-artikkel)]&lt;/ref&gt; Being an important politician and an allied of the King, Løvenskiold was not without power. Løvenskiold argued against the law that Norway's king, and thus the Kingdom's government, had granted his family eternal noble status, and the letters patent of 1739 uses the expression ‘eternally’.&lt;ref&gt;''Danish:'' [...] til evig tid [...]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quisling, J.L. (1921): [http://www.slekt.org/books/quisling/gaard1/010.html Løvenskioldslegten]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Constitution's § 97 in fact stated: ‘No law must be given retroactive force.’&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget.no: [http://www.stortinget.no/no/Stortinget-og-demokratiet/Lover-og-instrukser/Grunnloven-fra-1814/ Grunnloven fra 1814] Citation: § 97. Ingen Lov maa gives tilbagevirkende Kraft.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Norwegian count with official recognition was [[Peder Anker, Count of Wedel-Jarlsberg]], who died in 1893. His younger brothers were Herman, Baron of Wedel-Jarlsberg, who died in 1888, and Harald, Baron of Wedel-Jarlsberg, who died in 1897. The cousins Ulriche Antoinette de Schouboe (1813–1901) and Julie Elise de Schouboe (1813–1911), as well as Anne Sophie Dorothea Knagenhjelm (1821–1907), died early in the 20th century as some of Norway's last persons who had had official recognition as noble.

Although the institution of nobility gradually was dissolved, members of noble families continued to play a significant rôle in the political and social life of the country. For example, [[List of heads of government of Norway|Stewards and Prime Ministers]] such as Count [[Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg|Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg]] (Steward, 1836–1840), [[Severin Løvenskiold]] (Steward, 1841–1856, Prime Minister, 1828–1841), [[Peder Anker]] (Prime Minister, 1814–1822), [[Frederik Due]] (Prime Minister, 1841–1858), [[Georg Sibbern]] (Prime Minister, 1858–1871) and [[Carl Otto Løvenskiold]] (Prime Minister, 1884) had aristocratic backgrounds.

=== 1905 Independence ===
Aristocrats were active also in the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]] in 1905. Most prominent were diplomat [[Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg]] and world-famous polar explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen|Fridtjof Wedel-Jarlsberg Nansen]]. Nansen, who otherwise became Norway's first ambassador to [[London]] (1906–08), was pro dissolving the union and, among other acts, travelled to the [[United Kingdom]], where he successfully lobbied for support for the independence movement. Also in the ensuing referendum concerning monarchy versus republic in Norway, the popular hero Nansen's support of monarchy and his active participation in the pro-monarchy campaign is said to have had an important effect on popular opinion. After the dissolution of the union, the leading person in the creation of the new state's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] was [[Thor von Ditten]], a [[Foreign nobility in Norway|Norwegian of foreign nobility]].

=== Present state ===
[[File:Danmarks Adels Aarbog 1910 cropped.jpg|thumb|Many noble Norwegians are noble also in [[Denmark]] and as such included in the ''[[Danmarks Adels Aarbog|Yearbook of the Danish Nobility]]''.]]

Today, the nobility is a relatively marginal factor in the society, culturally and socially as well as in politics. Members of noble families are only individually prominent, like [[Anniken Huitfeldt]]. However, a handful of families, like [[Løvenskiold]], [[Treschow (Dano-Norwegian family)|Treschow]], and [[Wedel-Jarlsberg]], still possess considerable wealth. This includes fame and regular appearance in newspapers and also coloured magazines.

Landowner and businessman [[Carl Otto Løvenskiold (born 1953)|Carl Otto Løvenskiold]] owns ''[[Maxbo]]'' among other companies. The brothers Nicolai and Peder Løvenskiold own a large number of higher private schools in Norway, among others the [[Westerdals School of Communication]], the [[Bjørknes College]], and the [[Norwegian School of Information Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagens Næringsliv (19 October 2012): [http://www.dn.no/talent/article2490822.ece Mangemillionærer står bak privatskolene]&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent is also landowner and businesswoman [[Mille-Marie Treschow]], who is one of the wealthiest women in Norway.

Until and during the 20th century, noble persons have served at the Royal Court in Oslo. Prominent are (since 1985) Mistress of the Robes [[Ingegjerd Løvenskiold Stuart]] and (between 1931 and 1945) Lord Chamberlain [[Peder Anker Wedel-Jarlsberg]].

Although privileges were abolished and official recognition of titles was removed, some families still consider themselves noble by tradition and—lawfully—still bear their inherited name and coat of arms. Claims to nobility have no effect or support in law. There are still Norwegians who enjoy official recognition from the Danish government;—the [[Danish nobility|nobility in Denmark]] still exists. They are likewise included in the ''[[Danmarks Adels Aarbog|Yearbook of the Danish Nobility]]'', published by the Association of the Danish Nobility.

The family [[Roos af Hjelmsäter]] of the [[Swedish nobility]] is among the disappearingly few of Norway's medieval noble families still living today.&lt;ref name="SNL-uradel"&gt;[http://snl.no/uradel uradel] in Store norske leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;

The aristocracy has ruled and shaped Norway during nearly the whole existence of the Kingdom. Products of and references to the aristocracy are both visible and less explicit in today's society.

===Major cases===
In 1814 noblemen were leading when a [[constitutional monarchy]] and a [[parliament]] were established in Norway. Among them were the [[Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg|Count of Wedel-Jarlsberg]], [[Peder Anker]], and [[Christian Magnus Falsen]]. The [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway]] of 1814, which is still in function, was written by a nobleman, namely by Falsen. This constitution grants, among other things, [[freedom of speech]], protection of private property, and prohibition of painful [[search and seizure]].

In 1905 members of the aristocracy were leading in the independence movement. [[Eystein Eggen]] has claimed Norway's independence was realised by a 'genuinely aristocratic wave',&lt;ref&gt;Eggen, Eystein: [http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/debatt/article1092700.ece Aristokratenes 1905]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|genuint aristokratisk bølge}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which especially [[Fridtjof Nansen|Fridtjof Wedel-Jarlsberg Nansen]] and [[Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg|Fritz Wedel-Jarlsberg]] were important persons.

'''In names and places'''
* Several streets, squares and so on are named after noblemen, among others ''Grev Wedels plass'' (Count Wedel Square), ''Løvenskiolds gate'' (Løvenskiold Street), [[Majorstuen|Majorstua]] (a part of Oslo), and [[Wedel Jarlsberg Land]].
* Several buildings, enterprises and so on are named after noblemen, among others ''[[Best Western]] [[Gyldenløve]] Hotell'' (a hotel), ''Marie Treschow'' (a private home for old people), and ''[[Georg Morgenstierne]]s Hus'' (a building at the [[University of Oslo]] campus).

'''Philanthropy'''
[[Foundations in Norway|Norwegian foundations]] origined along with settled estates (''stamhus'') and [[fee tail]]s (''fideikommiss'') during absolutism in [[Norway]], and noblemen were among the first to establish such. In 1814, when the [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway]] was introduced, the foundation system was the only to survive; the creation of new settled estates and new fee tails was prohibited.

Of over 7,000 foundations in Norway today, several have been established by or bear the name of noble persons and families. An example is the Comital Foundation of Hielmstierne-Rosencrone,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brønnøysundregistrene]]: [http://w2.brreg.no/enhet/sok/detalj.jsp?orgnr=977155878 DEN GREVELIGE HIELMSTIERNE ROSENCRONSKE STIFTELSE]&lt;/ref&gt; providing financial support to certain poor women in [[Bergen]].

'''''Wollstonecraft'''''
In her work ''[[Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark]]'', published in 1796, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] shares her impressions of Norway. Some descriptions are related to the nobility and to the social structure:&lt;ref name="Wollstonecraft"&gt;[[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft, Mary]]: ''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' 1796.

* 'Though the king of Denmark be an absolute monarch, yet the Norwegians appear to enjoy all the blessings of freedom.  Norway may be termed a sister kingdom; but the people have no viceroy to lord it over them, [...]' &lt;small&gt;Letter VII.&lt;/small&gt;
* '[...] the Norwegians appear to me to be the most free community I have ever observed.' &lt;small&gt;Letter VII.&lt;/small&gt;
* 'There are only two counts in the whole country who have estates, and exact some feudal observances from their tenantry.' &lt;small&gt;Letter VII.&lt;/small&gt;
* 'In short, I have seldom heard of any noblemen so innoxious.' &lt;small&gt;Letter IX.&lt;/small&gt;
* '[In Christiania, i.e. Oslo,] I saw the cloven foot of despotism.  I boasted to you that they had no viceroy in Norway, but these Grand Bailiffs, particularly the superior one, who resides at Christiania, are political monsters of the same species. [...] The Grand Bailiffs are mostly noblemen from Copenhagen, [...]' &lt;small&gt;Letter XIII.&lt;/small&gt;
* 'The aristocracy in Norway, if we keep clear of Christiania, is far from being formidable; and it will require a long the to{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} enable the merchants to attain a sufficient moneyed interest to induce them to reinforce the upper class at the expense of the yeomanry, with whom they are usually connected.' &lt;small&gt;Letter XIV.&lt;/small&gt;

=== Modern aristocratic families ===
The following list contains (1) Norwegians who were ennobled in Norway between 1537 and 1660 and (2) Norwegians and Danes who were ennobled in Norway or in Denmark between 1660 and 1814. This list may not contain Danes who were ennobled in Denmark before 1660.

Years of denoblement (extinction) refer to when the last noble ''male'' member died. It should, however, be noted that several letters patent treated men and women equally; when unmarried or widowed, such women had a personal and independent status as noble. An example is the letters patent of the [[Løvenskiold (noble family)|Løvenskiold]] family, which uses the term 'legitimate issue of the male and the female sexus'.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-da|egte afkom af mand og qvindekjøn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different sets of titles have existed, and also the function and the content of titles have varied. There are considerable differences between medieval titles and modern ones.

Dano-Norwegian titles are different from the British concept of [[peerage]]. Whilst a peerage is inherited upon the holder's death and normally by the eldest son only, a Dano-Norwegian title was normally received by all legitimate sons and daughters at the moment of their birth, meaning that there could be several countesses or barons of the same family at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Nobility Law (Norway)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The exception was the title of count (''greve'' for men and ''grevinne'' for women), which in general was restricted to the bearer, his wife, and his eldest son.

One has to distinguish between titles and fiefs. For example, the (administrative) fief ''Countship of Jarlsberg'' was dissolved in 1821, but the recognition of the title ''Count of Jarlsberg'' was not abolished until 1893, and the (physical) estate of Jarlsberg is still in the family's possession.

Whilst a fief in Norway was limited to Norway, the ''title'' was also Danish. Likewise a fief-based title in Denmark was also Norwegian. In other words, titles were dual. For example, there were/are a Norwegian fief ''Countship of Jarlsberg'', a Norwegian title ''Count of Jarlsberg'' (no longer officially recognised), and a Danish title ''Count of Jarlsberg'' (still officially recognised).

The 1821 [[Nobility Law (Norway)|Nobility Law]] initiated a long-range abolition of official recognition of noble titles (not of titles per se).

'''Duke'''
In 1237 Earl [[Skule Bårdsson]] was given the title and the rank of [[duke]] ({{lang-no|hertug}}). It was the first time this title had been used in Norway, and it involved that the title of earl no longer had the highest rank below the King. It also heralded the introduction of new noble titles from [[Continental Europe]], which were to replace the old Norse titles.

'''Earl'''
In the process of increasing his power and territory by annexing [[Petty kingdoms of Norway|petty kingdoms]], Norway's high king offered [[vassalage]] titles in return for recognition and military support from each petty king and his aristocracy. Such regional kings and chieftains received the title of [[earl]] ({{lang-no|jarl}}). Earls were the only ones beside the King himself who were entitled to hold an army.

Later, during the [[Middle Ages]], Earl was in general a title restricted to members of the royal family. There was usually no more than one earl in mainland Norway at one time, and sometimes none. The last earl in mainland Norway was appointed in 1295.

In mainland Norway, this title was used normally for one of two purposes:

* To appoint a [[de facto]] ruler in cases where the King was a [[Minor (law)|minor]] or seriously ill, e.g. [[Haakon the Crazy]] in 1204 during the minority of King [[Guttorm of Norway|Guttorm]], [[Skule of Norway|Skule Bårdsson]] in 1217 during the illness of King [[Inge II of Norway|Inge Bårdsson]].
* To appease a [[pretender]] to the throne without giving him the title of king, e.g. Eirik, the brother of King [[Sverre of Norway|Sverre]].

'''Baron (medieval)'''
[[Lendmann]] was the highest rank attainable in the [[hird]], and a lendmann stood beneath only earls and the King.

King [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus VI]] abolished the title lendmann in 1277, and lendmen were given the title of [[baron]] In 1308, King [[Haakon V]] abolished this title, and a new set of titles was subsequently introduced: ''ridder'' (knight) and ''væpner'' (squire).

=== Medieval aristocratic titles (2nd system) ===

'''Knight and squire'''
The titles of knight and squire were introduced in 1308.

=== Modern aristocratic titles ===
Introduced in 1671 with the titles of baron and count, and supplied with the title of marquis in 1709, the following system is the current in Norway.

{| class="wikitable"

| friherrinne&lt;br/&gt;baronesse
| [[feudal barony|friherreskap]]&lt;br /&gt;[[feudal barony|baroni]]
| [[baron]]
|-
|}

The class of barons and the class of counts were even internally divided. A count would be a titular count (''greve''), a feudal count (''lensgreve'') or a national count (''riksgreve''). Likewise a baron would be a titular baron (''friherre''), a feudal baron (''lensfriherre'') or a national baron (''riksfriherre''). For example, a ''lensgreve'' uses the title ''greve'' only.

The correct combination of names and title when using Norwegian is ''first name'' + ''title'' + ''last name'', e.g. ''Peder Anker grev Wedel Jarlsberg''. The titles ''greve'' and ''friherre'' are abbreviated to respectively ''grev'' and ''friherr'' when used in names or addressing the person concerned, e.g. ''Peder Anker grev Wedel Jarlsberg'' or ''friherr Holberg''.&lt;ref&gt;Likewise, but not relevant in this article, one may not address a commoner as ‘herre Smith’; it has to be abbreviated to ‘herr Smith’.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is written ''Peder Anker Wedel Jarlsberg, grev'''e''' til Jarlsberg'' when the complete title is added to the complete name separated by a comma.

Traditionally, ennobled men have kept their birth name along with their name of nobility. Titles come ''in addition'' to these.

Examples:

* Johann Friedrich Struensee (old name) → [[Johan Friedrich Struensee]], [[Countship of Struensee|Count to Struensee]] (old name, new title)
* Joachim Geelmuyden (old name) → Joachim Geelmuyden [[Gyldenkrantz]] (old name, new name).
* Vilhelm Marselis (old name) → Vilhelm Marselis [[Güldencrone (noble family)|Güldencrone]], [[Barony of Wilhelmsborg|Baron to Wilhelmsborg]] (old name, new name, new title)

However, the old name is usually not kept when the name of nobility derives from this.

Examples:

* Hans Blix → [[Hans Blixencrone]] (not: Hans Blix Blixencrone)
* Bernt Ancher → [[Bernt Anker]] (not: Bernt Ancher Anker)

Whilst an ennobled man kept his old family name together with his name of nobility, descendants inherited the name of nobility only. However, descendants who receive the same given name as him usually receive his old family name too.

Example:

* Herman Leopoldus, ennobled as Herman Leopoldus [[Løvenskiold (noble family)|Løvenskiold]], has descendants named Herman Leopoldus Løvenskiold.

;Marquis
In 1709 King [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV of Norway]] granted the title [[Marquis of Lista]], then spelled ''Lister'', to [[Hugo Octavius Accoramboni, Marquis of Lista|Hugo Octavius Accoramboni]] of [[Florence]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Helland-643"&gt;Helland, Amund (1903): Topografisk-statistisk beskrivelse over Lister og Mandals amt. Første del. Den almindelige del. Pagina 643.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helland-644"&gt;Helland, Amund (1903): Topografisk-statistisk beskrivelse over Lister og Mandals amt. Første del. Den almindelige del. Pagina 644.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently the Marquis of Lista died without issue.

In 1710 the same king granted the title [[Marquis of Mandal]] to [[Francisco di Ratta, Marquis of Mandal|Francisco di Ratta]] and to the latter's nephews [[Giuseppe di Ratta, Marquis of Mandal|Giuseppe di Ratta]] and [[Luigi di Ratta, Marquis of Mandal|Luigi di Ratta]] of [[Bologna]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Helland-643"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Helland-644"/&gt; In Norway official recognition of this title was abolished under the 1821 [[Nobility Law (Norway)|Nobility Law]]. In Denmark it seems to have lasted until 1890.&lt;ref name="SNL-Mandal"&gt;''[[Store norske leksikon]]'': [http://snl.no/Mandal/adelstittel Mandal &amp;ndash; adelstittel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway remains the only country in Scandinavia to which the title of [[marquis]] is attached.

'''Count'''
The title of count was introduced in 1671.

In some families having the title of count, among others [[Wedel-Jarlsberg]], younger sons bear the dependent title of baron. This is often specified in each family's letters patent.

'''Baron (modern)'''
The modern title of baron was introduced in 1671.

==Noble institutions==
[[File:Akershus festning by night.jpg|thumb|Until the absolute monarchy was introduced in 1660, the nobility paid homage to new kings at [[Akershus Fortress]].&lt;br&gt;Photographer: Hans-Petter Fjeld]]
The old nobility had several arenas on which they gathered. Beside the [[Rigsraadet|Council of the Kingdom]], which was abolished in 1536, the nobility met at (1) homages to new kings (Norwegian: ''kongehylling''), (2) meetings of the nobility (''adelsmøte''), (3) meetings of the estates (''stendermøte''), and (4) days of the lords (''herredag''). The nobility's function after 1536 was mainly administrative and ceremonial.

===Homage of 1591===
The homage of 1591 at [[Akershus Fortress]] provides information about the Norwegian nobility in the late 16th century. The Norwegian noblemen who were represented at the homage consisted of some Danes—names like [[Gyldenstierne (noble family)|Gyldenstierne]], Lange, Juel, and [[Huitfeldt (noble family)|Huitfeldt]]—, some Norwegians—names like [[Benkestok (noble family)|Benkestok]]—, a couple of foreigners—Mowat (Scottish) and Norman de la Navité (French)—, and approximately 30 Norwegians with [[patronym]]s (names ending on -sen).&lt;ref&gt;Aktstykker til de norske stændermøders historie 1548–1661, volum I 1–2, paginae 105–108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--List of knights, noblemen, and lawmen: &lt;small&gt;'''(1)''' Henrik ''Gyldenstierne'' to Ågård, '''(2)''' Frederik ''Lange'' to Marckegård, '''(3)''' Hans Pedersen to Sem, '''(4)''' Ove ''Juel'' to Kjeldsgård, '''(5)''' Oluf ''Galde'' to Tomb, '''(6)''' Peder Iversen to Fresje, '''(7)''' Pros Lauritsen to Nørholm, '''(8)''' Anders ''Green'' to Sundsby, '''(9)''' Børge ''Green'' to Ristenes, '''(10)''' Peder Knutsen to Aggervig, '''(11)''' Peder ''Brockenhuus'' to Sande, '''(12)''' Hans ''Dresselberg'' to Stigtbierbye, '''(13)''' Aage ''Bielke'' to Austrått, '''(14)''' Anders ''Huitfeldt'' to Tronstad, '''(15)''' Jørgen ''Kruckow'' to Tjerne, '''(16)''' Eiler ''Brockenhuus'' to Strøm, '''(17)''' Thomas ''Norman de la Navité'', '''(18)''' Anders ''Mowat'' to Hovland, '''(19)''' Peder ''Bagge'', '''(20)''' Otte Thomessen to Vatna, '''(21)''' Jon ''Benkestok'' to Meløya, '''(22)''' Kristoffer ''Dal'' to Sem, '''(23)''' Otte ''Bildt'' to Morlanda (in Sweden), '''(24)''' Vincents ''Bildt'' to Molland, '''(25)''' Laurits ''Lystrup'' to Ofvergaard, '''(26)''' Torbjørn Torbjørnsen to Vie, '''(27)''' Christen Torbjørnsen to Myrvoll, '''(28)''' Peder ''Lystrup'' to Lysdal, '''(29)''' Kristoffer Pedersen to Borregård, '''(30)''' Henrik ''Mund'' to Io, '''(31)''' Mogens Baardsen to Østby, '''(32)''' Christopher ''Grøn'', '''(33)''' Mogens Kristoffersen to Brandstorp, '''(34)''' Knut ''Bildt'' to Lynggård, '''(35)''' Tjøstel Bårdsen to Bleike, '''(36)''' Mats Jonsen, '''(37)''' Gaute Jonsen, '''(38)''' Erik Gjertsen, '''(39)''' Arild Olufsen (Olsen), '''(40)''' Peder Hansen, '''(41)''' Christen ''Brun'', '''(42)''' Erik Hansen*, '''(43)''' Tormod Matsen to Strøm*, '''(44)''' Oluf (Ole) Pedersen to Olsnäs*, '''(45)''' Kjell Haneval*, '''(46)''' Peder Kristensen&lt;*, '''(47)''' Samson Engebretsen to Finne, '''(48)''' Klaus Jensen, '''(49)''' Mats Arildsen, '''(50)''' Jørgen Lauritsen, '''(51)''' Jens Nilsen to Semelenge, '''(52)''' Morten Nilsen, '''(53)''' Povel Hellesen, '''(54)''' Henrik Jørgensen.&lt;/small&gt; --&gt;

===Request of 1648===
In 1648, the nobility requested in a letter to the King that ‘[...] we and our descendants must be held by the Christian right faith and the [[Augsburg Confession]], so [that] it here in the Kingdom shall be maintained, protected, and shielded’ and that ‘we and our descendants of the noble estate here in Norway must be held by Norway’s law and right, [...] and enjoy the same privileges [...] as the nobility in Denmark [has received]’.&lt;ref&gt;Aktstykker til de norske stændermøders historie, volum II 1, pagina 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Himself being Evangelical Lutheran, the King confirmed that ‘[...] the true and pure religion remains unfalsified in lands and kingdoms [...]’.&lt;ref&gt;Aktstykker til de norske stændermøders historie, volum II 1, pagina 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noble privileges==
The noble privileges consisted of freedoms (Norwegian: ''frihet''), rights (Norwegian: ''rettighet''), and prerogatives (Norwegian: ''forrettighet''). There were two primary sources for such privileges: the letters of privilege and the electoral charters, both issued by the King.

The royal decrees on the order of precedence, introduced in the 17th century, created the office nobility (Norwegian: ''embetsadel'', ''rangadel''), i.e. persons who by holding a high civilian or military office or by belonging to, most often, one of the three highest classes of rank automatically received noble status for themselves as well as for wife and legitimate children.

===Noble privileges of 1582===
The noble privileges of 1582, given before the Meeting of the Nobility in the same year, decreed that a noblewoman who married a non-noble man should lose all her hereditary land to her nearest co-inheritor. The rule was designed with the intention of keeping noble land in noble hand and thus strengthening the nobility's power base. A similar clause in 1591 stated that a nobleman who married a non-noble woman should forfeit noble status for their children.

===Noble privileges of 1661===
The noble privileges of 1661 (1) reconfirmed the neck and hand, (4) reconfirmed the right for the nobility on their estates and in thereto belonging woods and waters to hunt and fish, (5) stated jura patronatus, but together with a duty to maintain the church buildings and such, (7, 8) stated that the nobility shall enjoy rank and honour above all others, (10) stated that the nobility when on travels representing the King shall receive a certain monetary compensation, (13) stated that no nobleman may be sentenced from honour or life by others than the King and his highest court, (14) stated that no nobleman may be arrested, and (22) reconfirmed the birk right.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Tax freedom===
Noblemen enjoyed personal tax freedom, although this was later abolished. Tax freedom for their seat farms remained.

Noblemen had other economic privileges, among others freedom from [[Duty (economics)|duty]] on imported and exported goods, such as beer and wine.

===Seat farm===
[[File:Elingaard front.jpg|thumb|[[Elingård|Elingård Farm]] in [[Østfold]] was a noble seat farm. The earliest known owner was Olav Torsteinsson (Gyldenhorn) in the 15th century.&lt;br&gt;Photographer: Commons user ''Arkitekten'']]
[[File:Glass paintings Torsnes.jpg|thumb|Glass paintings of the 17th century at [[Torsnes|Torsnes Farm]].&lt;br&gt;Photographer: Elin Galtung Lihaug]]

[[Seat farm]]s (Norwegian: ''setegård'', ''setegard'') were until 1660 an exclusive privilege of the nobility. A seat farm, a form of feudal [[demesne]], was a nobleman's main residence; the place where he had his seat. Seat farms had, especially, freedom from tax and [[tithe]]s.

While previously any farm on which a nobleman decided to reside would thereby acquire the status of seat farm, the right to become a seat farm was remarkably limited in 1639, when the law was changed to require a farm to have been a seat farm for a minimum of 40 years in order for it to be officially recognised. After 1800, the tax freedom was modified, and under the 1821 [[Nobility Law (Norway)|Nobility Law]], the tax freedom was ended at the then current owner's death.



===Weekday farmers===
Weekday farmers (Norwegian: ''ukedagsbønder'', ''vekedagsbønder'') were persons who, as tenants of the noble, had a duty to work on the seat farm on weekdays. The system came from Denmark before 1600. It became most widespread in Eastern Norway, where the concentration of seat farms was highest, but existed also in other parts of the Kingdom. From 1685 on, the duty work was limited to farmers who lived within two miles of the seat farm.

===Feud right===
The feud right (Norwegian: ''feiderett'') was the right to officially proclaim a feud between two or more persons. A murder committed after the proclamation of a feud was considered an ‘honest murder’, and unlike ordinary murders, which normally received capital punishment, could be expiated with fines. The feud right is mentioned in almost all electoral charters from 1513 to 1648.

===Conveyance right===
The King and noblemen, as well as high officials, had the right to receive conveyance from farmers. The right was never a formal right, but rather a consequence of the ‘conveyance duty’ which was imposed on farmers. Conveyance duty (Norwegian: ''skyssplikt'') is known since the 12th century and functioned as indirect taxation. In 1816, the duty was changed from being a free service to receiving payment per trip. However, the partial tax freedom which conveyance farmers had was abolished at the same time.

===Neck and hand right===
In 1646, the nobility achieved the possibility of having ‘neck and hand right’ (Norwegian: ''hals- og håndsrett''), that is, the authority to arrest and to prosecute persons and to execute judgments. This right was limited to farms or fiefs over which noblemen had jurisdiction.

===Charge and fine right===
Related to the neck and hand right was the ‘charge and fine right’ (Norwegian: ''sikt- og sakefallsrett''), that is, the authority to raise a charge against and to fine persons. This right, too, was limited to each nobleman's area of jurisdiction.

===Birk right===
The birk right (Norwegian: ''birkerett'') was the authority to appoint judges at the [[Birk (market place)|birk]] court, etcetera; birks were an ancient form of local jurisdiction adopted in Norway on the Danish model. Nine birks were created in 1649, but abolished already in 1651. The first real birks came in 1671 with the creation of the Countship of Larvik, in 1673 with the creation of the Countship of Griffenfeld, and in 1678 with the creation of the Barony of Rosendal. In addition the birk right was granted to the Halsnøy Monastery in 1661, the Lysekloster Estate in 1661, and the Svanøy Estate in 1685. The two countship birks and the barony birk lasted until 1821, when they were ‘entirely abolished’.

===Jus patronatus===
The ''jus patronatus'' (patronage right) consisted of ''jus presentandi'', the right to propose clergy for a specific church, and later became ''jus vocandi'', the right to appoint such clergy. Furthermore, the patron had the right to part of the church taxes and other income of the church. Jus patronatus did not have any relevance in Norway until after the 1640s, when a few noblemen began to receive it. This privilege was never widespread in the Kingdom.

===Various===
Around 1277, lendmen and skutilsveins received tax freedom for themselves and two members of their household, and ordinary members of the hird received the same, but for one member of their household.

In 1548, the nobility's attempts to weaken farmers’ [[odelsrett|allodial land right]] (Norwegian: ''odelsrett'') were rejected by the King and the Danish Council of the Kingdom.

== Noble symbolism ==

=== Coat of arms ===
{{See also|Norwegian heraldry}}

[[File:Den danske Vitruvius 1 tab026 - Kroner.jpg|thumb|Modern-time coronets of rank. Nobles and counts have one variant used on helms and shields and one variant used within shields. Barons' coronet applies to both locations.]]
[[File:Wedel.JPG|thumb|Coat of arms, including coronet, supporters, and motto, above the entrance to the family tomb of the [[Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg]].]]
[[File:Treschow.JPG|thumb|Gate to the manor of the [[Treschow (Dano-Norwegian family)|Treschow]] family. It shows the family coat of arms together with coronet and motto.]]

The use of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] was originally a custom developed and maintained by the nobility, but it was not exclusive to this estate. Norwegian farmers and burghers, as well as the non-noble parts of the clergy, had since early times borne arms in addition to more commonly used [[house mark]]s.

While the arms of the old nobility were of ancient origin and inherited through generations within each family, and therefore were not a (known) privilege from the King, the arms of the new nobility were often granted by the King upon ennoblement. In some cases, the ennobled person's former coat of arms or his wishes could be regarded in the process of composing new arms and [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]]s.

'''Helm'''
According to Dano-Norwegian custom, both nobles and non-nobles could use an open helm above the shield. (In Sweden, open helms were a privilege exclusive for the nobility.) Nobles used one, barons used two, and counts used three helms. Alternatively, counts’ helms had eleven bars and barons’ helms had seven bars.

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Dano-Norwegian Count Helm Coronet.jpg|Counts’ coronet and helm (eleven bars).
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Coronet'''
Noble coronets (Norwegian: ''adelskrone'') or coronets of rank (''rangkrone''), whether physical coronets or appearing in heraldic artwork, were reserved for the nobility. There were specific coronets for counts, barons, and nobility. In addition, the [[Gyldenløve|Golden Lions]]&amp;mdash;illegitimate royal descendants&amp;mdash;had an exclusive coronet.

File:T05 Danish Baron.svg|Coronet of barons on helm and shield and within shield.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Supporters'''
[[Supporter (heraldry)|Supporters]] were normally given only to counts.

'''Motto'''
Some noble families have [[motto]]s. These are always in [[Latin]].

Examples:

* [[Wedel-Jarlsberg|Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg]]: &lt;small&gt;RECTE FACIENDO NEMINEM TIMEAS&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Wedel.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Barony Rosendal|Barons of Rosendal]]: &lt;small&gt;MELIUS MORI IN LIBERTATE QUAM VIVERE IN SERVITUTE&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]: [http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ludvig_Rosenkrantz_Til_Rosendal/utdypning Ludvig Rosenkrantz Til Rosendal]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anker (noble family)|Anker]]: &lt;small&gt;GLORIA EX UTILE&lt;/small&gt;
* [[Treschow (noble family)|Treschow]]: &lt;small&gt;PIE CANDIDE CONSTANTER&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Treschow.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names===
[[File:Anker arms.jpg|thumb|Canting arms of the [[Anker (family)|Anker]] family.]]

Almost unique internationally and different from the continental nobility, where families have named themselves after the piece of land that they possess, Nordic nobles have since the 16th century in general adopted family names of an abstract and artistical character, often based on their respective coats of arms. For example, the noble family whose arms were a golden star, took the name [[Gyldenstierne (noble family)|Gyldenstierne]] ({{lang-en|Golden Star}}). As this custom of the old nobility established itself as permanent, also the new nobility, that is persons and families ennobled after the Medieval Ages, often received similar names when ennobled.

Other examples are [[Anker (family)|Anker]] ({{lang-en|Anchor}}), [[Gyllenpistol]] (''Golden Gun'') in Sweden, [[Hästesko]] (''Horseshoe'') in Sweden, [[Huitfeldt (noble family)|Huitfeldt]] (''White Field''), [[Løvenørn]] (''Lion Eagle''), [[Natt och Dag]] (''Night and Day'') in Sweden, [[Rosenvinge]] (''Rose Wing''), [[Svanenhielm]] (''Swan Helm''), [[Svinhufvud]] (''Swine Head'') in Sweden, and [[Tordenskiold]] (''Thunder Shield'').

'''Particle'''
The use of [[Nobiliary particle|particles]] like ''af'', ''von'', and ''de''—all these mean ''of''—was no particular privilege for the nobility, but on the other hand almost exclusively used by and associated with them. Especially in the late 17th century and the 18th century, one would often receive a particle together with one's old or new name when ennobled. Examples are families like [[Gyldenpalm (noble family)|de Gyldenpalm]] (lit. ‘of Goldenpalm’) and, with two particles, [[Munthe af Morgenstierne (noble family)|von Munthe af Morgenstierne]] (lit. ‘of Munthe of Morningstar’).

Prominent non-noble families having used particles are [[Cappelen (family)|von Cappelen]], [[von der Lippe (Norwegian family)|von der Lippe]], and [[Créquy family|de Créqui dit la Roche]].

'''Preposition'''
A nobleman had the right to write himself ''to'' ({{lang-no|til}}) the [[seat farm|seat farm(s)]] or the estate(s) on which he resided, for example ‘[[Sigurd Jonsson (regent)|Sigurd Jonsson]] til [[Sørum|Sudreim]]’. This preposition must not be confused with particles, which were a part of names.

=== Consumption ===
[[File:Ulvilde.JPG|thumb|The gravestone of Ulvhild Iversdatter to Melau may, among other available sources, illustrate noblewomen's fashion in the late 16th and the early 17th century. Through exclusive clothing and jewelry the nobility demonstrated great wealth, and also in this regard they distinguished themselves from the estate of commoners.&lt;ref name="Apollon"&gt;[http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/2007_3/Artikler/adel Adelens fråtsing på 1500-tallet]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Clothing'''
Already in the Medieval Ages a man was not allowed to dress in clothes implying that he belonged to another estate than his actual.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Whilst commoners could not wear finer clothes than nobles did, the nobility had to make sure they were not better dressed than the King and his family.&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt; In 1528 a royal decree decided that no noble could own more than three clothes of silk.&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt; No ladies or maids could wear broad [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]].&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt; Pearls in textiles as well as textiles containing gold were reserved for royal persons.&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt;

Usually a cloth's value was relatively big. Accessories were no exception. For example, a pearl bonnet alone could cost as much as 100 dollars;&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt; this was three years' salary for a [[Carpentry|carpenter]].&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt; Expensive were also gold chains, bonnets with ostrich feathers, etcetera.&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt; As such clothes were not only a matter of dressing, but also a part a family's capital.

Slitted clothes were usual among (female) nobles. This would reveal that a garment had two layers of textile.

'''Education'''
Many noblemen received their education at the [[Sorø Academy]] in [[Denmark]], a [[knight academy]]. Young men of the high nobility studied also at [[List of universities in Germany|German universities]].

'''16th and 17th century'''
During their trade with foreigners the nobility acquired luxurious products, for example chocolates, [[saffron]], [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], [[olive]], and [[citrus]].&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt; They desired and received new technology, such as [[stove]]s and [[bracket clock]]s.&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt; Also living animals were popular.&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt;

It was customary to give each other presents, for example horses, precious metals, and exotic fruits, especially to more important nobles or if one wished a service in return.&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt;

A case of exceptional dimensions was when [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] asked whether [[Tycho Brahe]] in [[Denmark]] was able to get him some [[reindeer]]s. Brahe wrote to his relative [[Axel Gyldenstierne]], [[Governor-general of Norway]], and after some struggle Gyldenstierne was able to find five animals, of which two were sent by ship to Brahe.&lt;ref name="Apollon"/&gt;

== Relation to the people ==

=== Cognatic descent of medieval aristocracy ===
[[File:Meløya.JPG|thumb|left|[[Meløy]]a was the seat of the major noble family of [[Benkestok (noble family)|Benkestok]]. Both the farm and the estate were inherited by non-noble descendants.&lt;br&gt;Photo: Commons user ''Knut'']]
[[File:Carl Martin Ellingsen.jpg|thumb|Descendant of the medieval aristocracy: [[Carl Martin Ellingsen]] (1848–1926).&lt;br&gt;Photo: Sophus Körner]]

A large number of Norwegians may trace ancestral lines back to members of various levels of medieval aristocracy. They must very often cross numerous cognatic links ({{lang-no|kvinneledd}}) and go back to the 16th century in order to establish a connection to the nobility. (An important consideration in this regard is that many experts dispute some popularly accepted family relations, which they consider undocumented or obviously wrong.) [[Queen Sonja of Norway]], born a commoner, has noblemen among her distant forefathers.

Whilst nearly all families of medieval aristocracy have become patrilineally extinct, there are families today whose patrilineal ancestors were close cognatic descendants of old noble families, for example some [[Nordland families]], the most prominent being the [[Ellingsen (family)|Ellingsen family]], whose progenitor shipper and tradesman Elling Christophersen was a great-grandson of Margrethe Jonsdotter Benkestok,&lt;ref name="Brandt-288"&gt;Brandt, Wilhelmine: ''Slægten Benkestok'', p. 288. Damms Antikvariat’s edition of 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Christensen (family)|Christensen family]] of the [[Husby Estate]], whose progenitor shipper and tradesman Anders Christensen was a great-great-grandson of aforementioned Margrethe.&lt;ref name="Brandt-288"/&gt;

Even though a family could lose their noble status, they would usually keep their land and fortune. There are examples of non-noble descendants who have inherited previously noble land centuries after the noble family concerned had become patrilineally extinct. One example is the estate of the [[Benkestok (noble family)|Benkestok family]], who lost their noble status in the late 16th century and disappeared patrilineally after 1672.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Wilhelmine: ''Slægten Benkestok'', p. 6. Damms Antikvariat’s edition of 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The estate originally consisted of land in Eastern, Western, and Northern Norway as well as on the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Shetland]]. Whilst the first generations of inheritors received large portions of land, it would subsequently be divided into smaller and smaller parts so that inheritors of later generations each received, be it, a large farm.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Wilhelmine: Slægten Benkestok, pagina 261. Damms Antikvariat’s edition of 1985. Citation: Ved Skiftet efter ham [d.v.s. sin ektemann] [...] 1787 „angav Enken [Elisabet Tollevsdatter] at have arvet efter sin sal. Moder Kirsten Andersdatter Nesøen for ungefær 69 Aar siden 4 Pd. [d.v.s. pund] i Gaarden Vaage i Rødø Fjerding”. NB. ''Vaage i Rødø'' nævnes som hørende til „de Benchestokkers Gods” baade ved Skiftet efter Trond Tordsen Benkestok 1570 [...] og ved Skiftet efter hans Søn Jon Benkestok 1599, ligesaa [i senere skifter].&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning descent from royalty through nobility, nobility expert [[Tore Vigerust]] has stated, though as a conservative estimate, that roughly 10,000 Norwegians living today can document with certainty their descent from the old [[List of Norwegian monarchs|kings of Norway]] and European royal houses. Vigerust has identified the noble families [[Gyldenløve (noble family)|Gyldenløve]] of [[Austrått]] and [[Rosensverd]] as families whose royal descent is verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;Adressa.no [http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/innenriks/article965664.ece Den store adelsbløffen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:

* [[Carl Martin Ellingsen]] (1848&amp;ndash;1926), of the aforementioned [[Nordland families|Nordland family]] [[Ellingsen (family)|Ellingsen]], was a [[Parliament of Norway|Member of Parliament]].

=== Cognatic descent of modern aristocracy ===
[[File:Bokken Lasson.jpeg|thumb|Descendant of the modern aristocracy: [[Bokken Lasson]] (1871&amp;ndash;1970).&lt;br&gt;Photo: unknown]]

A considerably smaller number of Norwegians descend from families of modern aristocracy, patrilineally as well as through cognatic links. Among such descendants, one finds several nationally and even internationally prominent persons.

Examples:

* [[Fridtjof Nansen|Fridtjof Wedel-Jarlsberg Nansen]] (1861&amp;ndash;1930), whose mother was Baroness Adelaide [[Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg|of Wedel-Jarlsberg]], was an explorer.
* [[Bokken Lasson]] (1871&amp;ndash;1970), whose mother was a [[Munthe af Morgenstierne]], was a cabaret singer and as well a member of the ''[[Kristiania Bohemians]]''.
* [[Pontine Paus]] (born 1973), a granddaughter of Countess Hedevig of Wedel-Jarlsberg, is a world-leading designer of [[handbag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]: [http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2003/11/21/bags-of-style Bags of Style]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous===
Through many ages, common people have desired either to be noble or to descend from members of this estate. This has led some to construct fraudulent ''[[ahnentafel]]s'' ([[pedigree chart]]s) or to accept erroneous ahnentafels.

An extreme case of such ahnentafels is that of [[Jon Bratt Otnes]] (1919–2004). Otnes was born into the lowest class of the farmer estate; his father was a cotter ({{lang-no|husmann}}). In the 1970s and with a heavily erroneous ahnentafel, Otnes began to claim publicly that he was the current head of the Medieval noble family of [[Brat (noble family)|Brat/Bratt]] and that he thus could have been King of Norway and of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aftenposten]]: [http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d169647.htm Han er vårt egentlig kongsemne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214015455/http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d169647.htm |date=2013-02-14 }} October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dagbladet]]: [http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2000/10/22/224341.html Rundlurte Aftenposten] 22 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This case caused much controversy between the 1970s and 2000.

During parts of the [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|Romantic Nationalist epoch]] and the subsequent worshipping of Vikings, when it was popular and/or gave a particular high status to demonstrate descent from the 'real' (i.e. Medieval, non-foreign) noble families and kings of Norway, fraudulent pedigrees flourished. This was the case also during the illegitimate [[Nasjonal Samling|National Unification]] rule during [[German occupation of Norway|Germany's occupation of Norway]] (1940–1945).

== Nobility as a term ==
[[File:Ovebjelke.jpg|thumb|[[Ove Bjelke|Ove Jensen Bjelke]], [[Chancellor of Norway]], belonged to the old nobility in Denmark and to the new nobility in Norway.&lt;br&gt;Painter: unknown&lt;br&gt;Photographer: Commons user ''Orland'']]

=== Medieval terms ===
The medieval aristocracy called themselves [[hird]] and later ‘free men’ likewise as commoners were called ‘unfree’. Knights were gathered in a particular class known as the [[Knight]]hood ({{lang-no|Ridderskapet}}), which stood above what was called ‘ordinary nobility’ ({{lang-no|menig adel}}). The aristocracy did not adopt and use the term ‘nobility’ ({{lang-no|adel}}) until the late 15th and the early 16th century; this originally German word arrived at the same time as the German [[House of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] [[List of Norwegian monarchs|Kings of Norway]]. However, the entity was completely the same before and after the introduction of this term.

=== Old and new nobility ===
In some cases it is difficult to draw a clear border between old nobility alias the medieval aristocracy and new nobility alias the modern aristocracy. A consensual definition is that new nobility are persons and families who were ennobled by [[letters patent]] by [[List of Norwegian monarchs|Norwegian monarchs]], primarily monarchs after and including Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret]]. Even though the term ‘new nobility’ is often considered as identical with ‘post-medieval nobility’, a not unconsiderable amount of so-called letter-noble families were ennobled and operated politically and militarily in the Late Medieval Age, among others the [[Rosenvinge (noble family)|Rosenvinge]] family, ennobled in 1505.

Old nobility from Denmark is considered as new nobility in Norway, not least because they represented a new era&amp;mdash;that of foreign rule&amp;mdash;in Norway's history.

=== High and low nobility ===
The high nobility consists of titled persons and families. The low nobility is untitled. This set of term applies mainly to nobility after 1671, when the titles of count and of baron were introduced. Families whose members have had seats in the pre-1536 [[Riksråd|Council of the Kingdom]]&amp;mdash;the ''Riksråd''&amp;mdash;are considered as high nobility in Norway. They are even known under their own term, ''riksråd nobility'' ({{lang-no|riksrådsadel}}).

=== Sword nobility and robe nobility ===
The terms sword nobility ({{lang-no|sverdadel}}) and robe nobility ({{lang-no|kjoleadel}}) refer to the nobility before and after 1660, respectively.

=== Office nobility and letter nobility ===
These terms are treated in this article's section [[Norwegian nobility#Modern aristocracy|Modern aristocracy]].

=== ''Uradel'' ===
[[Uradel]] (English: lit. ‘primeval nobility’) is an originally [[German language|German]] and romantic term that was coined in the 1820s and later adopted into the [[Norwegian language]] as well as into [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The term refers to the medieval aristocracy. The opposite of ''uradel'' is ''brevadel'' (English: lit. ‘letter nobility’).

==Other terms of nobility==

===Authentic farmer nobility===
Farmer nobility (Norwegian: ''bondeadel'') refers to farmers who were noble.

This term may also be used unofficially to describe farmers who had been noble or who had such ancestry through cognatic links and within a short genealogical timeframe. They were not a part of the Norwegian nobility.

For example, in 1768, when asked by the authorities in [[Copenhagen]] whether there still lived old nobility in the districts [[Senja (island)|Senja]] and [[Troms]] in [[Northern Norway]], a Danish-rooted official wrote: ‘Of old nobility I know nothing here in the north, but here is far too much farmer nobility or [[Benkestok (noble family)|Benkestok]] nobility!’&lt;ref name="Ytreberg18"&gt;Ytreberg, N.A. (1981): ''Nordlandske handelssteder'', pagina 18.&lt;/ref&gt; As an immigrant to the region, he was unfamiliar with the strong feeling of pride among the so-called page nobility (see below) and the farmers of aristocratic origin.&lt;ref name="Ytreberg18"/&gt;

===Romantic nationalistic farmer nobility===
After Norway achieved constitutional independence in 1814, in the period of [[romantic nationalism]] that followed, the urban ‘cultural élite’ as well as some farmers themselves began to consider the ‘Norwegian farmer’ as representative or a symbolic figure of ‘Norwegianness’. Norwegian farmers had always been relatively free compared to farmers in continental Europe, something to which the lack of a large and strong nobility had contributed. Farmers had in general sufficient amounts of food, and lived ‘in peaceful and natural circumstances’. Furthermore, from the middle of the 18th century, and peaking in the 19th, many Norwegian farmers managed to buy their own farms. Factors like these contributed to some farmers coming to regard themselves as a kind of farmer nobility. Such ideas are reflected, for example, in romantic nationalistic literature, but the term has never had any legal currency in Norway, and such farmers were and remained commoners.

For example, the teacher Andreas Austlid wrote in his book ''Salt fraa folkehøgskulen'' (1926) about his home parish: ‘An old parish of wealth, broad and satisfied and good – the most beautiful in the whole valley. A kind and calm farmer nobility - but self-supplied [with food], with much good and much low ancestry ...’&lt;ref&gt;''Norwegian (Nynorsk):'' Ei gamall velstands bygd, breid og mett og god - den fagraste i heile dalen. Ein snild og godsleg - men sjølvbyrg bondeadel, med mykjen god og mykjen laak arv ...&lt;/ref&gt;

===Page nobility===
{{See also|Setesvein}}
Page nobility ({{lang-no|knapeadel}}; ''knape'' means [[Page (occupation)|page]] or ''boy'') was and is a non-legal term referring to historical and in many cases biological descendants of the clerical setesveins in [[Northern Norway]].&lt;ref name="Ytreberg17"/&gt; As traders and shippers, these descendants in the late 16th and the 17th centuries constituted the leading non-noble class in the region.&lt;ref name="Ytreberg17"/&gt; In the 18th century, however, the term ''knape'' was in general used for all non-privileged traders and shippers regardless of their backgrounds.

===Expressions and extrapolated usage===
In modern Norwegian language, there are several expressions containing noble terms and titles. Examples are:

* '''adel, adelig:''' ''arbeidets adel'', nobility of labour
* '''fyrste, fyrstelig:''' ''fyrstelig mottakelse'', be received in a splendid manner, ''more seg fyrstelig'', rejoice like a prince
* '''greve, grevelig:''' ''(ankomme) i grevens tid'', (arrive) just in time and/or as the last person, ''leve som en greve'', live like a count, i.e. luxuriously

Furthermore, noble titles are used to describe persons who within respective sections of society have a leading position. Examples are:

* '''-adel:''' ''lønnsadel'', lit. wage nobility, ''nikkersadel'', lit. [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] nobility (Oslo only)
* '''-baron:''' ''matbaron'', food (chain) baron, ''oljebaron'', oil baron, ''hotellbaron'', hotel baron
* '''-fyrste:''' ''finansfyrste'', prince of finances, ''åndsfyrste'', intellectual prince, ''tåkefyrste'', lit. fog prince
* '''-aristokrati:''' ''pengearistokrati'', moneyed aristocracy, ''åndsaristokrati'', intellectual aristocracy

'''Asháninka''' (sometimes referred to as '''Campa''', although this name is derogatory) is an [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan language]] spoken by the [[Asháninka people]] of [[Peru]] and [[Acre (state)|Acre]], [[Brazil]]. There are low literacy rates in Asháninka; despite this, language use is vibrant among the Asháninka.

==Classification==

The Campa (or Pre-Andean) group of the [[Maipurean|Maipurean language family]] includes what have been called Asháninka, Gran Pajonal Campa, Ashéninka, Axaninca, Machiguenga, and Nomatsiguenga. As these are all very closely related linguistic systems, the decision to call them [[dialect]]s of a single language or different languages rests on social and political considerations rather than linguistic similarity or difference, as in so many other places in the world. Attempts to unify the varieties with one written standard have not been successful.

==History==

The language has also been called both Asháninka and Campa; the latter of which is considered by the Asháninka to be offensive, as it derives from the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] word ''thampa'', meaning ragged and dirty. Like all languages that have a predominance in any particular region of Perú, Asháninka is an official language in the area in which it is spoken, as provided by the [[Constitution of Peru|Constitution]]. Literacy rates range from 10% to 30%, compared to 15% to 25% literacy for the second language, [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

==Threats==

This language can be categorized as vulnerable for a multitude of reasons. South America has been a target for logging and other deforestation efforts, that are oftentimes illegal. Those that speak Asháninka call the historically dense rainforests of Peru and Brazil their home, and live off this land. This habitat, specially in the Peruvian side, faces a moderate threat from logging and other destructive practices by outside forces.

[[File:Tanner scale-female.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Tanner stages]] of breast development in girls.]]

'''Breast development''', also known as '''mammogenesis''', is a complex [[biological process]] in [[primate]]s that takes place throughout a [[female|female's]] life. It occurs across several phases, including [[prenatal development]], [[puberty]], and [[pregnancy]]. At [[menopause]], breast development ceases and the breasts atrophy. Breast development results in prominent and developed structures on the chest known as [[breast]]s in primates, which serve as both a [[sexual characteristic]] and as [[mammary gland]]s. The process is mediated by an assortment of [[hormone]]s (and [[growth factor]]s), the most important of which include [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], [[prolactin]], and [[growth hormone]].

==Biochemistry==
[[File:Breast anatomy normal scheme.png|thumb|upright=1.36|The breast: cross-section scheme of the [[mammary gland]]. {{ordered list |[[Chest wall]] |[[Pectoralis muscle]]s |[[Lobules]] |[[Nipple]] |[[Areola]] |[[Lactiferous duct|Milk duct]] |[[Adipose tissue|Fatty tissue]] |[[Human skin|Skin]]}}]]

===Hormones===
The master regulators of breast development are the [[steroid hormone]]s, [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]], growth hormone (GH), mostly via its secretory product, [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), and [[prolactin]].&lt;ref name="pmid20554705"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Hynes NE, Watson CJ |title = Mammary Gland Growth Factors: Roles In Normal Development And In Cancer |journal = Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol |volume = 2 |issue = 8 |pages = a003186 |year = 2010 |pmid = 20554705 |pmc = 2908768 |doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a003186 |url = }}[https://www.lustaci.com/best-breast-enhancement-pills/]&lt;/ref&gt; These regulators induce the expression of [[growth factor]]s, such as [[amphiregulin]], [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF), IGF-1, and [[fibroblast growth factor]] (FGF), which in turn have specific roles in breast growth and maturation.&lt;ref name="pmid20554705" /&gt;

At [[puberty]], [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) begins to be secreted, in a [[pulsatile secretion|pulsatile]] manner, from the [[hypothalamus]].&lt;ref name="JatoiKaufmann2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Ismail Jatoi |author2 = Manfred Kaufmann |title = Management of Breast Diseases |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nsUBW3-qJ9MC&amp;pg=PA12 |date = 11 February 2010 |publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn = 978-3-540-69743-5 |pages = 12, 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RosenthalZenilman2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Ronnie Ann Rosenthal |author2 = Michael E.

Women with CAIS, who are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated actions of androgens, have, as a group, above-average sized breasts. This is true despite the fact that they simultaneously have relatively low levels of estrogen, which demonstrates the powerful suppressant effect of androgens on estrogen-mediated breast development.&lt;ref name="IIIBarbieri2013" /&gt;

[[Aromatase excess syndrome]], an extremely rare condition characterized by marked [[hyperestrogenism]], is associated with precocious breast development and macromastia in females and similarly precocious [[gynecomastia]] (women's breasts) in males.&lt;ref name="pmid12843139"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Martin RM, Lin CJ, Nishi MY |title = Familial hyperestrogenism in both sexes: clinical, hormonal, and molecular studies of two siblings |journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume = 88 |issue = 7 |pages = 3027–34 |date = July 2003 |pmid = 12843139 |doi = 10.1210/jc.2002-021780 |url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12843139 |display-authors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9543166"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Stratakis CA, Vottero A, Brodie A |title = The aromatase excess syndrome is associated with feminization of both sexes and autosomal dominant transmission of aberrant P450 aromatase gene transcription |journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume = 83 |issue = 4 |pages = 1348–57 |date = April 1998 |pmid = 9543166 |doi = 10.1210/jc.83.4.1348 |url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9543166 |display-authors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Makowski2011"&gt;{{cite book |author = Gregory Makowski |title = Advances in Clinical Chemistry |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u_ksaKq95jkC&amp;pg=PT158 |accessdate = 24 May 2012 |date = 22 April 2011 |publisher = Academic Press |isbn = 978-0-12-387025-4 |page = 158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition in which the AR is defective and insensitive to androgens, there is full breast development with breast volumes that are in fact above average in spite of relatively low levels of estrogen (50 pg/mL estradiol).&lt;ref name="IIIBarbieri2013" /&gt; In [[aromatase deficiency]], a form of [[hypoestrogenism]] in which aromatase is defective and cannot synthesize estrogen, and in complete [[estrogen insensitivity syndrome]], a condition in which ERα is defective and insensitive to estrogen, breast development is completely absent.&lt;ref name="DianePublishing"&gt;{{cite book |title = International position paper on women's health and menopause : a comprehensive approach |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NCzYsz6Uv0IC&amp;pg=PA78 |publisher = DIANE Publishing |isbn = 978-1-4289-0521-4 |pages = 78– }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JamesonGroot2015"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = J.

The community of '''Britons in Egypt''' includes British migrants in [[Egypt]], as well as Egyptian citizens of British descent. In 2006, the Institute for Public Policy Research estimated that 14,000 British people were resident in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/brits_abroad/html/africa.stm|title=Africa|work=Brits Abroad|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bundelas''' are a [[Rajput]] clan of central India. The families belonging to this clan ruled several small states in the [[Bundelkhand]] region from the 16th century.

== Mythical origin ==

The mythical accounts of the Bundela dynasties trace their ancestry to the [[Suryavansha]] (solar dynasty). An example of such an account is that of Gorelal or Lal Kavi (c. 1700 CE), who composed a poetic biography of the Bundela king [[Chhatrasal]].{{sfn|Jain|2002|p=11}}

The account goes like this: [[Brahma]] originated from [[Vishnu]]. The descendants of Brahma were: [[Marichi]], [[Kashyapa]], [[Surya]] (the sun; son of Kashyapa and [[Aditi]]), [[Ikshavaku]], [[Dilipa (mythology)|Dilipa]], [[Raghu]], [[Aja (Hindu mythology)|Aja]], [[Dasharatha]], [[Ramachandra]], [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]], Haribrahma, and Vihagaraja. The seventh-generation descendant of Vihagaraja was Kiratdeva, who was the ancestor of [[Varanasi|Kashi]] king Virabhadra. The founder of the Bundela dynasty was a descendant of Virabhadra's son Jagdas (also known as Pancham, Devadasa or Hem Karan).{{sfn|Jain|2002|pp=9-11}}

Jagdas was a son of Virabhadra's junior queen. After being denied a share in the Kashi kingdom by the four sons of the elder queen, he came to the shrine of the goddess [[Vindhyavasini]]. There, he engaged in a long ''[[tapasya]]'' to seek the goddess' blessings. After failing to evoke response, he decided to sacrifice his head to the deity. As soon as the first drop of his blood fell on the ground, the goddess appeared before him. She declared that his son, a brave hero and a future ruler, would appear from the drop of the blood. This son – Bundela – was named after the drop (''bund'').{{sfn|Jain|2002|p=11-12}} The Bundela dynasties worshipped the Vindhyavasini as their [[kuladevi]] (family deity).{{sfn|Jain|2002|p=13}}

== Expansion legends ==

According to Bundela legends, Jagdas' descendant Arjunpal was the ruler of Mahoni. His eldest son Birpal succeeded him as the king of Mahoni, although his younger son Sohanpal was the best warrior. To get his share of the kingdom, Sohanpal sought help from Naga (alias Hurmat Singh), the [[Khangar (community)|Khangar]] ruler of Kurar ([[Garh Kundar|Kundar]]). Naga demanded a matrimonial alliance in return. When Sohanpal refused, Naga tried to detain him and forcibly agree him to the condition. Sohanpal escaped, and unsuccessfully sought help from the [[Chauhan]]s, the Salingars, and the [[Kachwaha]]s. Ultimately, a [[Panwar]] chief named Panpal (or Punyapal) agreed to help him. Their joint army defeated Naga in 1288 CE.{{sfn|Jain|2002|pp=14-15}} Sohanpal killed all the Khangar men in the fort, but spared the babies on the condition that the Khangars would serve as the servants of the Bundelas.{{sfn|Jain|2002|p=27}} Sohanpal became the king of Kurar, and his daughter married Panpal.{{sfn|Jain|2002|pp=14-15}}

The Bundelas formed "milk brotherhood" with the [[Ahirs]]. The Ahir wet nurses (''dudh ma'' or "milk mothers") nourished the Bundela princes with their milk, while the Ahir men served as warriors in the Bundela armies.{{sfn|Jain|2002|p=30}}

== Historical kingdoms ==

[[Rudra Pratap Singh]] (reigned 1501-1531 CE), said to be a descendant of Sohanpal, moved his capital from Garh Kundar to [[Orchha]] in 1531 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=K. K. Kusuman |title=A Panorama of Indian Culture: Professor A. Sreedhara Menon Felicitation Volume |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4JqgSUSXDsC&amp;pg=PA151 |year=1990 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=978-81-7099-214-1 |page=151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orchha State]] was the parent Bundela kingdom. [[Datia State]] (1626 CE) and [[Panna State]] (1657 CE) separated from the Orchha State. After the death of Panna's founder [[Chhatrasal]] in 1731, [[Ajaigarh State]], [[Bijawar State]] and [[Charkhari State]] separated from Panna.{{sfn|Jain|2002|p=3}} The official records of the [[Chhatarpur State]] also mentioned the caste of its rulers as "Panwar Bundela". Its founder was a [[Panwar]], who was in service of the Bundela ruler of Panna State until 1785 CE.{{sfn|Jain|2002|p=3}}

The [[Bundelkhand]] ("Bundela domain") region was named after the Bundelas.{{sfn|Jain|2002|p=1}}

===Gingee fort command===

After the [[Mughal Empire]] defeated the [[Maratha Empire]] at [[Gingee Fort]] in 1698,&lt;ref&gt;http://thirunelveli.org/Where_a_Tamil_Ballad_immortalised_a_Rajput_hero.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in return for military services,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/tale-of-a-forgotten-hero/article2457097.ece&lt;/ref&gt; the Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]], granted the  [[kiladar]]i (Fort Commandership) of Gingee to [[Swarup Singh of Gingee|Swarup Singh]], a Bundela Rajput chieftain in 1700 AD. Raja Swarup Singh died of old age in 1714 AD.  He was briefly succeeded by his son, [[Desingh]] who died gallantly in an attempt to save the fort from the [[Arcot State|Nawab of Arcot]].

==History==

Warren embraced the labor theory of value, which says that the value of a commodity is the amount of labor that goes into producing or acquiring it. From this he concluded that it was therefore unethical to charge more labor for a product than the labor required to produce it. Warren summed up this policy in the phrase "[[Cost the limit of price]]," with "cost" referring the amount of labor one exerted in producing a good. Believing the labor is the foundational cost of things, he held that equal amounts of labor should, naturally, receive equal material compensation. He set out to examine if his theories could be put to practice by establishing his "labor for labor store." If his experiment proved to be successful, his plan was to establish various colonies whose participants all agreed to use "cost the limit of price" in all economic transactions, hoping that all of society would eventually adopt the tenet in all economic affairs..&lt;ref name="Kemple"/&gt;
[[Image:LaborNote.JPG|thumb|left|300px|A 19th-century example of barter: A sample labor for labor note for the Cincinnati Time Store. Scanned from ''Equitable Commerce'' by [[Josiah Warren]] (1846)]]
In the store, customers could purchase goods with "labor notes" which represented an agreement to perform labor.&lt;ref name=low47/&gt; The items in the store were initially marked up 7% to account for the labor required to bring them to market with the price increasing the longer the time that a customer spent with the shopkeeper, as measured by a timer dial; later this markup was reduced to 4%. Corn was used as a standard, with 12 pounds of corn being exchangeable with one hour of labor. The result of the system was that no one was able to profit from the labor of another — every individual ostensibly received the "full produce" of his labor. Adjustments were made for the difficulty and disagreeableness of the work performed, so that time was not the only factor taken into consideration. Warren also set up boards on the wall where individuals could post what kind of services they were seeking or had to sell so that others could respond, and trade among each other using labor notes.&lt;ref name="Kemple"/&gt;

After a rough initial period, the store proved to be very successful. Warren's goods were much cheaper than competitors', though he maintained that he was not trying to put other stores out of business. Another store in the neighborhood converted to Warren's methods. The fact that prices for goods rose the more time a customer spent with Warren resulted in very efficient transactions. Warren said that he was doing more business in one hour than normal businesses do in one day, leading him to close shop part of the day to rest. Though the store was successful, the problem of equal labor times for different difficulties of work was a concern for Warren. He was never able to reconcile the objectivity of his "labor for labor" prescription {{mdash}} treating all labor as essentially [[fungible goods]] {{mdash}}  with the subjectivity employed in determining how much time used for one type labor entailed the same amount of work exerted during a different amount of time performing another type of labor. He settled to simply credit it with being a matter of individual judgment. Warren closed the store in May 1830 in order to depart to set up colonies based upon the labor-cost principle (the most successful of these being "[[Utopia (anarchist community)|Utopia]]"), convinced that the store was a successful experiment in "Cost the limit of price."&lt;ref name="Kemple"/&gt;

In fact, the store became Cincinnati's most popular at the time.  As Cincinnati librarian Steve Kemple noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the advantages of the store became known and its method understood, it was the most popular mercantile institution in the city. The people called it the “Time Store,” not because it gave credit or sold goods on installments, but on account of the peculiar and original method adopted to fix and regulate the amount of the merchant’s compensation.  This was determined on the principle of the equal exchange of labor, measured by the time occupied, and exchanged hour for hour with other kinds of labor.&lt;ref name="Kemple"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Josiah Warren credited [[Robert Owen]] with the creation of the idea for the [[Labor notes (currency)|labor-for-labor note]].  It was Warren, however, that actually put it into practice at the Time Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FV7QLVAny4C&amp;pg=PA47 |title=Low Living and High Thinking at Modern Times, New York |first1=Roger |last1=Wunderlich |publisher=[[Paul Avrich]] Collection, [[Library of Congress]] |isbn=9780815625544 |pages=47-48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Owen thereafter opened the [[National Equitable Labour Exchange#19th century|National Equitable Labour Exchange]], which embodied the same concept and practice.&lt;ref name="Shiller1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/cryptocurrencies-and-the-old-allure-of-new-money-20180530 |title=Cryptocurrencies and the old allure of new money |quote=Cryptocurrencies create an aura of exclusivity that fills devotees with revolutionary zeal, but we have seen such experiements [sic] fail before |work=[[Financial News]] |first1=Robert J. |last1=Shiller |date=May 30, 2018 |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cincinnati Tire Store experiment in use of labor as a medium of exchange antedated similar European efforts by two decades.&lt;ref name="Fishbein"/&gt;

==Reception==
Betty Joy Nash noted that, to varying degrees, the time store "communities strived to eliminate discrimination by class, sex, and race, and fostered education and scientific inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Utopia, USA |journal=Region Focus |last1=Nash |first1=Betty Joy |date=July 1, 2010 |volume=14 |number=3 |page=32 |issn=1093-1767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary film ''Anarchism in America'' (1981), by [[Pacific Street Films]] and funded by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], argued that Anarchism had its roots in 19th America with people like Josia Warren and the Time Store.&lt;ref name="Fishbein"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Anarchism as Ideology and Impulse: Anarchism in America   |journal=[[Film &amp; History]] |last1=Fishbein |first1=Leslie |origyear=1981 |date=1983 |volume=13 |number=1 |pages=17-22 |issn=0360-3695 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/400648/summary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it goes back to 1827 though 1830, Josiah Warner's "Cincinnati Time Store", which sold merchandise in units of hours of work called "labour notes" which resembled paper money, this was "[p]erhaps ... the anticipator of all future" [[Local exchange trading system]]s, and was even a precursor to modern [[cryptocurrency]].&lt;ref name="Khaleej"&gt;{{cite news |title=Why It's Difficult to Crack Cryptocurrency Mysteries |work=[[Khaleej Times]] |location=Dubai, United Arab Emirates |date=May 22, 2018 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-539822138.html |via=HighBeam Research}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-156553329.html |title=Editor's Introduction |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |work=[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]] |date=November 1, 2006 |quote=Referencing Moss [1977]2005: 125-128}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Robert J.

Intended as an open-sourced event, the day is celebrated by individuals, organizations, and establishment concerned on the Coral Triangle. The Coral Triangle day was observed the first time on June 9, 2012, in conjunction with the [[World Oceans Day]] on June 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coraltriangleinitiative.org/question/what-coral-triangle-day-and-why-are-we-celebrating-it-june-9|title=What is the Coral Triangle Day and why are we celebrating it on June 9? {{!}} CTI-CFF|website=www.coraltriangleinitiative.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Coral Triangle is a geographical term that refers to a vast ocean expense located along the equator and the confluence of the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans. The region covers the [[exclusive economic zone]]s of six countries: [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]], and Timor-Leste (the "CT6" countries). It is even considered as one of the 3 mega ecological complexes on [[Earth]], together with [[Congo Basin]] and the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is a broad scientific consensus that the region represents the global the global epicenter of marine life abundance and diversity—with 76% of all known coral species, 37% of all known [[coral reef fish]] species, 53% of the world’s [[coral reef]]s, the greatest extent of [[Mangrove|mangrove forests]] in the world, and spawning and juvenile growth areas for the world’s largest tuna fishery. Moreover, the biogeographical conditions within the CT may also enable the region to maintain its exceptional productivity in the face of future impacts of climate change, making it potentially the world’s most important “refuge” for marine life. These unparalleled marine and coastal living resources provide profound benefits to the 363 million people who reside within the six countries that compose the Coral Triangle, along with benefits to many millions more outside the region.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coraltriangleinitiative.org/library/cti-regional-plan-action|title=CTI Regional Plan of Action {{!}} CTI-CFF|website=www.coraltriangleinitiative.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the coastal and marine ecosystems in the Coral Triangle are under significant and increasing threat by the warming, acidifying and rising seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://awsassets.wwf.org.au/downloads/mo017_the_coral_triangle_and_climate_change_1may09.pdf|title=The Coral Triangle and Climate Change: Ecosystems, People, and Societies at Risk|last=Hoegh-Guldberg|first=O|publisher=WWF Australia|year=2009|isbn=978-1-921031-35-9|location=Sydney|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coral reefs have experienced mass [[Coral bleaching|bleaching]], which threaten to degrade the important ecosystems. Over half the coral reefs are at high risk primarily from coastal development, [[overfishing]], and unsustainable fishing practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the marine resources are a principal source of income for the population, the downstream effects of losing these critical coastal ecosystems are enormous.

== History ==
[[File:Coral-triangle-day-2013-poster.png|thumb|Coral Triangle Day 2013 Poster|294x294px]]
The Coral Triangle Day was first held on June 10, 2012, as a regional interpretation of World Oceans Day. During the 8th [[Coral triangle initiative|Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security]] (a multilateral partnership to safeguard the Coral Triangle's marine and coastal biological resources) Senior Official Meeting, member countries declared to designate the Coral Triangle Day to be held annually. It is, ever since, simultaneously celebrated by all Coral Triangle countries every year. It is celebrated through numerous activities including but not limited to beach clean-ups; sustainable seafood dinners and exhibitions; bazaars; and beach parties, among others. The intention is to carry the message of ocean conservation under the overall banner of the Coral Triangle Day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/coraltriangle/events/coraltriangleday/|title={{!}} WWF|website=wwf.panda.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the demographic features of the population of [[Kuwait]].

Expatriates account for around 70% of Kuwait's total population, with Kuwaitis constituting 28%–32% of the total population. The government and Kuwaiti citizens consider the proportion of expatriates (which has been relatively stable since the mid-1970s) to be a problem, and in 2016 the number of [[deportations]] increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/kuwait-steps-up-deportations-of-expat-workers|title=Kuwait steps up deportations of expat workers|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwait consists of six governorates: [[Hawalli Governorate|Hawalli]], [[Al Asimah Governorate (Kuwait)|Asimah]] (Capital), [[Al Farwaniyah Governorate|Farwaniyah]], [[Al Jahra Governorate|Jahra]], [[Al Ahmadi Governorate|Ahmadi]] and [[Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate|Mubarak Al-Kabeer]]. Some Kuwaiti people are foreigners that have were given Kuwaiti citizenship. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/thousands-born-in-kuwait-are-stuck-in-limbo-1.524427|title=Thousands born in Kuwait are stuck in limbo|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest population difficulty in Kuwait involves the [[Bedoon (ethnicity)|Bedoon]], a stateless people numbering just over 100,000 who are classed as illegal residents and who are trying to claim Kuwaiti citizenship.&lt;ref name=bbcnat&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21857431 |title=Kuwait MPs pass law to naturalise 4,000 stateless Bidun |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that these people are Arabs who migrated from [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]; a large part of the problem the Bedoon face is that these other states do not consider them as their nationals either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/stateless-kuwait-who-are-bidoon |title=Stateless in Kuwait: Who Are the Bidoon? |work=[[Open Society Foundations]] |date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, a law was passed to grant citizenship to 4,000 of these people as part of an attempt to resolve the problem.

The '''Dyula''' ('''Dioula''' or '''Juula''') are a [[Mande people|Mande]] [[ethnic group]] inhabiting several [[West African]] countries, including the [[Mali]], [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[Ghana]],and [[Burkina Faso]].

Characterized as a highly successful merchant [[caste]], ''Dyula'' migrants began establishing trading communities across the region in the fourteenth century. Since business was often conducted under non-Muslim rulers, the ''Dyula'' developed a set of theological principles for [[Muslim]] minorities in non-Muslim societies. Their unique contribution of long-distance commerce, Islamic scholarship and religious tolerance were significant factors to the peaceful expansion of Islam in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=104323&amp;rog3=IV|title=Jula, Dyula in Cote d'Ivoire|author=Joshua Project|work=joshuaproject.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
[[File:Dioula-Niger-1900.jpg|thumb|left|A Dyula man, 1900]]

The Mandé embraced Islam during the thirteenth century following introduction to the faith through contact with the [[Soninke people|Soninké]] people and [[North African]] traders. By the 14th century the [[Mali Empire|Malian empire]] (c.1230-1600) had reached its apogee, acquiring a considerable reputation for the Islamic rulings of its court and the pilgrimages of several emperors who followed the tradition of [[Lahilatul Kalabi]], the first black prince to make ''[[hajj]]'' to [[Mecca]]. It was at this time that Mali began encouraging some of its local merchants to establish colonies close to the gold fields of West Africa. This migrant trading class were known as ''Dyula'', the [[Mandinka language|Mandingo]] word for “merchant”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kevin |last=Shullington|title=Encyclopedia of African History|publisher= Routledge |edition=1 |date=18 November 2004|ISBN= 978-1-57958-245-6 |page=724|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ftz_gtO-pngC&amp;pg=PA724&amp;dq=dyula,+merchant+mandingo&amp;ei=2m6JS5arA4a-zASo1qmbDg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=dyula%2C%20merchant%20mandingo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dyula'' spread throughout the former area of Mandé culture from the Atlantic coast of [[Senegambia]] to the [[Niger]] and from the southern edge of the [[Sahara]] to forest zones further south. They established decentralized townships in non-Muslim colonies that were linked to an extensive commercial network, in what was described by professor [[Philip D. Curtin]] as a “trading diaspora.” Motivated by business imperatives, they expanded into new markets, founding settlements under the auspices of various local rulers who often permitted them self-governance and autonomy. Organization of ''dyula'' trading companies was based a clan-family structure known as the ''lu'' - a working unit consisting of a father and his sons and other attached males. Members of a given ''lu'' dispersed from the [[savanna]] to the forest, managed circulation of goods and information, placed orders, and effectively controlled the economic mechanisms of [[supply and demand]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shullington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'' Routledge; 1 edition (18 Nov 2004) {{ISBN|978-1-57958-245-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suwarian Tradition===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van een Dyula boerin met een hoofddoek van Dutch Wax TMnr 20013506.jpg|thumb|Photo of a Dyula farmer wearing a [[Dutch wax]] [[headscarf]], 1966.]]
Over time ''dyula'' colonies developed a [[theological]] rationale for their relations with non-Muslim ruling classes and subjects in what author Nehemia Levtzion dubbed “accommodationist Islam”.&lt;ref&gt;N. Levtzion and J.O. Voll (eds.), ''Eighteenth Century Renewal &amp; Reform in Islam'', Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1987, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The man credited with formulating this rationale is Sheikh [[Al-Hajj Salim Suwari]], a [[Soninke people|Soninke]] cleric from the core Mali area who lived around 1500. He made ''hajj'' to [[Mecca]] several times and devoted his intellectual career to developing an understanding of the faith that would assist Muslim minorities in “[[pagan]]” lands. He drew on North African and Middle Eastern jurists and [[theologians]] who had reflected on the problem of Muslims living among non-Muslim majorities, situations that were frequent in the centuries of Islamic expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001144/114426Eo.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Routes of Al-Andalus: Spiritual Convergence and Intercultural Dialogue|work= [[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Suwari formulated the obligations of Muslim minorities in West Africa into something known as the ''Suwarian tradition''. It stressed the need for Muslims to coexist peaceably with unbelievers and so justified a separation of religion and politics. In this understanding, Muslims must nurture their own learning and piety and thereby furnish good examples to the non-Muslims around them. They could accept jurisdiction of non-Muslim authorities as long as they had the necessary protection and conditions to practice the faith. In this teaching, Suwari followed a strong predilection in Islamic thought for any government even if non-Muslim or tyrannical as opposed to none. The military ''[[jihad]]'' was a resort only if the faithful were threatened. Suwari discouraged ''[[dawah]]'' (missionary activity), instead contending that [[Allah]] would bring non-Muslims to Islam in His own way; it was not a Muslim's responsibility to decide when ignorance should give way to belief. Since their Islamic practice was capable of accommodating traditional cults, ''dyula'' often served as priests, [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]]s, and counselors at the courts of [[animist]] rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Launay, R., ''Beyond the Stream: Islam &amp; Society in a West African Town''. Berkeley, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial and Political Expansion==
As fellow Muslims, ''dyula'' merchants were also able to assess the valuable [[trans-Saharan trade]] network conducted by North African Arabs and [[Berber people|Berbers]] whom they met at commercial centers across the [[Sahel]]. Some important trade goods included gold, [[millet]], slaves, and kola nuts from the south and slave beads and [[cowrie shells]] from the north (for use as [[currency]]). It was under Mali that the great cities of the Niger bend including [[Gao]] and [[Djenné]] prospered, with Timbuktu in particular becoming known across Europe for its great wealth. Important trading centers in Southern West Africa developed at the transitional zone between the forest and the savanna; examples include [[Begho]] and [[Bono Manso]] (in present-day Ghana) and [[Bondoukou]] (in present-day Côte d'Ivoire). Western trade routes continued to be important, with [[Ouadane]], [[Oualata]] and [[Chinguetti]] being the major trade centres in what is now [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Ade Ajayi.

===Penetration into Southern Forest Regions===
The development of ''Dyula'' trade in Ghana and the adjacent Ivory Coast had important political consequences and sometimes military implications as well. The ''dyula'' spearheaded Mande penetration of the forested zones in the south by establishing caravan routes and trading posts at strategic locations throughout the region en route to cola-producing areas. By the start of the sixteenth century, ''dyula'' merchants were trading as far south as the coast of modern Ghana.

On the forest's northern fringes, new states emerged, such as [[Bono Kingdom|Bono]] and Banda. As the economic value of gold and kola became appreciated, forests south of these states which had hitherto been little inhabited because of limited agricultural potential became more thickly populated, and the same principles of political and military mobilization began being applied there. Village communities became tributaries of ruling groups, with some members becoming the clients and slaves needed to support royal households, armies, and trading enterprises. Sometimes these political changes were not to the advantage of the ''Dyula'', who employed Mande warriors to guard their caravans and if necessary could call in larger contingents from the Sudanic kingdoms. In the seventeenth century, tensions between the Muslims and the local pagans in Begho erupted into a destructive war which eventually led to the total abandonment of the Banda capital. The local people eventually settled in a number of towns further east, while the dyula withdrew to the west to the further side of the Banda hills where they established the new trading center of [[Bonduku]].&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Fage, William Tordoff, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KR0oRd5GMGkC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=dyula+gonja&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vs8oypyXoo&amp;sig=l46TCjL1xBvnXmfZWWHV1mAVFrI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v8AtSpHiCoTUswOUusS3CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPA96,M1 ''A History of Africa''] 4th Edition, Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc., December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gonja State===
The ''dyula'' presence and changes in the balance of power occasioned political upheavals in other places. Among the paramount Mande political initiatives along trade routes south of [[Djenné|Jenne]] was creation of the ''dyula'' state of [[Gonja people|Gonja]] by Naba'a in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Bakewell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilks,Ivor. Wangara, Akan, and Portuguese in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|editor1-last=Bakewell|editor1-first=Peter|title=Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas|date=1997|publisher=Variorum, Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot|pages=29-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was  motivated by a general worsening of the competitive position of dyula traders and was occasioned by three factors: (1) a near-monopoly control in exporting forest produce achieved by the Akan kingdom of Bono; (2) the rise to power further north of the [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] Kingdom which controlled local salt pans; and (3) increased competition following the arrival in the region of rival long-distance traders from [[Hausaland]].

The reaction of the Dyula in the Bono-Banda-Gonja region to these developments was to erect a kingdom of their own in Gonja - the territory northern traders had to cross to reach Akan forestlands, situated in what is now modern [[Ghana]]. By 1675, Gonja had established a [[paramount chief]] called [[Yagbongwura]] to control the kingdom. But Gonja was not a fruitful land in which to try to maintain a centralized government. This is because the Dagomba power to the north and Akan power to the south were too powerful, thus the new kingdom rapidly declined in strength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/640523/history-of-western-Africa/54841/The-wider-influence-of-the-Sudanic-kingdoms ''The Wider Influence of the Sudanic Kingdoms''], britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Wilks|Wilks, Ivor]]. "''Wangara, Akan and Portuguese in the Fifteenth &amp; Sixteenth Centuries II: The Struggle for Trade''." ''Journal of African History'' 23:4 (1982): 463-472&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kong Empire===
Many of the trading posts established by the ''Dyula'' eventually became market villages or cities, such as [[Kong, Côte d'Ivoire|Kong]] in today's Northeastern Côte d'Ivoire. It emerged as a commercial center when Malian merchants began trading in the territory which was inhabited by pagan Senufo and other Voltaic groups. The sous-préfecture of Kong, in the area of Kong to [[Dabakala]], is said to be the “origin” area, where ''dyula'' traders first settled in the twelfth century. ''Dyula'' presence in the Kong area grew rapidly in the seventeenth century as a result of the developing trade between the commercial centers along the Niger banks and the forest region to the south which was controlled by the Baule chiefdoms and the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]]. The ''dyula'' brought their trading skills and connections and transformed Kong into an international market for the exchange of northern desert goods such as salt and cloth and southern forest exports such as cola nuts, gold, and slaves. The city was also a religious center that housed a substantial academic community of Muslim scholars, with palaces and mosques built in the traditional [[Sudan|Sudanese]] style. As Kong grew prosperous, its early rulers from the Taraweré clan, combined ''dyula'' and Senufo traditions and extended their authority over the surrounding region.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Person, ''Samori, Une Revolution Dyula''. [[Dakar]]: IFAN, 1970. Volume 1, Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By the eighteenth century the ''dyula'' had become quite powerful in the area and wished to rid themselves of subordination to Senufo chiefs. This was achieved in an uprising led by Seku Wattara (Ouattara), a ''dyula'' warrior who claimed descent from the Malinke Keita lineage and who had studied the Quran and engaged in commerce before becoming a warrior. By rallying around himself all ''dyula'' in the area, Seku Wattara easily defeated local chiefdoms and set up an independent ''Dyula'' state in 1710, the first of its kind in West Africa. He established himself as ruler and under his authority, the city rose from a small city-state to the capital of the great [[Kong Empire]], holding sway over much of the region. The ''dyula'' of Kong also maintained commercial links with European traders on the Atlantic coast around the [[Gulf of Guinea]], from whom they easily obtained prized European goods, most notably rifles, gunpowder, and textiles. The acquisition of weapons allowed for the creation of an armed militia force that protected trade routes passing through the territories of various minor rulers. In the course of developing his state, Seku Wattara built a strong army composed mostly of defeated pagan groups. The leadership of the army eventually developed into a new warrior class, called ''sonangi'', which was gradually separated from the overall ''dyula'' merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Eisenstadt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ4VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=dyula+islam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nsUV5SLYQm&amp;sig=yWspXh0lsahf1sjBJj0OUE_QvhM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t34tStmnMaOUtgOsy8irCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPA119,M1 ''The Early State in African Perspective''], Universitah ha-‘Ivrit bi-Yerushalayim. [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]], 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kong Empire started to decline after the death of Seku Wattara. Succession struggles divided the kingdom into two parts, with the northern area being controlled by Seku’s brother Famagan who refused to recognize the rule of Seku’s oldest son in the south. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, many of Kong’s provinces had formed independent chiefdoms. The city of Kong retained the prestige of an Islamic commercial center, but it was no longer the seat of an important political power. It eventually came under French colonial control in 1898. Despite the fall from glory, the seventeenth century Kong Friday Mosque survived, and the city was largely rebuilt in a traditional [[Sudano-Sahelian|Sudano-Sahelian architectural]] style and features a Qur'anic school.

===Kingdom of Wasulu===
[[Image:Wassoulou map.png|thumb|200px|The [[Wassoulou]] Region of West Africa.]]
The Mande conquerors of the nineteenth century frequently utilized trade routes established by the ''Dyula''. Indeed, it was his exploitation of their commercial network that allowed military leader [[Samory Touré]] (1830–1900) to rise to a dominant position in the [[Upper Niger]] region. A member of a ''dyula'' family from Sanankoro in [[Guinea]], Samori conquered and united ''Dyula'' states during the 1860s. He gained control over the Milo River Valley in 1871, seized the village of [[Kankan]] in 1881, and became the principal power holder on the Upper Niger. By 1883, Samori had successfully brought the local chieftains under his control and officially founded the kingdom of [[Wasulu]].

Having established an empire, he adopted the religious title of ''[[Almami]]'' in 1884 and recreated the Malian realm. This new state was governed by Samori and a council of kinsmen and clients who took on the management of the chancery and the [[treasury]], and administered justice, religious affairs, and [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]]. Unlike some of his contemporary state-builders, Samori was not a religious preacher, and Wasulu was not a reformist state as such. Nevertheless, he used Islam to unify the nation, promoting Islamic education and basing his rule on ''[[shari’a]]'' (Islamic law). However, Samori’s professional army was the essential institution and the real strength behind his empire. He imported horses and weapons and modernized the army along European lines.&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&amp;pg=PA426&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;dq=dyula+islam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0Vv_X6EkmJ&amp;sig=Gv6oWnJuXKtH6vQchW7XLrPW3XM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WW8tSvSiMIP4tQPk6MDrCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 ''A History of Islamic Societies''] (2nd Edition), [[University of California, Berkeley]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dyula'' traders had never enjoyed as much prosperity as they did under the ''almamy''. Even though they did not play a central part in the creation of the state, the ''dyula'' supported Samori because he actively encouraged commerce and protected trade routes, thus promoting a free circulation of people and goods. Samori put up the strongest resistance to European colonial penetration in West Africa, fighting both the French and British for seventeen years. Samori’s would-be Muslim empire was undone by the French, who took [[Sikasso]] in 1898, and sent Samori into exile, where he died in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encarta Encyclopedia - Africa |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572628_30/africa.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbSM3PY?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572628_30/africa.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyula Culture and Society==
[[File:Papa1999.b.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] [[Griot]] Al-Haji [[Papa Susso]] performing songs from the oral tradition of the [[Gambia]] on the [[Kora (instrument)|kora]]]]

''Dyula'' society is hierarchical or [[caste]]-based, with [[nobility]] and vassals. Like numerous other African peoples, they previously held slaves (''jonw''), who were often [[prisoner of war|war prisoners]] from lands surrounding their territory. Descendants of former kings and generals had a higher status than their [[nomadic]] and more settled compatriots. With time, that difference has eroded, corresponding to the economic fortunes of the groups.

The traditional ''dyula'' social structure is further organized into various familial [[clan]] groups, and clan affiliation continues to be a dominant aspect of both collective and individual identity. People are fiercely loyal to their clan lineage, often expressing their cultural history and devotion through the oral traditions of dance and storytelling. The ''dyula'' are [[patrilineal]] and [[patriarchal]], with older males possessing the most power and influence. Men and women commonly reside in separate houses made of mud or cement - men occupying roundhouses and women in rectangular ones. The father heads the family, and inheritances are passed down from fathers to their sons. Despite being illegal, the ''dyula'' still practice [[polygamy]], and young people are often encouraged to marry within their own clan.

Another hereditary class that was afforded a particularly important status by the ''dyula'' social hierarchy was occupied by the ''tuntigi'' or warrior class. The ''dyula'' had long been accustomed to surrounding their cities with fortifications and taking up arms when it was deemed necessary in order to defend themselves and maintain the smooth flow of trade caravans. As a result, they became closely associated with the ''tuntigi'' warriors.

==Islamic Tradition==
[[Image:Ghana mosque.jpg|thumb|Mosque in [[Ghana]]]]

The ''dyula'' have been predominantly Muslim since the 13th century. Many in rural areas combine Islamic beliefs with certain pre-Islamic animistic traditions such as the presence of spirits and use of [[amulets]]. ''Dyula'' communities have a reputation for historically maintaining a high standard of Muslim education. The ''dyula'' family enterprise based on the ''lu'' could afford to provide some of its younger men an Islamic education. Thus, an ''[[ulema]]'' (clerical) class known as [[karamogo]] emerged, who were educated in the Quran and commentary (''[[tafsir]]''), ''[[hadith]]'' (prophetic narrations), and the life of [[Muhammad]]. According to the ''dyula'' clerical tradition, a student received instruction under a single ''[[sheikh]]'' for a duration varying from five to thirty years, and earned his living as a part-time farmer working his teacher's lands. After completed his studies, a ''karamogo'' obtained a turban and an ''[[isnad]]'' (teaching license), and either sought further instruction or to start his own school in a remote village. A highly educated ''karamogo'' could become a professional ''[[imam]]'' or ''[[qadi]]'' (judge).

Certain families gained a reputation for providing multiple generations of scholars. For example, the Saghanughu clan was a ''dyula'' lineage living in  Northern and Western Ivory Coast and parts of the [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]]. This lineage may be traced to Timbuktu, but its principal figure was Sheikh Muhammad al-Mustafa Saghanughu (d. 1776), the ''imam'' of Bobo-Dyulasso. He produced an educational system based on three canonical texts of Quranic commentary (''[[tafsir]]'') and ''hadith''. His sons continued spreading their father’s teachings and expanded through towns in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, founding Islamic schools, or [[madrassah|madaris]], and acting as ''imams'' and ''qadis''.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Marvin Lapidus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413&amp;dq=dyula+people&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0Vv_W3ChqR&amp;sig=ysYKBPttrzWL-b9QKbBgxMaaE2M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RWIrSrn5H5uctgPwlIzqCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#PPA414,M1 ''A History of Islamic Societies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''madaris'' were probably a positive byproduct of the long history of Muslims’ interest in literary work. In "''The Islamic Literary Tradition in Ghana''", author [[Thomas Lionel Hodgkin|Thomas Hodgkin]] enumerates the large literary contribution that was made by Dyula-[[Wangara, Burkina Faso|Wangara]] Muslims to the history of not only the regions they found themselves in but also of West Africa as a whole. He cites al-Hajj Osmanu Eshaka Boyo of [[Kintampo District|Kintampo]] as an “''[['alim|alim]]'' with a wide range of Muslim connexions and an excellent grasp of local Islamic history” whose efforts brought together a great many Arabic manuscripts from around Ghana. These manuscripts, the ''Isnad al-shuyukh wa’l-ulama'', or ''Kitab Ghunja'', compiled by al-Hajj ‘Umar ibn Abi Bakr ibn ‘Uthman al-Kabbawi al-Kanawi al-Salaghawi of Kete-Krachi who Hodgkin describes as “the most interesting, and historically significant of the poets,” may now be found in the library of the [[Institute of African Studies]] of the [[University of Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hodgkin, ''The Islamic Literary Tradition in Ghana'', in I. Lewis (ed.), ''Islam in Tropical Africa''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dioula language==
The ''dyula'' speak the [[Dioula language|Dioula language or ''Julakan'']], which is included in the group of closely interrelated [[Manding languages]] that are spoken by various ethnic groups spread across Western Africa. Dioula is most closely related to the [[Bambara language]] (the most widely spoken language in Mali), in a manner similar to the relation between American English and British English. It is probably the most used language for trade in West Africa.

The Dioula language and people are distinct from the [[Diola]] (Jola) people of [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Casamance]].

The '''ecological model of competition''' is a reassessment of the nature of [[competition]] in the [[Economics|economy]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;. Traditional [[economics]] models the economy on the principles of [[physics]] (force, equilibrium, inertia, momentum, and linear relationships). This can be seen in the economics lexicon: terms like [[labour force]], [[market equilibrium]], [[capital flows]], and  [[price elasticity]]. This is probably due to historical coincidence. Classical [[Newtonian physics]] was the state of the art in science when [[Adam Smith]] was formulating the first principles of economics in the 18th century.

According to the ecological model, it is more appropriate to model the economy on [[biology]] (growth, change, death, evolution, [[survival of the fittest]], complex inter-relationships, non-linear relationships)&lt;ref&gt;Gowdy, J.M., 1992.

Companies that are able to develop a successful [[business model]] and turn a [[core competency]] into a [[sustainable competitive advantage]] will thrive and grow. Very successful firms may come to dominate their industry (referred to as ''category killers'').

In [[military science]], '''Force multiplication''' or a '''force multiplier''' refers to a factor or a combination of factors that dramatically increases (hence "multiplies") the effectiveness of an item or group, giving a given number of [[troop]]s (or other personnel) or [[weapons]] (or other hardware) the ability to accomplish greater things than without it.  The expected size increase required to have the same effectiveness without that advantage is the ''multiplication factor''.  For example, if a certain technology like [[GPS]] enables a force to accomplish the same results of a force five times as large but without GPS, then the multiplier is five. Such estimates are used to justify an investment cost for force multipliers.

Before the era of modern electronic communications, the Mongols used [[Swarming (military)|swarming tactics]] coordinated by effective [[military communications]] using flags, horns, and couriers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} In the Middle Ages, [[archer's stake]]s were driven into the ground for protection from mounted men-at-arms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  This is an example of "[[combined arms]]", another ancient method of force multiplication.

==Types==
Some common force multipliers are:
:* [[Morale]]
:* [[Mobility_(military)|Mobility]]
:* Fearsome [[reputation]]
:* [[Military technology|Technology]]
:* [[Advantage of terrain|Geographical features]]
:* [[Kamikaze (typhoon)|Weather]]
:* [[Military recruitment|Recruitment]] through [[diplomacy]]
:* [[Military education and training|Training]] and [[experience]]
:* [[Military strategy]], such as the [[Fabian strategy]]
:* [[Military tactics]], such as [[force concentration]]
:* [[Intelligence (military)|Intelligence]]
:* [[Military deception|Deception]]

Some factors may influence one another, e.g. enhanced technology improving morale or geographical features allowing deception.

==Doctrinal changes==

In the First World War, the Germans experimented with what were called "storm tactics", where a small group of highly trained soldiers ([[stormtrooper]]s) would open a salient through which much larger forces could penetrate. This met with only limited success, breaking through the first lines of defence but lacking the staying power to break the opposing forces entirely while the 1939 [[Blitzkrieg]], which broke through with coordinated mechanized ground forces with aircraft in close support, was vastly more effective.

Towards the end of World War II, the German army introduced [[kampfgruppe]] combat formations that were composed of whatever units happened to be available. Though poor quality ones generally constituted the major part of them, they often performed successfully because of their high degree of flexibility and adaptability. [[Mission-type tactics]], as opposed to extremely specific directives that give no discretion to the junior commander, are widely used by modern militaries now due to their force multiplication. Originating from German  concepts of ''Auftragstaktik'', these tactics may be developing even more rapidly in the concept of [[network-centric warfare]] (NCW) where subordinate commanders receive information not only from their own commanders, but from adjacent units.

A different paradigm was one of the results of the theories of [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]], the "high-low mix" in which a large number of less expensive aircraft, coupled with a small number of extremely capable "silver bullet" aircraft, had the effect of a much larger force. Boyd's concept of quick action is based on the repeated application of the "Boyd loop", consisting of the steps
:*'''Observe''': make use of the best sensors and other intelligence available
:*'''Orient''': put the new observations into a context with the old
:*'''Decide''': select the next action based on the combined observation and local knowledge
:*'''Act''': carry out the selected action, ideally while the opponent is still observing your last action.
Boyd's concept is also known as the [[OODA Loop]], and is a description of the decision-making process that Boyd contended applies to business, sports, law enforcement and military operations. Boyd's doctrine is widely taught in the American military, and one of the aims of network centric warfare is to "get inside his OODA loop"—that is, to go from observation to action before the enemy can get past orientation, preventing him from ever being able to make an effective decision or put it into action. Small unit leadership is critical to this, and NCW's ability to disseminate information to small unit leaders enables such tactics.

[[Network-centric warfare]] can provide additional information and can help prevent [[friendly fire]], but also allows "swarm tactics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and the seizing of opportunities by subordinate forces. These are a realization of Boyd's theories. {{Harv | Rand-Edwards-2000 | pg. 2}} defines " "a swarming case is any historical example in which the scheme of maneuver involves the convergent attack of five (or more) semiautonomous (or autonomous) units on a targeted force in some particular place. "Convergent" implies an attack from most of the points on the compass."

Another version of "swarming" is evident in air-to-ground attack formations in which the attack aircraft do not approach from one direction, at one time, or at the same altitude, but schedule the attacks so each one requires a Boyd-style OODA iteration to deal with a new threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}} Replacement training units (RTU) were "finishing schools" for pilots that needed to know not just the school solution, but the actual tactics being used in Vietnam. Referring to close air support, "In the RTU, new pilots learned the rules of the road for working with a [[Forward air control]]ler (FAC). The hardest part was finding the small aircraft as it circled over the target area. The fast-moving fighters used directional finding/steering equipment to get close enough to the slow, low FAC until someone in the flight could get an eyeball on him—a tally-ho. Once the FAC was in sight, he would give the fighters a target briefing—type of target, elevation, attack heading, location of friendlies, enemy defensive fire, best egress heading if hit by enemy fire, and other pertinent data. Usually the fighters would set up a circle, called a wheel or "wagon wheel", over the FAC, and wait for him to mark the target. Once the
target was marked, the flight leader would attack first.

==Psychology==
[[Napoleon]] is well known for his comment "The moral is to the physical as three to one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Maxims of Napoleon

 | title = The Candidate of Dreams
| date=1995-03-13
| accessdate=2010-05-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Morale]], training, and ethos have long been known to result in disproportionate effects on the battlefield.

[[Psychological warfare]] can target the morale, politics, and values of enemy soldiers and their supporters to effectively neutralize them in a conflict.

==Technology==
[[Ranged weapon]]s that hit their target can be far more effective than those that miss. That is why [[rifled musket]]s for infantry and [[rangefinder]]s for artillery became commonplace in the 19th century. 

Two new [[weapons of World War I]], [[barbed wire]] and the [[machine gun]], multiplied defensive forces, leading to the stalemate of [[trench warfare]]. 

===Tankers===

Airborne tanker aircraft, such as the [[Boeing]] [[KC-135]] are a very significant force multiplier.  They can carry fuel so bomber and fighter aircraft can take off loaded with extra weapons instead of full fuel tanks.  The tankers also increase the range and time loitering within or near the target areas by off-loading fuel when it is needed.  Tankers can also be used to rapidly deploy fighters, bombers, SIGNET, Airborne Command Post, and cargo aircraft from the [[United States]] to the areas where they are needed.  The force multiplier of a [[KC-135R]] can be anywhere from 1.5 to as much as 6 when used near the target area.

===Bombers===

At one extreme, a [[stealth aircraft]] like the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]] [[strategic bomber]] can attack a target without needing the large numbers of escort [[fighter aircraft]], [[electronic-warfare aircraft]], [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]], and other supporting aircraft that would be needed were conventional bombers used against the same target.

[[Precision-guided munition]]s (PGM) give an immense multiplication. The [[Thanh Hoa Bridge]] in [[North Vietnam]] had been only mildly damaged by approximately 800 sorties by aircraft armed with conventional [[Unguided bomb]]s, but had one of its spans destroyed by a 12-plane mission, of which 8 carried [[laser-guided bomb]]s. Two small subsequent missions, again with laser-guided bombs, completed the destruction of this target. Precision guided munitions are one example of what has been called the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]]. In World War II, British night bombers could hit, at best, an area of a city.

Modern PGMs commonly put a bomb within 3–10 meters of its target (see [[Circular error probable]]), and most carry an explosive charge significant enough that this uncertainty is effectively voided. See the [[Special reconnaissance#Ground-aided precision strike: initial experience|use of heavy bombers in direct support of friendly troops]] in Afghanistan, using the technique of Ground-Aided Precision Strike.

===Fighter combat===

[[Fighter aircraft]] coordinated by an [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] control aircraft, so that they can approach targets without being revealed by their own radar, and who are assigned to take specific targets so that duplication is avoided, are far more effective than an equivalent number of fighters dependent on their own resources for target acquisition.

In exercises between the Indian and US air forces, the Indian pilots had an opportunity to operate with AWACS control, and found it extremely effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/nov/17us.htm
 | title = On AWACS, IAF pilots match US counterparts
 | date = 2005-11-17
 | id = AWACS-IAF-2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has ordered AWACS aircraft, using [[EL/W-2090|Israeli Phalcon electronics on a Russian airframe]], and this exercise is part of their preparation. Officer and pilot comments included "definitely was a force multiplier. Giving you an eye deep beyond you"... "We could pick up incoming targets whether aircraft or missiles almost 400 kilometers away. It gives a grand battle coordination in the air".

==Creating local forces==

The use of small numbers of specialists to create larger effective forces is another form of multiplication. The basic A Team of US Army [[Special Forces]] is a 12-man unit that can train and lead a company-sized unit (100-200 men) of local guerrillas.

==Deception==

[[Deception]] can produce the potential effect of a much larger force. The fictitious [[First United States Army Group]] (FUSAG) was portrayed to the World War II Germans as the main force for the invasion of Europe. [[Operation Bodyguard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | title = Bodyguard of Lies: The Extraordinary True Story Behind D-Day

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
successfully gave the impression that FUSAG was to land at the [[Pas de Calais]], convincing the Germans that the real attack at [[Normandy]] was a feint. As a result of the successful deception, the Normandy force penetrated deeply, in part, because the Germans held back strategic reserves that they thought would be needed at the [[Pas de Calais]], against what was a nonexistent force. FUSAG's existence was suggested by the use of decoy vehicles that the Allies allowed to be photographed, fictitious radio traffic generated by a small number of specialists, and the [[Double Cross System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double Cross referred to turning all surviving German spies in the UK into [[Clandestine HUMINT#Double Agent|double agents]], who sent back convincing reports that were consistent with the deception programs being conducted by the [[London Controlling Section]].

Although the [[Constitution of Bolivia]] guarantees [[Women's rights|equal rights]] for women and men, women in [[Bolivia]] face struggles and discrimination in several aspects of their lives. According to the [[Human Development Report]] published by the Office of the [[United Nations Development Programme]], in Bolivia "men receive more and better education than women, receive increased and better health assistance than women, and have the possibility to generate greater income while working less...if we consider that women, as opposed to men, also have...the almost exclusive responsibility for domestic work".&lt;ref name=UNICEF1/&gt; According to a study by the [[Pan American Health Organization]] conducted in twelve Latin American countries, Bolivia has the highest prevalence of [[domestic violence]] against women among these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Violence against women in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comparative analysis of population-based data from 12 countries |publisher=[[Pan American Health Organization]] |url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8175:violence-against-women-latin-america-caribbean-comparative-analysis-population-data-from-12-countries&amp;Itemid=1519&amp;lang=en |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402163658/http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8175%3Aviolence-against-women-latin-america-caribbean-comparative-analysis-population-data-from-12-countries&amp;Itemid=1519&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }} [http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=19825&amp;Itemid=270&amp;lang=en Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivian women are also exposed to excessive [[machismo]], being utilized as promotional tools in popular advertising which solidifies stereotypes and assumptions about women.&lt;ref name="Walter2001H"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Walter|title=Women's rights: a global view|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30890-1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the 19th century, the 1830 [[civil code]] of [[Bolivia]] oversaw women's rights in the country. Under the code, women had to practice [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to their husbands. Women had no rights or legal protection against [[domestic abuse]]. Bolivian law began to change in the early 20th century due to pressure by upper class women. These women found inspiration in the work of [[feminist]] writer [[Adela Zamudio]]. The General Labor Act of 1939 gave women protection regarding labor relations. A [[constitutional amendment]] in 1949 stated that men and women were [[Women's rights|equal]]. Women earned the right to vote in 1952 as part of the Bolivian Social Revolution. The [[Bolivian Constitution of 1967]] declared that women and men were equal in regards to the law. The Civil Code of 1976 gave women some rights in a family code. That code also gave all Bolivians [[personal liberty]].&lt;ref name="Walter2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Walter|title=Women's rights: a global view|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30890-1|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Bolivian government acknowledges that laws protecting women are not enough. Poor publicizing of the laws is credited with this problem, causing lawyers to not use the laws in court. Furthermore, officials, often male, may choose not to enforce laws. Local and regional governments also lack the resources to implement the laws. Illiteracy of Bolivian women is also a possible cause, as women are unable to educate themselves about the laws that protect them.&lt;ref name="Walter2001C"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Walter|title=Women's rights: a global view|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30890-1|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Involvement==

Women's participation in [[politics of Bolivia|Bolivian politics]] has increased by 16 percent as of 1992.&lt;ref name=UNICEF1/&gt; Despite growth, indigenous women continue to lack influence in the political system. While Bolivian president [[Evo Morales]] has supported reforms regarding opportunities for indigenous peoples to hold office, opportunities for women have been lacking due to poor education and leadership for women. There have been successful outcomes regarding women's political involvement. In 2010, a national conference for indigenous women parliamentarians was held with almost 100 participants. During the [[Bolivian general election, 2009|election of 2009]], the number of women elected to parliamentary positions rose from 14 percent to 28 percent.&lt;ref name=MADRE&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Bolivia: Demanding a Political Voice for Women |url=http://www.madre.org/index/meet-madre-1/our-projects-20/bolivia-demanding-a-political-voice-for-women-147.html |work=Madre |accessdate=25 February 2012 |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302210650/http://www.madre.org/index/meet-madre-1/our-projects-20/bolivia-demanding-a-political-voice-for-women-147.html |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, half of Morales' political cabinet consists of women. Morales stated that he had dreamt of the opportunity to have half the cabinet members be women, and called a "homage," to the women in his family. As of 2010, 30 percent of the legislative branch seats were held by women.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|last=Schipani|first=Andres|title=Bolivian women spearhead Morales revolution |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8498081.stm|work=Madre|accessdate=25 February 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Ana Marie Romero became the first woman in Bolivian history to preside over the country's Senate.&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;{{cite web|last=Chávez |first=Franz |title=BOLIVIA: More Women in Parliament, With Their Own Agenda |url=http://ipsnews.zippykid.it/2010/01/bolivia-more-women-in-parliament-with-their-own-agenda/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218164031/http://ipsnews.zippykid.it/2010/01/bolivia-more-women-in-parliament-with-their-own-agenda/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 February 2013 |work=Madre |accessdate=25 February 2012 |date=20 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Romero, [[Lidia Gueiler Tejada]] presided over the lower Bolivian house and from 1978 until 1980 she was the country's interim president.&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt; In 1997, the Reform and Complementary Law to the Electoral Regime was passed, requiring that all political parties have at least 25 percent female candidates for the senate, and a third for other political offices.&lt;ref name="Walter2001B"/&gt;

Since the empowerment of women in government in Bolivia, more than 200 organizations that fall under the umbrella of the Coordinadora de la Mujer have been started. These organizations are involved in policy change and law making. On election ballots, female and male names must be alternated in order. An attempt was made by [[Elizabeth Salguero]], who chaired the Commission on Human Rights, to pass a law protecting women from political violence based on gender, but the law was not passed.&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt;

===Participation in development===

Adela Zamudio(AZ) is known as a group of women that seeks to empower and educate indigenous women about structure in community development work among men and women, and also to let them know how to be involved in that. The purpose of AZ was to have indigenous women to participate more in development work in a political manner. It has small effects to the rural community because of the conception of the women's gender role as a wife to their husbands, how they participate in development work, and they don't take the opportunity to earn income. For them, it would steal the opportunity away from their husbands.&lt;ref name="Hippert, Christine 2011"/&gt;

In 2005, two middle-class women from Bolivia that co-founded AZ they tried to establish an empowerment training class. Empowerment training, is used under the term of [[gender politics]],&lt;ref name="Hippert, Christine 2011" /&gt; which means it is only for women. A project was created for women to have an economic opportunity to help them earn income, and advance in [[economic development]]. They were given the option to create a stone pathway and would be paid for their work. If this project is what the women wanted to do, then the two middle-class women would bring the project proposal to the mayor's office in order to start the project. However, the women did not like this idea, because they thought their opportunity would take away from their husband's opportunity to earn money. Another reason was that there was another responsibility placed on the women besides taking care of their families. The women asked for the proposal to include men because they thought that because as husbands they were companions in development, not contestants. Their identity as a partner and a wife to their husbands is intertwined with progress of economic development. In the end, the women in charge proposed to analyze the differences in power between men and women, among the poor and middle class.

Many Bolivian women have a different perception on the AZ and its purpose when it comes to economic opportunity and community development. The women's perception is to have men get local jobs so there would be no need for them to travel a far distance to their job. This idea was presented by the local government. The project proposal was to help the women improve themselves and their community. The women wanted to give men the opportunity also, instead of creating competition between the two genders.&lt;ref name="Hippert, Christine 2011"/&gt; In another part of Bolivia, there are a group of indigenous women activists that do participate politically and want to decolonize.

An indigenous group, the Aymaras believe in the term Chachawarmi, which&lt;ref name="Burman, Anders 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Burman | first = Anders | title = ''Chachawarmi'': Silence and rival voices on decolonisation and gender politics in Andean Bolivia | journal = [[Journal of Latin American Studies]] | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 65&amp;ndash;91 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S0022216X10001793  | date = February 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022216X10001793 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; means to have men and women be represented equally. It is a traditional concept among majority of the Aymara people who live in the Andes of Bolivia. A study in 2009 focused mostly on Aymara activists living in the outskirts of [[La Paz]] analyzes in how they associate traditional customs, state politics and native activism. They believe that women and men are different, and therefore they have different responsibilities within the Chachawarmi system. They also believe that men and women complement each other with their roles and responsibilities. Within the Aymara community some indigenous women activists believe Chachawarmi should be used to decolonize and some believe it should be used for the community to stay the same. 
 
Aymara people of Bolivia are advocates for their cultural customs and socio-political equality, and also the equality between men and women within their community. However, many middle-class feminists don't agree with the Chachawarmi tradition. The feminists convey the idea that Chachawarmi system undermines the Aymara women's participation because they do not engage much in the discussions or community meetings. It is normal for women not to talk because men perceive them as not educated because they don't speak Spanish, or it could be a result of women trying to resist against men's leadership. It is difficult for them to find solutions to find equality within the Chachawarmi system.&lt;ref name="Burman, Anders 2011"/&gt;

Some of the Aymara community stated they do not want to trade in or be decolonized from their traditional customs if they agree to live in accordance to the political laws and policies. Another reason for not wanting to be decolonized is because the Chachawarmi has been around since their community was established, and their way of living has remained the same.

There is no direct solution to this debate between gender politics and decolonization of the Aymaran people of Bolivia, but the analysis of understanding the different opinions of it is evaluated.&lt;ref name="Burman, Anders 2011"/&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Bolivia la paz literacy LOC.jpg|thumb|200 px|Women attending an adult literacy class in the [[El Alto]] section of [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]]]]
A 2001 report by the [[National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia]] reported that Bolivian women are more [[illiterate]] than men, with rates being 19.35 percent versus 6.94 percent, respectively. Women living in [[rural]] areas have even higher rates of illiteracy, at 37.91 percent versus men at 14.42 percent.&lt;ref name=UNICEF1/&gt; Overall, women in Bolivia have the lowest rates in the continents region and is 20 percent under the Latin American average.&lt;ref name="Walter2001D"/&gt; The Law on Education Reform was passed in 1994 which promoted universal free educational opportunities for citizens regardless of gender. A focus was put on [[bilingual]] education for girls, which is credited with helping to lower the [[Dropping out|dropout]] rate.&lt;ref name="Walter2001B"/&gt; The majority of educational opportunities are performed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], while over 27 percent of Bolivian women don't speak Spanish, making access to education through their native language a barrier.&lt;ref name="Walter2001D"/&gt;

Low government support regarding education in rural areas, poor teaching training, educational programming and conflicts with the agricultural calendar all contribute to the education of girls living in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Walter2001F"/&gt; Bolivian women's school attendance rate is one of the lowest in South America. Less women attend school in rural areas, with only 64.6 percent attending.&lt;ref name="Walter2001F"/&gt; Girls in rural areas generally attend school up until the 3rd grade due to the demand of household work and helping to take care of younger siblings.&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter2001G"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Walter|title=Women's rights: a global view|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30890-1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 61 percent of women in Bolivia attend school as of 1998, a percentage lower than [[Chile]] (71 percent), [[Colombia]] (72 percent), and [[Peru]] (77 percent).&lt;ref name="Walter2001F"/&gt; Girls who are pregnant might be expelled from school.&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt;

==Economic participation==

[[Gender stereotypes]] are still a standard in regards to women's roles and decisions in and outside the home. Women handle [[household chore]]s, and it is estimated that 1 in 5 men make all decisions about purchases made for the household.&lt;ref name=SIG/&gt; The main women's [[trade union]] organization is the [[Bartolina Sisa Confederation]]. The Bolivian National Federation of Self-Employed Women Workers was formed to represent women who are [[self-employed]] in informal employment such as [[street vending|street vendors]], which is common areas of employment for indigenous women.&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter2001F"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Walter|title=Women's rights: a global view|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30890-1|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workforce participation and finances===

Women's participation in economic development increased from 22.5 percent to 40 percent between 1976 and 2002. As of 2002, 44 percent of women worked. Women living in [[urban area|urban]] areas tend to have the least paying and unproductive types of jobs, which is believed to be due to the lack of educational opportunities for women and educational requirements for better jobs. In rural areas women struggle more due to their gender and of being [[Indigenous peoples in Bolivia|indigenous]].&lt;ref name=UNICEF1/&gt; As of 1992 rural working women had risen from 18.3 percent in 1976 to 38.1 percent, but working conditions are often poor, wages low and have low productivity.&lt;ref name="Walter2001D"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Walter|title=Women's rights: a global view|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30890-1|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some employers require women to sign agreements not to get [[pregnant]].&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt; Indigenous women tend to work long hours as street vendors or [[domestic worker]]. Women who work the latter tend to work more hours, with less days off and low pay.&lt;ref name="Walter2001F"/&gt;

Despite growths in workforce participation, women's income capacity has changed very little. Increased distribution of wealth for women since 1990 until 2003 grew only by 3 percent.&lt;ref name=UNICEF1/&gt; As of 2001, women's wages were only 75 percent of men's wages. Professional women make even less, at only 69 percent.&lt;ref name="Walter2001D"/&gt; It is more difficult for a woman to obtain a [[bank loan]], than it is for men, due to the fact that most women will be unable to repay the loans due to limited financial backing. [[Micro-credit]] programs geared towards women do exist in Bolivia.&lt;ref name=SIG/&gt;

In Bolivia, women have seen an increase in opportunities to contribute to economic decisions, in both private and public sectors, increasing by 70 percent as of 2003.&lt;ref name=UNICEF1/&gt;

===Labor market===

As [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the dominant language in Bolivia, this causes a gap between Spanish speakers, bilingual speakers of Spanish and indigenous languages, and just the indigenous speakers. The gap is defined by how men and women will learn Spanish and if learned, what market labor participation they will have. Bolivian women that live in rural communities and have recently migrated to the urban cities usually do not know Spanish because being excluded from the rest of the population that knows Spanish. However, for men it doesn't matter if they migrated to an urban city from a rural community, they will more likely have opportunities to participate in the labor force. The older generation that live in the rural and urban communities mostly do not know Spanish. Women who have a large number of children usually do not work in the labor force, and then are not enticed to learn Spanish.&lt;ref name="Chiswick, Barry 2000"/&gt;

Women have lower labor force participation rate than do men.&lt;ref name="Chiswick, Barry 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chiswick | first1 = Barry R. | last2 = Patrinos | first2 = Harry Anthony | last3 = Hurst | first3 = Michael E. | title = Indigenous language skills and the labor market in a developing economy: Bolivia | journal = [[Economic Development and Cultural Change]] | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 349–367 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] via JSTOR | doi = 10.1086/452462 | jstor = 10.1086/452462 | date = January 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/452462| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they have a lower participation rate, they are less able to have an education. According to the Human Development Report of 2012, the average years of schooling for men and women adults is 9.2 years. When women do not have a proper education, they will not be capable of having jobs that provide them with a decent income. Also, according to the 2012 GII table, the inequality-adjusted income index is 0.294.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bolivia (Plurinational State of) | website = UNDP Human Development Reports | url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/BOL | publisher = [[United Nations Development Programme]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women living in La Paz earn a higher amount of money in comparison to women living in other urban cities of Bolivia. This is because La Paz is closely tied to government departments in which the government supports and encourages women by having them work in government related occupations.

In Bolivia, women who know only Spanish earn 28% more than women who are bilingual in Spanish and an indigenous language. Women who are bilingual earn 25% more than women who only speak an indigenous language. For women, the difference in making a certain amount of money in the labor market depends highly on their language skills.&lt;ref name="Chiswick, Barry 2000"/&gt; It is because it depends on the areas in how much they value Spanish for productivity in the labor market. Also, because of discrimination against indigenous people who are most likely poorly educated and have low quality Spanish skills.&lt;ref name="Chiswick, Barry 2000"/&gt;

===International migration===

Most of migration out of Bolivia has been attributed to the economic pressures due to the neoliberal regime.&lt;ref name="Gerrera, Gioconda 2005. pp. 281-303"&gt;{{citation | last = Gerrera | first = Gioconda | contribution = Mujeres ecuatorianas en las cadenas globales del cuidado | editor-last1 = Herrera | editor-first1 = Gioconda | editor-last2 = Tores | editor-first2 = Alicia | editor-last3 = Carrillo | editor-first3 = Maria Cristina | title = La migración ecuatoriana: transnacionalismo, redes e identidades | pages = 281&amp;ndash;303 | publisher = Facultad Latino Americana de Ciencias Sociales (FLASCO) | location = Quito | date = 2005 | isbn = 9978-67-104-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for international migrations is an unstable economy, high poverty and unemployment level. For women, generally being mistreated and discriminated within their society motivates them to leave their homes.&lt;ref name="Gerrera, Gioconda 2005. pp. 281-303"/&gt; Informal economies in Latin America have conformed to new policies imposed from Northern Countries and European countries. According to scholar Lourdes Beneria, there needs to be a balance between the family and labor market by integrating the capabilities approach (Nussbaum) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Women and human development: the capabilities approach | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780521003858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reconsider European policies.

Informal jobs increased by many policies that introduced for example, budget cuts and privatization policies. It reduced state monitoring and opened a free market for developing states to become global competitors and foreign investors. In 2006, Bolivia has the highest number of population over 55 percent that are a part of informal activities. It does not include undocumented migrants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some of these workers have low income jobs or work as self-employers. However, majority of them migrate for work temporarily.

Although migration takes place between Latin American countries, many women migrate to Western European countries as domestic workers because the middle-class and upper-class women in those countries do not have time to work both in the labor force and in domestic work. The migrant workers help them out with child care, household chores, [[elderly care]], and social reproduction.&lt;ref name="Benería, Lourdes 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Benería | first = Lourdes | author-link=Lourdes Benería |title = The crisis of care, international migration, and public policy | journal = [[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–21 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13545700802081984 | date = 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13545700802081984 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bolivia because there is not mobilization of domestic and market labor, women usually don't separate child care from work responsibilities. In order to care for their children many women don't work in formal jobs. There are a variety of incentives for women to leave their families temporarily. For example, instability, abuse, gender discrimination. They leave thinking that eventually their family will follow their example and to the same. The people within the household then have to be in charge of taking care of each other and in doing domestic work. The children have to depend on extended family and don't feel loved when their mother is away. It is harder for children to have their mothers gone than fathers because it goes against the traditional norm that the father is supposed to leave in order to provide.&lt;ref name="Benería, Lourdes 2008"/&gt;

The problem is complex in that it relies on the changes of policies made in the host country. Another part of the problem is that the solution depends to have a high level of gender equality within the gender division of work force. The purpose of integrating the capabilities approach and public policies so that the people will be capable in order to function and live a good life. Using a scholar, [[Ingrid Robeyns]] list is not completely universal, but function with a particular group of people who have different types of work than others. (1) being able to raise children and to take care of other; (2) being able to work in the labor market or to undertake other projects; (3) being able to be mobile; (4) being able to engage in leisure activities; and (5) being able to exercise autonomy in allocating one's time. Some capabilities can be applied to certain geographical areas than others. The majority of them would be applied to a community level than national or regional. It saves time for household members and mostly women working in the informal economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Robeyns | first = Ingrid | author-link=Ingrid Robeyns|title = Sen's capability approach and gender inequality: selecting relevant capabilities | journal = [[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]], special issue on the work of Amartya Sen | volume = 9 | issue = 2&amp;ndash;3 | pages = 61–92 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/1354570022000078024 | date = 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1354570022000078024 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property rights==

Due to cultural [[prejudice]] women suffer from discrimination regarding land acquisition, however, numbers have increased regarding women's ownership of land. The Bolivian Land Reform Act of 1996 states that land rights be handled equally between genders and peoples. In 1990, only 9 percent of land was owned individually or jointly by women. By 2004 that number had increased to 40 percent. Women have the same opportunity to access property as men do, however this generally affects only women in urban areas, as women in more rural areas are subject to traditional practices.&lt;ref name=SIG/&gt; The National Indigenous Women's Federation represents Indigenous women seeking to acquire property titles. Between 2006 and 2009, 10,299 [[land grant]]s were granted to women, totaling 164,401 [[hectare]]s.&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt;

===Conditional cash transfer===

In 2009, the Vice-Ministry for Equal Opportunities was created within the Ministry of Justice to promote women's rights by making public policies within the whole country. These would consider the rights of indigenous women.
 
In the same year, another organization was created. Bono Juana Azurday (BJA)&lt;ref name="Molyneux 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molyneux | first1 = Maxine | last2 = Thomson | first2 = Marilyn | title = Cash transfers, gender equity and women's empowerment in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia | journal = Gender &amp; Development, special issue: Social Protection | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 195–212 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13552074.2011.592631 | date = 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13552074.2011.592631 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conditional cash transfer scheme,&lt;ref name="Molyneux 2011"/&gt; which assists people living in poverty by giving them monthly payments. In return the group of people would have to agree act and do certain behaviors. The main goal of the Bolivian CCT program was to concentrate on women's needs and create gender equity. In addition, BJA was made to help children's education have security for the elderly. However, when this organization was created it did not involve with women's agencies or the government's gender organizations. As a result, the women's issues were ignored completely and especially rights were suppressed.

The CCT program, BJA, had more negative effects on the women than positive, according to the indigenous women of Bolivia.&lt;ref name="Molyneux 2011"/&gt; The women were required to go to education classes, participate in maternal health activities and go to family planning sessions. They were not educated about their rights. In addition, women had to surrender their rights to reproduce because of the BJA regulations. For, example, women would have to wait two years to have another child in order to have another cash transfer, but if they did conceive a child then the second cash transfer would be postponed. 
 
Another obstacle for Bolivian women nearing labor is that they are required to give birth in hospitals instead of their homes. This requirement allows them to receive proper maternal care. However, the women would have to walk or travel a far distance in order to get to the nearest hospital. There is a health clinic serving as a waiting place for them before they are about to go into labor. With the different atmosphere of hospitals and waiting clinics, and with differences between hospital staff and the indigenous women, there is a gap of misunderstanding of cultural tradition and the BJA's regulations.

The progress women made with the CCT program is that they were able to gain self-confidence through financial services. They were able to have more control over the money inside the household. Also, indigenous women had access to their own documentation and for their children. This allowed them to be recognized by the Bolivian government in order for them to have the same rights as other citizens.
 
The cash transfers were given to the women in order for them to take care of their children and their maternal health. It also gave them an opportunity to create a social network while moving to urban areas. The CCT program helped the welfare needs of the indigenous women. The CCT program did not pay much attention to the women's voice, give them more opportunities in order to move forward in the economy or could help them participate more as a community. There was a feeling of discrimination between the indigenous women and the staff workers, because the women did not speak Spanish and were not able to communicate effectively. The [[gender equity]] did not improve between men and women because the women were not able to improve their economic social status with the financial help they received.&lt;ref name="Molyneux 2011"/&gt;

==Crime against women==

Physical abuse and rape are the highest experienced crimes against women in Bolivia. A 1986 report from a hospital in [[La Paz]] stated that out of the 1,432 cases of rape and abuse, 66 percent were committed against women. 77.5 percent of those crimes were committed by husbands or family members, followed by 13 percent committed by strangers. Most cases are never brought to court, due to the subordinate expectations of women in Bolivian society.&lt;ref name="Walter2001H"/&gt;

===Domestic violence===

{{Main|Domestic violence in Bolivia}}

Historically, a husband was legally allowed to beat his wife or children to show his role as a paternal authority until 1973. Since 1973, domestic abuse has been cited as a reason for separation or divorce, but was not allowed to be taken to court by family members, except in cases when the injuries caused incapacitation for more than 30 days.&lt;ref name="Walter2001I"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Walter|title=Women's rights: a global view|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30890-1|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until 1995 that [[domestic violence]] became illegal,&lt;ref name="Walter2001B"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Walter|title=Women's rights: a global view|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30890-1|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, domestic violence towards women makes up for more than half of all assaults reported in the country. Half of Bolivian women have experienced [[sexual violence|sexual]], physical or [[psychological abuse|psychological]] abuse by a partner. 9 out of 10 women are believed to have experienced general violence towards them, while the opposite is for men: only 1 in 10 has experience violence directed at them.&lt;ref name=SIG/&gt; A [[United States State Department]] report in 1998 reported that 5 percent of women were physically abused and 48 percent psychologically abused. The Bolivian government estimates that approximately 100,000 incidents go unreported each year. The lack of women's support groups and domestic abuse shelters also contribute to the persistent violence.&lt;ref name="Walter2001I"/&gt;

===Work abuse===

Poor indigenous women are prone to often working in menial low paying jobs such as domestic service. A 1988 survey acknowledged that domestic servants do experience at work abuse, including [[sexual abuse]] by their employers. Maids also may experience discrimination, not being allowed to enter certain rooms of houses and utilize their employers utensils and household items.&lt;ref name="Walter2001F"/&gt;

===Rape and sexual assault===

[[Rape]] is illegal. In 2013, Bolivia passed a new comprehensive domestic violence law, which outlaws many forms of abuse of women, including [[marital rape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | last = Robinson | first = Jessica | title =  New law mandates harsh penalties and broad services to address violence against women in Bolivia | url = http://ain-bolivia.org/2013/03/new-law-mandates-harsh-penalties-and-broad-services-to-address-violence-against-woman-in-bolivia/ | work = ain-bolivia.org | publisher = Andean Information Network | date = 21 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of 1995, 3.5 rapes were reported each day, though the Congressional Committee on Women estimates that twice as many were not reported. Sexual assault and abuse is considered a crime against the morality of the community, rather than against the victim. The proof often falls on the victim, due to the generally private nature of sexual crimes, therefore most crimes are never taken to court due to the struggle for proof and high costs of legal fees. Rape cases that make it to court are often challenged by the rapist who might call the reputation of the victim into question. [[Prostitute]]s are not protected by the courts.&lt;ref name="Walter2001I"/&gt;

===Discrimination===

A [[presidential decree]] was declared in 1995 which provided equal rights for women and promised that the government would cease [[sexism]] against women.&lt;ref name="Walter2001B"/&gt;

====Discrimination against indigenous women====
Bolivia has the highest indigenous population in Latin America. The [[agricultural]] work of indigenous women, who often work alongside their husbands, is not recognized by Bolivian society as being productive. Indigenous women are considered inferior in Bolivian society. Opportunities regarding education and training are extremely poor. Lack of awareness about their legal rights and strict traditional gender roles contribute to their roles within Bolivian society. Many of the rural projects being programmed by new [[NGO]]'s focus mainly on men.&lt;ref name="Walter2001J"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Walter|title=Women's rights: a global view|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0IXyvEGao8C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30890-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==

===Maternal and child healthcare===

Between 1992 and 1993, child mortality rate went down for children 5 years and under, due to a primary healthcare programme in a rural community of Bolivia. The Andean Rural Health Care(ARHC)is a U.S. private organization, and is voluntary. Its focus is on maternal and child health care and have care services to prevent and cure diseases. It cooperates with staff and facilities from Bolivian Ministry of Health(MoH) to be more effective.&lt;ref name="B Perry, Henry 2011"/&gt;

The region has two distinct areas across from each other in the high plains just north of La Paz. The first area is Carbuco, which has low quality health care services. Ancoraimes is the second area and is known as the intervention area that has health care services available. Both populations work mainly in agriculture and domestic livestock production.&lt;ref name="B Perry, Henry 2011"/&gt;

In 1993, 95 percent of children ages 12 month to 23 months were enrolled in the health programme. The documentation shows that 78 percent were vaccinated. Mothers were trained to recognize the symptoms of [[pneumonia]] and 60 percent reported pneumonia cases to get medical assistance. In addition, the availability of clean water and sanitation was located within intervention areas, but only reached 10 percent of households.&lt;ref name="B Perry, Henry 2011"/&gt;

Indigenous couples are also less prone to discussing family planning with each other, despite male partner desires to not want additional children, as well. Indigenous women feel that their partners don't want to discuss the topic of family planning, thus the conversation never is had. Despite this communication problem, the Guttmacher Institute report found that the majority of both indigenous and non-indigenous couples approve of [[family planning]]. 44% of indigenous women said that they do not want a child but will not use [[contraceptives]], versus 26 percent of non-indigenous women.&lt;ref name=GI&gt;{{cite web | last = Carmin | first = Lauren | title = Indigenous women in Bolivia do not desire larger families than nonindigenous women | url = http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/02/01/index.html | work = News release | accessdate = 26 February 2012 | date = 1 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1983 survey found that over 70 percent of Bolivian women used no [[birth control]] method. 23.6 percent of women used contraceptives, with 6.1 percent being [[birth control pills]] or [[IUD]]s. Women also use the [[rhythm method]], which often  maternal mortality rates.&lt;ref name="Walter2001G"/&gt; A 1998 survey reported that [[maternal death]] in Bolivia was one of the highest in the world, with women living in the [[altiplano]] suffering from higher rates.&lt;ref name=UNICEF1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter2001G"/&gt; Main health causes of maternal mortality are [[infection]], [[hemorrhages]], complicates from [[childbirth]] and from [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=UNICEF1/&gt; [[Fertility rate]]s in Bolivia are among the highest in Latin America. [[UNESCO]] reported in 1996 that the fertility rate was 4.7 children per woman.&lt;ref name="Walter2001G"/&gt;

While pregnant, 63 percent of urban living women seek [[prenatal]] care. Women who do not seek prenatal care cite the high cost of services, lack of trust in medical professionals, and lack of education on the value of prenatal care as reasons for not seeking services.&lt;ref name="Walter2001H"/&gt;

===Family and home life===

When it comes to household responsibilities girls second in line to household tasks behind their mothers. Mothers often work at market, or as cooks, domestic servants or similar service jobs in order to provide for the family. Due to this demand for work, girls are expected to help with household chores and the care of their siblings while their mother works.&lt;ref name="Walter2001G"/&gt;

The legal age for women to marry in Bolivia is 14 and 16 years of age for men. Early marriage require [[parental consent]], with a judge being able to grant consent if the parents do not or cannot approve. A [[United Nations]] study in 2004 reported that 12 percent of girls between ages 15 and 19 were married, divorced or widowed.&lt;ref name=SIG/&gt;

A '''genootschap''' (German - '''genossenschaft''') is a specifically [[Netherlands|Dutch]] form of company, [[Voluntary association|association]], [[society]] or [[cooperative]], named after the pursuit for which its members gather.

==Definition==

Each member voluntarily joins his or her fate with that of his or her fellow members and that of the genootschap's ups and downs.  Such a society also usually has a number of other characteristics :

*Size and composition:  The number of members of a society is limited.  A society can be sizeable, but it is never a mass association.  Thus its intentions are decided only by its character.  
*Objective:  The target of a genootschap is always carried forward by its members with a certain degree of seriousness, as well as a great social aim.  From this also results its solemn character and interest in decorum.

==Kinds==
* [[Discreet genootschap]]
* [[Geheim genootschap]]
* [[Initiatiegenootschap]]
* [[Wetenschappelijk genootschap]]

==Examples==
* [[Republikeins Genootschap]]
* [[Nieuw Republikeins Genootschap]]

* [[Theosofisch Genootschap]]
* [[Russisch Geografisch Genootschap]]

'''Greeks in Kyrgyzstan''' form one of [[Kyrgyzstan|the country's]] smaller minority groups. The existing data are contradictory. According to 2009 Census there are 451 Greeks.&lt;ref name="NewCensus" /&gt; According to the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are 150 families of Greek origin (650&amp;ndash;700 people).&lt;ref name="gmfa"&gt;{{Cite book|publication-place=Hellenic Republic|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|url=http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/el-GR/Policy/Geographic+Regions/Russia-Eastern+Europe-Central+Asia/Bilateral+relations/Kyrghizstan/|title=Kyrgyzstan: The Greek Community|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the data of the General Secretariat For Greeks Abroad give an even lower number (50 people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=General Secretariat For Greeks Abroad |accessdate=2009-05-07 |url=http://www.ggae.gr/gabroad/organosi.el.asp |title=General Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716045118/http://www.ggae.gr/gabroad/organosi.el.asp |archivedate=July 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Initial settlement===
According to an official census of 1920, the Greeks of Kyrgyzstan numbered only 344.&lt;ref name="Agtz1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Agtzidis|first=Vlassis|url=http://www1.antibaro.gr/attachments/Istorikh_Parousia_Ellhnwn_ston_Kaukaso.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Historical Presence of the Greeks in the Caucasus|publisher=Antivaron|accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1939 and during [[World War II]] Greeks living in the [[Soviet Union]]&amp;mdash;most of them were merchants, but there were also some farmers&amp;mdash;[[population transfer in the Soviet Union|suffered deportations]], mainly to the steppes of [[Central Asia]], particularly to [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], Kyrgyzstan and [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hess |first=Christin |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=November 2008 |title=The Contested Terrain of the Parallel Society: The Other Natives in Contemporary Greece and Germany |journal=Europe-Asia Studies |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=1521&amp;ndash;1522 |doi=10.1080/09668130802362276 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a considerable time after the end of the war, these deported Greeks remained unrehabilitated, and were not allowed to return to their pre-deportation areas of settlement. Thus some of them chose to leave Siberia to settle in Kazakhstan and (to a lesser extent) in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abazov |first=Rafis |coauthors= |date=November 1999 |title=Economic Migration in Post-Soviet Central Asia: The Case of Kyrgyzstan|journal=Post-Communist Economies|volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=240}}&lt;br/&gt;* Hess (2008), 1521&amp;ndash;1522&lt;br/&gt;* {{cite web|last=Kekis|first=Theoharis|title=The Pontian Question as of 2008|url=http://www.efxinospontos.org/main_news/mainnews18.html"|accessdate=7 May 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these Greeks were finally concentrated in the [[Osh province]], and the town of [[Nookat]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Agtz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Agtzidis|first=Vlassis|url=http://www.anixneuseis.gr/?p=1734|title=Stalin's Persecutions against the Greeks of the Soviet Union|publisher=Detections|accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a second wave of deportations (1944&amp;ndash;1949) initiated by the [[Stalinism|Stalinist regime]], more than 31,000 families ([[Pontian Greeks]] and Greeks from [[Crimea]]) were sent to Bishkek; only 5,000 found a shelter living in squalid conditions. This time, the deported Greeks finally settled in the [[Talas Province]].&lt;ref name="Agtz" /&gt;

===Migration to Greece===
In early 1990s, the Greek community of Kyrgyzstan was still vibrant,&lt;ref name="Diam"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713999342|last=Diamanti&amp;ndash;Karanou |first=Panagoula|coauthors= |date=January 2003 |title=Migration of Ethnic Greeks from the Former Soviet Union to Greece, 1990-2000: Policy Decisions and Implications | journal=Southeast European and Black Sea Studies|volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=27, 32|accessdate=7 May 2009|doi=10.1080/713999342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numbered 3,000 members in all.&lt;ref name="Dipl"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.diplomatia.gr/index.php?module=column&amp;clid=39&amp;aid=812|last=Kalamvrezos|first=Dionysis|coauthors= |date=February 2006 |title=The Greek Diaspora in Russia| journal=Diplomacy|volume=3 |issue=26 |accessdate=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, from 1985 onward, their number has been decreasing, due to outmigration by Greeks in search of work.&lt;ref name="Kabar"/&gt; According to the statistics, during the 1990s 860 members of the Greek community of Kyrgyzstan (0.57% if the total number of Greek immigrants from the former [[Soviet Union]]) settled in Greece.&lt;ref name="Diam" /&gt;

==Organization==
The community is represented by the Filia (Friendship) Association of Ethnic Greeks, headed by chairwoman Olga Kupriyanova. According to her, the association has 300 members.&lt;ref name="Kabar"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rus.kabar.kg/2009/04/15/okupriyanova-kolichestvo-grekov-v-kyrgyzstane-za-15-let-umenshilos/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194556/http://rus.kabar.kg/2009/04/15/okupriyanova-kolichestvo-grekov-v-kyrgyzstane-za-15-let-umenshilos/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-03|periodical=Kabar Kyrgyzstan Information Agency|date=2009-04-15|accessdate=2009-05-04|title=О.Куприянова: Количество греков в Кыргызстане за 15 лет уменьшилось/O.

The University of [[Bishkek]] opened a Greek language department in 2003.&lt;ref name="gmfa"/&gt;

'''Hijra Farsi''' (Urdu: {{urd|فارسی چانڈڑنہ}}) is a [[Cant (language)|secret language]] spoken by South-Asian [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] and [[Kothi (gender)|koti]] communities. Hijras are a marginalized [[transgender]] community that lives in sequestered groups in many cities of India and Pakistan. The language, also known as ''Koti Farsi'', is spoken by the hijra community throughout Pakistan and North India (except [[West Bengal]]). The language is based on [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and not [[Persian language|Farsi]], as suggested by the name.&lt;ref name=Hall2001&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/linguistics/colloq/prev/2001/2001feb09.html|title=Stanford Linguistics Colloquium|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence structure is similar to [[Urdu]], but noticeable distinctions exist.&lt;ref&gt;Sheeraz, Muhammad, and Ayaz Afsar. "Farsi: An Invisible But Loaded Weapon for the Emerging Hijraism in Pakistan." Kashmir Journal of Language Research 14, no. 2 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the language is not actually based on Persian (Farsi), the hijras consider the language to be related to the language of the [[Mughal Empire]], which they associate with the origin of hijra identity. Hijra Farsi is most similar to Hindi, but is not intelligible to Hindi speakers due to distinctive intonation and a large amount of distinctive vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Hall2001/&gt;

After the partition of India, the language has come to include words of local languages including [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and other languages.

'''Hyderabad State Aero Club''' was an airport club in the [[Hyderabad State]], [[India]]. It became the airfield for the VII [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]]'s aircraft. The club hosted the first ever air show at the Begumpet airport.

==History==
The club started in 1936. The foundation for the terminal building was laid by [[Princess Durrushevar]] in November 1936. The Hyderabad Aero Club was formed and it became the airfield for Nizam of Hyderabad's aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/15/stories/2008101558500200.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109022903/http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/15/stories/2008101558500200.htm |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The second airport was further built with the provision of a proper airport terminal building in 1937, after realising the need for a full-fledged airport for Hyderabad.

===Return to roots: African Americans in Ghana===
{{main| African-Americans in Ghana}}
As reported by the journalist [[Lydia Polgreen]] in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article, the fact that Ghanaian slave exports to the Americas were so important between the 16th and 19th centuries means that Ghana currently is trying to attract African slave descendants from the [[Americas]] in order that they settle there, and so that they return to make the country the new home to many descendants of the Ghanaian diaspora - though not all are of Ghanaian descent. Accordingly, as reported by Valerie Papaya Mann, president of the African American Association of Ghana,  thousands of African Americans are already now living in Ghana, at least for part of the year. To encourage migration or visits by the descendants of enslaved Africans from the Americas, Ghana decided in 2005 to offer them a special visa and grant them  Ghanaian passports.&lt;ref name="Slave´s Diaspora"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/international/africa/27ghana.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title= Ghana's Uneasy Embrace of Slavery's Diaspora|publisher=''The New York Times''|author=Polgreen, Lydia|authorlink=Lydia Polgreen|date=December 27, 2005|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country of birth of residents in Ghana==
According to the Ghana Statistics Service 375,000 of the Ghana [[Residency (domicile)|resident]] population were born outside Ghana, representing 2.5% of the total Ghana resident population. In 2010 Census, European-born population was 14,295 in which some of them could be children of Ghanaians living in Europe.&lt;ref name="Ghana - 2010 Population and Housing Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statsGhana.gov.gh/docfiles/2010phc/Census2010_Summary_report_of_final_results.pdf|title=Ghana - 2010 Population and Housing Census|work=Ghana Statistics Service|year=2010|publisher=Government of Ghana|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conferment of a person, as a [[Citizenship|citizen]] of [[India]], is governed by Articles 5 to 11 (Part II) of the [[Constitution of India]]. The legislation related to this matter is the Citizenship Act 1955, which has been amended by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1986, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1992, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003, The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005
and Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2015.

Article 9 of Indian Constitution says that a person who voluntarily acquires citizenship of any other country is no longer an Indian citizen. Also, according to [[The Passports Act]], a person has to surrender his/her Indian passport and voter card and other Indian ID cards must not be used after another country's citizenship is obtained. It is a punishable offence if the person fails to surrender the passport.

'''Indian nationality law''' largely follows the ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (citizenship by right of blood) as opposed to the ''[[jus soli]]'' (citizenship by right of birth within the territory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/as-trump-strike-at-birthright-citizenship-americans-and-indians-look-up-14th-amendment/articleshow/66450132.cms|title=As Trump strikes at birthright citizenship, Americans – and Indians – look up 14th Amendment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President of India]] is termed the First Citizen of India.

==History==
{{See also|History of British nationality law#Early English and British nationality law|History of citizenship#Great Britain|Princely state}}
The [[Government of India Act 1858]] established the [[British Raj]] and formally brought the majority of Indians under [[British Empire|British imperial rule]]. Until the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] took effect on 15 August 1947, Indians under the British Raj generally fell into one of two categories:
*Indians resident and born in [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] came under the direct dominion of and bore [[allegiance]] to the British Crown, and held the status of ''[[British subject]]''. From 1 January 1915, the [[British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914]] defined British subjects as those born or naturalised in the British Sovereign's dominions (including British India), women married to men born or naturalised in the aforementioned Crown dominions and children legitimately born to a British subject father anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1914/17/pdfs/ukpga_19140017_en.pdf legislation.gov.uk: "British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914"] (original as printed)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Indians resident and born in a [[princely state]] (also known as an "Indian state" or a "Native state") under the British Raj, or in any other [[British protectorate]] or [[protected state]] under the British government, held the status of ''[[British protected person]]''.&lt;ref name="Royal_Commission_Scholarship" group="note"&gt;For example, see attached regulations for the [[1851 Research Fellowship]] for Indians, with reference to Indians from princely states as British protected persons ([http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Downloads/article_id_015_02_0059_0060_0.pdf Current Science - Science Notes and News])&lt;/ref&gt; This status extended to the wives and legitimate offspring of male subjects of those states. British protected persons were considered ''de jure'' foreigners, but could travel on British-issued passports.

Effective from 15 August 1947, India was established as the independent [[Dominion of India]]. Along with subjects of the other British Dominions, Indians resident, born and naturalised in Indian provinces legally remained British subjects by virtue of Section 18(3) of the Indian Independence Act, unless they had already acquired citizenship of the [[United Kingdom]] or any other country. From 15 August, British protection over the princely states lapsed, and Indians who were subjects of a principality automatically lost their status as British protected persons.&lt;ref name="Indians_Gulf_Residency" group="note"&gt;Indians then residing in the states of the [[Aden Protectorate]] or in the states under the [[Persian Gulf Residency]], and their wives and families, remained British protected persons. Both administrations had been previously transferred to the control of the British Foreign Office, the Aden Protectorate in 1917 and the Persian Gulf Residency in April 1947. Members of the [[Indian diaspora]] then resident in any other British protectorate or protected state also remained under British protection.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazette_of_India"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gazette of India - Extraordinary |url=http://pib.nic.in/archive/docs/DVD_28/ACC%20NO%20702-BR/LAW%201949-04-09_242.pdf|website=Press Information Bureau of India - Archive|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Instrument_Accession" group="note"&gt;Though the [[Instrument of Accession]] each prince signed upon acceding to either Dominion did not legally affect their sovereignty within their state.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 15 August 1947 and the date when an Indian princely ruler merged his state (not merely acceding to) into the new Dominion of India, thereby transferring his sovereign powers to the Indian government, the subjects of his state remained stateless though subjects of their ruler, lacking any recognized nationality or British subject status.

From 1 January 1949, when the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] came into force, to 25 January 1950, Indians in the Indian provinces became ''British subjects with Indian citizenship''.&lt;ref name="subject_Commonwealth_citizen" group="note"&gt;From 1 January 1949, the term ''British subject'' became interchangeable with ''[[Commonwealth citizen]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; From 26 November 1949, Indians domiciled in the territories of India became Indian citizens. With the promulgation of the Indian Constitution on 26 January 1950, which established the Republic of India, the majority of Indian citizens were no longer British subjects, but continued to enjoy the status of [[Commonwealth citizen]] (also known as a ''British subject with Commonwealth citizenship'', a status which does not entitle the holder to use a British passport), by virtue of their Indian citizenship and India's membership of the Commonwealth. However, a number of people, notably those who had been born in a former princely state, did not acquire Indian citizenship on commencement of the Indian Constitution and retained ''British subject without citizenship'' status (which entitles a person to a British passport) unless they had acquired citizenship of another Commonwealth country. The Citizenship Act of India (1955) finally extended Indian citizenship to all Indians, regardless of whether they had been born in a former princely state or not.

On 20 December 1961, after [[Annexation of Goa|military action]], India acquired the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]] and [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] which were under the territories of [[Portugal]]. The French territory of [[Puducherry district|Puducherry]], [[Karaikal district|Karaikal]], [[Mahé district|Mahé]], [[Yanam district|Yanam]] and the Free town of [[Chandannagar|Chandranagore]], were acquired under treaty of [[cession]] with [[France]]. [[Sikkim]] was also merged with India and became a constituent state with effect from 16 May 1975. Some of the enclaves in the eastern part of India were also acquired under border agreements with [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="Books.google.co.in"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1ecjepq80QC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=citizenship+act+1955&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NH_FUaSkNMK3iwKTzoH4DQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=citizenship%20act%201955&amp;f=false |title=Nationality and International Law in Asian Perspective - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to expressly provide the citizenship for people in territories as mentioned above, the central government issued the Goa, Daman and Diu (Citizenship) Order, 1962, Dadra and Nagar Haveli (Citizenship) Order, 1962 and Citizenship (Pondicherry) Order 1962, in exercise of its powers under section 7 of the Citizenship act and for Sikkim, the President extended the Citizenship act, and the relevant rules under Article 371-F(n) of Indian Constitution. In case of acquired enclaves, that did not necessitate legislative action, as that was only a border demarcation agreement.&lt;ref name="Books.google.co.in"/&gt;

==Granting of citizenship==
[[File:Indian Passport.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Cover of an [[Indian passport]]]]

=== Citizenship at the commencement of the constitution of India ===

Persons domiciled in the territory of India as on 26 November 1949 automatically became Indian citizens by virtue of operation of the relevant provisions of the Indian Constitution coming into force, and most of these constitutional provisions came into force on 26 January 1950. The Constitution of India also made provision regarding citizenship for migrants from the territories of Pakistan which had been part of India before [[Partition of India|partition]].

=== Citizenship by birth ===
Any person born in India on or after 26 January 1950, but prior to the commencement of the 1986 Act on 1 July 1987, is a citizen of India by birth. A person born in India on or after 1 July 1987 is a citizen of India if either parent was a citizen of India at the time of the birth. Those born in India on or after 3 December 2004 are considered citizens of India only if both of their parents are citizens of India or if one parent is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of their birth. In September 2013, [[Bombay High Court]] gave a judgement that a birth certificate, passport or even an Aadhaar card alone may not be enough to prove Indian citizenship, unless the parents are Indian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Passport-alone-no-proof-of-citizenship-Bombay-HC/articleshow/22244467.cms|title=Passport alone no proof of citizenship: Bombay HC |publisher=Times of India |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizenship by descent ===
Persons born outside India on or after 26 January 1950 but before 10 December 1992 are citizens of India by descent if their father was a citizen of India at the time of their birth.

Persons born outside India on or after 10 December 1992 are considered citizens of India if either of their parents is a citizen of India at the time of their birth.

From 3 December 2004 onwards, persons born outside of India shall not be considered citizens of India unless their birth is registered at an Indian diplomatic mission within one year of the date of birth. In certain circumstances it is possible to register after one year with the permission of the Central Government. The application for registration of the birth of a child must be made to an Indian diplomatic mission and must be accompanied by an undertaking in writing from the parents of the child that he or she does not hold the passport of another country.

=== Citizenship by registration ===

The Central Government may, on an application, register as a citizen of India under section 5 of the Citizenship Act 1955 any person (not being an illegal migrant) if s/he belongs to any of the following categories:

* a person of Indian origin who is ordinarily resident in India for seven years before making application under Section 5(1)(a) (throughout the period of twelve months immediately before making application and for six years in the aggregate in the eight years preceding the 12 months).
* a person of Indian origin who is ordinarily resident in any country or place outside undivided India;
* a person who is married to a citizen of India and is ordinarily resident in India for seven years before making an application for registration;
* minor children of persons who are citizens of India;
* a person of full age and capacity whose parents are registered as citizens of India.
* a person of full age and capacity who, or either of his parents, was earlier citizen of independent India, and has been residing in India for one year immediately before making an application for registration;
* a person of full age and capacity who has been registered as an overseas citizen of India for five years, and who has been residing in India for one year before making an application for registration.


'''Citizenship by naturalization'''

Citizenship of India by naturalization can be acquired by a foreigner who is ordinarily resident in India for 14 years (throughout the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of application and for 11 years in the aggregate of 14 years preceding the 12 months) and other qualifications as specified in Section 6 (1) of the Citizen Act,1955.

== Renunciation and termination of Indian citizenship ==

Renunciation is covered in Section 8 of the Citizenship Act 1955. If an adult makes a declaration of renunciation of Indian citizenship, s/he loses Indian citizenship. In addition, any minor child of that person also loses Indian citizenship from the date of renunciation. When the child reaches the age of 18, he or she has the right to have his or her Indian citizenship restored. The provisions for making a declaration of renunciation n under Indian citizenship law require that the person making the declaration be "of full age and capacity".

[[Image:IndianPassport-Dual-Citizenship.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Warning stamped onto Indian Passports Issued by the High Commission of India, [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada]]
Termination is covered in Section 9 of the Citizenship Act, 1955. The provisions for termination are separate and distinct from the provisions for making a declaration of renunciation.

Section 9(1) of the act provides that any citizen of India who by naturalisation or registration acquires the citizenship of another country shall cease to be a citizen of India. Notably, the termination provision differs from the renunciation provision because it applies to "''any citizen of India''" and is not restricted to adults. Indian children therefore also automatically lose their claim to Indian citizenship if at any time after birth they acquire a citizenship of another country by, for example, naturalisation or registration — even if the acquisition of another citizenship was done as a result of actions by the child's parents.

The acquisition of another country's passport is also deemed under the Citizenship Rules, 1956 to be voluntary acquisition of another country’s nationality. Rule 3 of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, 1956 states that "the fact that a citizen of India has obtained on any date a passport from the Government of any other country shall be conclusive proof of his/her having voluntarily acquired the citizenship of that country before that date". Again, this rule applies even if the foreign passport was obtained for the child by his or her parents, and even if possession of such a passport is required by the laws of a foreign country which considers the child to be one of its citizens (e.g., a US-born child of Indian parents who is automatically deemed to be a US citizen according to US law, and who is therefore required by US law to have a US passport in order to enter and leave the US). It does not matter that a person continues to hold an Indian passport. This rule seemingly even applies if the foreign nationality was automatically had from birth, and thus not voluntarily acquired after birth. Persons who acquire another citizenship lose Indian citizenship from the date on which they acquire that citizenship or another country's passport. The prevailing practice at a number of British diplomatic posts, for example, is to impound and return to the Indian authorities the Indian passports of those applicants who apply for and are granted British passports.&lt;ref name="passportReturn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/51205wa1.pdf|title=Letter from British High Commission Nairobi|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special rules exist for Indian citizens with a connection to Goa, Daman and Diu. Rule 3A of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, 1956 states that "Where a person, who has become an Indian Citizen by virtue of the Goa, Daman and Diu (Citizenship) Order, 1962, or the Dadra and Nagar Haveli (Citizenship) Order 1962, issued under section 7 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955) holds a passport issued by the Government of any other country, the fact that he has not surrendered the said passport on or before the 19 January 1963 shall be conclusive proof of his/her having voluntarily acquired the citizenship of that country before that date.

On 16 February 1962, a Constitution Bench of the [http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/ Supreme Court of India] held in the case of Izhar Ahmad Khan vs Union of India that "If it is shown that the person has acquired foreign citizenship either by naturalisation or registration, there can be no doubt that s/he ceases to be a citizen of India in consequence of such naturalisation or registration."

== Overseas Citizenship of India ==
{{main|Overseas Citizenship of India}}
{{Update section|date=February 2015}}
[[Image:OCI JK.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|Front Cover of an OCI Card. ''Note:'' While it resembles a passport, it is not a passport nor does it confer actual Indian citizenship.]]

In response to persistent demands for [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]], particularly from the diaspora in North America and other developed countries, the ''Overseas Citizenship of India'' (OCI) scheme was introduced by amending ''The Citizenship Act, 1955'' in August 2005. The scheme was launched during the [[Pravasi Bharatiya Divas]] convention in Hyderabad in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI); Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926231018/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 |date=26 September 2009 }}, [http://www.moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&amp;id=m3&amp;idp=35&amp;mainid=23 Diaspora Services: Overseas Citizenship of India Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504131659/http://moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&amp;id=m3&amp;idp=35&amp;mainid=23 |date=4 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian authorities have interpreted the law to mean a person cannot have a second country's passport simultaneously with an Indian one — even in the case of a child who is claimed by another country as a citizen of that country, and who may be required by the laws of the other country to use one of its passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in the United States or in Australia to Indian parents), and the Indian courts have given the executive branch wide discretion over this matter. Therefore, Overseas Citizenship of India is not an actual citizenship of India&lt;ref&gt;[http://newdelhi.usembassy.gov/acsdualnation.html Dual Nationality: India and the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317051738/http://newdelhi.usembassy.gov/acsdualnation.html |date=17 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus, does not amount to dual citizenship or dual nationality or anyone no longer to use Indian IDs after OCI. Moreover, the OCI card is not a substitute for an Indian visa and therefore, the passport which displays the lifetime visa must be carried by OCI holders while travelling to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/oct/29/flying-to-india-carry-old-passport-with-oci-card.htm |title=Flying to India?

The proof of lifelong visa will be just the OCI Card which will have “Life Time Visa” printed on it. The OCI Card will be valid with any Valid Passport.''' However, countries may consider the OCI as [[dual citizenship]]: for example, the UK government considers that, for purposes of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]], "OCI is considered to be citizenship of another State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/262267/ch14annexh.pdf | publisher=United Kingdom Border Agency|title = Nationality Instructions, Chapter 14, Annex H, Section 7.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, the then [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Manmohan Singh]], announced that the [[Non-Resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Person of Indian Origin]] card will be merged with the [[Overseas Citizen of India]] card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pm-announces-merging-of-oci-pio-cards/735090/|title=PM announces merging of OCI, PIO cards - Indian Express|website=www.indianexpress.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new card was proposed to be called the [[Overseas Indian Card]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southasianfocus.ca/news/new-overseas-indian-card-to-replace-oci-pio/ New Overseas Indian Card to replace OCI, PIO]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013004145/http://www.southasianfocus.ca/news/new-overseas-indian-card-to-replace-oci-pio/ |date=13 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 9 January 2015, the PIO card scheme has been discontinued and applicants are to apply for OCI only. All currently held PIO cards are treated as OCI cards. PIO card holders will get a special stamp in their existing PIO card, saying "lifelong validity"  thus making them equal to existing OCI cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indembassybern.ch/eoi.php?id=PIO|title=Embassy of India, Berne, Switzerland : PIO Card|website=indembassybern.ch|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual Citizenship ==
It is generally difficult to have [[dual citizenship]] of India and another country, due to the provisions for loss of Indian nationality when an Indian national naturalizes in another country (see "Loss of citizenship" above), and the requirement to renounce one's existing citizenships when naturalizing in India (see "Naturalization" above).

There are still some ways in which a person may have [[dual citizenship]] of India and another country, including:
* Children of foreign diplomats, who are born in India, are also given dual citizenship during the period of their parents' service in India.
* A minor child of Indian origins may hold [[Dual-citizenship|dual citizenship]] of India and another country. So that the minor can decide within six months of completing 18 years of age as to whether he/she prefers Indian citizenship. 
A public interest litigation (PIL) seeking [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dualcitizenship.in/|title=Dual Citizenship for Overseas Indians|website=www.dualcitizenship.in|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for overseas Indians was filed in the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] on 6 January 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/pil-filed-in-sc-seeking-dual-citizenship-for-nris-115010800470_1.html|title=PIL filed in SC seeking dual citizenship for NRIs|last=ANI|date=2015-01-08|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the eve of the inauguration of the [[Pravasi Bharatiya Divas]] (PBD) in Gujarat's capital Gandhinagar by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

On 20 April 2015, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Public Interest Litigation (PIL). In dismissing the said PIL, the Supreme Court reasoned that Mr. Venkat Narayan cannot plead on somebody else's behalf as he is not the aggrieved party and those who need to assert their right should come forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/supreme-court-dismisses-plea-for-voting-rights-of-overseas-citizens-756654|title=Supreme Court Dismisses Plea For Voting Rights of Overseas Citizens|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visa requirements for [[Indian citizen]]s are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[India]]. As of 13 February 2018, Indian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 56 countries and territories, ranking the Indian passport 81st in terms of travel freedom (tied with [[Ivory Coast]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]] passports), according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley visa restrictions index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2017|url=https://henleyglobal.com/files/download/hvri/HP_Visa_Restrictions_Index_170301.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Junk food news''' (also known as '''junk news''' or '''junk journalism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/politicos-junk-journalism/2012/05/03/gIQAXZ2yyT_blog.html|title=Politico’s junk journalism|last=Rubin|first=Jennifer|date=2012-05-03|website=Washington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[sardonic]] term for news stories that deliver "sensationalized, personalized, and homogenized inconsequential [[trivia]]",&lt;ref name=c2001&gt;{{cite book
|title=Censored 2001
|chapter=Junk Food News 1877-2000
|last=Jensen |first=Carl
|editor-last=Phillips |editor-first=Peter

especially when such stories appear at the expense of serious [[investigative journalism]]. It implies a [[media criticism|criticism]] of the [[mass media]] for disseminating news that, while not very nourishing, is "cheap to produce and profitable for media proprietors."&lt;ref name=c2001/&gt;

==Meaning of the term==
The term ''junk food news'' was first used in print by Carl Jensen in the March 1983 edition of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]].'' As the leader of [[Project Censored]], he had frequently faulted the media for ignoring important stories. In response, says Jensen, editors claimed that other stories were more important, and bolstered this claim with [[ad hominem]] comments directed against him.
&lt;blockquote&gt;...news editors and directors...argued that the real issue isn't [[censorship]]&amp;mdash;but rather a difference of opinion as to what information is important to publish or broadcast. Editors often point out that there is a finite amount of time and space for news delivery&amp;mdash;about 23 minutes for a half-hour network television evening news program&amp;mdash;and that it's their responsibility to determine which stories are most critical for the public to hear. The critics said I wasn't exploring media censorship but rather I was just another frustrated academic criticizing editorial news judgment.&lt;ref name=c2001/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To give this argument a fair hearing, Jensen decided to conduct a review to determine which stories the media had considered more important. But instead of hard-hitting investigative journalism, what he discovered was the phenomenon that he termed junk food news fell into predictable categories:&lt;ref name=c2001/&gt;

* Brand name news ([[celebrity]] gossip)
* Sex news (exposés and [[sexual titillation]])
* Yo-yo news ([[statistic]]s that change daily, such as [[stock market]] numbers and [[box office]] totals)
* [[Show business]] news (movie openings)
* Latest craze news (brief [[fad]]s)
* [[Anniversary]] news (anniversaries of major events or celebrity deaths)
* [[Sports]] news (sports rumours)
* [[Political]] news (bi-annual coverage of congressional campaign promises)

As the flip side to its annual list of the Top 25 Censored Stories, Project Censored publishes an annual list of the Top 10 Junk Food News stories, compiled by members of the National Organization of News Ombudsmen.

[[File:Spencer, Kenneth (um 1960).jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Kenneth Lee Spencer (c. 1960)]]

'''Kenneth Lee Spencer''' (25 April 1911&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/152956969|title=Findagrave|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www1.wdr.de/stichtag5492.html At least once source] says his year of birth was 1911&lt;/ref&gt; - 25 February 1964), usually known as '''Kenneth Spencer''', was an African-American opera singer and actor. A talented [[bass-baritone]], Spencer starred in a few Broadway musicals and musical films in the United States during the 1940s. Frustrated with the racial prejudice he experienced in the United States, Spencer moved to West Germany in 1950 where he had a successful opera and concert career. He also appeared in a number of German films. His career was cut short when he died in the crash of [[Eastern Air Lines Flight 304]].

== Life ==
Spencer was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], the son of a steel worker. He took private vocal lessons while working as a gardener, and eventually caught the attention of the [[tenor]] [[Roland Hayes]] who helped him to get a scholarship at the [[Eastman School of Music]]. After graduating in 1938, Spencer tried to get a performing career going but met many obstacles due to racial prejudice in the United States.

In 1938 he sang in the [[Federal Music Project]] [[NBC Blue]] [[radio opera]] ''Gettysburg'', first from [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, then at the [[Hollywood Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ong7cYNL5HUC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;ots=JzfoViYfmp&amp;dq=allintext%3A%20%22Gettysburg%22%20opera%20kenneth%20spencer&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q=allintext:%20%22Gettysburg%22%20opera%20kenneth%20spencer&amp;f=false Kenneth J. Bindas on the Federal Music Project].&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1940 he was understudy for [[Paul Robeson]] in the short lived Broadway musical ''[[John Henry (musical)|John Henry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fandango.com/kennethspencer/biography/p67181 Biography at Fandango].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by his professional recital debut in 1941 at New York City's [[The Town Hall|Town Hall]].

During the early 1940s Spencer made his first major successes in California as a concert artist at the Hollywood Bowl and as a radio performer. This led to his being cast in significant parts in two [[MGM]] films in 1943, the musical film ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'' where he shared the screen with [[Ethel Waters]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Eddie "Rochester" Anderson]], and [[Louis Armstrong]], and the war movie ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]''. Spencer also sang the ballad in ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk in the Sun]]'' (1945). He returned to Broadway to portray Joe in the critically acclaimed 1946 revival of [[Jerome Kern|Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Show Boat]]'',&lt;ref name=ShowIBDB&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/show-boat-1760# ''Show Boat''] (1946 Broadway revival, Ziegfeld Theatre) at IBDB&lt;/ref&gt; in which he sang ''[[Ol' Man River]]''. The revival was highly successful, running almost exactly a year,&lt;ref name=ShowIBDB/&gt; remarkable at the time for a revival of a play or musical. This was the first American production of ''Show Boat'' to receive a full-fledged Broadway cast album,&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/album/show-boat-prism-mw0000391631 ''Show Boat''] (1946 revival cast album) track listing at allmusic.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI175PXqlwY "Ol' Man River"] sung by Kenneth Spencer (audio)&lt;/ref&gt; rather than just a studio cast recording (there had been a British cast album in 1928).{{efn|The ''Show Boat'' 1946 revival cast recording has two versions of "Ol' Man River" - one sung by Spencer (#4), the other by [[Paul Robeson]] (#13).&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;}}

In 1949 Spencer's life changed after performing in Europe for the first time at the International Music Festival in [[Nice]]. The European public responded with enthusiasm to his performance and he was soon getting offers to perform all over Europe. It was the first time that Spencer experienced a working environment and culture that was not hindered by racial prejudice. In 1950 he returned to Europe to sing in a number of radio broadcasts with the [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française]] and perform in several highly lauded concerts in Berlin, including performances with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]]. Spencer was so enamored with the German public and frustrated with the meager opportunities he found as a black artist in America that he moved his family to [[Wuppertal]], West [[Germany]] in late 1950.

Spencer spent the next 14 years in Germany performing in concerts, operas, and plays. He also appeared in a few German films. His ability to perform not only Spirituals and classical music, but also folk songs in their original languages (French, German, Italian, Russian, Hebrew) won him much popularity in France and post-war Germany. He made a number of recordings with [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] during the 1950s and 1960s which consisted of classical music, spirituals, and folk songs.

Spencer died in the crash of [[Eastern Air Lines Flight 304]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twKfXowAigIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Disaster in the Air | publisher=Associated University Presses | author=Haine, Edgar A. | year=2000 | pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane crashed into [[Lake Pontchartrain]] after leaving the [[New Orleans International Airport]] on 25 February 1964.

'''Khalaj''', also known as '''Arghu''', is classified as a divergent [[Turkic language]] spoken in western [[Iran]], despite having much Persian influence.

==ISO confusion==
''[[Ethnologue]]'' and [[ISO 639|ISO]] list an [[Iranian language]] "Khalaj" with the same population,&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|kjf|Khalaj (Iranian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''[[Glottolog]]'' states it does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|khal1270|Khalaj (Iranian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Khalaj speak their Turkic language and [[Persian language|Persian]], and the supposed Iranian language of the Khalaj is spurious.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
While initially thought to be closely related to [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], linguistic study, particularly that done by Gerhard Doerfer, led to the reclassification of Khalaj as a distinct non-[[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] branch of Turkic language.{{sfn|Kıral|2012|p=89}} Evidence for this includes the preservation of the vowel length contrasts of [[Proto-Turkic]] (PT),{{sfn|Cheung|Aydemir|2015|p=80}} word-initial *''h'', and the lack of the sound change *''d'' → ''y'' characteristic of Oghuz languages.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The preservative character of Khalaj can be seen by comparing the same words across different Turkic varieties; for example, in Khalaj, the word for "foot" is ''hadaq'', while the cognate word in nearby Oghuz languages is ''ayaq'' (compare [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''ayak''). Because of the preservation of these archaic features, some scholars have speculated that the Khalaj are the descendants of the Arghu Turks.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Some [[Turkish people|Turkish]] scholars{{who|date=August 2018}} consider Khalaj to be one of the "last examples" of [[Old Turkic]].&lt;ref name="halaçça"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/ESKI%20TURK%20DILI/mehmet_olmez_halaclar_ve_halacca.pdf |title=Mehmet Ölmez, Halaçlar ve Halaçça, Türk Halkları ve Dilleri: 2, s. 15-22. |access-date=2016-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818115100/http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/ESKI%20TURK%20DILI/mehmet_olmez_halaclar_ve_halacca.pdf |archive-date=2018-08-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical distribution==
Khalaj is spoken mainly in [[Markazi Province]] in [[Iran]]. Doerfer cites the number of speakers as approximately 17,000 in 1968; Ethnologue reports that the population of speakers grew to 42,107 by 2000.

===Dialects===
The main dialects of Khalaj are Northern and Southern. Within these dialect groupings, individual villages and groupings of speakers have distinct speech patterns.

Doerfer&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Doerfer|1971}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Doerfer|Tezcan|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that Khalaj retains three [[vowel length]]s postulated for Proto-Turkic: long (e.g. {{IPA|[q'''aː'''n]}} 'blood'), half-long (e.g. {{IPA|[b'''aˑ'''ʃ]}} 'head'), and short (e.g. {{IPA|[h'''a'''t]}} 'horse'). However, {{Harvcoltxt|Manaster Ramer|1995}} challenges both the interpretation that Khalaj features three vowel lengths and that Proto-Turkic had this three-way contrast. Some vowels of Proto-Turkic are realized as falling diphthongs, as in {{IPA|[quo̯l]}} ('arm').

==Grammar==

===Morphology===

====Nouns====
Nouns in Khalaj may receive a [[plural]] marker or [[Possession (linguistics)|possessive]] marker. [[Declension|Cases]] in Khalaj include [[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Locative case|locative]], [[Ablative case|ablative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], and [[Equative case|equative]].

Forms of case suffixes change based on vowel harmony and the consonants they follow. Case endings also interact with possessive suffixes. A table of  basic case endings is provided below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Case!!Suffix
|-
|Nominative|| -
|-
|Dative||-A, -KA
|-
|Accusative||-I, -NI
|-
|Locative||-čA
|-
|Ablative||-dA
|-
|Instrumental||-lAn, -lA, -nA
|-
|Equative||-vāra
|}

====Verbs====
Verbs in Khalaj are [[inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical voice|voice]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[negation]]. Verbs consist of long strings of [[morpheme]]s in the following array:

:'''Stem + Voice + Negation + Tense/Aspect + Agreement'''

===Syntax===
Khalaj employs [[subject–object–verb]] word order. [[Adjective]]s precede [[noun]]s.

==Vocabulary==
The core of Khalaj vocabulary is Turkic, but many words have been borrowed from [[Persian language|Persian]]. Words from neighboring Turkic dialects, namely, [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] have also made their way into Khalaj.

===Numbers===
Khalaj numbers are Turkic in form, but some speakers replace the forms for "80" and "90" with Persian terms:

*1 - {{IPA|[biː]}}
*2 - {{IPA|[æk.ki]}}
*3 - {{IPA|[yʃ]}}
*4 - {{IPA|[tœœɾt]}}

[[Canonization|Saint]] '''Leonardo Murialdo''' (26 October 1828 – 30 March 1900) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and the founder of the Congregation of Saint Joseph - also known as the Murialdines.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/32800|author=Daniele Bolognini|title=San Leonardo Murialdo|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=29 March 2007|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catholicsaints.info/saint-leonard-murialdo/|title=Saint Leonardo Murialdo|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=29 March 2015|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murialdo's call to the priesthood did not manifest until late in his education in [[Savona]]; he pursued his ecclesial studies and was [[ordained]] as such in 1851 before dedicating himself to social work alongside the poor and with adolescent men.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=AS&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://saintscatholic.blogspot.com.au/2014/03/saint-leonardo-murialdo.html|title=Saint Leonardo Murialdo|date=|publisher=All Saints &amp; Martyrs|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This put him into contact with social luminaries such as [[Saint Giovanni Bosco]] and [[Joseph Cafasso|Saint Giuseppe Cafasso]] who held Murialdo in great esteem.&lt;ref name=GA&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20100428.html|title=General Audience|date=28 April 2010|publisher=Holy See|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SU&gt;{{citeweb|date=11 February 2014|title=St. Leonard Murialdo|publisher=Salesians UK|accessdate=19 December 2017|url=http://www.salesians.org.uk/salesians/st-leonard-murialdo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His zeal for social concern saw his frequent calls for an end to worker exploitation and the granting of further rights to workers in factories.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Murialdo died in the [[Odor of sanctity|odor of holiness]] in 1900 and had a reputation for deep personal holiness. This became more prevalent in northern Italian cities where Murialdo and his religious order worked. The cause for his canonization opened under [[Pope Benedict XV]] in 1921 with [[Pope John XXIII]] later confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming Murialdo as [[Venerable]] in 1961. [[Pope Paul VI]] beatified Murialdo in late 1963 and later canonized him just under a decade later in 1970.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Life==
===Education===
Leonardo Murialdo was born on 26 October 1828 in [[Turin]] as the seventh of nine children to the [[upper middle-class]] Leonardo Franchino Murialdo (1776 or 1777-15.06.1833) and Teresa Rho (c. 1795-9.07.1849).&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; His father - a [[stockbroker]] - died in 1833 during his childhood. His nickname as a child was "Nadino". Before him six sisters were born before his birth and then the birth of his brother and sister; his siblings were (in order):
* Olimpia
* Aurelia
* Dionisia
* Emilia
* Clementine (died in her childhood)
* Domitillia
* Ernesto
* Delfina (1830-???)
Murialdo received his [[baptism]] on 27 October in the San Dalmazzo parish church.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

In 1836 both he and his brother Ernesto were sent to the [[Piarists|Piarist]] boarding school (Scolopian College) in [[Savona]] which he attended until 1843; the pair arrived via coach on 27 October in the evening after having departed Turin on 25 October.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; His initial education there lasted until 1838 while he began his high school education there from 1838 until 1843. He studied the humanities and grammar and two of his educators were the priests Atanasio Canata and Giovanni Solari.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SU/&gt; But he felt a deep personal crisis from 1842-43 due to his fellow pupils' poor behaviour and tendencies. He and his brother returned to Turin in September 1843 where he made his first Confession to the [[abbot]] Pullini. On 3 November 1843 he returned to Savona to begin a philosophical course but also chose ancient historical sciences to avoid bad companions that had forced his earlier departure from the school.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; In spring 1844 he listened to the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friar Vincenzo Oliva give a [[Lent|Lenten]] sermon about Hell which had a profound impact on Murialdo to the point where he decided to consecrate himself to [[God]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He decided he wanted to become a Capuchin in the spirit of detachment though the [[Canon (priest)|canon]] Lorenzo Renaldi - a close friend - dissuaded Murialdo and suggested he just become a diocesan priest instead.

Murialdo's confessor during his time in Savona was [[Marcantonio Durando|Blessed Marcantonio Durando]]; Durando would be the one leading him in a spiritual retreat in preparation for his [[ordination]].&lt;ref name=SU/&gt; He completed his philosophical course (which he commenced in 1843) on 6 November 1845 and was then vested in the [[cassock]] for the first time after the abbot Pullini blessed the cassock in the Santa Chiara church once Murialdo began his ecclesial studies. Murialdo later wrote that "he never had a thought" about becoming a priest.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; Upon his return to Turin he began his ecclesial studies in 1845 at [[University of Turin|the college]] (as an external cleric student) there.

He never believed he would become a priest and it was believed that his brother Ernesto would do so. In his childhood he wanted to pursue a career in the armed forces while in Savona entertaining notions of learning [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. During his philosophical course he set himself on becoming an [[Engineering|engineer]]. He began a theological course in Turin from 1845 to 1850 as an external clerical student and his two tutors during this time were the theologians Augusto Berta and Pietro Baricco.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; His academic course ended on 8 May 1850 and he received excellent results.

===Priesthood===
He received his ordination to the [[priesthood]] on 20 September 1851 in the Church of the Visitation from [[Monsignor]] Giovanni Domenico Ceretti; the latter also made Murialdo a subdeacon (21 September 1850) and a [[Diaconate|deacon]] (5 April 1851). He celebrated his first Mass at San Dalmazzo church with abbot Maximo Pullini and canon Lorenzo Renaldi co-celebrating alongside him.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Murialdo's first focus after his ordination was to work in the poor Vanchiglia neighbourhood close to the Oratorio dell'Angelo Custode which his cousin Roberto Murialdo managed. It was one of the first oratories in Turin to minister to poor and abandoned children on the fringes of living.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; From 1857 until 1865 he was - at the request of [[John Bosco|Saint Giovanni Bosco]] - the director for the Oratorio di San Luigi. Murialdo conferred and collaborated with Bosco as well as [[Joseph Cafasso|Saint Giuseppe Cafasso]].&lt;ref name=SU/&gt;

On 28 September 1865 he left Turin and went to the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]] church in [[Paris]] to further his theological studies in moral matters and to further himself in [[canon law]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; It was during this time that he attended a conference of the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul|Vincentians]] and later visited [[London]]. In Paris he wanted to become a [[Sulpician]] but the superior Henri Icard dissuaded him from this.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; Murialdo returned to Turin in October 1866 and was put in charge of the Artigianelli Boarding School where adolescent men were educated and taught a trade. In 1870 he became the director of the Oratorio di San Martino. In 1871 he organized the Union of Catholic Workers on behalf of the women and other people who worked in factories. In 1871 he also was among the promoters of the popular Catholic libraries. In 1858 he met [[Pope Pius IX]] in a private audience after Bosco wanted Murialdo to go with him to meet the pontiff.&lt;ref name=SU/&gt;&lt;ref name=GA/&gt;

In 1873 he established the Congregation of Saint Joseph in honor of [[Saint Joseph]] as a model for [[laborers]] and did this with the [[Venerable]] Eugenio Reffo as his collaborator in this venture.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He conferred with Father Icard and the theologian William Blengio to discuss hie dream while also conferring with the [[Bishop of Alba]] Eugenio Roberto Galletti and the [[Archbishop of Turin]] Alessandro Riccardi di Netro as well as his successor Lorenzo Gastaldi. The aim was to support apprentices and people in trades. He further founded an agricultural school in addition to a center for delinquents. In 1876 he founded the Association of the Good Press in 1876 to improve Italian journalism while - alongside the Venerable Pio Paolo Perazzo - founded the newspaper ''The Voice of the Worker'' which became the diocesan paper known as ''The Voice of the People''.

Murialdo contracted a grave illness in 1877 but his friend Bosco said that he would live for much longer and would not die from his illness. In 1878 he founded an agricultural centre in Rivoli and later in 1892 - in the spirit of [[Pope Leo XIII|Pope Leo XIII's]] ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' - wrote to the local council to denounce the exploitation of workers. He also presented a reform project including schooling until age fourteen and the abolition of [[Shift work|night work]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; His last surviving siblings Aurelia and Ernesto both died in 1890 causing Murialdo great grief since all his friends and relatives were deceased at this stage.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

===Declining health and death===
In 1885 he suffered serious [[bronchitis]] that lasted from 1 January until 17 February; Murialdo believed he would die during this time due to the seriousness of his illness. Bosco visited him and blessed him.&lt;ref name=SU/&gt;

Murialdo died on 30 March 1900 in Turin due to [[pneumonia]]; his final words were: "I'm waiting".&lt;ref name=SU/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; His remains were interred after his funeral but later transferred to the Santa Barbara church in Turin.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

==Sainthood==
The formal cause of canonization started under [[Pope Benedict XV]] on 23 November 1921 and conferred on him the title of [[Servant of God]]. The diocesan process for investigating Murialdo's life and reputation for holiness took place in Turin from 1910 until 1913 with his writings receiving theological approval on 13 December 1916; the [[Congregation for Rites]] validated this diocesan investigation on 2 March 1932. The work culminated in the declaration of his life of [[heroic virtue]] on 26 April 1961 when [[Pope John XXIII]] proclaimed him to be Venerable. [[Pope Paul VI]] beatified him on 3 November 1963 and later canonized him less than a decade later in 1970.

===General Audience===
On 28 April 2010 - during his General Audience - [[Pope Benedict XVI]] spoke about Murialdo on the occasion of the Year of Priests that the pontiff had convoked. He referred to Murialdo's "loving response to God" in doing His will as well as "his conviction of the merciful love of God". The pope continued that Murialdo possessed a keen and "serene awareness of his own limitations" from his own education to his priesthood and during his social apostolate which the pope referred to as "the tireless zeal of action".&lt;ref name=GA/&gt;

Benedict XVI concluded that Murialdo "abandoned himself with trust to Providence" which motivated his life and had a profound influence on his social apostolate in Turin.&lt;ref name=GA/&gt;

==Namesakes==
Murialdo has become the focus for several locations and organizations such as:
* The San Leonardo Murialdo parish located in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murialdomilano.it/ Parish of San Leonardo Murialdo, Milan]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Instituto Leonardo Murialdo located in Albano Lazio; the Murialdines manage it to provide an education to children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murialdoalbano.it/ Instituto Leonardo Murialdo, Albano Lazio]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Oratorio di San Leonardo Murialdo in Popesti Leordeni for adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://murialdo.ro/Oratoriul/CeesteOratoriul/tabid/92/language/ro-RO/Default.aspx "Ce este Oratoriul?", Fundatia Murialdo]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The San Leonardo Murialdo church on Via Salvatore Pincerle 144 in [[Rome]] was built in 1978 and consecrated a decade later in 1988.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">[[File:Newport Reading Room in Rhode Island.jpg|thumb|right|Reading Room, ca. 1910]]
The '''Newport Reading Room''' (also known as '''The Reading Room'''), founded in 1854, is a [[gentlemen's club]] located on [[Bellevue Avenue]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], [[United States|USA]]. Its primary building features an actual book [[Reference library|reading room]]. The Spouting Rock Beach Association, which owns the famed [[Bailey's Beach]], has been reported to own the building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,833860-2,00.html Time Article Recreation: Splendors at Home, July 2, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; However this claim, according to the club's leadership, is incorrect.

==History==
The Newport Reading Room was founded in 1854 by [[William Shepard Wetmore]], a wealthy China trade merchant, and several other notable Newporters, including Yankee traders and Southern planters who summered in Newport. Several of the managing stock holders were full-time Rhode Island residents while others were summer residents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kN0iAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Cleveland Armory, ''The last resorts''  (Greenwood Press, 1973)p. 247]&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, the [[Newport Casino]], a rival club nearby on Bellevue Avenue was started by a former Reading Room member, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., as described:

The Newport Reading Room incident concerns Bennett and one of his polo buddies, Captain Candy, better known as "Sugar Candy." A wager was concocted whereby Sugar Candy would mount his polo pony and ride up the short flight of stairs into the exclusive club located on Bellevue Avenue. Bennett was reprimanded, Sugar Candy supposedly shown the door for the last time. As the story goes (never proven), Bennett started the Newport Casino in response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redwoodlibrary.org/notables/bennett.htm redwood library website link to story] (accessed Oct. 8, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1081563/index.htm Sports Illustrated, Sept. 2, 1968] (accessed Oct. 8, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Reading Room has a long history of hosting charitable fundraisers, for example the ''New York Times'' reported on the club's 1912 baseball game against the U.S. Navy officers of the Atlantic Fleet to raise funds for Newport Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;BASEBALL AT NEWPORT.; Naval Officers to Play Reading Room Team for Charity.

The '''Nubian languages''' ({{lang-ar|لغات نوبية}}) are a group of related languages spoken by the [[Nubians]]. They form a branch of the [[Eastern Sudanic languages]], which is part of the wider [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan phylum]]. Initially, Nubian languages were spoken throughout much of [[Sudan]], but as a result of [[arabization]] they are today mostly limited to the [[Nile Valley#In Sudan|Nile Valley]] between [[Aswan]] (southern [[Egypt]]) and [[Al Dabbah]] as well as a few villages in the [[Nuba mountains]] and [[Darfur]].

==Languages==
[[File:Old Nubian manuscript.jpg|thumb|A page from an [[Old Nubian]] translation of the ''[[Investiture of the Archangel Michael]]'', from the 9th-10th century, found at [[Qasr Ibrim]], now at the [[British Museum]]. [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]'s name appears in red: Nubians during the period frequently used Greek personal names, often with a terminal ‑ⲓ added.]][[File:Marble stone with southern-Nubian inscription, Soba.jpg|thumb|Marble Monument found in Soba with an as yet undeciphered inscription in Alwan Nubian]]

Rilly (2010) distinguishes the following Nubian languages, spoken by in total about 900,000 speakers:
# [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]], the largest Nubian language with 545,000 speakers in [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], and the Nubian diaspora. Previously known by the geographic terms Mahas and Fadicca/Fiadicca. As late as 1863 this language, or a closely related dialect, was known to have been spoken by the [[arabization|arabized]] Nubian [[Shaigiya tribe]].{{sfn|Bechhaus-Gerst|1996|pp=25-26}}
# [[Kenzi language|Kenzi]] ([[endonym]]: Mattokki) with 100,000 speakers in [[Egypt]] and [[Dongolawi language|Dongolawi]] ([[endonym]]: Andaandi) with 180,000 speakers in [[Sudan]]. They are no longer considered a single language, but closely related. The split between Kenzi and Dongolawi is dated relatively recently to the 14th century.
# [[Midob language|Midob]] (Meidob) with 30,000 speakers. The language is spoken primarily in and around the Malha volcanic crater in North [[Darfur]].
# [[Birgid language|Birgid]], spoken north of [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]] around Menawashei until the 1970s. Was the predominant language between the corridor of Nyala and [[al-Fashir]] in the north and the [[Bahr al-Arab]] in the south as recent as 1860.{{sfn|Spaulding|2006|p=396}}  
# [[Hill Nubian languages|Kordofan Nubian]], a group of closely related dialects spoken in various villages in the northern [[Nuba Mountains]]; in particular by the [[Dilling language|Dilling]], [[Debri language|Debri]], and [[Kadaru language|Kadaru]].

An additional language, [[Haraza language|Haraza]], is known only from a few dozen words recalled by village elders in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Bell (1975) "[http://www.africabib.org/rec.php?RID=191308412&amp;DB=p Documentary Evidence on the Haraza Nubian Language]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{glotto|hara1258|Haraza Nubian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]] is preserved in at least a hundred pages of documents, comprising both texts of a [[Christianity|Christian]] religious nature and documentary texts dealing with state and legal affairs. Old Nubian was written with a slanted [[uncial]] variety of the [[Coptic alphabet]], with the addition of characters derived from [[Meroitic script|Meroitic]]. These documents range in date from the 8th to the 15th century AD. Old Nubian is currently considered ancestral to modern Nobiin, even though it shows signs of extensive contact with Dongolawi. Another, as yet undeciphered Nubian language has been preserved in a few inscriptions found in [[Soba (city)|Soba]], the capital of [[Alodia]]. Since their publication by Adolf Ermann in 1881, they are referred as 'Alwan inscriptions' or 'Alwan Nubian.'

Synchronic research on the Nubian languages began in the last decades of the nineteenth century, first focusing on the Nile Nubian languages Nobiin and Kenzi-Dongolawi. Several well-known Africanists have occupied themselves with Nubian, most notably [[Karl Richard Lepsius|Lepsius]] (1880), [[Leo Simon Reinisch|Reinisch]] (1879) and [[Carl Meinhof|Meinhof]] (1918); other early Nubian scholars include Almkvist and [[Heinrich Schäfer|Schäfer]]. Additionally, important [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative]] work on the Nubian languages has been carried out by [[Robin Thelwall|Thelwall]], Marianne Bechhaus-Gerst in the second half of the twentieth century and Claude Rilly and George Starostin in the twenty-first.

== Classification ==
Traditionally, the Nubian languages are divided into three branches: Northern (Nile), Western (Darfur), and Central. ''Ethnologue's'' classifies the Nubian languages as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/nubian|title=Nubian|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Northern (Nile)
** [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]]
* Western (Darfur)
** [[Midob language|Midob]]
* Central
** [[Kenzi language|Kenzi]]
** [[Birgid language|Birgid]]
** [[Dongolawi language|Dongolawi]]
** [[Hill Nubian languages|Hill (Kordofan)]]
*** Kadaru-Ghulfan
**** [[Ghulfan language|Ghulfan]]
**** [[Kadaru language|Kadaru]]
*** Unclassified
**** [[Dair language|Dair]]
**** [[Dilling language|Dilling]]
**** El [[El Hugeirat language|Hugeirat]]
**** [[Karko language (Sudan)|Karko]]
**** [[Wali language (Sudan)|Wali]]

Glottolog groups all non-Northern Nubian branches in a single group named West-Central Nubian. Additionally, within Hill Nubian, Glottolog places Dair in the same branch as Kadaru.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/kord1246|title=Glottolog 3.0 - Kordofan Nubian|last=|first=|date=|website=glottolog.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between Dongolawi and Nobiin remains a matter of debate within Nubian Studies. Ethnologue's classification is based on glotto-chronological research of Thelwall (1982) and Bechhaus-Gerst (1996), which considers Nobiin the earliest branching from Proto-Nubian. They attribute the current syntactical and phonological proximity between Nobiin and Dongolawi to extensive language contact. Arguing that there is no archeological evidence for a separate migration to the Nile of Dongolawi speakers, Rilly (2010) provides evidence that the difference in vocabulary between Nobiin and Dongolawi is mainly due to a pre-Nubian substrate underneath Nobiin, which he relates to the [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]]. Approaching the inherited proto-Nubian vocabulary in all Nubian languages systematically through a comparative linguistic approach, Rilly arrives at the following classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le méroïtique et sa famille linguistique|last=Rilly|first=Claude|publisher=Peeters|year=2010|isbn=978-90-429-2237-2|location=|pages=401|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Nile Nubian
** [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]]
** Kenzi-Dongolawi
*** [[Dongolawi language|Dongolawi]]
*** [[Kenzi language|Kenzi]]
* Western Nubian
** [[Birgid language|Birgid]]
** Midob-Kordofan
*** [[Midob language|Midob]]
*** [[Hill Nubian languages|Kordofan]]

==Orthography==
There are three currently active proposals for a Nubian alphabet: based on the [[Arabic script]], the [[Latin script]] and the [[Old Nubian language#Writing|Old Nubian alphabet]]. Since the 1950s, Latin has been used by four authors, Arabic by two and Old Nubian by three, in the publication of various books of proverbs, dictionaries, and textbooks. For Arabic, the extended [[ISESCO]] system{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} may be used to indicate vowels and consonants not found in the [[Arabic alphabet]] itself.

The Supreme God or Supreme Being in the [[Orisha#Pantheon|Yoruba pantheon]], Olorun, has three manifestations: '''[[Olodumare]]''', the [[Supreme Creator|Creator]]; '''Olorun''', ruler of the heavens; and '''[[Olofi]]''', who is the conduit between Orún ([[Heaven]]) and Ayé ([[Earth]]). Olorun rules the Orún and works through the Orishas, and thus reaching humans in the Ayé.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://beudeeful.com/orisha-olorun/|title=Yoruba Orishas: Olorun {{!}} beudeeful|date=2015-02-28|work=beudeeful|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vital energy of Olorun manifests in humans as Ashé, which is the life force that runs through all living things.

Olodumare carries the responsibility of coordinating the Universe by way of it, while Olofi is identified with Olofin [[Oduduwa]] (a different divine entity, born of Akamara) who brings existence to earth on orders from Olodumare.

Humans do not worship Olorun directly, there are no sacred areas of worship or ordained person. Olorun is outlying, distant and does not partake in human rituals. There are no shrines or sacrifices dedicated directly to him, although followers can send prayers in his direction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/726921148|title=God is not one : the eight rival religions that run the world|last=R.,|first=Prothero, Stephen|isbn=9780061571282|edition= First HarperCollins paperback |location=[New York, New York]|oclc=726921148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Yoruba [[Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s, meanwhile, the word '''Ọlọhun''' is also commonly used to denote their faith in God as The Almighty Divine, The Absolute Sovereign."

For Yoruba traditions there is no centralized authority, because of this and the way the traditions were spread through the slave trade to other areas of the world, there are many different ways that Yorubans can understand the idea of Olorun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Orisa-Ifá sidebar|Deities}}

== Etymology ==

From the [[Yoruba Language]]. A contraction of the words ''Olo'' (which denotes ownership or rulership) and ''Orun'' (which means the [[Heaven]]s, abode of the spirits).

The '''Red Nation''' ({{lang-naq|'''Khaiǁkhaun'''}}) is the main subtribe of the [[Nama people]] in [[Namibia]] and the oldest Nama group speaking [[Khoekhoegowab]], the language often called Damara/Nama.

The main settlement of the Red Nation is [[Hoachanas]], a small settlement in southern central Namibia, today part of the [[Hardap Region]].&lt;ref name="Republikein"/&gt;

==History==
===Pre–colonial period===

The word ''Khaiǁkhaun'' means "great defender" in Khoekhoe, from ǁkhau, "defend". There is no agreement as to where the name ''Red Nation'' originated from. [[Heinrich Vedder]] claims that the Khaiǁkhaun called themselves ǀAwa-khoi, "red people", whereas [[Klaus Dierks]] declares that the Europeans later nicknamed the tribe ''Red Nation''. In any case, the attribution is a reference to their slightly reddish face color.&lt;ref name="Republikein"&gt;{{cite news

|work=[[Die Republikein]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vedder|1997|pp=126f}}

The first [[Tribal chief|Kaptein]] of the Khaiǁkhaun was ǂHâb who unified most of the Nama clans at the end of the 17th century. After ǂHâb's death in 1710 the [[ǁKhauǀgoan]] (Swartbooi Nama) and the [[ǂKharoǃoan]] (Keetmanshoop Nama) were the first Nama groups to leave the union&lt;ref name="KDHeroesday"&gt;{{cite web

With [[Manasse ǃNoreseb]]{{'s}} ascent to chieftaincy in 1880, hostilities started between the Red Nation and other Nama clans. [[Hendrik Witbooi (Namaqua chief)|Hendrik Witbooi]], leader of the [[ǀKhowesin]] (Witbooi Nama) was an archenemy of Manasse. His superiority in power forced the Red Nation into alliances with other Nama factions such as the [[ǁOgain]] (Groot Doden) and the [[ǀHaiǀkhauan]] (Berseba Orlam), but also the [[Ovaherero]], and later the [[German Empire|Imperial]] colonial administration of [[German South-West Africa]].&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;{{cite news

Witbooi attacked Hoachanas several times and broke the resistance of the Khaiǁkhaun. He installed a rival chief, ǃHoeb ǁOasemab ([[Fritz Lazarus ǁOaseb]]) and confiscated the land of the Red Nation. The German protection treaty did not help, the Germans never had the intention to help single parties within the same tribe. [[Heinrich Vedder]] opined that Witbooi's plan was to defeat the Nama tribes one by one, lease the land back to them after he conquered it, and gain the position of a Nama Paramount Chief in the process.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|pp=645–647}}

===German colonial period===
When the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|Herero and Nama War]] broke out in which the Germans attacked the indigenous Herero and Nama in [[German South-West Africa]], Manasse ǃNoreseb and Hendrik Witbooi ceased their hostilities and fought together against the ''[[Schutztruppe]]'' ("protection force", the units deployed to the German colonies). The Red Nation under Manasse, with only 100 armed men, took over the defense of the central eastern area of [[Aranos]], [[Leonardville, Namibia|Leonardville]], [[Aminuis]], and Hoachanas.&lt;ref name="NE"/&gt;

The German Empire's ''Schutztruppe'' defeated both the Nama and the Herero during this war. Manasse ǃNoreseb and Hendrik Witbooi died in 1905, survivors were detained in [[concentration camp]]s, much the same way as the British had set up camps for forced labour in their [[Union of South Africa|colony of South Africa]] during the [[Anglo-Boer War]] of 1899–1902. Thousands of people, including women and children, died in these concentration camps from illness, neglect, and malnutrition,&lt;ref name=KDW/&gt; leading to a [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|genocide of the Herero and Nama peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Olusoga|Olusoga, David]] and Erichsen, Casper W (2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5732">The '''Santa Monica Track Club''' was formed in 1972 by Joe Douglas as a post-collegiate track club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flotrack.org/videos/coverage/view_video/234884-2009-outdoor-season-on-flotrack/186994-joe-douglas-founder-of-santa-monica-track-club FloTrack interview&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1980s, the team came to be a major player in worldwide [[Track and field athletics|Track and Field]] competition, with team members setting numerous World and National records.  The membership list reads like a ''[[Who's Who]]'' of Olympic athletes and the SMTC logo became a recognizable icon on the uniforms of those elite athletes.

==History==
In its first year of existence, [[Puerto Rico at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympian]] from [[Puerto Rico]], Willie Rios joined the club and qualified to run in the [[1972 Summer Olympics]].  In 1974, member Reid Harter set the first [http://www.usatf.org/statistics/records/view.asp?division=american&amp;location=road&amp;age=open&amp;sport=LDR American Record] in the road 30 Kilometre run.  By 1976, three team members qualified for the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santamonicatrackclub.org/about-us.html Santa Monica Track Club&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, a young [[Carl Lewis]], then known as a top level High School long jumper, joined the club for competitions beyond his collegiate career at the [[University of Houston]].  Lewis went on to be the dominant force in sprinting and long jump for the next decade.  Coached in the off season by his collegiate coach [[Tom Tellez]], other elite sprinters were attracted to the club, including [[Carol Lewis]], Carl's sister and University of Houston teammates [[Joe DeLoach]], [[Leroy Burrell]] and [[Kirk Baptiste]].  The club developed an impressive record of Olympic and World Championships, limited in many situations because teammates were the closest competition at the highest level.  Lewis and Burrell exchanged the prestigious World Record in the [[100 metres]] four times.

Four members of the club, [[Michael Marsh (athlete)|Michael Marsh]], [[Leroy Burrell]], [[Floyd Heard]] and [[Carl Lewis]], representing the Santa Monica Track Club tied the [[Men's 4 × 100 metres relay world record progression#Records since 1977|world record in the 4x100 meters relay]] at the [[Herculis]] meet in [[Monaco]].  The record lasted for four days until it was surpassed by a team representing the USA that consisted of three of the SMTC members, with [[Dennis Mitchell]] replacing Heard.  The same four members set the World Record in the 4 x 200 metre relay, set at the [[Mt. SAC Relays]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/toplists/inout=O/age=n/season=0/sex=M/all=y/legal=A/disc=4X2/detail.html IAAF 4 x 200 Relay list&lt;/ref&gt;  That record lasted over 20 years until it was surpassed by .05 by a team from Jamaica at the [[2014 IAAF World Relays – Men's 4 × 200 metres relay|2014 IAAF World Relays]].   Also [[Kevin Young (athlete)|Kevin Young]]'s World Record in the [[400 metre hurdles]] set in winning the [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] still stands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/toplists/inout=o/age=n/season=0/sex=M/all=y/legal=A/disc=400H/detail.html IAAF 400 metre hurdles list&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was elected into the [[Mt. SAC Relays]] Hall of Fame in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtsacrelays.com/fame.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The club is funded through the Santa Monica Track Club Foundation, founded by [[Ed Stotsenberg]] (who had the personalized license plate SMTC 1), an early [[Masters athletics|Masters]] runner who joined the club in the mid-1970s and became its president.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?board=1&amp;thread=1500001&amp;id=1504182 Lets Run&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santamonicatrackclub.com/main_foundation.htm  Santa Monica Track Club&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Short-term business statistics''' (STS) are [[economic statistics]] published by [[Eurostat]], the [[European Commission]]'s statistical office. They cover each of the [[member states of the European Union]], and provide aggregated results for the euro area and the EU.
Short-term business statistics provide information on the economic development of four major domains: industry, construction, retail trade, and other services. These domains are defined in relation to a classification of economic activities, the NACE Rev.2 ([[Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community]], second revision).

For the four domains the following variables are reported (most on a monthly, some on a quarterly basis):

* Industry: Production, turnover (domestic and non-domestic), new orders (domestic and non-domestic), number of persons employed, hours worked, gross wages and salaries, output prices (domestic and non-domestic), import prices.
* Construction: Production (total, of buildings and of civil engineering), number of persons employed, hours worked, gross wages and salaries, construction costs (material costs, wage costs), construction permits.
* Retail trade and repair: Turnover, retail trade volume, number of persons employed.
* Other services: Turnover, number of persons employed, output prices.

There is a small community of '''Singaporeans in Canada''', consisting largely of expatriate professionals and immigrants from [[Singapore]] and their families as well as [[international students]] and [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizens of [[Singaporean]] descent.

==Migration history==
During the 1970s, arrivals to Canada from Singapore numbered less than 100 per year while in the following decade, immigrants born in Singapore averaged between 200 and 400. In the years 1989–91, arrivals from Singapore approached 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/m3/2 : Multicultural Canada - Malaysians-Singaporeans/Migration and Settlement] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712190848/http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/m3/2 |date=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Singaporeans are employed by Canadian companies or in the public sector, including universities. They also figure prominently among medical doctors, accountants, engineers, and architects. Approximately one-third are self-employed and have entered Canada under that category or as entrepreneurs. Most of their businesses are urban-based and often have a highly technical focus, such as computers or chemical and engineering products. Most Singaporeans in Canada tend to retain their citizenship in anticipation of possible return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/m3/3 : Multicultural Canada - Malaysians-Singaporeans/Economic Life] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713080511/http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/m3/3 |date=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1987 and 1991, some 1,500 to 1,800 Singaporean students were living in Canada.

==Notable Singaporeans in Canada==
* [[Chloe Ing]], figure skater
* [[Thea Lim]], writer
* [[Devan Nair]], former [[President of Singapore]]
* [[Jonathan Seet]], Canadian singer-songwriter
* [[Goh Poh Seng]], Singaporean dramatist, novelist and poet
* [[Steph Song]], actress

'''Social rank theory''' provides an evolutionary [[paradigm]] that locates affiliative and ranking structures at the core of many psychological disorders. In this context, displays of submission signal to dominant individuals that subordinate group members are not a threat to their rank within the [[Social stratification|social hierarchy]]. This helps to achieve [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]]. According to social rank theory, anxiety and depression are natural experiences that are common to all mammalian species, and it is the pathological exaggeration of anxiety and depression that contributes to psychological disorders.

== Social rank in group living ==
Three hundred million years ago [[proto-mammals]] individually competed for resources such as food, territory, and sexual partners. Over time, some species began to live in groups, which brought the evolutionary advantages of increased protection from predators and adversaries, increased access to resources, and better reproductive success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aL40CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR6&amp;lpg=PR6&amp;dq=ISBN:+978-1-138-82463-8+(pbk)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pRuHHU5cYi&amp;sig=pe4Up-JqkX0iyD9XGdQQuH033FA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE15zXrO7aAhVniVQKHbWiDRkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ISBN%3A%20978-1-138-82463-8%20(pbk)&amp;f=false|title=Evolutionary psychiatry: a new beginning|last=Stevens|first=Anthony; Price, John|publisher=Routledge|others=|year=2016|isbn=9781138824638|edition=Classic|location=New York|pages=|oclc=935679992}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the adoption of group living emerged two psychological systems which functioned to preserve the new social order: a social rank system and a safety system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=P.|last2=Cheung|first2=M.

Upon adopting group living practices, competition between individuals shifted from struggles for territory to social rank, as dominant individuals have better access to limited resources than their subordinates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tse|first=Wai S.|last2=Wu|first2=Jayne|last3=Poon|first3=Kai-Chung|date=2011-05|title=Motivation for achievement as perceived resource value in social rank theory of depression: A structural equation modeling analysis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0191886911000250|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=50|issue=7|pages=1034–1038|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.01.019|issn=0191-8869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant positions can also equate to high status as well as the authority to administer punishments and rewards within the group.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weisman|first=Ora|last2=Aderka|first2=Idan M.|last3=Marom|first3=Sofi|last4=Hermesh|first4=Haggai|last5=Gilboa-Schechtman|first5=Eva|date=2011-06|title=Social rank and affiliation in social anxiety disorder|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005796711000829|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|volume=49|issue=6-7|pages=399–405|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2011.03.010|issn=0005-7967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranking benefits the group through the implementation of a social framework that lowers the overall energy expenditure of the group where conspecifics are competing for the same resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2614371|title=Sociobiology and behavior|last=P.|first=Barash, David|date=1977|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0444990291|location=New York|oclc=2614371}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the acknowledgement of differences in rank curbs aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/852790506|title=Primate Social Systems|last=M.|first=Dunbar, Robin I.|date=1988|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781468466966|location=Boston, MA|oclc=852790506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranking also functions as a channel through which social control and resources are allocated. Thus, the purpose of the social rank system is to remain attuned the social hierarchy to better compete for rank, and consequently expand resource acquisition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Conversely, the safety system views the social world not as a competitive space, but instead as a cooperative space where others may extend reassurances and assistance. Thus, the safety system searches for opportunities to cooperate and connect with potential allies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Evaluations of sameness and difference are crucial to making [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group/out-group]] distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12237533|title=Social Psychology|last=Brown|first=Roger|date=|publisher=Free Press|year=1986|isbn=9780029083000|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=|oclc=12237533}}&lt;/ref&gt; One’s level of belonging within the group is often based on the ability to conform to group mores and standards and has been found to be a predictor of group acceptance, popularity, and rank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Jack C.|last2=Giammarino|first2=Mary|last3=Parad|first3=Harry W.|date=1986|title=Social status in small groups: Individualgroup similarity and the social "misfit."|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.3.523|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=50|issue=3|pages=523–536|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.3.523|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the ingroup/outgroup distinctions may have emerged from kin selection, as hunter-gatherer groups were often genetically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociobiology and Mental Disorder: A New View|last=Wenegrat|first=B.|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1984|isbn=|location=California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within humans, the sense of group belonging has evolved to become fundamental to physical and mental health and security, having important implications for self-esteem and self-identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Depression-Evolution-Powerlessness-Routledge-Editions/dp/1138953156|title=Depression: the evolution of powerlessness|last=Gilbert|first=Paul|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=1317189426|location=New York|pages=|oclc=956521476}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abrams|first=D.|last2=Wetherell|first2=M.|last3=Cochrane|first3=S.|last4=Hogg|first4=M.

== Social ranking behavior ==
Studies demonstrate that primates adhere two main forms of group living characterized by opposing interactional styles: agonic and hedonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/911386423|title=Social fabrics of the mind|last=Chance|first=Michael R.A.|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Ltd.|others=|year=1988|isbn=|location=Hove|pages=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agonic mode of interaction is typical of hierarchical societies, in which group members concentrate on defending against threats to status. Agonic behavior is focused around aggression as well as the inhibition of aggression, often through either submission or appeasement. On the other hand, the hedonic mode of interaction is characteristic of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian societies]], where cooperative and affiliative behavior is common. Hedonic behavior is more affectional and is distinguished by reassurance and reconciliation. Both modes of interaction can be found in all societies, to varying degrees.

=== Agonistic interactions ===

==== Ritualistic agonistic behavior ====
Agonistic competition spans back as far as 300 million years, and thus is deeply ingrained into the genome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Extensive observational evidence of reptiles and birds reveal that when they compete for breeding territory, individuals engage in a specific manner of interactional display, known as ritualistic agonistic behavior (RAB).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Opponents confront one another and display various power signals which may include standing tall, maintaining eye contact, or puffing themselves up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Foundations of Ethology|last=Lorenz|first=Konrad|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1981|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacLean|first=P. D.|date=1977|title=The triune brain in conflict|journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics|volume=28|issue=1-4|pages=207–220|doi=10.1159/000287065|issn=0033-3190|pmid=416456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacLean|first=P. D.|date=April 1985|title=Brain evolution relating to family, play, and the separation call|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=42|issue=4|pages=405–417|issn=0003-990X|pmid=3977559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Behavioural Biology of Aggression|last=Archer|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of behavior can also be found in humans, especially in the context of a physical contest.

RAB functions as a means of evaluating the strength, fighting capability, and resource holding potential (RHP) of one’s opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=G. A.|date=September 1974|title=Assessment strategy and the evolution of fighting behaviour|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=47|issue=1|pages=223–243|issn=0022-5193|pmid=4477626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behavioral Ecology: An Evolutionary Approach|last=Parker|first=G.A.|publisher=Blackwell|year=1984|isbn=|editor-last=Krebs|editor-first=John R.|location=Oxford|pages=|chapter=Evolutionary Strategies|editor-last2=Davies|editor-first2=Nick B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one determines that their own RHP is inferior to that of their adversary and will likely lose the altercation, they may take flight and escape unscathed. On the other hand, if one determines that their own RHP is stronger than that of their opponent, they are free to initiate the altercation. Thus, an accurate internal evaluative algorithm is crucial not only for evading or prolonging potentially fatal fights, but also for provoking winning situations which may improve one’s social rank.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Involuntary subordinate strategy ====
After assessing one’s opponent, territorial species usually react with either a flight or flight response. However, in a "blocked escape" scenario, where territory is limited or escape is impossible, this pattern diverges.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Upon losing dominance, defeated individuals undergo a change in physical demeanor known as the yielding subroutine of RAB or the involuntary subordinate strategy (ISS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=John S.|last2=Sloman|first2=Leon|date=|title=Depression as yielding behaviour: an animal model based upon Schjelderup-Ebbe’s pecking order|url=|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=8|pages=85s–98s|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=J.|last2=Sloman|first2=L.|last3=Gardner|first3=R.|last4=Gilbert|first4=P.|last5=Rohde|first5=P.|date=March 1994|title=The social competition hypothesis of depression|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=164|issue=3|pages=309–315|issn=0007-1250|pmid=8199784}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an early study of farmyard fowls found that despite an absence of physical injury, defeated birds seemed to be paralyzed. Furthermore, with their wings and head lowered to the ground, the birds seemed to experience depressive mood. Similarly, another study demonstrated that defeated lizards lost their characteristic bright colors, then died shortly after.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Given the proximity to and dependency on conspecifics, group-living animals are perpetually faced with blocked escape scenarios, as a flight response to in-group confrontation would result in both diminished breeding chances as well as heightened threat of predation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

ISS impedes the capability of the subordinate individual to attempt a comeback and signals to their opponent that they are not longer a threat. Thus, ISS is adaptive in that it ensures that when the subordinate individual goes down, they stay down. Meanwhile, it also indicates to the dominant individual that their opponent has truly yielded, so altercation need not continue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Submissive behaviors ====
Among group-living species, regular fighting is prevented through the inhibition and control of RAB. Within these groups, subordinates are largely responsible for acknowledging dominant individuals through overt acts of submission. Individuals who believe themselves to be in a subordinate role must be able to prevent the provocation of an attack by a dominant conspecific, or, if an attack is elicited, swiftly terminate the attack. Subordinate individuals are able to accomplish this through submissive involuntary body language, which can include screaming, sideways glances, the fear grin, lowering the eyes, crouching to appear smaller, etc.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Another avenue through which subordinates communicate their submission is through the mobilization of internal inhibition. Like the submissive postures and gestures listed above, internal inhibition is involuntary. This inhibitory process is characterized by the suppression of exploratory behavior and an inability to take initiative, both of which may be the consequences of attempts to avoid the aggressive attention of dominant individuals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Internal inhibition stimulates high states of arousal, and thus, increased levels of tension in subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/852792281|title=Stress, Health, and the Social Environment : a Sociobiologic Approach to Medicine|last=J.P.|first=Henry|last2=Stephens|first2=P.M.|date=|publisher=Springer Verlag|others=|year=1977|isbn=9781461263654|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=852792281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sapolsky|first=R. M.|date=November 1989|title=Hypercortisolism among socially subordinate wild baboons originates at the CNS level|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=46|issue=11|pages=1047–1051|issn=0003-990X|pmid=2554841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal inhibition can also lead to the loss of energy, depressed mood, retarded movements, reduced information processing capacity, sleep disturbance, poor appetite, loss of confidence, all of which are characteristic of depression. In submitting to dominant individuals and constraining their own reproductive and resource seeking behaviors, subordinates regulate levels of aggression within the group.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is in this context that external and internal inhibitive behaviors are adaptive.

=== Hedonistic interactions ===
Within the last ten million years, hedonistic forms of social competition have emerged. In hedonistic interactions individuals actively attract conspecifics in order to elevate social status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Status is achieved through the demonstration of constructive qualities such as beauty, intelligence, talents, and special abilities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Social approval of these qualities raises self-esteem, while disapproval can result in lowered self-esteem, loss of status, and reduced attractiveness to potential mates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, with the knowledge that one is valued by conspecifics signals reassurance and orients individuals towards affiliation as opposed to agonistic interactions. Hedonistic interactions are also characterized by the formation of alliances and coalitions, which offer another avenue through which to improve status. In building networks of alliances, individuals dedicate a lot of effort towards ensuring that one’s self-presentation properly conforms to group mores and standards. As a result, a great deal of social life entails the seeking group approval which acts to both confirm rank and impart a sense of belonging.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Mate selection ====
Social dominance by means of attractiveness has been shown to be essential in determining reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power, Dominance and Nonverbal Behavior|last=Shively|first=Carol|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1985|isbn=|editor-last=Ellyson|editor-first=Steve L.|location=New York|pages=|chapter=The Evolution of Dominance Hierarchies in Nonhuman Primates|editor-last2=Dovidio|editor-first2=John F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Evolution|last=Trivers|first=Robert|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|year=1985|isbn=|location=California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Evolution: An Introduction for the Behavioural Sciences|last=Richards|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year=1987|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Primate Social Systems|last=Dunbar|first=Robin Ian MacDonald|publisher=Croom Helm|year=1988|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it is not strength and aggression, but attractiveness that forms the basis of human mate selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|date=|title=Sex differences in human mate preference: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures|url=|journal=Brain and Behavioral Sciences|volume=12|pages=1–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human females tend to be drawn towards mates who are able to protect and invest in children. Thus, for women, attractiveness is associated with status. On the other hand, human males are often drawn towards biologically health mates which is manifested by natural beauty and youth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Social investment ====
The dominance hierarchy is also an attention hierarchy in that well integrated individuals evoke and secure higher levels of positive social attention than less integrated individuals. Not only does positive attention lower defensive arousal, but positive attention from higher ranking individuals heightens mood. Social attention also functions as a means through which individuals can elicit investment from others. Conspecifics may be coaxed into investing in socially attractive individuals, who can then access more resources, form more alliances, secure mates, and affirm group membership.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The measure of one’s ability to secure attention and elicit investment is known as social attention holding potential (SAHP). With elevated social status, leadership roles, and access to more resources, those with high SAHP benefit from increased evolutionary fitness. On the other hand, individuals with low levels of SAHP tend to display the submissive behaviors characteristic of ISS such as inhibition, withdrawal, and lack of confidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Estimates of rank and social attractiveness can be internalized. These internal estimates have implications for one’s biological state. For instance, depressive brain state patterns may reflect either a primitive defeat-like state which involves loss of feeling and social withdrawal; or a more submissive pattern with various efforts to elicit investment from others; or some combination of the two.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Psychological application ==
Social rank theory predicts that success within agonistic and hedonistic interactions can have the following effects on human [[psychopathology]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''The Resurrection of Hungary: A Parallel for Ireland''''' was a book published by [[Arthur Griffith]] in 1904 in which he outlined his ideas for an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[dual monarchy]]. He proposed that the former kingdoms which had created the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801, namely, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], return to the pre-1801 arrangement whereby they had two governments but a shared king. The policy, which was modelled on [[Hungary]]'s achievement of equal status with [[Austria]] under the [[Habsburg]] emperor/king, became the basis for the policy of Griffith's new [[Sinn Féin]] party. He proposed a dual monarchy, similar to the equivalent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, formed under the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Compromise of 1867]].

Griffith summed up his ideas in the book by comparing the relative status of Hungary vis-à-vis Austria and Ireland vis-à-vis Great Britain:

{{quote|The Hungarians resorted to a manly policy of [[Passive Resistance (Hungary)|passive resistance]] and non-recognition of Austria’s right to rule – the Irish resorted to parliamentarianism, implying recognition of an English right to rule this country. And one nation today is rich, powerful and able to defy her conqueror, while the other is poor, weak and more tightly held in the conqueror’s grasp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=462&amp;docID=2373 Griffith's book] quoted by [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He advocated a policy of [[abstentionism]] from the institutions of the United Kingdom and a return to the ''[[Constitution of 1782]]'' agreed between the British government and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] in 1782.

Griffith called his new party, Sinn Féin, a "King, Lords and Commons Party".&lt;ref&gt;[[ibid]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anglo-Irish Empire'' idea, though strongly associated with Griffith, was not uniquely his creation. As early as the mid-1880s Lord Salisbury, leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had contemplated using the 1867 Austro-Hungarian example as a model for a reformed relationship between Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishdemocrat.co.uk/reviews/griffiths-legacy/ Peter Berresford Ellis in ''The Irish Democrat'' in 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917 the party while maintaining its commitment to abstentionism, abandoned Griffith's proposal for having the British monarch on the Irish throne as [[King of Ireland]]. Instead it was split between republicans (those associated with the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 and who had subsequently joined Sinn Féin) who advocated the creation of a new republic with an elected head of state, and those who advocated the creation of an Irish monarchy, albeit now with a monarch chosen from any [[royal house]] but the [[House of Windsor]].

The concept was ridiculed by the nationalist commentator DP Moran, who called its supporters the "Green Hungarian Band".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=Joseph|title=Our Joyce: From Outcast to Icon|date=1998|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=45|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=Zn-r5DEF_68C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=%22green+hungarian+band%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TUtxPddsvI&amp;sig=EYapbLLZWicT0TOj9GLU_hMYX54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K7pMVZnqCcKtsgHmz4GIDg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22green%20hungarian%20band%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917 the party's ''[[Ard Fheis]]'' adopted a motion committing the party to establishing a republic before holding a referendum on whether to install a monarchy or not, once the monarch chosen was not from the House of Windsor.&lt;ref&gt;Ard Fheis, October 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; The party later committed itself unambiguously to supporting a republic.

Given its introduction of the concept of abstentionism, and its formative role in the appearance of Sinn Féin, ''The Resurrection of Hungary'' was one of the most influential texts in 20th-century Irish history.

'''Turks in Belgium''' or '''Belgian Turks''' refers to [[Turkish people]] who have immigrated to [[Belgium]]. However, the term may also refer to Belgian-born persons who have Turkish parents or who have a Turkish ancestral background.

== History ==

[[Turkish people|Turkish]] migration to [[Belgium]] began in the 1960s when Belgium was actively encouraging immigration to meet its employment needs in an era of rapid economic expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzmaurice|1996|loc=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These immigrants were welcomed as "[[guest workers]]" when [[Turkey]] signed a bilateral agreement with Belgium in July 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kasaba|2008|loc=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|1995|loc=279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As mainly unskilled labourers, Turkish immigrants hoped to make a fortune in a short time and then return to Turkey. The majority of Turkish migrants arrived from the rural regions of [[Central Anatolia Region|central Anatolian provinces]], particularly from [[Afyon]], [[Eskisehir]] and [[Kayseri]].&lt;ref name="Wets 2006 loc=93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wets|2006|loc=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in the industrialised areas and later brought families when Belgium attempted to resolve the growing problem of low population by encouraging family reunions.&lt;ref name="Moutsou 2006 loc=123"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moutsou|2006|loc=123}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s the phenomenon of immigrants arriving in Belgium with a [[tourist visa]] started; most came from [[Afyon]], especially from the town of [[Emirdağ]].&lt;ref name="Gailly 1997 loc=147"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gailly|1997|loc=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akgündüz|2008|loc=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival they looked for work and tried to legalise their status as labourers. The presence of these tourists created a [[black market]] labour force so that on two occasions the government had to legalise their status. Once they obtained the status of "guest workers" they could bring in their family.&lt;ref name="Gailly 1997 loc=148"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gailly|1997|loc=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, immigration to Belgium for economic reasons was forbidden by law. The only legal way to take up residence in Belgium was by [[family reunification]], which was only applicable to members of the [[nuclear family]] of guest workers or by marrying someone who was a [[Belgian nationality law|Belgian citizen]]. Another possible motive for coming to Belgium was to apply for the status of [[asylum-seeker]] upon arrival. Turkish asylum seekers came from all over Turkey, with some belonging to minority groups in the country (such as [[Kurds]]). However, other asylum seekers included ethnic Turks from [[Eastern Europe]] (such as [[Bulgarian Turks]] and [[Macedonian Turks]]).&lt;ref name="Gailly 1997 loc=148"/&gt;

Since the entry of [[Bulgaria]] into the European Union, thousands of [[Bulgarian Turks]], among whom many were already working in Belgium as undocumented foreigners, have established themselves under the status of independent workers, i.e. officially minor associates in small firms, mostly in the building and cleaning sector. They've brought with them their spouses and children, thus beginning to make Belgium their new home, some children are indeed born in Belgium, even when their parents were or are still undocumented. There were officially 1,957 Bulgarian-born persons living in Belgium in 2001, 4,807 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Migrations et populations issues de l'immigration en Belgique - Rapport statistique et démographique 2008|editor=Schoonvaere, Quentin|publisher=Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism|year=2009|url=http://www.diversite.be/diversiteit/files/File/studies/2009/migratie/Rapport_demographie_2008_-_complet.pdf|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The census of 1970 counted 21,000 Turks; in the part-census of 1977 this figure had risen to 60,000. For the next few years, family reunifications continued to raise the totals and by 1981 there were 64,000 Turks. Although this growth was slowing down, it did continue to grow to 72,000 Turks by 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nielsen|2004|loc=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996, there were 81,744 Turks in Belgium, 26% of whom lived in [[Brussels]] and 50% in [[Flanders]]-particularly in [[Antwerp]] and [[Ghent]].&lt;ref name="Moutsou 2006 loc=123"/&gt; In 1993, some 88,269 people with Turkish nationality were registered in Belgium, however by 1999, this dropped to 70,701 Turkish nationals because a substantial part of the population adopted the Belgian nationality.&lt;ref name="Timmerman 2004 loc=144"&gt;{{Harvnb|Timmerman|2004|loc=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turks still continue to migrate to Belgium in the hope of building a better future; many lured by social and economic security.&lt;ref name="Timmerman &amp; Van der Heyden 2005 loc=94"&gt;{{Harvnb|Timmerman|Van der Heyden|2005|loc=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Turks living in Belgium originate from the region of [[Emirdağ]] although there are also many Turks from [[Sivas]] who found their way to Belgium.&lt;ref name="Timmerman &amp; Van der Heyden 2005 loc=91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Timmerman|Van der Heyden|2005|loc=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 49.8% live in the [[Flemish region]], 25.2% in [[Wallonia]], and 25% in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blommaert|Verschueren|1998|loc=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turks from the same region in Turkey also tend to congregate not only in the same cities but also in the same quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gailly|1997|loc=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Turks live in the [[Schaarbeek]] commune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|State|2004|loc=279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chaussee De Haecht street is heavily populated with Turkish immigrants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Koutroubas|Vloeberghs|Yanasmayan|2009|loc=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its pizzerias, pastry shops, cafes, and barbers, is reminiscent of a Turkish street. According to the Turkish Consulate in [[Antwerp]], the number of Turks there is about 75,000, and there are 115 Turkish associations just in Antwerp. There are an addition 82 Turkish associations in [[Brussels]].

== Religion ==
{{see also|Religion in Belgium|Islam in Belgium}}

The majority of Turks are Sunni [[Muslims]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levinson|1998|loc=13-14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Turkish Sunni groupings are active in Belgium, most notably [[Milli Görüş]] (''Fédération islamique belge''), the [[Süleyman Hilmi Tunahan|Süleymancis]] (''Union des Centres culturels islamiques de Belgique'') and the [[Said Nursî|Nurcus]] . As in other countries, there is also an official Sunni [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|Diyanet]] (''Fondation religieuse islamique turque de Belgique''), which controls most mosques and a majority of the affiliations to the repatriation funerary insurance.

Another Turkish Muslim community present in Belgium is the [[Alevism|Alevi]] one, with several associations in Brussels, the ''Centre culturel turc pour le respect de la personne humaine - Erenler'' (Turkish cultural centre for the respect of the human being - Erenler), officially registered in 1994, founded by Alevis from the village of Karacalar, near Emirdag, led by their traditional spirituel leader (''dede'') from the Şahbaz family, and the more progressive ''Centre socioculturel alévi de Bruxelles'', officially registered in 2003 by 14 founding members, 4 of whom were born in [[Elbistan]], 3 in Belgium, 2 in [[:tr:Gücük, Elbistan|Gücük]] (near Elbistan), the rest in [[Adıyaman]], Inis, [[Tunceli]], [[Soğucak]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Sün|tr|3=Sünköy, Elazığ}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=November 13, 2003|title=Centre socioculturel alévi de Bruxelles|journal=[[Belgian Official Journal|Moniteur belge]]|publisher=Kingdom of Belgium|location=Brussels|language=French|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv_pdf/2003/11/13/03119240.pdf|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charleroi]] (''Centre culturel alévi de Charleroi'', officially registered in 1999 by 9 founding members, 6 of whom had the dual Turkish-Belgian citizenship),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=January 21, 1999|title=Centre culturel alévi de Charleroi|journal=[[Belgian Official Journal|Moniteur belge]]|publisher=Kingdom of Belgium|location=Brussels|language=French|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/vzw/vzwf2.htm|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antwerp]] (''Alevietische Kultureel Centrum Antwerpen''), [[Liège]] (from 2002 till 2004 ''Liège Alevi Kultur Dernegi - Association culturelle Alévi de Liège'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv_pdf/2004/03/30/04050732.pdf |title='&amp;#39;Liège Alevi Kultur Dernegi - Association culturelle Alévi de Liège'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2005 ''Foyer culturel alévi de Liège'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv_pdf/2005/10/27/05153556.pdf |title='&amp;#39;Foyer culturel alévi de Liège'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg province]] (''Samenwerking Limburgse Alevieten'', officially registered in 1990). There is also a Federation of the Belgian Alevi Associations, ''Belçika Alevi Birlikleri Federasyonu'', since 2008 ''Fédération unions des Alévis en Belgique - Belçika Alevi Birlikleri Federasyonu'' (FUAB-BABF),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv_pdf/2008/02/28/08033120.pdf Fédération unions des Alévis en Belgique - Belçika Alevi Birlikleri Federasyonu]''&lt;/ref&gt; created in 2003, based in Antwerp, then in Brussels in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv_pdf/2006/01/06/06006146.pdf |title=Fédération unions des Alévis en Belgique - Belçika Alevi Birlikleri Federasyonu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grouping the ''Alevietische Kultureel Centrum Antwerpen'', the ''Centre culturel alévi de Charleroi'' and the ''Samenwerking Limburgse Alevieten''.

== Organisations and associations ==
There are dozens of Turkish associations in Belgium, most are grouped into federations, either linked to the Turkish government ([[Presidency of Religious Affairs|Diyanet]]) and embassy or to various Turkish religious and political movements, [[Milli Görüş]] (''Fédération islamique belge''), the [[Said Nursî|Nurcus]], the  [[Süleyman Hilmi Tunahan|Süleymancis]] (''Union des Centres islamiques de Belgique''), the [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]] (''Verbond der Turkse Verenigingen in België'', ''Belçika Ülkücü Türk Dernekleri Federasyon/Belçika Türk Federasyonu'') etc.

== Political participation ==
At the federal level, several deputies and senators have been elected or coopted to the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives]] and [[Belgian Senate|Senate]]. Among them, the [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Flemish Socialists]] [[Cemal Çavdarlı]] (deputy in 2003-2007) and {{Interlanguage link multi|Fatma Pehlivan|nl}} (senator in 2001-2007, and again in 2009-2010), the [[Groen!|Flemish Ecologists]] [[Meryem Kaçar]] (senator in 1999-2003) and [[Meyrem Almaci|Meyrem Almacı]] (deputy since 2007, reelected in 2010), the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Flemish Christian Democrat]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Hilâl Yalçin|nl}} (deputy in 2007-2010), the [[New-Flemish Alliance|N-VA]] attorney [[Zuhal Demir]] (deputy since June 2010; [[Antwerp (district)|Antwerp district]] mayor since January 2013) and [[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|French-speaking Socialist]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Özlem Özen|fr}} (deputy since June 2010). Kaçar, Cavdarlı and Pehlivan are [[Ghent]] residents, Almacı and Demir are Antwerp residents Yalçın comes from the Limburg province and Ozen from the Walloon province of Hainaut.

There are also Turkish-Belgian members of the regional parliaments, one of them, [[Emir Kir]] ([[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|French-speaking Socialist Party]]), became an underminister in the [[Politics and Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels regional government]] in [[Belgian regional elections, 2004|2004]], and again in [[Belgian regional elections, 2009|2009]], as Secretary for Public Sanitation and Monument Conservation.

A dozen Turkish-Belgian municipal councillors became ''échevin'' or ''schepen'' (alderman) after the [[Belgian provincial and municipal elections, 2006|2006 municipal elections]], mostly in Flanders or the Brussels Region, plus a few in Wallonia.

== Music ==
Turks have also contributed to music in Belgium, recently [[Hadise]] daughter of a family from [[Sivas]] was in the pop music world in Belgium. Hadise made a name for herself in 2003 in the “Idool” song contest sponsored by VTM, the largest Belgian broadcaster. Her songs “[[Stir Me Up]]” and her album “[[Milk Chocolate Girl]]” were on top of the charts for a long time.

There is considerable confusion in both Chinese and foreign sources over definitions of urban places and hence considerable variation in estimates of China's urban population (see [[Migration in China]]).

The problem of determining the size of the urban population reflects inconsistent and changing administrative categories; the distinction between rural and urban household registry and between categories of settlements; the practice of placing suburban or rural districts under the administration of municipal governments; and the differences in the status accorded to small towns. In sociological terms, urban refers to an area characterized by a relatively high degree of specialization in occupational roles, many special-purpose institutions, and uniform treatment of people in impersonal settings. In this sense, a Chinese [[market town]] is more urban than a [[village]], and settlements become more urban as they grow in size and economic complexity. Municipalities like [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] have the highest degree of [[division of labor]] and the most specialized institutions.

==Distinctive features==
Legal status as an urban dweller in China is prized. As a result of various state policies and practices, contemporary Chinese urban society has a distinctive character, and life in Chinese cities differs in many ways from that in cities in otherwise comparable developing societies. The most consequential policies have been the household registration system, the legal barriers to [[human migration|migration]], the fostering of the all-embracing [[work unit]], and the restriction of [[commerce]] and [[market (economics)|market]]s, including the [[housing market]]. In many ways, the weight of official control and supervision is felt more in the cities, whose administrators are concerned with controlling the population and do so through a dual administrative [[hierarchy]]. The two principles on which these control structures are based are locality and occupation. Household registers are maintained by the [[police]], whose presence is much stronger in the cities than in the countryside (see [[Public Security Bureau]]). Cities have been subdivided into districts, wards, and finally into small units of some fifteen to thirty households, such as all those in one apartment building or on a small lane. For those employed in large organizations, the work unit either is coterminous with the residential unit or takes precedence over it; for those employed in small collective enterprises or neighborhood shops, the residential committee is their unit of registration and provides a range of services.

The control of housing by work units and [[local government]]s and the absence of a housing market have led to a high degree of residential stability. Most urban residents have spent decades in the same house or apartment. For this reason, urban neighborhoods are closely knit, which in turn contributes to the generally low level of [[crime]] in [[List of cities in the People's Republic of China|Chinese cities]].

Since the early 1950s, the party leadership has consistently made rapid [[industrialization]] a primary goal and, to this end, has generally favored investment in heavy industry over consumption. For cities, these policies have meant an expansion of factories and industrial employment, along with a very low level of spending in such "nonproductive" areas as housing or urban [[transit system]]s. The emphasis on production, and [[heavy industry]] and the discouragement of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[Trade|exchange]], along with state [[takeover]]s of [[commerce]] and the [[service sector]], led to cities having many factories but no peddlers, snack stalls, or entertainment districts. In the 1950s and early 1960s, major efforts were made to bring women into the paid labor force. This served the goals of increasing production and achieving [[sexual equality]] through equal participation in productive labor, a classic [[Marxist]] remedy for sexual inequality. By 1987 almost all young and middle-aged women in the cities worked outside the home.

Chinese cities, in contrast to those in many [[developing countries]], contain a high proportion of workers in factories and offices and a low proportion of workers in the service sector. Workers enjoy a high level of [[job security]] but receive low [[wage]]s. Between 1963 and 1977 most wages were frozen, and promotions and raises were very rare. Even with the restoration of material incentives in the late 1970s, two general wage raises in the 1980s, and increased opportunities for bonuses and promotions, wages remained low and increased primarily with seniority. As in most parts of the world, one reason that so many Chinese urban women are in the work force is that one income is not enough to support a family.

In the 1980s it was possible to purchase such [[consumer]] [[durables]] as television sets and bicycles on the market, but housing remained scarce and subject to allocation by work units or [[municipal housing]] bureaus. Although housing was poor and crowded, Chinese neighborhoods had improved greatly over the [[slum]] conditions that existed before 1950. Most people were gainfully employed at secure if low-paying jobs; the municipal government provided a minimal level of services and [[utilities]] ([[water]] and [[sanitation]]); the streets were fairly clean and orderly; and the crime rate was low.

==Housing==
Chinese urban dwellers, as a category, receive [[subsidies]] on [[food]], housing, and [[transportation]] services. In the 1980s such subsidies came to occupy an increasingly large share of the [[state budget]]. Even with subsidies, food purchases took the largest share of [[household budget]]s. Rents, in contrast, were very low, seldom taking more than 5 percent of household income even with water and electricity charges included. Little new housing was built between 1950 and 1980, and although more urban housing was erected between 1980 and 1985 than in the previous thirty years, housing remained in short supply. Entire families often lived in one room and shared cooking and toilet facilities with other families. Marriages were sometimes delayed until housing became available from the municipal office or the work unit. Young people were expected to live with their parents at least until [[marriage]]. This was consonant with traditional family patterns but was also reinforced by the shortage of housing. The pattern of long-term residential stability and great pressure on the stock of available housing meant that city neighborhoods were less stratified by occupation or [[income]] than those of many other countries. Not only were incomes more [[egalitarian]] to begin with, but more money could not buy a bigger or better equipped apartment. Managers and technical specialists lived under much the same conditions as manual workers, often in the same buildings. While many urban families enjoyed higher real incomes in the 1980s, they usually could not translate those incomes into better housing, as peasants could.

Until recently, housing was provided by an individual's [[work unit]] in the form of a one or two bedroom [[apartment]]. In the 1990s, a private housing market began to develop, leading to numerous ''xiaoqu'' (lit. "small zones") springing up in the cities. These areas had newly furnished apartments and [[town house]]s. Large-sized houses, colloquially termed "mansions" (''bieshu'') in the Chinese language, is a rather new concept and is usually only available to the business elite.

The combination of full adult employment with a minimal service sector put heavy burdens on urban households. By the 1980s both the public and the government recognized the burdens on urban households and the associated drain on the energies of workers, managers, and professionals. After 1985 more money was budgeted for housing and such municipal services as piped-in [[cooking]] [[gas]]. But state encouragement of the private or collective service sector had greater effect. [[Unemployment|Unemployed]] urban [[youth]] were permitted and sometimes advised to set up small restaurants or service establishments. Peasants were permitted to come into cities to sell produce or local products. Municipal authorities seemed to ignore the movement of substantial numbers of rural people into the urban service sector as peddlers, carpenters, and other skilled workers or, occasionally, as domestic workers. In the mid-1980s the [[Chinese press]] reported an influx of teenage girls from the country seeking short-term work as [[Maid|housekeeper]]s or [[nannies]]. Like other rural migrants, they usually used ties with relatives or fellow villagers resident in the city to find positions.

==Families and marriage==
Urban families differ from their rural counterparts primarily in being composed largely of wage earners who look to their work units for the housing, old-age security, and opportunities for a better life that in the [[countryside]] are still the responsibility of the family. With the exception of those employed in the recently revived urban service sector ([[restaurant]]s, [[tailoring]], or repair shops) who sometimes operate family businesses, urban families do not combine family and enterprise in the manner of peasant families. Urban families usually have multiple wage earners, but children do not bring in extra [[income]] or [[wage]]s as readily as in the countryside. Urban families are generally smaller than their rural counterparts, and, in a reversal of traditional patterns, it is the highest level [[Management|managers]] and [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] who have the smallest families. Late marriages and one or two children are characteristic of urban managerial and professional groups. As in the past, elite family forms are being promoted as the model for everyone.

Three-generation families are not uncommon in cities, and a healthy grandparent is probably the ideal solution to the [[childcare]] and [[Homemaking|housework]] problems of most families. About as many young children are cared for by a grandparent as are enrolled in a [[work unit]] [[Nursery school|nursery]] or [[kindergarten]], institutions that are far from universal. Decisions on where a newly married couple is to live often depend on the availability of housing. Couples most often establish their own household, frequently move in with the husband's parents, or, much less often, may move in with the wife's parents. Both the state and the society expect children to look after their aged parents. In addition, a retired worker from a [[state enterprise]] will have a [[pension]] and often a relatively desirable [[apartment]] as well. Under these circumstances elderly people are assets to a family. Those urban families employing unregistered maids from the countryside are most likely those without healthy grandparents.

Families play less of a role in marriage choices in cities than in the countryside, at least in part because the family itself is not the unit promising long-term security and benefits to its members. By the late 1970s, perhaps half of all urban marriages were the result of introductions by workmates, relatives, or parents. The marriage age in cities has been later than that in the countryside, which reflects greater compliance with state rules and guidelines as well as social and economic factors common to many other countries. People in cities and those with secondary and postsecondary [[education]] or professional jobs tend to marry later than farmers. In China it was felt that marriage was appropriate only for those who have jobs and thus are in a position to be full members of society. Peasant youth, who have an automatic claim on a share of the collective fields and the family house, qualified, but college students or urban youths who are "waiting for assignment" to a lifetime job did not. In any case, work unit approval was necessary for marriage.

Urban weddings were usually smaller and more subdued than their rural counterparts, which reflected the diminished role of the families in the process. Families often reserve a restaurant and a wedding ceremony troupe, which includes a wedding host and entertainers. More guests will be coworkers or friends of the bride and groom than distant kin or associates of the parents. The wedding ceremony focuses on the bride and groom as a couple rather than on their status as members of families. Similarly, a brief honeymoon trip rather than a three-day celebration in which the entire village plays a part is an increasingly common practice. Long engagements are common in cities, sometimes because the couple is waiting for housing to become available.

==Providing for the next generation==
Although Chinese families continue to be marked by respect for parents and a substantial degree of [[filial piety]], parents have weighty obligations toward their children as well. Children are obliged to support parents in their old age, and parents are obliged to give their children as favorable a place in the world as they can in the early phase of their life. In the past this meant leaving them [[property]] and providing the best [[education]] or [[training]] possible. For most rural parents today the choice of a [[career]] for their children is not a major issue. Most children of peasants will be peasants like their parents, and the highest realistic ambition is a position as a low-level [[Professional revolutionaries|cadre]] or [[teacher]] or perhaps a [[technician]]. The primary determinant of a rural child's status and well-being remains his or her family, which is one reason for the intense concern with the marriage choices of sons and daughters and for the greater degree of [[parent]]al involvement in those decisions.

Urban parents are less concerned with whom their children marry but are more concerned with their education and eventual careers. Urban parents can expect to leave their children very little in the way of property, but they do their best to prepare them for secure and desirable jobs in the state and commercial sectors. The difficulty is that such jobs are limited, competition is intense, and the criteria for entry have changed radically several times since the early 1950s. Many of the dynamics of urban society revolve around the issue of job allocation and the attempts of parents in the better-off segments of society to transmit their favored position to their children. The allocation of scarce and desirable goods, in this case jobs, is a political issue and one that has been endemic since the late 1950s. These questions lie behind the changes in educational policy, the attempts in the 1960s and 1970s to settle urban youth in the countryside, the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, and the post-1980 encouragement of small-scale private and collective commerce and service occupations in the cities. All are attempts to solve the problem, and each attempt has its own costs and drawbacks.

==Opportunities and competition==
Cities, by definition, are places with a high degree of occupational specialization and [[division of labor]]. They are places offering their inhabitants a range of occupational choice and also, to the degree that some occupations are seen as better than others, competition for the better occupations. Cities also provide the training for specialized occupations, either in schools or on the job.

In China there is a cultural pattern stressing [[individual]] achievement and [[upward mobility]]. These are best attained through formal [[education]] and are bound up with the mutual expectations and obligations of parents and children. There is also a [[social structure]] in which a single, bureaucratic framework defines desirable positions, that is, managerial or professional jobs in the state or private sectors or secure jobs in factories. Restricted migration, lifetime employment, egalitarian wage structures, and the insular nature of work units were intended by the state, at least in part, to curtail individual competition. Nevertheless, some jobs have been still seen as preferable to others, and it is urbanites and their children who have the greatest opportunities to compete for scarce jobs. The question for most families is how individuals are selected and allocated to those positions. The lifetime tenure of most jobs and the firm control of job allocation by the party make these central issues for parents in the favored groups and for local authorities and party organizations.

Between the early 1950s and mid-1980s, policies on recruitment of personnel and their allocation to desirable jobs changed several times. As the costs and drawbacks of each method became apparent, pressure mounted to change the policy. In the early and mid-1950s, the problem was not acute. State offices were expanding rapidly, and there were more positions than people qualified to fill them. Peasants moved into cities and found employment in the expanding industrial sector. Most of those who staffed the new bureaucratic sectors were young and would not begin to retire until the 1980s and 1990s. Those who graduated from [[secondary school]]s or [[universities]], however, or were discharged from the [[armed forces]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s found few jobs of the sort they were qualified for or had expected to hold.

Attempts to manage the competition for secure jobs were among the many causes of the [[Political radicalism|radical]], [[utopia]]n policies of the period from 1962 to 1976. Among these, the administrative barriers erected between cities and countryside and the confinement of peasants and their children to their villages served to diminish competition and perhaps to lower unrealistic expectations. [[Wage]] freezes and the [[rationing]] of both staples and scarce consumer goods in cities attempted to diminish [[social stratification|stratification]] and hence [[competition]]. The focusing of attention on the sufferings and [[egalitarian]] communal traditions of the past, which was so prominent in [[Maoist]] rhetoric and replaced the future orientation of the 1950s, in part diverted attention from frustrations with the present. Tensions were most acute within the education system, which served, as it does in most societies, to sort children and select those who would go on to managerial and professional jobs. It was for this reason that the [[Cultural Revolution]] focused so negatively on the education system. Because of the rising competition in the schools and for the jobs to which schooling could lead, it became increasingly evident that those who did best in school were the children of the "[[bourgeoisie]]" and urban professional groups rather than the children of workers and peasants (see [[Education in the People's Republic of China]]).

Cultural Revolution-era policies responded with public [[deprecation]] of [[schooling]] and [[expertise]], including closing of all schools for a year or more and of universities for nearly a decade, exaltation of on-the-job training and of political motivation over expertise, and preferential treatment for workers and peasant youth. Educated urban youth, most of whom came from "bourgeois" families, were persuaded or coerced to settle in the countryside, often in remote frontier districts. Because there were no jobs in the cities, the party expected urban youth to apply their education in the countryside as [[primary school]] [[teacher]]s, production team [[accountant]]s, or [[barefoot doctor]]s; many did [[manual labor]]. The policy was intensely unpopular, not only with urban parents and youth but also with peasants and was dropped soon after the fall of the [[Gang of Four]] in late 1976. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of the youth who had been sent down to the countryside managed to make their way back to the cities, where they had neither jobs nor ration books. By the mid-1980s most of them had found jobs in the newly expanded service sector.

In terms of creating jobs and mollifying urban parents, the 1980s policies on urban employment have been quite successful. The jobs in many cases are not the sort that educated young people or their parents would choose, but they are considerably better than a lifelong assignment to remote frontier areas.

The Maoist policies on education and job assignment were successful in preventing a great many urban "bourgeois" parents from passing their favored social status on to their children. This reform, however, came at great cost to the economy and to the prestige and authority of the party itself.

==Examinations, hereditary transmission of jobs, and connections==
Beginning in the late 1970s, China's leaders stressed [[expertise]] and [[education]] over motivation and ideology and consequently placed emphasis again on [[examinations]]. Competition in the schools was explicit, and examinations were frequent. A major step in the competition for desirable jobs was the passage from senior middle school to college and university, and success was determined by performance on a nationwide college and university entrance examination (see [[National College Entrance Examination]]). Examinations also were used to select applicants for jobs in factories, and even factory managers had to pass examinations to keep their positions. The content of these examinations has not been made public, but their use represents a logical response to the problem of unfair competition, [[Cronyism|favoritism]], and [[Political corruption|corruption]].

One extreme form of selection by favoritism in the 1980s was simple hereditary transmission, and this principle, which operated on a ''[[de facto]]'' basis in rural [[work unit]]s, seems to have been fairly widely used in China's industrial sector. From the 1960s to the 1980s, factories and mines in many cases permitted children to replace their parents in jobs, which simplified [[recruitment]] and was an effective way of encouraging aging workers to [[retire]]. The government forbade this practice in the 1980s, but in some instances state-run factories and mines, especially those located in rural or remote areas, used their resources to set up subsidiaries or sideline enterprises to provide employment for their workers' children. The leaders of these work units evidently felt responsible for providing employment to the children of unit members. Jobs are also transmitted through other relatives or their friends, with accordance to the complex Chinese social concept of ''[[guanxi]]''.

The party and its role in personnel matters, including job assignments, can be an obstacle to the consistent application of hiring standards. At the grass-roots level, the party branch's control of job assignments and promotions is one of the foundations of its power, and some local party cadres in the mid-1980s apparently viewed the expanded use of examinations and educational [[wikt:qualification|qualification]]s as a threat to their power. The party, acting through local employment commissions, controlled all job assignments. Party members occupied the most powerful and desirable positions; the way party members were evaluated and selected for positions remained obscure. Local party cadres were frequently suspected by the authorities of using their connections to secure jobs for their relatives or clients.

'''Walt Walkinshaw''' was an American attorney who "epitomized the Northwest character, old school. He was an outdoorsman, a lawyer with a strong conscience, and a passionate advocate of progressive causes," according to David Brewster in ''Crosscut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brewster|first1=David|title=Walt Walkinshaw: salt of the Northwest earth|url=http://crosscut.com/2010/05/02/crosscut-blog/19481/Walt-Walkinshaw-salt-Northwest-earth/|publisher=Crosscut|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walt on top of Mt. Walkinshaw.jpg|thumb|Walt on top of Mt. Walkinshaw]]
Walkinshaw was born in 1917 in Seattle into a pioneering family – a peak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt. Walkinshaw in the Olympic Mountains|url=http://www.climbersguideolympics.com/peaks/gray-wolf-hurricane-ridge-group/mount-walkinshaw|publisher=Olympic Mountains: A Climbing Guide|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Olympic Mountains]] is named after his father Robert B. Walkinshaw, an author and lawyer.

After graduating cum laude from the University of Washington in 1939, he was chosen as one of 40 young [[Rockefeller Foundation]] interns in the federal government in Washington, D.C. He worked in various departments and ended up as a staff member in the executive office of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] where he wrote reports on the various new agencies of the [[New Deal]].

[[File:Navy navigator of escort aircraft carrier in World War II.jpg|thumb|left|Navy navigator of escort aircraft carrier in World War II]] [[File:Walt serves in the US State Department.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Department of State spokesman for Point Four]] Walkinshaw's career was interrupted by World War II. He served in the Navy for five years of continuous duty in war zones at sea. He started in the North Atlantic as a deck officer on a cargo ship dodging German submarines. His Asiatic-Pacific Theater ribbon contains three stars – one for [[Saipan]], another for [[Iwo Jima]], and the third for [[Okinawa]]. He also received a "special commendation for performance duty in operations" against Iwo Jima. When he was navigator of aircraft carrier [[USS Windham Bay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USS Windham Bay: Ship's Historian Report|url=https://sites.google.com/site/windhambay/Home/ship-s-historian-report|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; his ship was in the first bloody assault of that island. American journalist [[Ernie Pyle]] was at one time aboard the USS Windham Bay, and wrote about the importance of jeep carriers in naval battles. Walt retired in 1946 as a commander.

He then became a program analyst and foreign affairs specialist with the U.S. government's Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific and Cultural Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Clark A.|title=An Effective Instrument of Peace: Scientific Cooperation as an Instrument of U.S. Foreign Policy, 1938-1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this job, he worked with a little-known program of technical aid and exchange of scientific know-how with South America. He worked with a staff of three to get their idea of technical assistance to expand from South America to the rest of the world. In the Mundt bill (P.L. 402), the program was passed by Congress to go worldwide, but no funding was provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From the minutes of the Executive Committee of the Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific and Cultural Cooperation, March 1948, Harry S. Truman Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until a friend of Walkinshaw's, Benjamin Hardy, wrote the idea into the inaugural speech of President [[Harry S. Truman]] and the president announced this bold new program of aid for the underdeveloped world that it was funded and went worldwide. It was Truman's fourth point in his speech and thus named the [[Point Four Program]].

Point Four was the first time in history that a powerful nation – in this case the industrial giant of the world – was committing itself to assist in the building up of other countries, not in order to gain dominion over them or to profit by their exploitation, but as a means of contributing to the establishment of a world order distinguished by personal freedom and social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Benjamin|title=Manuscript for unpublished book on Point Four, located in Harry S. Truman Library, National Archives and Records Services, United States Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helping the world's sick, hungry, uneducated and discouraged to help themselves became a national policy.

In 1950, Walkinshaw was a representative of the [[United States Department of State]] on the Griffin Mission that went to Southeast Asia to establish Point Four. The idea of using younger people for overseas technical work was suggested in his final report for the Griffin Mission, and furthered by Lloyd Andrews who became head of Point Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Walter Walkinshaw, Officer of Technical Cooperation and Development, Department of State.  Report on Trip to Certain NEA and FE Countries, Feb. 2 – Ap 20, 1958.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews later had direct input when President [[John F. Kennedy]] founded the [[Peace Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oral History Interview with Stanley Andrews, Harry S. Truman Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Point Four also laid the foundation for what would later become [[USAID]], the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Walkinshaw left Point Four in 1951 for several reasons. During the early 1950s, [[McCarthyism]] was at its height and Walkinshaw's boss was accused, and then cleared, as one of ten top subversive members of the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=Haldore|title=Fifty Years Around the Third World: Adventures and Reflections of an Overseas American|date=1986|issue=Fraser Publishing Company, Burlington, Vermont.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that many of the colleagues he respected were being driven out of the State Department. Further, an idea he promoted in Point Four of [[appropriate technology]] and small improvements decided upon by the people involved was often being replaced by [[Marshall Plan]] types of big industrial projects. He also found that most budget requests had to be tied to the military.

Walkinshaw was deeply tied to the Northwest and wanted to get back to his roots in Seattle. He had earned his law degree from [[George Washington University]] while working full-time in the State Department, so he started his new law practice in Seattle and was a lone practitioner for 21 years before joining Riddell Williams law firm.

[[File:Walt and Jean at San Juan retreat.jpg|thumb|Jean and Walt at San Juan retreat]]

Not long after moving back to Seattle, he met his future wife Jean Strong at a Quaker meeting. Jean was a graduate of Stanford University and had just returned from [[Hiroshima]], where she worked to build houses of good will. They soon married and had three children: Charlie, Rob and Meg.

Walkinshaw's wife [[Jean Walkinshaw]] also had deep ties to the Northwest. Her father was an early civil engineer who built roads including the [[North Cascades Highway]] to Marblemount and a portion of the road around the [[Olympic Peninsula]]. Mount Henderson in the Olympic Mountains is named after her grandfather. Jean became an award-winning documentary producer and produced for [[The History Channel]]; [[KING-TV]], NBC affiliate in Seattle; and [[KCTS]], the public television station in Seattle. She produced more than 50 documentaries. In 1992 she was inducted into the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] Silver Circle for 25 years of significant contribution to the television industry and community.

[[File:Walt as a young lawyer.jpg|thumb|Walkinshaw as a lawyer]]As a lawyer, Walkinshaw drafted many state laws that established the direction of health care, including patient bill of rights, [[right to die]], and licensure of health care professionals.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} He was also the attorney for the architects who designed [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport|SeaTac]] and the [[Washington State Convention Center]].

Walkinshaw is listed in Men of Achievement (1973), and in several editions of [[Who's Who]] in the West.

Walkinshaw served as founding secretary for ACT Theater, and remained its secretary, attorney and advisor for 35 years. He helped start the Seattle chapter of [[Amigos de las Americas]], an organization that sends teenagers as volunteers to Latin America. He served on many others boards including [[Northwest Kidney Centers]], Municipal League, United Nations Association and City Club.

As an avid fly fisherman, he crusaded to preserve and maintain habitat and recreational areas. As attorney for the owners of the [[Nisqually Delta]] wetlands near Olympia, Washington, he steered his clients to sell their land to the government, which resulted in the [[Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge]] on the delta.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/restoring-nisqually-estuary-to-close-popular-trail/&lt;/ref&gt; He was an officer and director of the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition. He was a member of the Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee, of the U.S. Department of Commerce from 1980 to 1983. And he was an officer and director of the Washington Fly Fishing Club.

[[File:Walt, the environmentalist.jpg|thumb|left|Walt, the environmentalist]]His law partner Stimson Bullitt, remembering their long-time friendship, wrote of Walkinshaw, "You are the only person I have known for whom I thought ethical decisions were not hard – that on coming to a moral fork in the road, you would take the right one without breaking stride."

Walkinshaw died in Seattle on April 16, 2010, at age 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walt Walkinshaw obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/seattletimes/obituary.aspx?n=walter-walkinshaw&amp;pid=142177272|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tribute to Walt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walt Walkinshaw: An appreciation|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2010/04/19/walt-walkinshaw-an-appreciation/|publisher=Seattle P-I}}&lt;/ref&gt; national correspondent Joel Connelly of the ''Seattle P-I'' wrote that Walt "became one of the self-effacing, credit sharing 'Greatest Generation' activists who shaped the postwar city and region."

The '''Yukaghir languages''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|k|ə|ɡ|ɪər|,_|j|uː|k|ə|ˈ|ɡ|ɪər}}; also ''Yukagir, Jukagir'') are a small family of two closely related languages—[[Northern Yukaghir language|Tundra]] and [[Southern Yukaghir language|Kolyma Yukaghir]]—spoken by the [[Yukaghir]] in the [[Russian Far East]] living in the basin of the [[Kolyma River]]. At the 2002 Russian census, both Yukaghir languages taken together had 604 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perepis2002.ru/index.html?id=17|title=Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года|website=www.perepis2002.ru|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent reports from the field reveal that this number is far too high: [[Southern Yukaghir language|Southern Yukaghir]] had maximum 5 fluent speakers in 2009, while the [[Tundra Yukaghir language|Tundra Yukaghir]] language had around 60-70.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpi.nl/research/research-projects/syntax-typology-and-information-structure/fieldsites/yukaghir|title=Yukaghir — Syntax, Typology, and Information Structure — Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics|website=www.mpi.nl|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire family is thus to be regarded as [[moribund language|moribund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/nasia_report.html|title=Endangered languages in Northeast Asia: report|website=www.helsinki.fi|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and grammatical features==
The relationship of the Yukaghir languages with other language families is uncertain, though it has been suggested that they are distantly related to the [[Uralic languages]], thus forming the putative [[Uralic–Yukaghir languages|Uralic–Yukaghir]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;Collinder, Björn (1940) Jukagirisch und Uralisch. Uppsala: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tundra and Kolyma Yukaghir are the only two remnants of what used to be one of the dominant languages/language families of northeastern Siberia, spreading from the [[Anadyr River|River Anadyr]] in the east to the [[Lena River|River Lena]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Dolgikh, Boris O. (1960) Rodovoj i plemennoj sostav narodov Sibiri v XVII v. Moskva: Izdatel'stvo Akademii Nauk SSSR&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of the evidence of early sources, it can be assumed that there existed a Yukaghir dialect continuum, with what is today Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir at the extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Nikoleava, Irina (2008) Chuvan and Omok languages? In: A. Lubotsky et al. (Eds.) Evidence and Counter-Evidence. Festschrift Frederik Kortland. Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 313-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two languages share only a relatively small part of the vocabulary and are not mutually intelligible. The basic grammatical structures, however, are very similar. Both languages have residual [[vowel harmony]] and a complex [[phonotactics]] of consonants. Both have rich [[agglutinative]] morphology and are strictly [[Head directionality parameter|head-final]]. There is practically no finite subordination and very few [[coordinate structure]]s. The most spectacular feature of TY and KY grammar is the [[Active–stative language|split intransitive]] alignment system based on discourse-pragmatic features. In absence of [[Focus (linguistics)|narrow focus]], the system is organised on the [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] basis; when focused, [[direct object]]s and subjects of [[intransitive verb]]s are co-aligned (special focus case, special focus agreement).

==Members==
The two extant varieties of Yukaghir are:
*[[Tundra Yukaghir language|Tundra Yukaghir]] (Northern Yukaghir, also known as Wadul): 30 to 150 speakers in 1989. Last spoken in the [[tundra]] belt extending between the lower [[Indigirka]] to the lower [[Kolyma River|Kolyma]] basin ({{coord|69|N|154|E|}}). Formerly spoken in a much wider area extending to the [[Lena River|Lena]] basin in the west.
*[[Southern Yukaghir language|Kolyma Yukaghir]] (Forest Yukaghir, Southern Yukaghir, also known as Odul): 5 to 10 speakers in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Last spoken in the forest zone near the sources of the Kolyma, divided between the [[Sakha Republic]] and the [[Magadan Oblast]] (around {{coord|65|N|153|E|}}), previously in the wider area of the upper [[Kolyma region]].

Extinct varieties include [[Omok language|Omok]] and [[Chuvan language|Chuvan]], which survived until perhaps the 18th century.
