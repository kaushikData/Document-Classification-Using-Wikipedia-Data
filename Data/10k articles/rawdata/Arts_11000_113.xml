'''Alfred Émile Léopold Stevens''' (11 May 1823{{snd}}24 August 1906) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] painter,  known for his paintings of elegant modern women.

Alfred Stevens was born in [[Brussels]]. He came from a family involved with the visual arts: his older brother [[Joseph Stevens (painter)|Joseph]] (1816–1892) and his son Léopold (1866–1935) were painters, while another brother Arthur (1825–99) was an art dealer and critic. His father, who had fought in the Napoleonic wars in the army of [[William I of the Netherlands]], was an art collector who owned several watercolors by [[Eugène Delacroix]], among other artists.  His mother's parents ran Café de l'Amitié in Brussels, a meeting place for politicians, writers, and artists.  All the Stevens children benefited from the people they met there, and the social skills they acquired in growing up around important people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alfred Stevens. 1823 Brussels – Paris 1906|year=2009|publisher=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|location=Brussels and Mercatorfonds|isbn=978-90-6153-876-9|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
After the death of his father in 1837, Stevens left middle school to begin study at the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels, where he knew [[François Navez]], the Neo-Classical painter and former student of [[Jacques-Louis David]] who was its director and an old friend of Stevens's grandfather. Following a traditional curriculum, he drew from casts of classical sculpture for the first two years, and then drew from live models.&lt;ref name="Stevens2009_p12"&gt;{{cite book|title=Alfred Stevens. 1823 Brussels – Paris 1906.|year=2009|publisher=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|location=Brussels and Mercatorfonds|isbn=978-90-6153-876-9|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, Stevens went to [[Paris]], joining his brother Joseph who already was there. He was admitted to the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], the most important art school in Paris.  Although it is said that he became a student of its director [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], this is likely not true.&lt;ref name="Stevens2009_p12"/&gt; An early picture by Stevens, ''The Pardon'' or ''Absolution'' (Hermitage, St. Petersburg), signed and dated 1849, shows his mastery of a conventional naturalistic style which owes much to 17th-century Dutch [[Genre works|genre]] painting. Like the Belgian painter and friend with whom he stayed in Paris, [[Florent Joseph Marie Willems]] (1823–1905), Stevens carefully studied works by painters such as [[Gerard ter Borch]] and [[Gabriel Metsu]].&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas, Bernadette. "Alfred (Emile-Léopold) Stevens" in ''Oxford Art Online''. Retrieved December 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career beginnings==
Stevens's work was shown publicly for the first time in 1851, when three of his paintings were admitted to the Brussels Salon.  He was awarded a third-class medal at the Paris Salon in 1853, and a second-class medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Universal Exposition]] in Paris in 1855.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; His ''Ce qu'on appelle le vagabondage [What is called vagrancy]'' ([[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris) attracted the attention of [[Napoleon III]] who, as a result of the scene in the picture, ordered that soldiers no longer be used to pick up the poor from the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/what-is-called-vagrancy-16565.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&amp;cHash=4d0e85d052|title=Musée d'Orsay: Alfred Stevens What is called vagrancy|date=4 February 2009|work=musee-orsay.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other paintings he exhibited at the Salon in [[Antwerp]] that year, ''Chez soi'' or ''At Home'' (present location unknown) and ''The Painter and his Model'' (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore), introduced subjects from "la vie moderne" for which he became known: an elegant young woman in contemporary dress and the artist in his studio.  In 1857, Stevens made his first important sale to a private collector, when ''Consolation'' was bought for a rumored 6,000 francs by the Berlin collector and dealer Ravéné.  At the same time, he and his brother were becoming part of the art world of Paris, meeting people such as the [[Goncourt]] brothers, [[Théophile Gautier]], and [[Alexandre Dumas]] at the salons of [[Mathilde Bonaparte|Princess Mathilde]] as well as popular cafés.  In 1858, Stevens married Marie Blanc, who came from a rich Belgian family and old friends of the Stevens's. Eugène Delacroix was a witness at the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alfred Stevens.  1823 Brussels – Paris 1906.|year=2009|publisher=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|location=Brussels and Mercatorfonds|isbn=978-90-6153-876-9|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mature career==

During the 1860s, Stevens became an immensely successful painter, known for his paintings of elegant modern women.  His exhibits at the Salons in Paris and Brussels attracted favorable critical attention and buyers.  An excellent example of his work during this time is ''La Dame en Rose'' or ''Woman in Pink'' ([[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], Brussels), painted in 1866, which combines a view of a fashionably dressed woman in an interior with a detailed examination of Japanese objects, a fashionable taste called ''[[japonisme]]'' of which Stevens was an early enthusiast.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; In 1863, he received the [[Legion of Honor]] (Chevalier) from the French government.  In 1867, he won a first-class medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Universal Exposition]] in Paris, where he and [[Jan August Hendrik Leys]] were the stars of the Belgian section, and was promoted to [[Officer of the Legion of Honor]].  His friends included [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], [[Frédéric Bazille]], and [[Puvis de Chavannes]], and he was a regular in the group that gathered at the Café Guerbois in Paris.

Stevens fought for the French during the siege of Paris in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], but returned to Belgium with his wife and family before the [[Paris Commune]].  They returned after the war, and Stevens continued to achieve critical acclaim as well as great success with collectors. In 1875, he bought a grand house and garden in Paris on rue des Martyrs, which appeared in his paintings as well as those of other artists, including Édouard Manet's ''The Croquet Party'' (Städel Museum, Frankfurt am Main) from 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staedelmuseum.de/sm/index.php?StoryID=337&amp;ObjectID=233&amp;websiteLang=en|title=Willkommen im Newsroom|work=staedelmuseum.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He had to leave the house in 1880, however, to make way for the construction of a new street, which was named after him.)  In 1878, he was made a Commander of the Legion of Honor and received another first-class medal at the Salon.

Despite earning a considerable income through the sale of his paintings, Stevens found that a combination of bad investments and excessive spending caused him great financial difficulties during the 1880s.  An additional expense came from summers by the sea, which a doctor told Stevens in 1880 were essential for his health.  Thus the artist was glad to agree when the Paris dealer Georges Petit offered him 50,000 francs to finance his vacation in exchange for the paintings Stevens produced during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alfred Stevens.  1823 Brussels – Paris 1906.|year=2009|publisher=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|location=Brussels and Mercatorfonds|isbn=978-90-6153-876-9|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This deal, which lasted for three years, resulted in the sea becoming an important subject for him, and over the rest of his career, he painted hundreds of views of popular resorts along the Normandy coast and the Midi in the south.  Many of them are painted in a sketchy style that shows the influence of the Impressionists.  Stevens also began to take private students, including [[Sarah Bernhardt]],&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; who became a close personal friend, and [[William Merritt Chase]]. Other students were [[Berthe Art]], [[Charles Bell Birch]], [[Jules Cayron]], [[Marie Collart-Henrotin]], [[Louise De Hem]], [[Harriet Campbell Foss]],&lt;ref name="Tufts(U.S.)1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Eleanor Tufts]]|author2=National Museum of Women in the Arts (U.S.)|author3=International Exhibitions Foundation|title=American women artists, 1830–1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvxPAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=International Exhibitions Foundation for the National Museum of Women in the Arts|isbn=978-0-940979-01-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgette Meunier]], [[Lilla Cabot Perry]], [[Jean Paul Sinibaldi]], and [[Fernand Toussaint]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Stevens in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late career==
The single most important work from the second half of Stevens's career is the monumental ''Panorama du Siècle, 1789–1889'', which he painted with [[Henri Gervex]].  Stevens painted the women and details and Gervex the men, with the help of fifteen assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alfred Stevens.  1823 Brussels – Paris 1906.|year=2009|publisher=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|location=Brussels and Mercatorfonds|isbn=978-90-6153-876-9|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was shown to great acclaim at the International Exhibition held in Paris in 1889.  He also received several great professional tributes.  In 1895, a large exhibition of his work was held in Brussels. In 1900, Stevens was honored by the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris with the first retrospective exhibition ever given to a living artist.  Supported by patrons led by the Comtesse de Greffulhe, it achieved social cachet as well as popular success.  In 1905, he was the only living artist allowed to exhibit in a retrospective show of Belgian art in Brussels. Despite these exhibitions, he was not able to sell enough of his work to manage well financially.  Having outlived his brothers and most of his friends, he died in Paris in 1906, living alone in modest rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alfred Stevens.  1823 Brussels – Paris 1906.|year=2009|publisher=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|location=Brussels and Mercatorfonds|isbn=978-90-6153-876-9|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angstloch.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An ''angstloch'' at [[Wildenburg Castle (Eifel)|Wildenburg Castle]]]]

An '''''angstloch''''' (apparently "fear hole", but more probably from the [[Latin|Lat.]] ''angustus'' "narrow" and German ''Loch'' "hole") was a small hole in the floor of [[medieval]] [[castle]]s and [[fortress]]es that led to a cellar or basement room below. The term is German and has no English equivalent, although a door, where there is one, to such a hole is called a [[trapdoor]] (German: ''Falltür''). 

An ''angstloch'' is usually located above the basement of a fighting tower or ''[[bergfried]]''. The description of these basement rooms as "[[dungeon]]s" stems from the romanticised castle studies of the 19th century. There is no evidence to indicate that prisoners were really lowered through the ''angstloch'' into the dungeon using a rope or [[rope ladder]] as these 19th century accounts suggest. Archaeological finds, by contrast, indicate the use of these basement spaces as store rooms. For example, piles of stones have been found in such rooms that suggest they were used as a store for projectiles to be used in time of [[siege]].

'''''As Nasty As They Wanna Be''''' is the third album by [[Miami bass]] group [[2 Live Crew]]. It was released on February 7, 1989 and became the group's largest seller, being certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1990, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]] ruled that the album was legally obscene;&lt;ref&gt;''Skyywalker Records, Inc. v. Navarro'', 739 F.Supp. 578 (S.D. Fla. 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; this ruling was later overturned by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;''Luke Records, Inc. v. Navarro'', 960 F.2d 134 (11th Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first album in history to be deemed legally obscene.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 1993. [http://deflem.blogspot.com/1993/08/rap-rock-and-censorship-1993.html "Rap, Rock, and Censorship: Popular Culture and the Technologies of Justice."] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Law and Society Association, Chicago, May 27–30, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

It would also be the final album to be released under the Skyywalker Records label. Following a successful lawsuit against Luther Campbell and Skyywalker Records by ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and director [[George Lucas]], the company was forced to change its name to [[Luke Records]].

The album is broken down track-by-track by [[Luther Campbell|Luke]] and Mr. Mixx in Brian Coleman's book ''[[Check the Technique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Brian, 2007, ''[[Check The Technique]]: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies'', Villard/Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the album cover and imagery of the record were used in the music video of the song "The Rabbit" by Swedish band [[Miike Snow]].

== Obscenity trial ==
Federal district judge Jose Gonzalez ruled that the album was obscene, making it illegal in certain counties of Florida. Subsequently, on June 9, 1990, three band members were arrested, and their album seized, when they performed some tracks at a local sex club, in [[Broward County, Florida]]. In the "media circus"&lt;ref&gt;MacInnes 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; attendant on these events, only the Washington ''[[Washington City Paper|City Paper]]'', [[Tipper Gore]]'s [[Parents Music Resource Center]] and ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine published the offending lyrics. [[Christopher Hitchens]], in a column on the last of these, citing the admonition on the cover of the album—"If you don't like the record, you can kiss our mother fuckin' ass"—commented,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Precisely. It's obvious to this reviewer that the Crew should be left alone, and that their foulmouthed attitude toward the gentler sex is a good-sounding excuse for a youth-hating and surreptitiously bigoted prosecution. I don't know the private thoughts of Sheriff Nick Navarro of Broward County, but I doubt they are worth a rat's behind and see no reason why he should sublimate his own vagina-dreading disorders in this expensive and undemocratic fashion. The same applies to the preposterous Judge Jose Gonzalez Jr., who in ruling on Sheriff Navarro's raid opined that the music appeals to "the loins, not to the intellect." In fact, I think they are a pair of racist shitheads who should be told to fuck right off.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An obscenity trial followed, in which [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], addressed the court on behalf of the defendants, all of whom were eventually acquitted.

==Trivia==
*The album cover can be found on the wall of the music store in the comedy film, ''[[Next Friday]]''.
*''As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' is the first ever [[Southern rap]] album to go [[RIAA|platinum]] and the only one from the 1980s.
*In the liner notes, the group thanks Chris Jurewicz, who at the time was a 10-year-old who wrote the group a fan letter. He grew up to be [[Chris Jay]], the lead singer of the rock band, [[Army of Freshmen]].
*The German CD omitted tracks 17 and 18 due to "capacity reasons." The length was 68:55 mins.
*"The Fuck Shop" contains a lyrical [[public service announcement]] reminding people to clean their genitals after sex.

'''''As Clean As They Wanna Be''''' is the clean version of [[2 Live Crew]]'s third album. The album contains a disclaimer that '"This album does not contain explicit lyrics."  The album had notably worse sales than the explicit version. However, it does contain "Pretty Woman", which is not on the explicit version. The song – a parody of the [[Roy Orbison]] hit "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" – resulted in a Supreme Court case, ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', which established that a commercial [[parody]] can qualify as [[fair use]]. Despite the sticker on the album cover claiming "This album does not contain explicit lyrics", the song "Break It on Down" appears in its original, explicit form. Additionally, the song "City of Boom" (which is exclusive to the clean version) contains several explicit lyrics.

[[File:YEAROFTHEDRAGONSF1979.jpg|thumb|Playwright Frank Chin portrays "Fred Eng" in the Asian American Theater Workshop production of ''Year of the Dragon'' in San Francisco, California 1977]]
The '''Asian American Theater Company''' (AATC) is a non-profit theatre performance company based in San Francisco. Its stated mission is "To connect people to Asian American culture through theatre".

==Background==
The Asian American Theater Company was established in 1973 by playwright [[Frank Chin]] to develop and present original works of [[Asian American theatre|theatre about Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent]]. AATC is credited as a progenitor of the Asian-American theater movement alongside [[East West Players]] and [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Velina Hasu. "Currents: Out of the Margins: A National Theatre Conference in Los Angeles Galvanizes Asian-American Forces." ''American Theatre'' 10 2006: 132–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being a producing company, AATC is a workshop where [[Asian people|Asian]] [[Pacific Islander]] writers, actors and directors can explore ideas and create works that carry with them the AATC's purpose, which is to explore who [[Asian American|Asian Pacific Islander Americans]] are as a people and as a community.

For many years the Asian American Theater Company was housed in The Asian American Theater Center located near the corner of Arguello and Clement Streets in San Francisco’s ethnically diverse Richmond district. The Theater Center suffered much damage from the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], but was able to re-open its doors a year later. The costly repairs however created a heavy economic burden and in 1996 the Asian American Theater Company moved its administrative offices to Japantown, and produced its plays in various theater venues throughout the city such as the Off-Market Theater and the Thick House. Today the administrative offices reside in San Francisco's Potrero Hill neighborhood at 1695 18th Street.

==Programs==

The company's main stage productions are new plays and revivals of classics by Asian Pacific Islander American playwrights, directed, performed and designed by local talent.  Most scripts will have been developed at AATC and each will be presented at various venues around the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] with full-production run.

Under its emerging artists project, young actors, many  of whom are making their acting debut, perform plays by new playwrights or revivals of classics by established artists.  Many of the actors and writers taking part in the Emerging Artists Project have participated in the Training Program.

The group hosts staged readings, where scripts under development are directed, rehearsed and presented, followed by discussion and critique.  Readings are free or a nominal donation is requested.  Scripts from women and under-represented Asian Pacific Islander groups are especially welcome.

A training program consisting of two semesters a year of courses in acting, scene study, voice and movement and playwright's workshops, conducted by professional artists, offered at low cost.

==Alumni==
Many well known Asian American actors and playwrights have been associated with AATC productions in the past.  Notable alumni:

===Actors===
* [[Michael Paul Chan]]
* [[Dennis Dun]]
* [[Amy Hill]]
* [[Rodney Kageyama]]
* [[Lane Nishikawa]]

[[File:AthenaSömek1.jpg|thumb|Athena Relief of Sömek]]
The '''Athena relief of Sömek''' is a Greco-Roman [[rock relief]], located some two kilometres north of the village of [[Sömek, Silifke|Sömek]] in [[Silifke]] district of [[Mersin province]] in Turkey, near the valley of the [[Limonlu Çayı|Limonlu]] river, the ancient Lamos. In antiquity, the river formed the border between "Rugged [[Cilicia]]" (Kilikia Tracheia) in the west and "Flat Cilicia" (Kilikia Pedias) in the east.

== Description ==
[[File:AthenaSömek3.jpg|thumb|Right pilaster with symbols and candelabrum]]
The relief is carved in the living rock at a height of some 1.5 metres above the ground. It has a total height of 1.3 metres. In a niche finished with a conch-shaped top, the image of a woman is found, who can be identified as the goddess [[Athena]] thanks to the inscription, among other things. On both sides the niche is formed from blocky [[pilaster]]s, topped by wide capitals. The goddess is dressed in a [[peplos]], the ''apoptygma'', or upper layer, of which is bound by a girdle at the waist. On the lower part, the robe is tightly fitted to her body, such that her calves are clearly visible underneath. The material covers up her ankles and feet, at the sides of it wrinkle lines go from it to the ground.
[[File:AthenaSömek2.jpg|thumb|left|Inscription]]
The right arm of the figure is raised and holds a lance. Her left, pointing down to the ground, holds a shield on edge. The lance rests on a column, which connects directly to the left pilaster. A snake winds around the lance and column, with its lower end reaching along the ground to Athena's feet. The head and mane of a bridled horse can be seen above the shield and left arm of the goddess and its hindquarters disappear behind her right arm. On the right pilaster there is a star, a crescent moon and a thunderbolt to be seen. Between the moon and the thunderbolt, traces of a servered head can be made out. Similar traces are found to the left of the left pilaster, which is itself undecorated. To the right of the righthand limit of the image, a symbol has been engraved, consisting of a stand with two crescent moons on top and a ball with star. Serra Durugönül, who investigated the Cilician rock reliefs in the 1980s, thought this was a candelabrum, that is a cult object, to be interpreted as a simplified depiction of a [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]].

Between the lance on the left and the female figure an inscription of 13 lines is engaved in a narrow field. In it the goddess is referred to as ΑΘΗΝΑ ΚΡΙΣΟΑ (Athena Krisoa);. The [[epithet]] ΚΡΙΣΟΑ, derived from a place name, indicates a local variant of the divinity, but the place connected with the epithet cannot yet be located. It would certainly have been found in the north of Rough Cilica, however.  The same epithet shows up in another inscription in the area and in both inscriptions Athena is also referred to as ΟΡΕΙΑ (Oreia, meaning "mountaindweller")&lt;ref&gt;On the cult of Athena Oreia, which is attested only in Cilicia, see Emanuela Borgia: ''Il culto di Athena Oreia in Cilicia.'' In: Michel Mazoyer (Hrsg.): ''La campagne antique: espace sauvage, terre domestiquée.'' Paris 2003, {{ISBN|2-7475-4977-1}}, S. 73–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation and Dating ==
The depiction of the goddess corresponds to the [[Athena Parthenos]] type, modelled on [[Phidias]]' free-standing statue in the [[Parthenon]] on the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]]. Numerous imitations of this statue were made even in ancient times - another one has also been found in Cilicia. Similarities with Phidias' original include, above all, the clothing, the shield and the column standing on the left. In the original statue, this was a support of the right hand, in wehich Athena held [[Nike (goddess)|Nike]]. Even though this no longer has a function, since this statue is carved in relief and doesn't hold Nike, the artist was unwilling to omit this characteristic attribute.

Particularly on account of the type of clam-shell vault of the relief, Durugönül identified two possible dates for the creation of the relief. The first would be the time of the Emperors [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]] in the 1st century, the second would be the period after [[Hadrian]] in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.  She inclines to the second, dating the relief to the 2nd century, on the basis of comparison with other rock reliefs of [[Asia Minor]], among which is that of a moongod at [[Sumatar Harabesi]] in [[Osrhoene]], which an inscription dates after 165.

The '''authority''' of a text is its reliability as a witness to the author's intentions. These intentions could be initial, medial or final, but intentionalist editors (most notably represented by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] editing school) generally attempt to retrieve final authorial intentions. The concept is of particular importance for textual critics, whether they believe that authorial intention is recoverable, or whether they think that this recovery is impossible. 

Here are some examples of authority:

* The only authority for the works of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Catullus]] derives from a lost manuscript, of which three copies reside in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France|National Library]] in Paris, the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]], and the [[Vatican Library]] in Rome (the ''Codex Vaticanus''). No one knows, or can ever know, how close this manuscript comes to [[Catullus]]' intentions—in other words, how great its authority is.
* It is generally thought that the Q1 ('[[Bad quarto]]') edition of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is an [[copyright infringement|unauthorized]] copy, reconstructed from memory by one of the actors. If this is so, then it has some authority, but much less than the first authorized quarto, Q2 (1602). In comparison, however, it might be a useful authority to the cuts and adaptations made in the performance it was based on.
* The [[First Folio]] edition of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1623) is the only authoritative source, since it is the copy-text of all future editions.
* A diary which is probably authentic has total authority.

A text's authority is made more problematic when it has more than one author, when it falsely asserts itself to be someone else's work, or when it is revised many times. For instance:

* The forged [[Hitler Diaries|diaries]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] have no authority as the work of their supposed author, but they do have authority as a witness to the intentions of [[Konrad Kujau]], the forger.
* A page on Wikipedia could be said to indicate the intentions of the aggregate of users who have edited it up to that point: it has multiple authority. But many of its editors will disagree with one another about what the page should contain. The idea of 'final intention' does not easily apply, since the page is never complete, and since a recent change (e.g. a piece of vandalism) might not be satisfactory to any of the other editors except the one who made it.
* The [[quarto]] edition of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]] differs from the later [[folio (printing)|folio]] edition in many ways. Most modern versions collate the two, preferring one edition in one passage and the other in another. But some editors, such as [[Stanley Wells]], argue they are separate works with different artistic intentions, and that neither of them has more authority.

Authority can also be related to a particular edition, especially if this edition reaches a degree of popularity.

[[File:H Hoffmann Struwwel 08.jpg|thumb|275px|Stories about playing with matches do not have [[happy ending]]s.  An illustration from "The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches" from ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', by [[Heinrich Hoffmann (author)|Heinrich Hoffman]], 1858.]]
A '''cautionary tale''' is a tale told in [[folklore]], to warn its listener of a [[Risk|danger]]. There are three essential parts to a cautionary tale, though they can be introduced in a large variety of ways.  First, a [[taboo]] or prohibition is stated: some act, location, or thing is said to be dangerous. Then, the narrative itself is told: someone disregarded the warning and performed the forbidden act. Finally, the violator comes to an unpleasant fate, which is frequently related in expansive and grisly detail.  

==Cautionary tales and conformity==
Cautionary tales are [[ubiquitous]] in [[popular culture]]; many [[urban legend]]s are framed as cautionary tales: from the lover's lane haunted by a hook-handed [[murder]]er to the tale of a man who shot a [[cactus]] for fun only to die when the plant toppled onto him. Like [[horror fiction]], generally the cautionary tale exhibits an ambivalent attitude towards social taboos.  The narrator of a cautionary tale is momentarily excused from the ordinary demands of [[etiquette]] that discourages the use of gruesome or disgusting imagery because the tale serves to reinforce some other social taboo.  

Cautionary tales are also frequently utilised to spread awareness of [[morality|moral]] issues, and for this reason are often told to children to make them conform to rules that either protect them or are for their own safety.

Those whose job it is to enforce [[conformity]] therefore frequently resort to cautionary tales. The [[German language]] anthology, ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', contains tales such as "Die gar traurige Geschichte mit dem Feuerzeug" (The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches); it is fairly easy to deduce the ending from the title.  [[Social guidance film]]s such as ''[[Boys Beware]]'' or ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' are deliberately patterned after traditional cautionary tales, as were the notorious [[driver's education]] films (''[[Red Asphalt]]'', ''[[Signal 30]]'') of the 1960s, or military films about [[syphilis]] and other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.  The framework of the cautionary tale became a [[cliché]] in the [[slasher film]]s of the 1980s, in which [[adolescent]]s who had [[sexual intercourse|sex]], drank [[alcoholic beverage]]s, or smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] inevitably ended up as the victims of the [[serial killer]] [[villain]].  

On the other hand, in the adolescent culture of the [[United States]], for more than a hundred years the traditional cautionary tale gave rise to the phenomenon of [[legend tripping]], in which a cautionary tale is turned into the basis of a dare that invites the hearer to test the taboo by breaking it.

==Reactions to cautionary tales==
The genre of the cautionary tale has been satirized by several writers. [[Hilaire Belloc]] in his ''[[Cautionary Tales for Children]]'' presented such moral examples as "Jim, Who ran away from his Nurse, and was eaten by a Lion", and "Matilda, Who told lies, and was Burned to Death". [[Lewis Carroll]], in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', says that Alice:

{{blockquote|"had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they ''would'' not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger ''very'' deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked "poison", it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later."}}

In ''[[The Complete Tribune Printer]]'', [[Eugene Field]] gave cautionary tales an ironic inversion, as in ''The Gun:''
{{blockquote|This is a gun. Is the Gun loaded? Really, I do not know. Let us Find out. Put the Gun on the table, and you, Susie, blow down one barrel while you, Charlie, blow down the other. Bang! Yes, it was loaded. Run quick, Jennie, and pick up Susie's head and Charlie's lower Jaw before the Nasty Blood gets over the New carpet.}}

Some films, such as ''[[Gremlins]]'', satirized this framework by imposing very arbitrary rules whose violation results in horrendous consequences for the community by not taking responsibility.

Cautionary tales are sometimes heavily criticized for their ham-fisted approach to [[ethics]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} ''[[The Cold Equations]]'' is a well-known example. In the story, a man has to eject a young woman out of the airlock, otherwise his rocket will not have enough fuel to deliver some badly needed serum, without which everyone at a small outpost would perish. Her death is justified because she ignored a 'no entry' sign, "when the laws of physics say no, they don't mean maybe", and no other solution would reduce the weight of the ship enough to complete the trip safely.

A '''criminal charge''' is a formal accusation made by a governmental authority (usually a [[Prosecutor|public prosecutor]] or the [[Police|police]]) asserting that somebody has committed a [[crime]].  A charging document, which contains one or more criminal charges or '''counts''', can take several forms, including:

* [[complaint]]
* [[information (formal criminal charge)|information]]
* [[indictment]]
* [[Summons#Citation|citation]]
* [[traffic ticket]]

The charging document is what generally starts a criminal case in [[court]]. But the procedure by which somebody is charged with a crime and what happens when somebody has been charged varies from country to country and even, within a country, from state to state.

Before a person is proven guilty, the charge must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref name="Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond A Reasonable Doubt|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Beyond+a+Reasonable+Doubt|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Punishment ==
There can be multiple punishments due to certain criminal charges. Minor criminal charges such as [[misdemeanor]]s, tickets, and infractions have less harsh punishments.  The judge usually sentences the person accused of committing the charges right after the hearing. The punishments generally include fines, suspension, probation, a small amount of jail time, or alcohol and drug classes. If the criminal charges are considered more serious like a [[felony]], then there is a more lengthy process for determining the punishment. Felonies include the most serious crimes such as [[murder]] and [[treason]]. In addition to the trial that decides innocence or guilt, there is a separate trial (after one is [[convicted]]) that determines the punishment(s) for the criminal charges committed.&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Larson|first=Aaron|title=Criminal Charges|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/criminal_charges.html|work=Law Offices of Aaron Larson|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights when facing criminal charges==
In the United States, people facing criminal charges in any situation are given rights by the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vinson|first1=Carl|title=Your Basic Constitutional Rights in the Criminal Justice System|url=https://www.georgialegalaid.org/resource/your-basic-constitutional-rights-in-the-crimi|website=GeorgiaLegalAid.org|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights include things like the [[right to remain silent]], [[habeas corpus]], and the [[right to an attorney]]. It is important for someone facing criminal charges to know their rights so they can take the proper action using their rights. Among those rights are a criminal suspect's [[Miranda Rights]] which are read to a suspect prior to interrogation while in the custody of the police. If a suspect is not given a Miranda warning prior to interrogation it is possible that the suspect's statements will be excluded from evidence in a later criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Geoffrey R.|title=The Miranda Doctrine in the Burger Court|journal=The Supreme Court Review|date=1977|volume=99|page=169|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/scr.1977.3109510?journalCode=scr|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prosecution ==
Many people avoid criminal charges by staying out of the state where they committed the crime. A person facing state criminal charges is always prosecuted in the state where they committed the charges.&lt;ref name=Cornell /&gt;  A person may be able to get away with minor violations like a ticket, but they will not be able to hide from something like a misdemeanor or a felony.  
There are about sixty criminal charges that are considered more serious that people face every day. These charges can range from less serious actions such as [[shoplifting]] or [[vandalism]] to more serious crimes such as [[murder]].&lt;ref name=FindLaw /&gt;

== Reckoning ==
A person may not even know if he/she was charged. If he/she is really worried, he/she can contact an [[Lawyer|attorney]] to ascertain if he/she was charged with any crime(s). A police officer may also charge someone after they investigate the possible crime(s) he/she committed.&lt;ref name="Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Procedure|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Criminal_procedure|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FindLaw&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finley|first1=Laura|title=Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia of Trends and Controversies|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1610699289|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3J1DQAAQBAJ|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[kylix]] depicting athletic combats is a ceramic drinking cup made approximately in the late [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] period, 490 B.C., in [[Attica]].&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt; It is currently in the Museum of Fine Arts Boston as part of The Ancient World Collections.&lt;ref name =ref1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/drinking-cup-kylix-depicting-athletic-combats-153754|title=Drinking cup (kylix) depicting athletic combats|date=2017-09-14|work=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist, Onesimos, uses red-figure technique for the decoration. [[Red-figure pottery|Red-figure]] technique was invented in Athens around 530 B.C. and quickly became one of the leading modes of decoration Athenian potters used.&lt;ref name =Author&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vase/hd_vase.htm|title=Athenian Vase Painting: Black- and Red-Figure Techniques {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Art|first=Author: Department of Greek and Roman|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red-figure technique was favored because it allowed for a greater representation of garments, emotions and anatomy making it useful for artists, such as Onesimos, to use in painting athletic events.&lt;ref name =Author/&gt;

== Onesimos ==
[[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]] was an artist who worked in Athens from 500-480 B.C.&lt;ref name=Getty1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/56/onesimos-greek-attic-active-500-480-bc/|title=Onesimos (Greek (Attic), active 500 - 480 B.C.) (Getty Museum)|website=The J. Paul Getty in Los Angeles|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name means "profitable" and it is speculated that is could have been a nickname&lt;ref name=Getty1/&gt; His name is known because of a cup that was found which also held the signature of the potter [[Euphronios]]. He almost exclusively painted cups and he favored realistic portrayals of the human body often painting athletic events and other activities that allowed for him to depict active poses.&lt;ref name="Onesimos - Oxford Reference"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Onesimos - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195300826.001.0001/acref-9780195300826-e-0702?rskey=IDDXGr&amp;result=703|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195300826.001.0001/acref-9780195300826-e-0702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pancration Foul Scene by the Foundry Painter
]]
The exterior sides of this kylix holds depictions for two athletic events: the [[Pankration|pancration]] and a wrestling match. The pancration was a popular athletic event in Ancient Greece and was introduced in 648 BCE to the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=Nenova&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/pankration/|title=Pankration|last=Nenova|first=Stella|date=February 9, 2016|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-10-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word pancration can be broken down into ''pan'' meaning all and ''kratos'' meaning strength or power and it was a form of ancient martial arts that combined both wrestling and boxing.&lt;ref name=Nenova/&gt; In Onesimos' depiction of the pancration there are two young boys wrestling, their youth evident from their lack of facial hair, and there are two trainers, one on either side of the them. One trainer is standing and the other is sitting next to a column that is holding what appears to be a prize cauldron.&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt; There is also another young boy standing next to the standing trainer. Scenes of the pancration were common among red-figure vessels depicting athletic events as is seen by the pancration scene by the Foundry Painter.

The other athletic event depicted is boxing. There are also two young boys with no facial hair engaged in the athletic act with the one on the left facing frontally towards the viewer. They being observed by a trainer on the left with a staff and staves in his hand and another young boy on the right. The boy standing on the right observing the young boxers appears to be in a stance of measuring the field and is also a mirror image of the boy observing in the pancration scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4171628|title=Masterpieces of Greek Vase Painting, about 1900 B.C.-340 B.C|last=Vermeule|first=Cornelius C.|date=1980|journal=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the background around the scene there are different objects that would typically be used in athletic events such as a two mattocks, a discus bag which appears to be on a wall, and jumping weights.&lt;ref name =ref1/&gt;

The tondo or the interior of this kylix holds an image on a youth holding a hare. His face is frontal facing the viewer and he is wearing a himation or a cloak around his shoulders and there is a walking stick in the background.&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

== Inscriptions ==
On the pancration scene there is one inscription that reads "Panaitios kalos" which is translated to "Panaitios is handsome".&lt;ref name =ref1/&gt; In many of his [[kalos inscription]]s, Onesimos uses the name Panaitios which misled many to believe that there was a Panaitios Painter whose work was earlier than Onesimos. It is now accepted, however, that the Panaitos Painter and Onesimos are the same.&lt;ref name="Onesimos - Oxford Reference"/&gt; In the boxing scene there are two inscriptions; one reading "Lukos kalos" or "Lykos is handsome" and the other on the discus bag reading "Kalos" or "handsome".&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt; The final inscription is found in the tondo and it reads "Ho pais kalos" or "The boy is handsome".&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

== Connection between kylixes and athletic training ==
Greek kylixes and other vessels during the Archaic period frequently depicted activities such as athletic training events that were favored by their users, the majority of which where part of the aristocracy.&lt;ref name="getty.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/10928/attributed-to-carpenter-painter-attic-red-figure-kylix-greek-attic-510-500-bc/|title=Attic Red-Figure Kylix (Getty Museum)|website=The J. Paul Getty in Los Angeles|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kylixes where often used at [[symposium]]s which were all male drinking parties. Symposiums were considered an integral part of Greek culture and was an activity reserved for only the most elite of society.&lt;ref name=symp&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Symposium/|title=Symposium|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was held in a private home where the men would get together to drink, eat, sing and discuss various topics such as philosophy and politics; the only women who were allowed to attend were high-class entertainers. It was an activity that served to reinforce the status and bond of the aristocracy.&lt;ref name=symp/&gt; Athletic events were also an important part of Greek culture as they believed in the importance of training their bodies just as much as they trained their minds.&lt;ref name=FAQ6&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/faq6.html|title=Ancient Olympic FAQ 6|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grecian youths of elite families would train under athletic trainers at a [[palaestra]] or a wrestling school.&lt;ref name=FAQ6/&gt; These training sessions where a key part of youth socialization in society.&lt;ref name="getty.edu"/&gt;

'''Elena M. Patron''' is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] scriptwriter, novelist, poet, dramatist, essayist, and magazine columnist.  Patron was one of the few [[women in the Philippines]] who ventured and succeeded in writing for [[Philippine comics]], a field that was dominated by [[Men in the Philippines|Filipino male]] writers.&lt;ref name=Komiks&gt;[http://komiklopedia.wordpress.com/2008/01/02/elena-m-patron/ Elena M. Patron by Komiklopedia on 2008/01/02], komiklopedia.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Patron was a writer for the women’s pages and movies sections of [[Liwayway]] magazine.  During her tenure as a writer-interviewer of showbusiness personalities, Patron was able to interview American actor [[Jeffrey Hunter]], American singer [[Paul Anka]], and some [[beauty queen]]s, among others.  Her magazine columns included ''Buhay May-asawa'' (Married Life), ''Psychopathic'', ''Munting-lupa'' (literally Small Portion of Land), and ''Alta-Sosyedad'' (High [level of] Society).   She became interested in scriptwriting and writing novels for the field of Philippine comics after her ''Mga Payo ni Ate Mameng'' (Older Sister Mameng’s Advice) column in the pages of Liwayway magazine was converted into comic book format.  Her first comic book novel was ''Kapatid Ko ang Aking Ina'' (My Sister is My Mother), a novel that was adapted into a film that gave her a [[Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Award]] (FAMAS Award) for best story.  Among her other novels were ''Isinilang Ko ang Anak ng Ibang Babae'' (I Gave Birth to the Child of Another Woman), ''Dalawa ang Nagdalantao sa Akin'' (There Were Two Who Became Pregnant for Me), ''Ako si Emma, Babae'' (I am Emma, a Woman), ''Padre, si Eba'' ([[Priest|Father]], This is [[Eve]]), ''Bago N’yo Ako Sumpain'' (Before You Curse Me), ''Lord, Give Me a Lover'', ''Ang Mukha ni Aniana'' (Aniana's Face), ''Eladia'', ''Sa Lilim ng Ilang-Ilang'' (Under the Shade of the [[Ilang-ilang]] Tree), ''Cara'', ''Bibo'' ([[wikt:dapper|Dapper]]), and ''Sleeping Beauty''. Her ''Sleeping Beauty'' was a prominent novel in Aliwan Komiks.  During the 1990s, upon the decline of Philippine comics readership, Patron moved into writing novels for [[Tagalog-language]] [[paperback]]s, locally known as [[Tagalog pocketbooks]].&lt;ref name=Komiks/&gt;

==Film adaptation==
Among Patron’s novels that had been adapted into films included ''Lord, Give Me a Lover'', ''Adult Kid'', ''Ako si Emma, Babae'' (I am Emma, a Woman), ''Isinilang Ko ang Anak ng Ibang Babae'' (I Gave Birth to the Child of Another Woman), ''Pompa'', ''Dalawa ang Nagdalantao sa Akin'' (There Were Two Who Became Pregnant for Me), ''Padre, si Eba'' (Father, This is Eve), ''Bago N’yo Ako Sumpain'' (Before You Curse Me), ''Ligaw-Tingin, Halik-Hangin'' (Courtship Through Gazing, Kissing in the Wind [undemonstrated desire to court and kiss a person admired; the suitor can only look at the admired woman, unable to get closer, a kisser of empty space]), and ''Kape’t Gatas'' (literally Coffee and Milk; figuratively Brown and White [referring to skin color]).&lt;ref name=Komiks/&gt;

==Awards==
Apart from her FAMAS-award-winning novel ''Kapatid Ko ang Aking Ina'', Patron obtained awards from The Citizen’s Council for Mass Media (CCMM), Starlight Cultural Foundation, Komiks Operation Brotherhood, Inc. (KOMOPEB), and the Catholic Mass Media.&lt;ref name=Komiks/&gt;

==Family==
Patron was married to Angel T. delos Angeles, an insurance consultant.  She is the mother of one offspring, Angelo Ardee.&lt;ref name=Komiks/&gt;

'''Eugène Siberdt''', '''Eugeen Siberdt''' or '''Eugène François Joseph Siberdt'''&lt;ref&gt;Name also written as: 'Eugeen Frans Josef Siberdt' and 'Eugeen Frans Jozef Siberdt"&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Antwerp]], 21 April 1851 – Antwerp, 6 January 1931) was a [[Belgian]] [[Academic art|Academic]], late-[[Romanticism|Romantic]] painter who created portraits, history paintings, genre scenes and [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/72395 Eugène Siberdt] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is now mainly known as the professor of drawing at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Antwerp Academy]] whose conflict with [[Vincent van Gogh]] led to van Gogh leaving the Antwerp Academy after only three months of attendance.&lt;ref name=gogh&gt;Steven Naifeh, Gregory White Smith, 'Van Gogh: The Life", Random House Publishing Group, 18 Oct 2011, p. 448-489&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Eugène Siberdt was born in Antwerp where he trained at the Antwerp Academy under [[Edward Du Jardin]], [[Polydore Beaufaux]], Van Leprous and [[Nicaise de Keyser]].

He was awarded the [[Prix de Rome (Belgium)|Prix de Rome]] (Second Place) in 1873. From 1874, Siberdt commenced exhibiting at all the important Belgian salons with success.  He was a successful portrait painter and became the Official Royal Portraitist.
[[File:Eugene Siberdt - The little gamblers.jpg|thumb|360px|left|The little gamblers]]

Siberdt was appointed a professor at the Antwerp Academy in 1883.&lt;ref name=knohl&gt;[http://www.theknohlcollection.com/portfolio/detail/farewell-dear-frane/  Eugene Siberdt, ''Farewell Dear France''] at the Knohl Collection&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent van Gogh started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886.  Here van Gogh quickly got into trouble with [[Charles Verlat]], the director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style.  Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class [[Franz Vinck]].  Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by Siberdt.  Soon Siberdt and van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt's requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line.  When van Gogh was required to draw the [[Venus of Milo]] during a drawing class, he produced the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to van Gogh’s drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper. Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt: 'You clearly do not know what a young woman is like, ''God damn it!'' A woman must have hips, buttocks, a pelvis in which she can carry a baby!'  According to some accounts this was the last time van Gogh attended classes at the Academy and he left later for Paris.&lt;ref name=gogh/&gt; On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including van Gogh, had to repeat a year. The story that van Gogh was expelled from the Academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded.&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[http://janlampo.com/category/romantiek/ Jan Lampo, ''In het Spoor van de Academie – persbericht]'' {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eugene Siberdt - Portrait of governor baron Edward Osy de Zegwaart.jpg |thumb|250px|Governor baron Edward Osy de Zegwaart]]

About ten years after the incident with van Gogh, Siberdt was involved in a conflict with [[Eugeen Van Mieghem]], another student who did not wish to submit to the academic rigour of the Antwerp Academy.  This also led to Van Mieghen leaving the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanmieghemmuseum.com/main.php?lang=NL Eugeen Van Mieghem	(1875-1930) – een kunstenaar van het volk] at the Eugeen Van Mieghem Museum {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Eugène Siberdt was a typical representative of the late-Romantic style as developed in Belgium by pupils and teachers of the Antwerp Academy.  In particular, the influence of [[Henri Leys]] remained paramount at the Academy throughout the second half of the 19th century in style as well as subject matter.&lt;ref name=ac&gt;'Contradicties: 350 jaar Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen : 1663-2013'; 2013 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teachers at the Academy encouraged their students to study the antique, draw precisely and stick to the sober and somber palette typical of 19th century academic painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmska.be/en/Onderzoek/Ensor/ERP_palet.html Ensor's palette] at the KMSKA website&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between Siberdt and van Gogh is best seen as a conflict between van Gogh's unconventional view of art and the academic view represented by Siberdt.&lt;ref name=lam/&gt;

As a typical representative of the academic tradition of the Antwerp academy, Siberdt painted subjects such as genre scenes often of a sentimental nature such as ''[[:File:Eugène Siberdt - Sad omen.Jpeg|The sad omen]]'', stories from the glorious national artistic history such as ''[[:File:Eugene Siberdt - Erasmus and Quentin Matsys.jpg|The meeting between Erasmus and Quentin Matsys]]'' or international historic events such as ''[[:File:Eugene Siberdt - Martin Luther Translating the Bible, Wartburg Castle, 1521.jpg|Martin Luther translating the bible]]''.  The historic scenes were typically set in the 16th and 17th century, de period during which Antwerp enjoyed its cultural and commercial heyday.  Stories from [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']] were also a recurring theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualart.com/Artwork/2-works--The-pact-between-Faust-and-Meph/48F46016F2F9F9FA Eugene Siberdt, 2 works]: The pact between Faust and Mephisto; Martha and Margaret with a jewelry box, at Mutual Art&lt;/ref&gt; Siberdt further created history paintings with biblical subjects such as ''[[:File:Eugène Siberdt - The Prophet Nathan rebukes King David.jpg|The Prophet Nathan rebukes King David]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mayfairgallery.com/index.php?location=item&amp;item=19480&amp;section=recent The Prophet Nathan rebukes King David by Eugène Siberdt] at Mayfair Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

Siberdt painted many [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] compositions.  These often depict [[Romani people|Roma]] women or harems such as ''[[:File:Eugene Siberdt - The jewels of a Harem.jpg|The jewels of a Harem]]''. The latter painting also reflected the contemporary interest in the theme of the [[harem]] and the ''[[odalisque]]'' in Orientalism.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Thornton, ''Women as Portrayed in Orientalist Painting'', www.acr-edition.com, 1994, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Siberdt was a capable portrait painter who was sought after by private and official patrons.&lt;ref name=knohl/&gt;

'''Giacomo Ernesto Eduardo Di Chirico''' (27 January 1844 &amp;ndash; 26 December 1883) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]]. Together with [[Domenico Morelli]] and [[Filippo Palizzi]], he was one of the most elite [[:it:Pittura napoletana|Neapolitan artists]] of the 19th century. 
==Biography==
Giacomo Di Chirico was born in [[Venosa]] into a [[carpenter]]'s family, the younger son of Luigi and Caterina Savino.  In 1847, when Di Chirico was barely 3 years old, his father Luigi died, leaving the family [[impoverished]].  He attended a private school for boys from deprived families under the supervision of [[priest]] Giuseppe Gianturco, the brother of politician [[:it:Emmanuele Gianturco|Emanuele Gianturco]].  He began working at a [[barber]]shop in order to support his family economically but had become passionate about his [[painting]] hobby, after learning basic art techniques from his older brother, Nicola, a [[sculptor]].

Di Chirico had begun to create portraits of his customers, who expressed admiration for his work, and local citizens who saw his portraits began to request them.  Feeling stimulated from such interest and their appreciation, Di Chirico decided to become a professional painter.  He obtained a subsidy salary from the municipality of Venosa, was enrolled in the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Napoli|Academy of Fine Arts of Naples]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accademianapoli.it/istituzioni-e-societa/ Academy of Art in Naples&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated after he had demonstrated optimal results from the studies.

In 1865, Di Chirico became a disciple of [[Francesco de Sanctis (critic)|Francesco de Sanctis]], who taught him lessons in literature for two years.

Between 1868 and 1871, Di Chirico refined his artistic technique while living in [[Rome]], further strengthening his friendship with [[Domenico Morelli]] and [[:it:Filippo Palizzi|Filippo Palizzi]].  He returned to Naples in order to open an art studio.

During his career, Di Chirico created masterpieces such as ''Buoso da Duera'', ''Quinto Orazio Flacco'', ''Corteggiamento'' and ''Donna lucana''. ''Sposalizio in Basilicata'', one of his best known paintings, was exposed in [[Paris]] (1877), [[Vienna]] (1879) and [[Munich]] (1882).  It was purchased by the French merchant [[Adolphe Goupil]].  Di Chirico's works were exposed at the [[Goupil &amp; Cie]] in [[Paris]].  He received the title [[Order of the Crown of Italy|Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy]] from [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].

Between 1877 and 1878, Di Chirico was made an honorary professor at the Academy of Art in Naples.  He spent August ([[Ferragosto]]) in [[Maiori]], where he met his wife Emilia D’Amato.  He remained with her for the rest of his life and they had a daughter named Maria. One of his pupils was [[Pietro Scoppetta]].

As his artistic career continued to reach new heights, so did the rise of his activity until 1882, when Di Chirico began to exhibit symptoms of [[mania]], [[sleep deprivation]] and [[cachexia]], a pattern of ailments that overlapped with the Dutch painter [[Vincent van Gogh's health|Vincent van Gogh's illness]]. Di Chirico was confined to the Provincial lunatic asylum for his mental illness. In the asylum, his physical health continued to deteriorate, and he died during treatment in Naples in 1883 at age 39.

The '''''Harriet Tubman Memorial,''''' also known as '''''Step on Board''''', is located in [[Harriet Tubman Park]] in the [[South End, Boston|South End]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartboston.com/content/step-board-harriet-tubman-memorial|title=Step on Board / Harriet Tubman Memorial » Public Art Boston|website=www.publicartboston.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It honours the life of abolitionist [[Harriet Tubman]]. It was the first memorial erected in Boston to a woman on city-owned property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wgbh.org/basicBlack/episodeDetail.cfm?featureid=8222&amp;rssid=1|title=Basic Black|website=www.wgbh.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial is a 10-foot tall [[bronze]] sculpture by artist [[Fern Cunningham]] and depicts Tubman leading a small group of people. She holds a Bible under her right arm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The figures are backed by a vertical slab, on the reverse of which is a diagram of the route Tubman took when accompanying passengers on the [[Underground Railroad]], and several quotes by and about Tubman.

The inscription on the back of the memorial reads:

&lt;poem&gt;
''Step On Board''
HARRIET ROSS TUBMAN
1820 - 1913

''Go Down Moses, Way Down in Egypt's Land,''
''Tell Old Pharoah - Let My People Go''

''There are two things I've got a right to,''
''and these are death or liberty. One or another''
''I mean to have. No one will take me back alive.''
              &amp;mdash;Harriet Tubman

''The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the''
''witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism.''
              &amp;mdash;[[Frederick Douglass]]

''Tell my brothers to be always watching unto prayer,''
''and when the good old ship of Zion comes along,''
''to be ready to step aboard.''
              &amp;mdash;Harriet Tubman

''She expected deliverance when she prayed,''
''unless the Lord had ordered otherwise.''
              &amp;mdash;[[Sarah Bradford]]
&lt;/poem&gt;

Locations along the Underground Railroad are shown along an arc: Canada, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, New York City, Philadelphia, Delaware, and Maryland.

'''''Historia Histrionica''''' is a [[1699 in literature|1699]] literary work by [[James Wright (antiquarian)|James Wright]] (1643-1713), on the subject of theatre in England in the seventeenth century. It is an essential resource for information on the actors and theatrical life of the period, providing data available nowhere else.

The work's full title is '''''Historia Histrionica: An historical account of the English stage shewing the ancient use, improvement, and perfection of dramatick representations in this nation. In a dialogue of plays and players.''''' The original 1699 [[book size|octavo]] edition, published anonymously, was printed by G. Groom for the bookseller William Hawes. (His shop was at the sign of the Rose, in Ludgate Street.)

As its title indicates, the work is cast in the form of a dialogue between two abstract figures, Lovewit and Trueman; Trueman imparts to Lovewit (and to the reader) his knowledge of theatrical matters. The author, James Wright (1643&amp;ndash;1713), was an attorney and occasional poet, and a collector of old plays. Along with [[Gerard Langbaine]] and [[John Downes (prompter)|John Downes]], Wright was one of the earliest historians of British theatre.

''Historia Histrionica'' was reprinted in the twelfth volume of [[Robert Dodsley]]'s collection of old plays,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dodsley, ed., ''A Select Collection of Old Plays'', London, 1744.&lt;/ref&gt; and included in subsequent editions of that work. Wright's essay remains a valuable resource for modern scholars of the subject and the period.&lt;ref&gt;Dale B. J. Randall, ''Winter Fruit: English Theatre 1642&amp;ndash;1660'', Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995; pp. 43-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Alan King, ''The Gendering of Men, 1600&amp;ndash;1750: The English Phallus'', Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2004; pp. 96-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Menzer, ed., ''Inside Shakespeare: Essays on the Blackfriars Stage'', Selinsgrove, PA, Susquehanna University Press, 2006; pp. 54-5, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Wright also published ''Country Conversations'' (1694), in which he compares late seventeenth-century theatre to earlier theatre by Shakespeare, Jonson, Massinger, and others.

'''Hittite art'''  was produced by the [[Hittites|Hittite civilization]] in ancient [[Anatolia]], in modern-day [[Turkey]], and also stretching into [[Syria]] during the second millennium BCE from the nineteenth century up until the twelfth century BCE. This period falls under the Anatolian [[Bronze Age]]. It is characterized by a long tradition of canonized images and motifs rearranged, while still being recognizable, by artists to convey meaning to a largely illiterate population. &lt;blockquote&gt;“Owing to the limited vocabulary of figural types [and motifs], invention for the Hittite artist usually was a matter of combining and manipulating the units to form more complex compositions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sculpture and Sculptors of Yazılıkaya|last=Alexander|first=Robert L.|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Newark|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many of these recurring images revolve around the depiction of [[Hittite mythology and religion|Hittite deities and ritual practices]]. There is also a prevalence of hunting scenes in Hittite relief and representational animal forms. Much of the art comes from settlements like [[Alaca Höyük]], or the Hittite capital of [[Hattusa]] near modern-day [[Boğazkale]]. Scholars do have difficulty dating a large portion of Hittite art, citing the fact that there is a lack of inscription and much of the found material, especially from burial sites, was moved from their original locations and distributed among museums during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canby|first=Jeanny Vorys|date=1989-01-01|title=Hittite Art|jstor=3210203|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|volume=52|issue=2/3|pages=109–129|doi=10.2307/3210203}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, larger period groupings have been established by some, including the Colony Age, the [[Hittite Old Kingdom]] Era, and the period of the [[Hittite Empire]].

== The Colony Age ==
Historians refer to the period around the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries B.C.E. as the Colony Age, before a larger Hittite Kingdom was established in the region. Groups in settlements of this period included [[Hattians]], [[Hurrians]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] living in trading colonies, which the Hittites took control of when they moved into the area. The art style of this time involved assimilation of previous Anatolian symbols and sensibilities. Before this period and during the third millennium, art in ancient [[Anatolia]] consisted of rather flat representations of human figures found at burial sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was emulated in Hittite ivories like one of a young girl, half seated, cupping her breasts, and wearing a traditional cap.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Most of the objects available from the second millennium come in the mediums of carved ivories, baked clay, and small seals. A group of ivories from Acemhöyük, now housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] of New York, includes a small [[sphinx]] with long curls of hair over its chest that art historians refer to as Hathor curls. As for seals, while there were more traditional [[cylinder seal]]s, the composition of these Hittite [[stamp seal]]s did not include a ground-line, and thus the figures are free floating. Deities have been identified such as weather gods who stand on bulls or mountains. This image is repeated in later Imperial [[rock relief]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hittite people of the Colony Age took on and incorporated the motifs from the previous civilizations they asserted control over, mimicking indigenous art styles, including in the depiction of animals such as deer, lions, bulls, and raptors like eagles. A common piece is animal-shaped [[rhyton]]s, or drinking vessels, which could be sculpted out of clay or later metalwork. The raptors in particular are exceptionally well-shaped.  The [[Hüseyindede vases]] are examples of a type of elaborate pottery vase with animal figures and other decoration in [[relief]]; other pieces in this style have been found. 
[[File:Furniture support- female sphinx with Hathor-style curls MET DP110464.jpg|thumb|left|Ivory Hittite Sphinx, 18th century B.C.E.]]

== Old Hittite Kingdom ==
Moving into the seventeenth century when the Hittites formed a larger state with their capital at Hattusa, the art style began incorporating larger and more permanent pieces such as stone [[relief]]s in addition to the continuing tradition of seals. In more recent years, pieces that were thought to belong to this period have been moved to the Empire period, and it may be that some Empire works are actually from the Hittite Old Kingdom. Hittite seals could be made of anything from baked clay to gold. In addition to surviving objects, some knowledge of these seals also comes from the impressions they left on ceramics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Figures in the Old Kingdom period became more wiry, and were depicted in more violent situations. This is true for seals, reliefs, and small 3-dimensional figures. A common subject for art at this time was conflict among divine figures and struggles for power, which was not represented as much during the Hittite Empire. Other scenes, like one relief on the neck of a silver rhyton housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depict gods during hunts. There is a sense of temporal progression in the images of this piece, as there is a deer living and being confronted, and then lying conquered and prone further along the rim. There is also an assumption of spiritual connotations in this piece in regards to a "Protector God of the Wild Fields".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Hittite Empire ==
[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 1320163 nevit.jpg|thumb|Scene from Alaca Höyük Sphinx Gate]]
Beginning in the fourteenth century and lasting into the twelfth century, this period saw even more creation of large-scale relief sculpture, and figures represented tend to be more solid, with thicker proportions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Much of the art found from the Hittite Empire Period comes from the settlement of Alaca Höyük. It is unclear which ancient city this correlates to, however it has been argued that it could be Tawiniya, [[Arinna]], Hanhana, or [[Zippalanda]]. The most common opinion among scholars is that it is the holy city of Arinna, because of its proximity to the capital of Hattusa and the ritual practices depicted in art there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taracha|first=Piotr|date=June 2012|title=THE SCULPTURES OF ALACAHÖYÜK: A Key to Religious Symbolism in Hittite Representational Art|url=|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|volume= 75|pages=108–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A much-studied monument in this area that is argued to have been constructed at this time is a stone gate flanked by two carved sphinxes and cyclopean blocks covered in unfinished reliefs of a religious procession and hunting scenes. This procession depicts Hittite royalty and six priests approaching a god in the form of a bull, and a cast of entertainers including acrobats and jesters on ladders. The hunting scenes are on blocks directly above this procession. However, there is disagreement among scholars as to the exact construction date of this structure. Some place it between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, while others argue that it belongs in the second half of the thirteenth century. The guardians wear the long Hathor curls common to Hittite sphinxes since at least the eighteenth century BCE and were carved out of single blocks of stone 13&amp;nbsp;ft high and 6.5&amp;nbsp;ft thick.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another monument is the King's Gate leading into the temple district of in the upper city of Hattusa. Here a low relief of a god, 7&amp;nbsp;ft tall, looms.

Other reliefs of the Hittite exist on non-man-made structures. While some Hittite [[rock relief]]s do not have inscriptions, and thus are difficult to date, others can be attributed to the reigns of specific kings such as [[Ḫattušili III]], or [[Muwatalli II]]. Relief scenes from ancient [[Sam'al]], in modern Zincirli Höyük, include a procession of gods on one wall and an image of a king named [[Tudḫaliya I|Tudḫaliya]] on the wall opposite it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are a number of large recumbent lions in stone, of which the [[Lion of Babylon (statue)|''Lion of Babylon'']] statue at [[Babylon]] is the largest, if it is indeed Hittite.

The ceramic works produced at this time, apart from rare decorative pieces, was mainly plain with simple forms and a focus on utility and function. Hittites did make use of [[potter's wheel]]s, as well as the free sculpting of more animalistic forms. The forms and production methods were fairly consistent across the Empire. A piece from the village of [[Gordium|Gordion]], on the fringes of the Empire, could greatly resemble a piece from the capital, Hattusa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henrickson|first=Robert C.|date=June 1995|title=Hittite Pottery and Potters: The View from Late Bronze Age Gordion|url=|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|volume= 58| issue =  2|pages=82–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A small stone seal bearing [[Anatolian Hieroglyphs|Hittite hieroglyphics]] has been discovered in [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], indicating trade outside the Empire. It also confirms the diplomatic ties with Egypt indicated by the Hittite-Egyptian Treaty, since Megiddo is an important stopping point for ambassadorial messengers between the two regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Itamar|date=June 1995|title=A Hittite Seal from Megiddo|url=|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|volume= 58| issue =  2|pages=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Hittite==
After the fall of the Hittite Empire many aspects of Hittite art and culture continued in [[Syro-Hittite states|smaller city-states]] in south-eastern Anatolia, as well as modern northern Iraq and most of Syria; [[Carchemish]] was the largest of these.  Older Hittite elements were increasingly mixed with Assyrian and other influences. The terms "Late Hittite", "Neo-Hittite" and "Syro-Hittite" are all used to describe this period and its art, which lasted until the states were conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], by around 800 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Gilibert, 2&lt;/ref&gt;  This period marked the transition into the [[Iron Age]], beginning around 1200 BCE in this region.&lt;ref&gt;Gilibert, 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the states were much smaller, public sculpture increased, with many statues, and ceremonial exterior paths lined with [[orthostat]]s or stone slabs carved with reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gilibert, 60-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rock reliefs==
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|left|Hittite deities at [[Yazılıkaya]]]]
The Hittites were important producers of rock reliefs, which form a relatively large part of the few artistic remains they have left.&lt;ref name="Bonatz"&gt;Bonatz&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Karabel relief]] of a king was seen by [[Herodotus]], who mistakenly thought it showed the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Sesostris]].&lt;ref&gt;Harmanşah (2014a), 88–89; [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/hist13.html Livius.org on "The relief of Sesostris" in Herodotos' ''Histories'' 2.102–103, 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  This, like many Hittite reliefs, is near a road, but actually rather hard to see from the road.  There are more than a dozen sites, most over 1000 metres in elevation, overlooking plains, and typically near water. These perhaps were placed with an eye to the Hittite's relation to the landscape rather than merely as rulers' propaganda, signs of "landscape control", or border markers, as has often been thought.&lt;ref&gt;Harmanşah (2014a), 90–94; Ullmann, Lee Z., in Harmanşah (2014), Chapter 8; though see also Bonatz&lt;/ref&gt;  They are often at sites with a sacred significance both before and after the Hittite period, and apparently places where the divine world was considered as sometimes breaking through to the human one.&lt;ref&gt;Harmanşah (2014a), 92&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Yazılıkaya]], just outside the capital of [[Hattusa]], a series of reliefs of Hittite gods in procession decorate open-air "chambers" made by adding barriers among the natural rock formations.  The site was apparently a sanctuary, and possibly a burial site, for the commemoration of the ruling dynasty's ancestors. It was perhaps a private space for the dynasty and a small group of the elite, unlike the more public wayside reliefs. The usual form of these is to show royal males carrying weapons, usually holding a spear, carrying a bow over their shoulder, with a sword at their belt.  They have attributes associated with divinity, and so are shown as "god-warriors".&lt;ref name="Bonatz"/&gt;

Other rock reliefs include the [[İvriz relief]], [[Manisa relief]], [[Hanyeri relief]], [[Fıraktın relief]], [[Gökbez relief]], [[İmamkullu relief]], and [[Hemite relief]].

'''Hybrid beasts''' appear in the [[folklore]] of a variety of cultures as [[legendary creature]]s.

==In burial sites==
Remains similar to those of mythological hybrids have been found in burial sites discovered by archaeologists. Known combinations include horse-cows, sheep-cows, and a six-legged sheep. The skeletons were formed by ancient peoples who joined together body parts from animal carcasses of different species. The practice is believed to have been done as an offering to their gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/weird-horse-cows-6-legged-sheep-found-iron-age-burials-n395871|title=Horse-Cows? Bizarre 'Hybrid' Animals Found in Ancient Burials|publisher=LiveScience|author=Laura Geggel|date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
These forms' [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s appear across cultures in many [[mythologies]] around the world.

Such hybrids can be classified as partly human hybrids (such as [[mermaid]]s or [[centaur]]s) or non-human hybrids combining two or more non-human animal species (such as the [[griffin]] or the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]]). Hybrids often originate as [[zoomorphic]] deities who, over time, are given an [[anthropomorphic]] aspect.

===Paleolithic===
Partly human hybrids appear in [[petroglyph]]s or [[cave painting]]s from the [[Upper Paleolithic]], in [[shamanism|shamanistic]] or [[totemism|totemistic]] contexts. Ethnologist Ivar Lissner theorized that [[cave paintings]] of beings combining human and animal features were not physical representations of mythical hybrids, but were instead attempts to depict [[shaman]]s in the process of acquiring the mental and spiritual attributes of various beasts or [[power animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Steiger 1999"&gt;{{cite book| last=Steiger| first= B.| year=1999| title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shape-Shifting Beings| location=Farmington Hills, MI| publisher=Visible Ink| isbn=1-57859-078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]] has observed that beliefs regarding animal identity and [[shapeshifting|transformation into animals]] are widespread.&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;{{cite book | last=Eliade | first=Mircea | title=Rites and Symbols of Initiation: the mysteries of birth and rebirth | publisher=Harper &amp; Row | year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the [[Vinca culture]] of [[Neolithic Europe]] in particular is noted for its frequent depiction of an owl-beaked "[[bird goddess]]".&lt;ref&gt;a term of [[Marija Gimbutas]]', see e.g. ''The language of the goddess: unearthing the hidden symbols of western civilization'' San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row; London: Thames and Hudson (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Seth + Horus = 2 terres.jpg|thumb|The falcon-headed Horus and crane-headed Seth.]]
Examples of humans with animal heads ([[theriocephaly]]) in the [[ancient Egyptian pantheon]] include jackal-headed [[Anubis]], cobra-headed [[Amunet]], lion-headed [[Sekhmet]], falcon-headed [[Horus]], etc. Most of these deities also have a purely zoomorphic and a purely anthropomorphic aspect, with the hybrid representation seeking to capture aspects of both of which at once. Similarly, the [[Gaul]]ish ''[[Artio]]'' sculpture found in [[Berne]] shows a juxtaposition of a bear and a woman figure, interpreted as representations of the theriomorphic and the anthropomorphic aspect of the same goddess.

Non-human hybrids also appear in ancient Egyptian iconography as in [[Ammit]] (combining the [[crocodile]], the [[lion]], and the [[hippopotamus]]).

===Ancient Middle East===
Mythological hybrids became very popular in [[Luwian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian|Assyrian]] art of the [[Late Bronze Age]] to [[Early Iron Age]]. The angel (human with birds' wings, see [[winged genie]]) the mermaid (part human part fish, see [[Enki]], [[Atargatis]], [[Apkallu]]) and the [[Shedu]] all trace their origins to Assyro-Babylonian art. In [[Mesopotamian mythology]] the ''urmahlullu'', or lion-man served as a guardian spirit, especially of bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Black, Jeremy A. and Anthony Green |title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-292-70794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiggermann |first=F. A. M. |title=Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts |publisher=Styx |year=1992 |isbn = 90-72371-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Babylonian [[Lilitu]] demon, particularly as shown in the [[Burney Relief]] (part-woman, part-owl) prefigures the [[harpy]]/[[Siren (mythology)|siren]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]].

===Mediterranean===
[[File:Zeus Typhon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 596.jpg|thumb|[[Zeus]] darting his lightning at [[Typhon]], shown as a hybrid with a human torso, bird's wings and a reptilian lower body (Chalcidian black-figured [[hydria]], c. 550 BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] Inv. 596).]]

In [[Archaic Greece]], Luwian and Assyrian motifs were imitated, during the [[Orientalizing Period]] (9th to 8th centuries BC), inspiring the monsters of the [[Greek mythology|mythology]] of the [[Classical Greek period]], such as the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], the [[Harpy]], the [[Centaur]], the [[Griffin]], the [[Hippocampus (mythology)|Hippocampus]], [[Talos]], [[Pegasus]], etc.

The motif of the winged man appears in the Assyrian [[winged genie]], and is taken up in the Biblical [[Seraphim]] and [[Chayot]], the Etruscan [[Vanth]], Hellenistic [[Eros]]-[[Cupid|Amor]], and ultimately the Christian iconography of [[angel]]s.

The motif of otherwise human figures sporting [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s may derive from partly [[goat]] hybrids (as in [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and the [[Devil]] in Christian iconography) or as partly [[Bull (mythology)|bull]] hybrids ([[Minotaur]]). The [[Gundestrup cauldron]] and the [[Pashupati]] figure have [[stag]]'s [[antlers]] (see also [[Horned God]], [[horned helmet]]). The Christian representation of [[Moses]] with horns, however, is due to a mistranslation of the Hebrew text of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:29–35 by [[Jerome]].

===Hinduism===
[[File:Ganesh mimarjanam EDITED.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Street festivities in [[Hyderabad, India]], during the festival of [[Ganesha Chaturthi]].]]
The most prominent hybrid in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] iconography is [[elephant]]-headed [[Ganesha]], god of wisdom, knowledge and new beginnings.

Both [[Nāga]] and [[Garuda]] are non-hybrid mythical animals ([[snake]] and [[bird]], respectively) in their early attestations, but become partly human hybrids in later iconography.

The [[Hindu deities|god]] [[Vishnu]] is believed to have taken his first four [[incarnation]]s in human-animal form, namely: [[Matsya]] ([[human]] form with [[fish]]'s body below waist), [[Kurma]] (human form with [[turtle]]'s body below waist), [[Varaha]] (human form with a [[boar]]'s head), [[Narasimha]] (human form with [[lion]]'s head).

[[Kamadhenu]], the [[mythical]] cow which is considered to be the mother of all other [[cattle]] is often portrayed as a cow with human head, [[peacock]] tail and bird wings.

Large number of artifacts came to the West and were exhibited and sold to an eager audience.]]

First described by French art critic and collector [[Philippe Burty]] in 1872, '''Japonism''', from the [[French language|French]] '''''Japonisme''''', is the study of Japanese art and artistic talent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme in Britain: Whistler, Menpes, Henry, Hornel and nineteenth-century Japan|last=Ono|first=Ayako|publisher=Routledge Curzon|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japonism affected fine arts, sculpture, architecture, performing arts and decorative arts throughout Western culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term is used particularly to refer to Japanese influence on [[European art]], especially in [[impressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japonism|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Japonism|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ukiyo-e ==
From the 1860s, ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', Japanese [[wood-block print|woodblock print]]s, became a source of inspiration for many Western artists.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bickford|first=Lawrence|year=1993|title=Ukiyo-e Print History|jstor=42597774|journal=Impressions|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukiyo-e began as a Japanese painting school developed in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1976|title=Defining Ukiyo-e|jstor=42597582|journal=Impressions|publisher=Japanese Art Society of America|volume=1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukiyo-e woodblock prints were created to fit a demand for inexpensive, souvenir images.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Although the prints were inexpensive, they were innovative and technical which gave each one value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanesque: The Japanese Print in the Era of Impressionism|last=Breuer|first=Karin|publisher=Prestel Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prints were rarely created with a single patron in mind, rather they were created for the commercial market in Japan.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Although a percentage of prints were brought to the West through Dutch trade merchants, it was not until the 1860s that ukiyo-e prints gained popularity in Europe.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Western artists were intrigued by the original use of color and composition. Ukiyo-e prints featured dramatic [[foreshortening]] and asymmetrical compositions.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==History==

===Seclusion (1639–1858)===

[[File:Deksel, beschilderd met bamboe en prunus en twee vogels. Met bijbehorende pot (A).jpeg|thumb|left|[[Chantilly porcelain]] pot, painted with bamboo and prunus and two birds. 1730–1735]]

During the [[Edo period]] (1639–1858), Japan was in a period of seclusion and only one international port remained active.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme: Cultural Crossings Between Japan and the West.|last=Phaidon|first=|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]], ordered that an island, Dejima, be built off the shores of Nagasaki from which Japan could receive imports.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Dutch were the only country able to engage in trade with the Japanese, however, this small amount of contact still allowed for Japanese art to influence the West.&lt;ref&gt;Gianfreda, Sandra. "Introduction." In ''Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh… Japanese Inspirations'', edited by Museum Folkwang, Essen, 14. Gottingen: Folkwang/Steidl, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Every year the Dutch arrived in Japan with fleets of ships filled with Western goods for trade.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme: Cultural Crossings Between Japan and the West|last=Phaidon|first=|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cargoes arrived many Dutch treatises on painting and a number of Dutch prints.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Shiba Kōkan]] (1747–1818) was one of the notable Japanese artists that studied the Dutch imports.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Shiba Kōkan|Kōkan]] created one of the first etchings in Japan which was a technique he had learned from one of the imported treatises.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Shiba Kōkan|Kōkan]] would combine the technique of [[linear perspective]], which he learned from a treatise, with his own ukiyo-e styled paintings.

==== Seclusion era porcelain ====
Through the seclusion era, Japanese goods remained a sought after luxury by European monarchs.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme: Cultural Crossings Between Japan and the West|last=Phaidon|first=|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese porcelain manufacturing began in the seventeenth century after the unearthing of [[kaolin clay]] near Nagasaki.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Japanese manufacturers were aware of the popularity of porcelain in Europe, therefore, some products were specifically produced for the Dutch trade.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Porcelain and lacquerware became the main exports from Japan to Europe.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Chisaburo, Yamada. "Exchange of Influences in the Fine Arts between Japan and Europe." ''Japonisme in Art: An International Symposium'' (1980): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Porcelain was used to decorate the homes of monarchs in the Baroque and Rococo style.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A popular way to display porcelain in a home was to create a porcelain room. Shelves would be placed throughout the room to display the exotic decorations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Nineteenth century re-opening===
[[File:Appert Frères - Carp Vase - Walters 47384 - Profile.jpg|thumb|Carp Vase designed by Eugène Rousseau and made by [[Appert Frères]],  1878–84]]
During the [[Kaei era]] (1848–1854), after more than 200 years of [[Sakoku|seclusion]], foreign merchant ships of various nationalities began to visit Japan. Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, Japan ended a long period of national isolation and became open to imports from the West, including photography and printing techniques. With this new opening in trade, Japanese art and artifacts began to appear in small curiosity shops in Paris and London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme: Japanese Influence on French Art 1854-1910|last=Cate|first=Phillip Dennis|last2=Eidelberg|first2=Martin|last3=Johnston|first3=William R.|last4=Needham|first4=Gerald|last5=Weisberg|first5=Gabriel P.|publisher=Kent State University Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=Kent|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Japonism began as a craze for collecting Japanese art, particularly [[ukiyo-e]]. Some of the first samples of ukiyo-e were to be seen in Paris.&lt;ref name="Thirion"&gt;Yvonne Thirion, "Le japonisme en France dans la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle à la faveur de la diffusion de l'estampe japonaise", 1961, Cahiers de l'Association internationale des études francaises, Volume 13, Numéro 13, pp. 117–130, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/caief_0571-5865_1961_num_13_1_2193 www.persee.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1856 the French artist [[Félix Bracquemond]] first came across a copy of the sketch book ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'' at the workshop of his printer, Auguste Delâtre.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme: Japanese Influence on French Art 1854-1910|last=Cate|first=Phillip Dennis|last2=Eidelberg|first2=Martin|last3=Johnston|first3=William R.|last4=Needham|first4=Gerald|last5=Weisberg|first5=Gabriel P.|publisher=Kent State University Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=Kent|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketchbook had arrived in Delâtre's workshop shortly after Japanese ports had opened to the global economy in 1854; therefore, Japanese artwork had not yet gained popularity in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Japanese Print in the Era of Impressionism|last=Breuer|first=Karin|publisher=Prestel Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following this discovery, there was an increase of interest in Japanese prints. They were sold in curiosity shops, tea warehouses, and larger shops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shops such as ''La Porte Chinoise'' specialized in the sale of Japanese and Chinese imports.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''La Porte Chinoise,'' in particular, attracted artists [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Edgar Degas]] who drew inspiration from the prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme: Japanese Influence on French Art 1854-1910|last=Cate|first=Phillip Dennis|last2=Eidelberg|first2=Martin|last3=Johnston|first3=William R.|last4=Needham|first4=Gerald|last5=Weisberg|first5=Gabriel P.|publisher=Kent State University Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=Kent|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Godwinsideboard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edward William Godwin]] designed a number of Japanese-inspired pieces, including this [[Sideboard (Edward William Godwin)|sideboard]], 1867–70]]
European artists at this time were seeking an alternative style to the strict academic methodologies.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanesque: The Japanese Print in the Era of Impressionism|last=Breuer|first=Karin|publisher=Prestel Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatherings organized by shops like ''La Porte Chinoise'' facilitated the spread of information regarding Japanese art and techniques.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Artists and movements==
[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|Advertising poster for the comic opera ''[[The Mikado]]'', which was set in Japan (1885)]]Ukiyo-e was one of the main Japanese influences on Western art. Western artists were attracted to the colorful backgrounds, realistic interior and exterior scenes, and idealized figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanesque: The Japanese Print in the Era of Impressionism|last=Breuer|first=Karin|publisher=Prestel Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis was placed on diagonals, perspective, and asymmetry in ukiyo-e, all of which can be seen in the Western artists who adapted this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanesque: The Japanese Print in the Era of Impressionism|last=Breuer|first=Karin|publisher=Prestel Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to study each artist as an individual who made unique innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme: Japanese Influence on French Art 1854-1910|last=Cate|first=Phillip Dennis|last2=Eidelberg|first2=Martin|last3=Johnston|first3=William R.|last4=Needham|first4=Gerald|last5=Weisberg|first5=Gabriel P.|publisher=Kent State University Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=Kent|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Van Gogh - Portrait of Pere Tanguy 1887-8.JPG|thumb|''Portrait of Père Tanguy'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]], an example of [[Ukiyo-e]] influence in Western art (1887)]]

=== Vincent van Gogh and woodblock color palettes ===
{{main|Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)}}
[[Vincent van Gogh]] began his deep interest in Japanese prints when he discovered illustrations by Félix Régamey featured in ''The Illustrated London News'' and ''Le Monde Illustré.''&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Thomson, Belinda. "''Japonisme'' in the Works of Van Gogh, Gaugin, Bernard and Anquetin." In Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh… Japanese Inspirations, edited by Museum Folkwang, Essen, 70. Gottingen: Folkwang/Steidl, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Régamey created woodblock prints, followed Japanese techniques, and often depicted scenes of Japanese life.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Van Gogh used Régamey as a reliable source for the artistic practices and everyday life scenes of the Japanese. Beginning in 1885, van Gogh switched from collecting magazine illustrations, such as Régamey, to collection ukiyo-e prints that could be bought in small Parisian shops.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Van Gogh shared these prints with his contemporaries and organized a Japanese print exhibition in Paris in 1887.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Van Gogh's ''Portrait of Pere Tanguy'' (1887) is a portrait of his color merchant, Julien Tanguy. Van Gogh created two versions of this portrait, which both feature a backdrop of Japanese prints.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Belinda. "''Japonisme'' in the Works of Van Gogh, Gaugin, Bernard and Anquetin." In Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh… Japanese Inspirations, edited by Museum Folkwang, Essen, 71. Gottingen: Folkwang/Steidl, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the prints behind Tanguy can be identified, with artists such as [[Hiroshige]] and [[Kunisada]] featured. Van Gogh filled the portrait with vibrant colors. He believed that buyers were no longer interested in grey-toned Dutch paintings, rather paintings with many colors were seen as modern and were sought after.&lt;ref name="Thomson, Belinda 2014"&gt;Thomson, Belinda. "''Japonisme'' in the Works of Van Gogh, Gaugin, Bernard and Anquetin." In Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh… Japanese Inspirations, edited by Museum Folkwang, Essen, 72. Gottingen: Folkwang/Steidl, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was inspired by Japanese woodblock prints and their colorful palettes. Van Gogh included into his own works the vibrancy of color in the foreground and the background of paintings that he observed in Japanese woodblock prints and made use of light to clarify.&lt;ref name="Thomson, Belinda 2014"/&gt;

=== Edgar Degas and Japanese prints ===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Mary Cassatt at the Louvre The Etruscan Gallery - Edgar Degas.jpg|thumb|Edgar Degas, ''Mary Cassatt at the Louvre: The Etruscan Gallery,'' 1879-1880. Aquatint, drypoint, soft-ground etching, and etching with burnishing, 26.8 x 23.6 cm.]]
In the 1860s, [[Edgar Degas]] began to collect Japanese prints from ''La Porte Chinoise'' and other small print shops in Paris.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme: Japanese Influence on French Art 1854-1910|last=Cate|first=Phillip Dennis|last2=Eidelberg|first2=Martin|last3=Johnston|first3=William R.|last4=Needham|first4=Gerald|last5=Weisberg|first5=Gabriel P.|publisher=Kent State University Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=Kent|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degas’ contemporaries had begun to collect prints as well which gave him a large collection for inspiration.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Among the prints shown to Degas was a copy of Hokusai's ''Random Sketches'' which had been purchased by Bracquemond after seeing it in Delâtre's workshop.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The estimated date of Degas’ adoption of Japonism into his prints is 1875.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Japanese print style can be seen in Degas’ choice to divide individual scenes by placing barriers vertically, diagonally and horizontally.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Similar to many Japanese artists, Degas’ prints focus on women and their daily routines.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme: Japanese Influence on French Art 1854-1910|last=Cate|first=Phillip Dennis|last2=Eidelberg|first2=Martin|last3=Johnston|first3=William R.|last4=Needham|first4=Gerald|last5=Weisberg|first5=Gabriel P.|publisher=Kent State University Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=Kent|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atypical positioning of his female figures and the dedication to reality in Degas’ prints aligned him with Japanese printmakers such as Hokusai, Utamaro, and Sukenobu.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Degas' print ''Mary Cassatt at the Louvre: The Etruscan Gallery'' (1879-1880), the commonalities between Japanese prints and Degas' work can be found in the two figures: one that stands and one that sits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanesque: The Japanese Print in the Era of Impressionism|last=Breuer|first=Karin|publisher=Prestel Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of the figures was familiar in Japanese prints. Degas also continues the use of lines to create depth and separate space within the scene.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Degas' most clear appropriation is of the woman leaning on a closed umbrella which is borrowed directly from Hokusai's ''Random Sketches.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanesque: The Japanese Print in the Era of Impressionism|last=Breuer|first=Karin|publisher=Prestel Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== James McNeill Whistler and British Japonism ===
Japanese art was exhibited in Britain beginning in the early 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme in Britain: Whistler, Menpes, Henry, Hornel and nineteenth-century Japan|last=Ono|first=Ayako|publisher=Routledge Curzon|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exhibitions featured a variation of Japanese objects, including maps, letters, textiles and objects from everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme in Britain: Whistler, Menpes, Henry, Hornel and nineteenth-century Japan|last=Ono|first=Ayako|publisher=Routledge Curzon|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exhibitions served as a source of national pride for Britain and served to create a separate Japanese identity apart from the generalized "orient" cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme in Britain: Whistler, Menpes, Henry, Hornel and nineteenth-century Japan|last=Ono|first=Ayako|publisher=Routledge Curzon|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was an American artist who worked primarily in Britain. During the late 19th century, Whistler began to reject the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] style of painting that his contemporaries favored. Instead, Whistler found simplicity and technicality in the Japanese aesthetic.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme in Britain: Whistler, Menpes, Henry, Hornel and nineteenth-century Japan|last=Ono|first=Ayako|publisher=Routledge Curzon|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than copying specific Japanese artists and artworks, Whistler was influence by general Japanese methods of articulation and composition which he integrated into his works.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, Whistler refrained from depicting Japanese objects in his paintings; instead, he used compositional aspects to infuse a sense of exoticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme in Britain: Whistler, Menpes, Henry, Hornel and nineteenth-century Japan|last=Ono|first=Ayako|publisher=Routledge Curzon|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler's ''The Punt'' (1861) displayed his interest in asymmetrical compositions and dramatic uses of foreshortening. This composition style would not be popular among his contemporaries for another ten years, however it was a characteristic of earlier [[Ukiyo-e]] art.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japonisme in Britain: Whistler, Menpes, Henry, Hornel and nineteenth-century Japan|last=Ono|first=Ayako|publisher=Routledge Curzon|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gustav Klimt ===
[[File:Gustav Klimt 047.jpg|right|200px]]
The most well-known japonised painting of [[Gustav Klimt]] is [[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II|The Second Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer]]. In the last style of Klimt, he was influenced by a Norwegian fuavist.

==Japanese gardens==
[[File:Claude Monet, French - The Japanese Footbridge and the Water Lily Pool, Giverny - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]]'s garden in Giverny with the Japanese footbridge and the water lily pool (1899)]]
The aesthetic of Japanese gardens was introduced to the English-speaking world by Josiah Conder's ''Landscape Gardening in Japan'' ([[Kelly &amp; Walsh]], 1893). It sparked the first Japanese gardens in the West. A second edition was required in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Slawson 1987:15 and note2.&lt;/ref&gt; Conder's principles have sometimes proved hard to follow:
{{quote|Robbed of its local garb and mannerisms, the Japanese method reveals aesthetic principles applicable to the gardens of any country, teaching, as it does, how to convert into a poem or picture a composition, which, with all its variety of detail, otherwise lacks unity and intent&lt;ref&gt;Conder quoted in Slawson 1987:15.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Samuel Newsom's ''Japanese Garden Construction'' (1939) offered Japanese aesthetic as a corrective in the construction of [[rock garden]]s, which owed their quite separate origins in the West to the mid-19th century desire to grow alpines in an approximation of Alpine [[scree]].  According to the Garden History Society, the [http://www.mizenfineart.com/en/blog/  Japanese] landscape gardener Seyemon Kusumoto was involved in the development of around 200 gardens in the UK. In 1937 he exhibited a rock garden at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]], and worked on the Burngreave Estate at Bognor Regis, a Japanese garden at [[Cottered]] in Hertfordshire, and courtyards at [[Du Cane Court]] in London.

The impressionist painter [[Claude Monet]] modeled parts of his garden in Giverny after Japanese elements, such as the bridge over the lily pond, which he painted numerous times. By detailing just on a few select points such as the bridge or the lilies, he was influenced by traditional Japanese visual methods found in ''ukiyo-e'' prints, of which he had a large collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giverny.fr/en/information/cultural-information/giverny-collection-of-japanese-prints-of-claude-monet/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fondation-monet.com/en/giverny-2/the-japanese-prints/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genevieve Aitken, Marianne Delafond. ''La collection d'estampes Japonaises de Claude Monet''. La Bibliotheque des Arts. 2003. {{ISBN|978-2884531092}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also planted a large number of native Japanese species to give it a more exotic feeling.

== Museums ==
In the United States, the fascination with Japanese art extended to collectors and museums creating significant collections which still exist and have influenced many generations of artist.  The epicenter was Boston in no small part due to [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]], a pioneering collector of Asian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/294884928|title=Journeys east : Isabella Stewart Gardner and Asia|last=1957-|first=Chong, Alan,|date=2009|publisher=Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum|others=Murai, Noriko., Guth, Christine., Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.|isbn=1934772755|location=[Boston]|oclc=294884928}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] now houses the finest collection of Japanese art outside Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/asia|title=Art of Asia|date=2010-10-15|work=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Freer Gallery of Art]] and the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]] house the largest Asian art research library in the United States and house Japanese art together with the Japanese influenced works of Whistler.

==Plot==
[[File:Jerrica benton jem.jpg|thumb|left|frameless|Jem and her true identity Jerrica Benton.]] The series revolves around Jerrica Benton, the owner and manager of Starlight Music and, as Jem, lead singer of the rock group Jem and the Holograms. Jerrica adopts the [[persona]] of Jem with the help of a [[holography|holographic]] computer, known as Synergy, which was built by Jerrica's father to be "the ultimate audio-visual entertainment synthesizer" and is bequeathed to her after his death. Jerrica is able to command Synergy to project the hologram of Jem over herself by means of the remote micro-projectors in her earrings, thus disguising her features and clothing, enabling her to assume the Jem persona. Jem, through the use of her earrings, is also able to project holograms around her and uses this ability throughout the series to avoid danger and provide special effects for the performances of her group.

Jem's group, the Holograms, consists of Kimber Benton, Jerrica's younger sister, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]], and main [[songwriter]] for the band; Aja Leith, [[Electric guitar|guitarist]]; and Shana Elmsford, who plays the synth [[drum]]s. Aja and Shana are also childhood friends and adopted [[foster care|foster]] sisters of Jerrica and Kimber, having lived with the Benton family since they were young. Shana briefly leaves the group to pursue a career in fashion, at which point a new character, Carmen "Raya" Alonso, is introduced as her replacement. The Holograms are aware of Jem's secret identity and the existence of Synergy when the series begins, while Raya is made aware unintentionally shortly before joining the group. Upon her return to the Holograms, Shana becomes the band's [[Bass guitar|bassist]].

The Holograms have two rival bands: the Misfits and the Stingers. The Misfits are composed of petulant rich girl Pizzazz (real name Phyllis Gabor) and her cohorts: no-nonsense guitarist Roxy (Roxanne Pelligrini) and kind-hearted, sensitive [[keytar]] player Stormer (Mary Phillips). They are joined later by the manipulative [[United Kingdom|British]] [[saxophone|saxophonist]] Jetta (Sheila Burns).

The Stingers debut on the third season when they cause disruptions for both groups by becoming co-owners of Stinger Sound with Eric Raymond. Originally from Germany, the Stingers are composed of egotistical lead singer Riot (Rory Llewelyn), guitarist/con artist Rapture (Phoebe Ashe), and keyboardist Minx (Ingrid Kruger). (The real names of Minx and Rapture are not disclosed in any of the installments.)

Episodes of the series frequently revolve around Jerrica's efforts to keep her two identities separate, protect Synergy from those who might exploit the holographic technology, and support the twelve foster children known as the Starlight Girls who live with her and the Holograms. The Misfits frequently attempt to upstage Jem and the Holograms' endeavors, often nearly resulting in physical harm to members of the group. This rivalry is encouraged and manipulated by their manager and central villain in the series, Eric Raymond, former half-owner of Starlight Music who runs Misfits Music (later Stinger Sound).

During the series, Eric Raymond constantly plots to become owner of Starlight Music and get revenge on Jem and the Holograms for having cost him control of the company. Jerrica also deals with a complex and emotionally draining faux [[love triangle]] involving her alter identity, Jem, and Rio Pacheco, longtime boyfriend of Jerrica. Rio romantically pursues both women, not knowing they are one and the same. Later in the series, Jem is also romantically sought after by Riot, who becomes infatuated with her – adding further complications to her relationships.

In the final episode of the series, the Misfits and Jem declare a truce when Ba Nee, one of the most troubled foster girls in Starlight House, is claimed by her long-lost father. Her father is found by Jem and the Holograms with the help of Riot's father. Riot's relationship with his father is mended with the help of Jem.&lt;ref name="jem_bible"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Christy|last=Marx|url=http://www.christymarx.com/tolist/jemsx.htm| title=JEM bible| year=1986|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

===Conception and staffing===
[[Hasbro]] hired advertising agency [[Griffin-Bacal Advertising]], the founders of [[Sunbow Entertainment|Sunbow Productions]], to create the 65-episode animation series. Griffin-Bacal ([[Sunbow]]), as well as [[Marvel Productions]], had previously created the successful ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' series for [[Hasbro]]. ''G.I. Joe'' writer [[Christy Marx]] was hired to create the series based on the line of dolls and the original concept, which consisted of the two girl bands, Synergy, the boyfriend Rio, and the Rockin' Roadster. Marx created the full character biographies and relationships, including the love triangle aspect between Rio and Jerrica Benton/Jem, Starlight Music and Starlight House, the Starlight Girls, the villain Eric Raymond and various secondary characters. Later, Marx was asked to develop new characters as they were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/interview-christy-marx-creator-of-jem-and-the-holograms|title=Interview: Christy Marx, Creator of Jem and the Holograms|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx wrote 23 of the 65 episodes. Other writers for the series included [[Cary Bates]], [[Greg Weisman]], [[Paul Dini]], [[Buzz Dixon]], [[Ellen Guon]], Steve Mitchell, [[Michael Reaves]], [[David Wise (writer)|David Wise]], [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Mary Skrenes]], Beth Bornstein, [[Roger Slifer]], Richard Merwin, Sandy Fries, Cheri Wilkerson, Misty Stewart-Taggart, [[George Arthur Bloom]], Jina Bacarr, Barbara Petty, Chris Pelzer, Michael Charles Hill, Eric Early, Clare Noto, Carla Conway and Evelyn A. R. Gabai.

The Executive Producers were Joe Bacal, Jay Bacal, Tom Griffin and [[Margaret Loesch]]. The story editor was [[Roger Slifer]] and [[Christy Marx]] featuring industry veteran [[Wally Burr]] as the series' voice director. The series' directors and supervising animators included many veterans of the [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] cartoon studio including [[Gerry Chiniquy]], John Gibbs, [[Norman McCabe|Norm McCabe]], [[Warren Batchelder]] and [[Tom Ray]].

===Casting===
[[Samantha Newark]] provided the speaking voices of Jem and Jerrica. Despite having toured as a child singer in Africa, she did not do the singing for Jem. The voiceover cast never auditioned for the music side of the series and vice versa. The music for Jem was all cast and recorded in New York and Atlanta and the voiceover actors were cast and recorded in Burbank, California. They matched the speaking voices of the cast to the singing voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/samantha_newark.html |title=Samantha Newark – Jem and the Hologrmas| author= Danielle Henbest| accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Britta Phillips]], who had never before worked professionally as a singer, was cast as the singing voice of Jem after obtaining an audition through her father who worked on [[jingle]]s in New York. The initial take from the audition was used as the first opening theme song, "Truly Outrageous".&lt;ref name="britta" /&gt; The remaining Holograms speaking voices were provided by Cathianne Blore (Kimber Benton/Aja Leith), Cindy McGee (Shana Elmsford), and [[Linda Dangcil]] (Carmen 'Raya' Alonso).

The Misfits' speaking voices were provided by Patricia Alice Albrecht (Phyllis "Pizzazz" Gabor), Samantha Paris/Bobbie Block (Roxanne "Roxy" Pellegrini), [[Susan Blu]] (Mary "Stormer" Phillips), and Louise Dorsey (Sheila "Jetta" Burns), the daughter of [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]. Ellen Bernfeld provided the singing voice of Pizzazz.

The Stingers' speaking voices were provided by [[Townsend Coleman]] (Rory "Riot" Llewelyn), [[Ellen Gerstell]] (Phoebe "Rapture" Ashe), and [[Kath Soucie]] (Ingrid "Minx" Kurger). Gordon Grody, a vocal coach who later worked with [[Lady Gaga]], provided the singing voice for Riot.&lt;ref name="grody"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | isbn = 9781466873018 | last = Childs | first = T.

Other notable cast members included [[Charlie Adler]], who had already had a lengthy voice-over career, as the central villain Eric Raymond. He also provided the voices of both of Eric's major henchmen Zipper and Techrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mkbmemorial.com/adler/bio.html|title=Official Charlie Adler Site: Biography|accessdate=2011-09-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402221553/http://mkbmemorial.com/adler/bio.html|archivedate=2012-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late [[Vicki Sue Robinson]], famous for the 1970s discothèque-oriented hit "[[Turn the Beat Around]]", who provided the singing voices of both Rapture and Minx, and Ari Gold, pop singer and songwriter, who provided the singing voice for Ba Nee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Jem" (1985) – Full cast and crew|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090461/fullcredits|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of music videos in ''Jem'' was a result of the success and popularity of [[MTV]] at the time which began airing four years prior. The placement of the songs throughout each episode was done to complement the story and the use of music videos in the show was considered "radical" for the time. The show contains a total of 187 music videos with 151 unique songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=2011 |title=Jem and the Holograms: The Truly Outrageous Complete Series |publisher=Shout!

The series' format called for three fully produced songs for the featured music videos in each episode. Anne Bryant composed the music. Lyrics for the show's featured songs were written by Barry Harman. The theme song "JEM{{spaced ndash}}Truly, Truly, Truly Outrageous" was the opening and closing theme for the show until late 1987, when Bryant's second theme, "JEM GIRLS" became the series' opening theme for the majority of episodes and "JEM{{spaced ndash}}Truly, Truly, Truly Outrageous" was kept as the show's permanent closing theme.&lt;ref name=shout_joe_bacal&gt;Joe Bacal. Commentary. ''Jem and the Holograms: The Truly Outrageous Complete Series''. 2011. DVD. Shout! Factory, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Music videos featured an "in-your-face" style that was directed at the viewer or the more traditional style. The music videos paralleled the style of rock videos found on MTV at the time featuring fast editing, a quick pace, and special effects.&lt;ref&gt;Christy Marx. Commentary.

Ellen Bernfeld, performing as Pizzazz, [[Britta Phillips]], performing as Jem, and Gordon Grody, performing as Riot, the lead singer of the Stingers, along with Diva Gray, Florence Warner and Angela Capelli were the voices of the pop, funk and punk electronica productions, supported by Britta Phillips's father, pianist Peter Phillips, and by guitarist Steve Bill, bassist Tom Barney and set drummer and electronic drum programmer Tom Oldakowski. Anne Bryant, who chose the singers and musicians, created a pure young pop sound for Jem and the Holograms supported by acoustic instruments. The sound for the Misfits was crafted as strictly electronic other than the addition of guitars and an occasional sax solo when the character of Jetta was introduced into the Misfits. This was done to create an identifiable punk electronica style in stark contrast to their rival singing groups. In season three, Bryant introduced the slower, smooth, sexy/funky groove for the third group that entered the show, the Stingers.&lt;ref name="britta"&gt;{{cite news|title= Cartoon Character Puts Singer Into Spotlight |publisher= Sun Sentinel|date=|url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-12-22/features/8702130145_1_demo-hasbro-theme-song|accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No official ''Jem'' soundtrack was ever released; however, many of the songs from the first season were released on cassette with dolls or play-sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jem Tapes ID page|url=http://www.pranceatron.com/jem/jemtapes.htm|accessdate=2011-09-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127064736/http://pranceatron.com/jem/jemtapes.htm|archivedate=2011-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Jem'' was the #1 [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] rated syndicated cartoon series in November 1986 and in 1987 it was the third most watched children's program in syndication with 2.5 million viewers weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Salas|first=Tersas|title=TV Licensing Changes Channels To Avoid Program Overflow|journal=Playthings|date=June 1987|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jem'' has aired in multiple countries including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[West Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[United States]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.wiredprnews.com/2011/06/16/hey-pop-culture-fans-jem-is-back-on-tv_2011061620002.html |title= Hey Pop Culture Fans – "JEM" is back on tv |date=2011-06-16|accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was nominated for the [[Young Artist Award]] twice, once in 1986 for "Exceptional Young Actresses in Animation: Series, Specials, or Film Features" for [[Samantha Newark]]'s performance, then in 1988 for "Best Animation Series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms8.htm|title=8th Annual Awards|accessdate=2011-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ww3JB2pY?url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms8.htm|archivedate=2011-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms10.htm|title=10th Annual Awards|accessdate=2011-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XlsvpxJ4?url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms10.htm|archivedate=2015-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-standing popularity of [[Mattel]]'s [[Barbie]] franchise led to a competition between [[Hasbro]]'s Jem product line and [[Barbie and the Rockers]], a similar product line by Mattel. This resulted in reduced sales for both products. Hasbro discontinued the Jem toyline at the end of 1987 after it failed to meet sales expectations, but despite this, the series continued production and aired until 1988. ''Jem'' was partially released on DVD in multiple countries, with a complete set available for the first time in 2011. The same year, ''Jem'' began airing on [[Discovery Family|The Hub]] in the United States, causing a significant increase in the ratings for the channel. It also aired on [[Teletoon Retro]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=TELETOON Canada inc.|date=2011-07-25|url=http://www.teletoon.com/media/2011/english/press/teletoon-fall2011.pdf|title=TELETOON Canada Announces an Unreal Fall Lineup that Will Make You Jump Out of Your Seat|accessdate=2011-09-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927231920/http://www.teletoon.com/media/2011/english/press/teletoon-fall2011.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manga-distribution.fr/md/index.php?script=produit_dvd&amp;ref=1037|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929182240/http://www.manga-distribution.fr/md/index.php?script=produit_dvd&amp;ref=1037|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-09-29|title=Jem et les Hologrammes – Intégrale – Pack 3 Coffrets DVD – DVD Manga – Animation – Achat de DVD à petit prix|accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Jem – The Complete 1st &amp; 2nd Seasons|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/10248/jem-the-complete-1st-2nd-seasons/|accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christy Marx has long expressed a desire to make a modern-day revival of the animated series, but stated in a 2004 interview that there are a great deal of complications concerning the rights to the ''Jem'' properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jemcon.org/?q=about|title=About|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I would like to see that happen. I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but the whole rights situation for ''Jem'' is very, very complicated. Believe me, if there were a simple straightforward way to do it, it would be done. But there are some very big complications that are in the way at the moment.|Christy Marx}}

===Reruns===
After almost 20 years, since last airing in the United States in 1993 on the USA Network (in re-runs), ''Jem'' returned to syndication. The series aired reruns on The Hub Network/Discovery Family from May 31, 2011 to November 15, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://press.discovery.com/us/hub/press-releases/2011/hub-tv-network-generates-truly-outrageous-rec-1344/|title=The Hub Tv Network Generates 'Truly Outrageous' Record Ratings with Holiday Weekend Sneak Peek Preview of Summer Programming : Discovery Press Web|publisher=Discovery Communications|date=2011-06-01|accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Getzler|first=Wendy|url=http://kidscreen.com/2011/04/29/the-hub-brings-back-80s-and-90s-animation/ |title=The Hub brings back '80s and '90s animation|work=Kidscreen|date=April 29, 2011|accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2011, [[Teletoon Retro]], a Canadian channel dedicated to cartoons, announced that ''Jem'' would be part of its fall 2011 lineup.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; On April 5, 2012, [[Hasbro]] announced that ''Jem'', along with several other Hasbro franchises, will be available on [[Netflix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=662179|title=Hasbro Studios Signs Multi-Year Deal with Netflix to Provide Its Award-Winning Content across Multiple Platforms in the U.S.|publisher=Hasbro Inc.

On September 8, 2011, [[Hasbro]] issued a press release announcing its attendance at the 2011 [[New York Comic Con]] convention, which ran from October 13 to October 16. The press release stated that Hasbro would be showing new and upcoming products from its toy lines at its booth, including ''Jem and the Holograms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=604101|title=Hasbro Announces New York Comic Con Debut and Title Sponsorship of "NYCC Kids!|last=Benkwitt|first=Daniel|work=Hasbro Inc.|date=September 8, 2011|accessdate=September 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018151818/http://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=604101|archive-date=2011-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2012, [[Integrity toys|Integrity Toys, Inc.]] announced their plans to release a brand-new series of collectible fashion dolls based on the TV series. The special edition Hollywood Jem doll became available at the Hasbro Toy Shop booth during Comic-Con International in San Diego at an approximate retail price of $135.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashiondollreview.blogspot.com/2012/06/jem-and-holograms-san-diego-comic-con.html|title=THE FASHION DOLL REVIEW: Jem and the Holograms - a San Diego Comic Con Exclusive|first=Alison|last=Rasmussen|date=27 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jem doll sold out on day two of the convention.&lt;ref&gt;http://kjemradio.wordpress.com/2012/07/14/breaking-news-hollywood-jem-sold-out-at-sdcc{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
2011 saw Hasbro release a one-off comic book titled ''Unit:E'' as an exclusive at the New York Comic-Con; this was created by "HasLab" as a potential multi-brand crossover platform. The plot depicted Synergy, now an alien artificial intelligence, assisting the descendant of Acroyear and a Biotron from ''[[Micronauts]]'' in searching for heroes to help him combat Baron Karza; she shows them characters from ''G.I. Joe'', ''Transformers'', ''Battleship Galaxies'', ''[[Stretch Armstrong]]'', ''[[Action Man]]'', ''[[M.A.S.K.]]'' and ''[[Candy Land]]'', amongst others; Jerrica herself is shown as not having taken up the Jem identity yet, but will eventually compose the "Music of the Spheres" (presumably with Synergy's aid). The comic, however, was never followed-up.

The Jem comic book was released by [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] in March 2015: written by [[Kelly Thompson]], art by [[Sophie Campbell]] and colors by M. Victoria Robado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.idwpublishing.com/shop/jem-holograms-1/ |title=Jem and the Holograms #1 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=[[IDW Publishing]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic book offers a modern re-imagining of the series with new character designs and different situations, such as the Holograms and the Misfits being unsigned bands at the start with Eric Raymond being hired as the Misfits' manager during the second story arc. In addition, Kimber and Stormer begin a romantic relationship. As of Issue #16, which is Campbell's final issue as regular artist, The Stingers have been introduced to the series, with Raya being featured as a fourth member of the band. The title's current status within the new [[Hasbro Comic Book Universe]] (consisting of several new or relaunched titles, using the IDW ''Transformers'' comics as the backbone for a cohesive universe) has been somewhat erratic; IDW writers have generally indicated that, while characters from ''Jem'' will not show up in crossovers (including the ''Revolution'' mini-series that launched the universe), they do exist and will receive occasional references. The series ended on June 14, 2017, with issue #26, but a six-issue miniseries--''Jem &amp; the Holograms: Infinite #1 and Jem &amp; the Holograms: Misfits Infinite #1'' was released later in the month.&lt;ref name=cbr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/jem-holograms-finale-kelly-thompson-gisele-lagace/|title=INTERVIEW: Kelly Thompson &amp; Gisèle Lagacé Take A Bow On Jem and the Holograms, But An Encore Is Coming|date=6 June 2017|work=cbr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, IDW's then President Greg Goldstein announced the possibility for a new ''Jem'' comic book series for 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/41062/icv2-interview-idw-publisher-president-greg-goldstein-part-2?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter|title=ICV2 INTERVIEW: IDW PUBLISHER AND PRESIDENT GREG GOLDSTEIN, PART 2|publisher=ICv2|date=August 6, 2018|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
{{main article|Jem and the Holograms (film)}}
After the success of ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]'' films, [[Hasbro]] began considering a live-action film adaptation or a new incarnation of the animated series with [[Universal Studios]], with which Hasbro had signed a six-film contract in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowles |first=Dustin |url=http://www.pajiba.com/trade_news/jem-and-the-holograms-movie.php |title=Jem and the Holograms Coming to the Big Screen? |publisher=Pajiba.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[Hasbro Studios]] with [[Legacy Recordings]] released its first non-soundtrack album, ''Truly Outrageous: A Tribute to Starlight Records'' on August 7, 2015. The record was part of the promotion of the [[Jem and the Holograms (film)|Jem film]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3665">In [[mathematics]], the  '''Jucys&amp;ndash;Murphy elements''' in the [[group algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_n] &lt;/math&gt; of the [[symmetric group]], named after [[Algimantas Adolfas Jucys]] and G. E. Murphy, are defined as a sum of [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]]s by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;X_1=0, ~~~  X_k= (1 k)+ (2 k)+\cdots+(k-1\ k), ~~~ k=2,\dots,n. &lt;/math&gt;

They play an important role in the [[representation theory]] of the [[symmetric group]].

==Properties==
They generate a commutative subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [ S_n] &lt;/math&gt;. Moreover,
''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; commutes with all elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_{n-1}] &lt;/math&gt;.

The vectors constituting   the basis of Young's "seminormal representation"   are eigenvectors for the action of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  For any [[standard Young tableau]] ''U'' we have:

:&lt;math&gt;X_k v_U =c_k(U) v_U, ~~~ k=1,\dots,n, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U'') is the ''content'' ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' of the cell (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') occupied by  ''k'' in the standard Young tableau&amp;nbsp;''U''.

'''Theorem''' (Jucys): The [[Center (algebra)|center]] &lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbb{C} [S_n])&lt;/math&gt; of the group algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_n] &lt;/math&gt;  of the symmetric group is generated by the [[symmetric polynomial]]s in the elements ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.

'''Theorem''' (Jucys): Let ''t'' be a formal variable commuting with everything, then the following identity for polynomials in variable ''t'' with values in the group algebra  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_n] &lt;/math&gt; holds true:

:&lt;math&gt; (t+X_1) (t+X_2) \cdots (t+X_n)= \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sigma t^{\text{number of cycles of }\sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem''' ([[Okounkov]]&amp;ndash;[[Vershik]]): The subalgebra of  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_n] &lt;/math&gt; generated by the centers

: &lt;math&gt; Z(\mathbb{C} [ S_1]), Z(\mathbb{C} [ S_2]), \ldots,  Z(\mathbb{C} [ S_{n-1}]),  Z(\mathbb{C} [S_n])  &lt;/math&gt;

is exactly the subalgebra generated by the Jucys&amp;ndash;Murphy elements ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.

'''Emily Laverne Harding''' (October 10, 1905 – September 25, 1984) was an American [[animator]].

==Career==
Harding, who worked for the [[Walter Lantz Productions|Walter Lantz studio]] for much of her half-century career in animation, is among the earliest woman animators.&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;{{IMDb name|0362354|Laverne Harding}}. Retrieved March 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She is also one of the few women to receive a [[Winsor McCay Award]] for lifetime achievement, one of the most prestigious awards in animation (only nine women have been recognized out of 161 awards given). She won this award in 1980.&lt;ref name="Windor McCay Awards Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Windor McCay Awards Website |url=http://annieawards.org/winsor-mccay-award |website=Windor McCay Awards Website |accessdate=7 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712035848/http://annieawards.org/winsor-mccay-award |archivedate=12 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1932, Harding had settled in Los Angeles and was a student at the [[Chouinard Art Institute]]. Working for the Lantz studio from 1934 until 1960,&lt;ref name="IMDB" /&gt; Harding was particularly noted for her work on ''[[Woody Woodpecker]]'' cartoons; she designed the version of the character that was in use from 1950 to 1999. While working for the Lantz studios, Harding also drew a humorous newspaper strip, ''Cynical Susie'', for [[United Media|United Feature Syndicate]]. ''Cynical Susie'' revolved around the exploits of the titular heroine, (a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] woman) and her pet cow, Lily Whey.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trina Robbins]] and [[Catherine Yronwode]], ''Women and the Comics''. New York, Eclipse Books, 1985. {{ISBN|9780913035023}} (pp. 71-2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Goulart]], ''The Funnies : 100 years of American comic strips''.Holbrook, Mass. : Adams Pub., 1995. {{ISBN|1558505393}}. (p. 141)&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Lantz, she animated for [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons such as [[Yogi Bear]].&lt;ref name="IMDB" /&gt; She later worked for [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]] on ''[[The Pink Panther Show|Pink Panther]]'' cartoons, and was briefly employed at [[Warner Bros. Animation|Warner Bros.]] and [[Filmation]] as well.&lt;ref name="IMDB" /&gt; 
Harding was a native of the state of [[Louisiana]].

'''[[Maria Zankovetska]] Theatre''' ({{lang-uk|Національний академічний український драматичний театр імені Марії Заньковецької}}, ''Natsionalnyi akademichnyi ukrayinskyi dramatychnyi teatr imeni Mariyi Zankovetskoyi''; {{lang-pl|Teatr Skarbkowski}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt;) is a drama theatre in the centre of [[Lviv]], Ukraine, at the intersection of  Lesya Ukrayinka Street and Prospekt Svobody. The building was erected in the mid 19th century and until [[World War I]] was used as a theatre stage and a session hall of the regional council.

==History==
[[File:Stanislav Skarbek Theatre in Lviv.jpg|thumb|left|Skarbek Theater, Lwów, water-colour by T. Rybrovsky, 1900]]
The theatre was founded by Count [[:pl:Stanisław Skarbek|Stanisław Marcin Skarbek (pl)]] (1780–1848) [[Abdank coat of arms]], who as early as 1819 had applied for permission from the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Imperial]] authorities to build it following the final [[Third Partition of Poland|Partition of Poland]].&lt;ref name="teatry1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatry.art.pl/!inne/teatralia3/teatrsk.htm |title=Teatralia3 - Teatr Skarbkowski |publisher=Teatry.art.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the theatre’s [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] building began in 1837, the project was designed by architects Jan Salzmann and Ludwig Pichl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.com.pl/semper/teatr.html |title=SEMPER FIDELIS - Okoliczności powstania i otwarcia Teatru Wielkiego we Lwowie |publisher=Lwow.com.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex was built in the location of bastions, which surrounded the [[:uk:Низький замок|Lower Castle]] and its foundation was made of 16,000 oak logs. In 1842 it was the third biggest building of Central Europe.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090321024424/http://www.poznan.pl/mim/public/euro2012/pages.html?id=8127&amp;ch=10854&amp;p=10859&amp;instance=1017&amp;lang=pl&amp;lhs=publications&amp;rhs=publications&amp;lhs=euro2012  Ukraina. UEFA Euro 2012: Lwów.] Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the theatre itself, the complex also included apartments, for such famous personalities as [[Artur Grottger]] and [[Juliusz Kossak]]. On the opening day, March 28, 1842, a [[Franz Grillparzer]] play in the German language was presented, and on the next day, [[Aleksander Fredro]]'s play ''Śluby panieńskie'' was presented, this time in Polish.&lt;ref name="teatry1"/&gt;

In initial years, plays both in Polish and German were presented, and this lasted until 1871, when all German plays were withdrawn and the theatre became a Polish-language only. In 1872, operas were also presented, which made Skarbek Theatre the sole opera scene in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. 

In late years of the 19th century, the complex became insufficient, and in 1900, it was augmented by a brand new building of the [[The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Grand Theatre]]. Skarbek Theatre was turned into a philharmonic, then into a cinema. Currently, it is home of the Ukrainian Dramatic Theatre of [[Maria Zankovetska]]. On May 18, 2008, celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Polish People's Theatre of Lviv took place in the complex, with performance of a play by [[Marian Hemar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.com.pl/teatr/skarbek/jubileusz.html |title=Jublileusz Polskiego Teatru we Lwowie |publisher=Lwow.com.pl |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3405">'''Nordic — Office of Architecture''' is a Norwegian architecture and masterplanning practice specialising in complex projects such as airports and hospitals. The practice was founded as '''Narud Stokke Wiig Architects and Planners''' in 1979 but changed names in 2012. Partners in Nordic — Office of Architecture include Gudmund Stokke, John Arne Bjerknes, Johannes Eggen, Christian Henriksen, Geoffrey Clark, Eskild Andersen and Hallgrimur Thor Sigurdsson. The practice employs 120 people located in the main office in [[Oslo]], in [[Copenhagen]] and in [[London]].

Since 1991 Nordic — Office of Architecture has been involved in the design and planning of [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo Airport]], following the decision that the main airport would move to [[Gardermoen]] from its previous location at [[Fornebu]]. The airport opened in 1998, and Nordic has been involved in the continuous improvement works and the current vast expansion including a new pier, as part of Team_T. Team_T is a collaboration between Nordic — Office of Architecture, [[COWI A/S|COWI]], [[Norconsult]], [[Aas-Jakobsen]] and Per Rasmussen AS.

In 2014 Nordic — Office of Architecture, [[Grimshaw Architects]] and Haptic Architects were assigned by the consortium of [[Cengiz Holding|Cengiz]]-Kolin-[[Limak Holding|Limak]]-Mapa-[[Kalyon Group|Kalyon]] to design what will become the worlds largest airport, [[Istanbul New Airport]].

'''''Ordo Virtutum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Order of the Virtues'') is an [[allegory|allegorical]] [[morality play]], or [[liturgical drama]], by [[Hildegard of Bingen|St. Hildegard]], composed c. 1151, during the construction and relocation of her Abbey at Rupertsberg. It is the earliest morality play by more than a century, and the only [[Medieval]] musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.

A short version of ''Ordo Virtutum'' without music appears at the end of ''[[Scivias]]'', Hildegard's most famous account of her visions. It is also included in some manuscripts of the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum'' ("Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations"), a cycle of more than 70 liturgical songs. It may have been performed by the convent nuns at the dedication of the St. [[Rupertsberg]] church in 1152&lt;ref&gt;Sabina Flanagan. ''Secrets of God: The Writings of Hildegard of Bingen''. Boston: Shambhala, 1996. Page 119.&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly before the Mass for the [[Consecrated virgin|Consecration of Virgins]] at the convent .&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Sheingorn.  "The Virtues of Hildegard’s Ordo Virtutum; or, It Was a Woman’s World".  ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The subject of the play is typical for a musical drama. It shows no biblical events, no depiction of a saint's life, and no miracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Robert|date=Fall 1986|title=The "Ordo Vitutum": Ancestor of the English Moralities?|jstor=41153244|journal=Comparative Drama|volume=20|pages=201–210|doi=10.1353/cdr.1986.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, ''Ordo Virtutum'' is about the struggle for a human soul, or Anima, between the Virtues and the Devil.  The idea that Hildegard is trying to develop in Ordo Virtutum is the reconnection between the "creator and creation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://healthyhildegard.com/ordo-virtutum/.|title=Hildegard's Ordo Virtutum - HealthyHildegard.com|date=2016-10-22|work=HealthyHildegard.com|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece can be divided as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  "Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen’s ''Ordo Virtutum''".   ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Pages 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part I: Prologue in which the Virtues are introduced to the Patriarchs and Prophets who marvel at the Virtues.

Part II: We hear the complaints of souls that are imprisoned in bodies.  The (for now) happy Soul enters and her voice contrasts with the unhappy souls.  However, the Soul is too eager to skip life and go straight to Heaven.  When the Virtues tell her that she has to live first, the Devil seduces her away to worldly things.

Part III:  The Virtues take turns identifying and describing themselves while the Devil occasionally interrupts and expresses opposing views and insults. This is the longest section by far and, although devoid of drama or plot, the musical elements of this section make it stand out.

Part IV: The Soul returns, repentant.  Once the Virtues have accepted her back, they turn on the Devil, whom they bind. Together they conquer the Devil and then God is praised.

Part V: A procession of all the characters.

==Roles==
*The Soul (female voice)
* The Virtues (sung by 17 solo female voices): Humility (Queen of the Virtues), Hope, Chastity, Innocence, Contempt of the World, Celestial Love, Discipline? (the name is scratched out in the manuscript) Modesty, Mercy, Victory, Discretion, Patience, Knowledge of God, Charity, Fear of God, Obedience, and Faith&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Sheingorn.

Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992. Page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; These Virtues were seen as role models for the women of the Abbey, who took joy in overcoming their weaknesses and defeating the Devil in their own lives. 
* Chorus of the Prophets and Patriarchs (sung by a male chorus)
* Chorus of Souls (sung by a women’s chorus)
* The Devil (a male voice --&lt;ref&gt;Maud Burnett McInerney.  ''Eloquent Virgins from Thecla to Joan of Arc''.  New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.  Page 137.&lt;/ref&gt; the Devil does not sing, he only yells or grunts: according to Hildegard, he cannot produce divine harmony).&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  "Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen’s ''Ordo Virtutum''".   ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The meaning and emphasis of the Ordo Virtutum in Hildegard of Bingen's community is affected by which persons in the community played which roles, and how they related to each other at the time of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Monastic Education|last=Ferzoco|first=George|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2000|isbn=9780718502461|location=|pages=72–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the soul represents Richardis von Stade, Hildegard’s friend and fellow nun, who had left to become abbess of another convent.  Hildegard was upset by this appointment and tried to have it revoked, appealing even to [[Pope Eugene III]].  However, Hildegard was unsuccessful and Richardis departed, only to die shortly thereafter on October 29, 1151.  Other scholarship propose an allusion to Hildegard's brother Bruno.&lt;ref&gt;Heineich Schipperrges ''Hildegard of Bingen: Healing and the Nature of the Cosmo''s M. Weiner, 1997 p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Before dying Richardis told her brother that she wanted to return to Hildegard, not unlike the returning, repentant Soul of Ordo Virtutum.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Bolton Holloway.  "The Monastic Context of Hildegard’s ''Ordo Virtutum''".  ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Pages 70-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the piece is called Ordo Virtutum, which is typically translated to " Virtue Play". Many people are not aware that Ordo Virtutum's translation from Latin actually serves as a double meaning can also be translated to "Rules by which the world works".&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Composition ==
Hildegard of Bingen was never classically trained in composition, nor was she trained to play instruments. She was "self-taught", although not in a way that many people would expect. Her whole life Hildegard of Bingen claimed to be both Clairvoyant and Clairaudient. The music came to her in her trances and that is how she was able to compose that many pieces without any formal training. She also attempted to describe what she was going through in her works such as Ordo Virtutum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://healthyhildegard.com/hildegard-music/|title=Hildegard Music - HealthyHildegard.com|date=2016-11-28|work=HealthyHildegard.com|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in the Abbey ==
The performance of music of any kind in the abbeys of the medieval era would be a cause for celebration. The majority of the life of [[nun]]s would have been lead without speaking due to their [[vow of silence]]. The sisters dedicate their lives to poverty and would not indulge in human wants. The lives of women in this life would have been dedicated to the service of their community and [[God the Father]]. Speaking any idle words would have been seen as offensive. The performance of Ordo Virtutum would be a chance to use the human voice as a vessel for praise. The play was seen as a spiritual celebration and the joy of overcoming human weakness. A moment of religious celebration, at the consecration of an abbey, would have allowed the women to enjoy the joy of music while still worshiping God.

== The Healing Properties ==
In addition to the use of the human voice as a vessel for praise, it was found that music and rhythm had healing properties and could be used for good. Hildegard of Bingen believed that music had a direct correlation with the opening of Dys&amp;shy;[[anaesthesia]] (which is also known as the Third State of Consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/people/professor-jaideep-pandit/ Jaideep J. Pandit] at [[St John's College, Oxford|St. John’s College in Oxford]] uses this term in the same sense, but without reference to its medieval origin: {{cite journal |vauthors=Pandit JJ |collaboration=37 participants |date=2014-09-09 |title=5th National Audit Project (NAP5) on accidental awareness during general anaesthesia: summary of main findings and risk factors |url=https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/113/4/549/2920161 |journal=[[British Journal of Anaesthesia]] |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=549–559 |doi=10.1093/bja/aeu313 |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music was used as a way to enlighten yourself and bring joy and positivity into your soul. It was a type of meditation that promoted relaxation. The manner in which this was practiced highly resembles the way buddhist meditation techniques are performed. Up until 2015 neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] was researching Hildegard's 12th century belief that music can bring a whole brain connection between the two hemispheres, to heal and calm the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foxhall|first=Katherine|date=July 2014|title=Making Modern Migraine Medieval: Men of Science, Hildegard of Bingen and the Life of a Retrospective Diagnosis|journal=Medical History|volume=58|issue=3|pages=354–374|doi=10.1017/mdh.2014.28|issn=0025-7273|pmc=4103393|pmid=25045179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical elements==
''Ordo Virtutum'' is written in [[verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic verse]] and contains 82 different melodies, which are set more [[syllable|syllabically]] than Hildegard's [[liturgy|liturgical]] songs. All parts are sung in [[plainchant]] except that of the [[Devil]].&lt;ref name="Palisca"&gt;Claude V. Palisca. ''Norton Anthology of Western Music''. Vol. 1, 3rd ed. New York: Norton, 1996. Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an alternation between solo and chorus parts as well as [[melisma]]tic versus syllabic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  "Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen’s ''Ordo Virtutum''".   ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main "acts" in the play are set in allegorical towers and the musical dimensions are driven by the architectural understanding, for example, the development of processional chants that link the action in one tower to that of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fassler|first=Margot|date=Summer 2014|title=Allegorical Architecture in Scivias: Hildegard's Setting for the Ordo Virtutum.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uwindsor.ca/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=97787747&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|volume=67|pages=317–378|via=EBSCOhost|doi=10.1525/jams.2014.67.2.317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final verses of the play move into a mystical mode and describe the crucifixion of Christ, asking the audience to bend their knees so that God may "stretch out his hand to you" (''genua vestra ad patrem vestrum flectite / ut vobis manum suam  porrigat,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;36–37). The final word, ''porrigat'' ("stretch out"), is set to thirty-nine notes, it is the longest melisma in the play. It is meant to illustrate the stretch of a divine hand toward humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Robert|date=Fall 1986|title=The "Ordo Virtutum": Ancestor of the English Moralities?|jstor=41153244|journal=Comparative Drama|volume=20|pages=201–210|doi=10.1353/cdr.1986.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pammakaristos Church - exterior - P1030461.JPG|thumb|Parekklesion of the Pammakaristos Church (Fethiye Museum).]]
'''Pammakaristos Church''', also known as the '''Church of [[Theotokos]] Pammakaristos''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Θεοτόκος ἡ Παμμακάριστος}}}}, "All-Blessed Mother of God"), is one of the most famous Greek Orthodox [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Byzantine]] churches in [[Istanbul]], Turkey. Adapted in 1591 into the '''Fethiye Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Fethiye Camii}}, "mosque of the conquest"), it is today partly a museum, the [[parekklesion]]. The edifice serves as one of the most important examples of [[Constantinople]]'s [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] architecture, and the last pre-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] building to house the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. It also has the largest amount of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[mosaic]]s in Istanbul after the [[Hagia Sophia]] and [[Chora Church]].

==Location==
The building is located in the [[Çarşamba, Istanbul|Çarşamba]] neighbourhood within the district of [[Fatih]] inside the [[Walls of Constantinople|walled city]] of [[Istanbul]]. Theotokos Pammakaristos overlooks the [[Golden Horn]].

[[File:Pammakaristos Church fragments.JPG|thumb|Fragments from the Church, kept at the Istanbul Archaeological Museums]]
According to most scholars, the church was built between the eleventh and the twelfth centuries. Many historians and archaeologists believe that the original structure of the church can be attributed to [[Michael VII Ducas]] (1071&amp;ndash;1078), others put its foundation in the [[Comneni]]an period.&lt;ref name=ma346&gt;Mathews (1976), p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested by the Swiss scholar and Byzantinist [[Ernest Mamboury]] that the original building was erected in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mamboury, (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; 

A ''parekklesion'' (a side chapel) was added to the south side of the church in the early [[Palaiologan period]], and dedicated to '''[[Christ]]os ho Logos''' ({{lang-el|Christ the Word}}).&lt;ref&gt;Mathews (1976), p. 347. ''Logos'' in the Eastern Orthodox [[Theology]] is the denomination of the second Person of the [[Trinity]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The small shrine was erected by Martha Glabas in memory of her late husband, the ''[[protostrator]]'' [[Michael Doukas Glabas Tarchaneiotes]], a general of [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], shortly after the year 1310.&lt;ref name=ma347&gt;Mathews (1976), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; An elegant dedicatory inscription to Christ, written by the poet [[Manuel Philes]], runs along the parekklesion, both outside and inside it.

The main church was also renovated at the same time, as the study of the [[Templon]] has shown.&lt;ref name=ma347/&gt;
Following the [[fall of Constantinople]], the seat of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate|Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]] was first moved to the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], and in 1456 to the Pammakaristos Church, which remained as the seat of the Patriarchate until 1587.

Five years later, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Murad III]] converted the church into a mosque and renamed it in honor of his ''Fetih'' (Conquest) of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], hence the name ''Fethiye Camii''. To accommodate the requirements of prayer, most of the interior walls were removed in order to create a larger inner space.

The complex, which was neglected, has been restored in 1949 by the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] and [[Dumbarton Oaks]], which brought it back to its pristine splendor.&lt;ref name=ma346/&gt; While the main building remains a mosque, the parekklesion has since then been a museum.&lt;ref&gt;Entrance tickets, which up to some months ago had to be bought at Haghia Sophia, are now for sale at the parekklesion.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture and decoration ==
The Comnenian building was a church with a main aisle and two ''deambulatoria'',&lt;ref&gt;A ''deambulatorium'' is an aisle which encircles the central part of a church&lt;/ref&gt; and had three [[apse]]s, and a [[narthex]] to the west. The [[masonry]] was typical of the Comnenian period, and adopted the technique of the ''recessed brick''. In this technique, alternate courses of brick are mounted behind the line of the wall, and are plunged in a mortar's bed, which can still be seen in the [[cistern]] underneath and in the church.&lt;ref name=ma346/&gt;
The transformation of the church into a mosque changed the original building greatly. The arcades connecting the main [[aisle]] with the deambulatoria were removed and were replaced with broad archways to open up the nave. The three apses were removed too. In their place toward the east a great domed room was built, obliquely with respect to the orientation of the building.

On the other side, the parekklesion represents the most beautiful building of the late Byzantine period in [[Constantinople]]. It has the typical [[cross-in-square]] plan with five domes, but the proportion between vertical and horizontal dimensions is much bigger than usual (although not so big as in the contemporary Byzantine churches built in the Balkans).

Although the inner colored marble revetment largely disappeared, the shrine still contains the restored remains of a number of [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|mosaic]] panels, which, while not as varied and well-preserved as those of the Chora Church, serve as another resource for understanding late Byzantine art.

A representation of the [[Pantocrator]], surrounded by the prophets of the [[Old Testament]] ([[Moses]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Zephaniah]], [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]], [[Joel (prophet)|Joel]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], [[Obadiah]], [[Habakkuk]], [[Jonah]], [[Malachi]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Isaiah]]) is under the main dome. On the apse, Christ Hyperagathos is shown with [[Virgin Mary]] and [[St. John the Baptist]]. The [[Baptism]] of [[Jesus|Christ]] survives intact to the right side of the dome.

'''Paul Laffoley''' (August 14, 1935 – November 16, 2015) was an American [[visionary artist]] and [[architect]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], represented by [[Kent Fine Art]] in New York.

==Biography==

Paul Laffoley, as one of America's foremost visionary artists, seemed to work in a perpetual present tense (there is no "late" or "old age" style for him). From a young age, spiritual productivity was measured by how deeply one's wisdom could be developed, and how broadly one's compassion could exert itself.

Paul Laffoley was born on August 14, 1935 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to an [[Irish Catholic]] family.  His father, Paul Laffoley, Sr., the president of the Cambridge Trust Company, was also a [[lawyer]] and taught classes at [[Harvard Business School]]. Although his father had been against him pursuing painting as a career, Laffoley was indoctrinated with his father's religious philosophical beliefs including aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism and what he called "mind-physics". Laffoley senior also instructed Paul that there was "no gravity" which was a source of great humor when Paul was given the assignment to explain in grade school.

Laffoley wrote that his first spoken word was "[[Constantinople]]" at the age of six months. He did not speak again until he was four years old.&lt;ref name="madone"/&gt; He was diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome testing both high and low academically.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to Laffoley, he attended the progressive Mary Lee Burbank School in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], where his draftsman's talent was ridiculed by his [[abstract expressionist]] teachers.  After further studies at the Waldorf School, Laffoley would complete undergraduate studies at [[Brown University]], graduating in 1961 with honors in classics, philosophy, and [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Laffoley Bio|url=http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley|publisher=Kent Fine Arts LLC|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021031335/http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley/|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As written by Paul in The Phenomenology of Revelation, he was given eight [[electroshock]] treatments after the termination of "about a year of weekly sessions with a psychiatrist, who had treated me for a mild state of catatonia" while at Brown in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafolley|first=Paul|title="The Dream As The Initiation" from The Phenomenology of Revelation|year=1989|publisher=Kent Fine Arts|location=New York, NY|isbn=1878607057|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, he enrolled at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he studied architecture because it consisted of diagrams that rendered objects in space with accuracy and precision.  He also studied with the sculptor Mirko Basaldella at Harvard's Carpenter Center that he cited was an early influence. After one year, he was summarily grand juried out of the GSD by the faculty for being "overly involved in his work". By chance, Laffoley was given an issue of Progressive Architecture by his uncle with Frederick Kiesler on the cover.  Laffoley felt Kiesler work was what he had been searching for, and after writing 17 letters, Laffoley came to New York and succeeded in apprenticing with [[Frederick John Kiesler|Frederick Kiesler]].  While canvasing the art scene in New York, Laffoley would meet [[Andy Warhol]], who offered him a place to sleep at his 87th Street fire station if he would report on late night television between 1 and 5 am. It was from watching these Indian Head Test Patterns along with his early exposure to a Hindu tutor that Laffoley would arrive at a format for his large scale paintings that would dominate his work for five decades.

After the death of his father in 1963, Paul would return to Boston from New York, and eventually established his first dedicated studio space at 36 Bromfield Street on Christmas Day, 1968.  It was there that Paul's career would begin to "connect" with an early show at the Orson Welles Theater that was "highjacked" and taken to the Woodstock Music Festival for presentation by Dean Gitter without Paul's permission.  In an effort to recover his work, Paul took the bus to Woodstock which lead to his exposure to the current countercultures of the day, and would be followed by numerous exhibition opportunities and curatorial projects that would lead to the creation of his Boston Visionary Cell (1971).  The Boston Visionary Cell, which Paul Laffoley founded on the model of an artists’ guild, was a highly communal and curatorial undertaking.  The charter of the Boston Visionary Cell underscores Laffoley’s thought processes “to develop and advance visionary art”.

By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, and evolved to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging [[psychotronics|psychotronic]] device, perhaps similar to architectural monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] or the Cathedral of Notre Dame and their spiritual aura.  Works such as Thanaton III (1989), The Orgone Motor (1983), and the Geochronmechane: The Time Machine from Earth (1990) would follow this concept.

After the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on [[September 11, 2001]], Laffoley was one of a number of architects who, in 2002, submitted designs for the competition to plan the [[One World Trade Center|Freedom Tower]]. Laffoley took his inspiration from the work of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] architect [[Antoni Gaudí]]. His conception was to plan a gigantic hotel in the style of Gaudí's [[Sagrada Família]] church in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|title=Postmodern, In a Manner Of Speaking; A Shape Out of 1908 Is Offered Downtown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/21/nyregion/postmodern-in-a-manner-of-speaking-a-shape-out-of-1908-is-offered-downtown.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="madone"&gt;{{cite web|last=Larroque|first=Jean-Pierre|title=The Mad One|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmBuzdLUFsc|publisher=Doublethink Productions|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Austin Museum of Art organized a traveling survey of his career in 1999, Mr. Laffoley became something of a cult figure for curators around the world. The Palais de Tokyo in Paris devoted an entire room to his work in its 2009 exhibition "Chasing Napoleon", and several of his works were included in "The Alternative Guide to the Universe" at the Hayward Gallery in London in 2013. Other major shows include Premonitions of the Bauharoque at the Henry Art Gallery, Seattle (publication), Secret Garden at the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (publication) and the recent monograph entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited by Douglas Walla and published by the University of Chicago Press in Spring 2016.

==About==
Following his formal education in the classics at Brown and architectural studies at [[Harvard]], Laffoley would begin to assimilate and systematically cross-pollinate his related strands of intellectual inquiry.  In a search for expanded opportunities, he went to New York in 1963 to work with the visionary artist and architect [[Frederick Kiesler]], and was also recruited to view late-night TV for [[Andy Warhol]] in exchange for a place to sleep.  Weekdays, Laffoley found employment with [[Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] where he worked on the plans for the yet to be built [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] Towers before being terminated upon his suggestion of bridges joining the two buildings.

At that time, Laffoley had been painting in the basement of his family home in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] on the weekends, completing his first fully mature vision:  The [[Kali-Yuga]]: The End of the Universe at 424826 A.D.  From this point forward, Laffoley began to formulate his unique trans-disciplinary approach to a new discipline combining, [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[architecture]] and spirituality to the practice of painting.  Laffoley first began to organize his ideas in a format related to eastern [[mandalas]], partially inspired by the late night patterns he watched for Warhol on late night television.  This quickly developed into four general subcategories of paintings: [[operating system]]s, [[Psychotronics|psychotronic]] devices, meta-energy, [[time travel]], and [[lucid dream]]ing.  Conceived of as "structured singularities", Laffoley never works in series, but rather approaches each project as a unique schematic.  Working in a solitary lifestyle, each 73 ½ x 73 ½ inch canvas would take up to three years to paint and code.  By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging psychotronic device, a modern approach to trans-disciplinary enlightenment and its spiritual aura.

From an early age, Laffoley manifested an obsessive interest in [[UFO]]s.  He had seen the movie ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' 873 times.  He explains that his obsessive interest in the film derives partly from a fascination with the architecture of the space ship in the film which, early on in his life, was subconscious. While he was still a child he made a vow to become an architect so that he could design flying saucers, although he did not become a registered architect until he was 50 years of age.

{{quote|Two years later, in preparation for a major oral surgery, I was subjected to a routine cat-scan of my head.  As a result, a miniature metallic-like "implant" was discovered in my brain near the pineal gland.  A local chapter of [[MUFON]] (Mutual UFO Network) declared it to be a "nanotechnological laboratory" capable of accelerating or retarding my brain activity.  I have come to believe that the implant is extraterrestrial in origin and is the main motivation of my ideas and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laffoley|first=Paul|title="Disco Volante" from the UFO Show|year=2000|publisher=University Galleries, Illinois State University|location=Normal, IL|isbn=0-945558-30-9|pages=34, 36, 24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Work==

Painted on large canvases, the majority of Paul Laffoley's paintings combine words and imagery to depict a spiritual architecture of explanation, tackling concepts like dimensionality, time travel through hacking relativity, connecting conceptual threads shared by philosophers through the millennia, and theories about the cosmic origins of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outsider Art Sourcebook|date=March 2009|publisher=Raw Vision|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0954339326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=The Boston Visionary Cell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/arts/design/paul-laffoley-the-boston-visionary-cell.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=ART IN REVIEW: Paul Laffoley, 'Portaling'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/06/arts/art-in-review-paul-laffoley-portaling.html|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010,

Laffoley's writings as well as works of art were published in May 2016 by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in a new book entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited and texts by Douglas Walla, with further texts by [[Linda Dalywimple Henderson]], [[Arielle Saiber]] and [[Steven Moskowitz]].

British writer [[Michael Bracewell]], in his collection of essays entitled ''When Surface was Depth'' observed: "If Laffoley's work within the Boston Visionary Cell can be said to have one principal preoccupation - a common denominator of his eclectic scholarship and practice - then that preoccupation would be to understand the process by which one goes from becoming to being." Bracewell has also written that, "The Boston Visionary Cell, as a concretized manifestation of its inhabitant's work and preoccupations, describes the way in which a chaos of data - no less than a chaos of marble - can be sculpted by research to release the perfect forms within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|title=when surface was depth|date=July 9, 2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=London|isbn=0306811308|pages=346–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laffoley died on November 16, 2015 in South Boston, Massachusetts, of congestive heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VISIONARY ARTIST AND GENIUS PAUL LAFFOLEY HAS DIED|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/visionary_artist_and_genius_paul_laffoley_has_died2|publisher=Dangerous Minds|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandre Cabanel Phèdre.jpg|thumb|Alexandre Cabanel, ''Phaedra'', 1880. Oil on canvas, 194 x 286 cm. Musée Fabre, Montpellier.]]
'''''Phaedra''''' is a later work of [[Alexandre Cabanel]], a French [[academic painter]] working from the 1840s until his death in 1889. This work was exhibited in the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1880 and later donated by Cabanel to the [[Musée Fabre]], located in his hometown of Montpellier, France. ''Phaedra'' is a large oil painting of a classical subject in literature, which can be attributed to Cabanel's studies in the Paris [[École des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; As Cabanel's painting career developed, he expanded his style to preserve the French Academy while appealing to his personal interests in literature, often depicting new perspectives in contradiction with tradition. Alexandre Cabanel's painting of ''Phaedra'' exemplifies his pull toward academic paintings of theatrical heroines in reference to the social happenings of late nineteenth-century France.

The painting depicts [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] stretched out on her side in a lavishly decorated bed, one arm at supporting her head and one hanging off the edge fingering the expensive drapery. She stares out of the left side of the picture plane, her face dark and resolute, while her unkempt hair is splayed on the decorated pillow. Her pale nude body covered by a sheer white sheet contrasts with the deep red, black, and gold tones around her. Two ladies in waiting are on the right. One is standing, but crouched over slightly, and active. Her body is half out of the picture plane as she peers over at Phaedra, hands clasped as if silently imploring the woman to move. The second lady sits at Phaedra's bedside sleeping, eyes closed, head leaned back, as if resting from the exhaustion of some heavy emotion. The luxurious fabrics on the bed are scattered and slipping off, as if the bed hadn't been made for a while. On the floor sits an expensive fur rug, its golden tones reminiscent of the shield, helmet, and sword tied to a column before Phaedra's bed. The furniture and architecture are adorned with oriental designs, creating a foreign look of drama and wealth. The light source for the painting comes from outside of the picture plane on the left, contrasting with the dimly lit lantern in the background.

==Technical properties==

===Medium===
Cabanel used the [[oil painting]] technique, which creates a luminosity akin to the wealth and luxury of the subject, due to the shiny quality of the medium. This also gives the work a greater sense of depth, as the thin layers of paint provide striking visual effects to the contrasting dark and light colors in the scene.

===Size===
The size of the painting, a little over six by nine feet, is congruent with a traditional [[history painting]], or a work depicting a historical event in monumental size in order to convey the importance and influence of that moment. This painting type was heavily used and venerated by the traditional group of academic painters, of which Cabanel was a part. However, in Cabanel's time, subjects from literature and mythology were also used for this painting type, as exemplified in ''Phaedra''. Therefore, Cabanel, in alignment with his time, is taking an element of the traditional style and applying it to an alternate intelligent subject matter.

==Subject==
The subject of the work was brought on by Cabanel's affiliation with literature, an infatuation that began with the Paris École des Beaux-Arts.&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Cabanel spent time at the school as a student and teacher, where he was exposed to classical works of literature, as well as important French writers of the past centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Cabanel would have studied Euripides' [[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]], written in 429 BCE, a play that details Phaedra's love and betrayal of her stepson, Hippolytus, who denies his stepmother's love. In her sorrow, Phaedra hangs herself, but leaves a suicide note of sorts calling Hippolytus her seducer. Theseus, her husband, banishes and ultimately kills his son, although the truth is revealed and their relationship reconciled before Hippolytus finally dies.&lt;ref&gt;James and Jondorf, "Introduction," 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent version of the subject had been written by [[Phèdre|Racine]] in 1677, and was performed and celebrated during Cabanel's life.&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvain Amic suggests that, because of the contemporary attention to the play, Cabanel was likely trying to revive an interest in antiquity among the rapidly progressing art that rejected traditional subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Salon program's description of Phaedra contained an excerpt from Euripides' classical play: “Consumed with love's sorrow, Phaedra has locked herself in her palace. A delicate veil covers her head. This is the third day she has gone without food as she is intent on ending her wretched existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt; This reference to antiquity was Cabanel's way of stating his own intelligence, while attempting to reach a larger group with the academic reminder of the subject's origins in antiquity. This excerpt also places Cabanel's ''Phaedra'' in a weakened and emotional moment, showing the artist's innovation in contrast to the often heroic and instructive works of the Academy. Further, Cabanel tended to progress his works according to people's tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; While opposed to the anti-academic modes of painting, Cabanel was able to accept certain changes within the painting world, attempting to use the progression as a way of circling contemporary thoughts back to the classical subjects accepted by the Academy. ''Phaedra'' can be understood as another way that the artist tried to assimilate his own artistic ideals with a developing artistic age.

==Rome and theatricality==
This work relays a certain level of theatricality, which can definitely be attributed to the main source of the work being a play, but also to the result of Cabanel's time spent painting in Italy, influencing his decorative works commissions. Cabanel received the [[Prix de Rome]] award for his accomplishments in history painting in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next five years in Rome, absorbing the dramatic [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] works that permeate the city. Upon his return to Paris, Cabanel was commissioned to help decorate the Salon des Cariatides in the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]].&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The final work was destroyed, but his cartoons show influences of Michelangelo's heroic and thoughtful figures of the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], Raphael's introspective philosophers and mathematicians of the ''[[School of Athens]]'', and the theatrical compositions and movement of Annibale Carracci's [[Farnese Gallery]] decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; These cartoons are evidence of the effect that Roman works of the past had on Cabanel. The heroic figures are absent from ''Phaedra'', but there is an air of brooding tension and drama that can reasonably be attributed to his influence by the Renaissance and Baroque masters.

==Elements from his past works==
Cabanel incorporates various elements of his earlier works into ''Phaedra'', namely the aforementioned dramatic literature (see '''Subject'''), portraiture, and the female nude.

===Portraiture===
[[File:Cabanel, Alexandre - Olivia Peyton Murray Cutting - 1887.png|thumb|Alexandre Cabanel, ''Olivia Peyton Murray Cutting'', 1887. Oil on canvas, 276 x 149 cm. Museum of the City of New York.]]
Cabanel produced many works of portraiture throughout his painting career. His soft and precise depictions of women were very popular among the upper classes, establishing the artist as a viable resource for beautiful likenesses.&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In his painting ''Olivia Peyton Murray Cutting'', Cabanel utilized a dark background in order to emphasize the light skin of the woman.&lt;ref&gt;Blühm, ''Alexandre Cabanel'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Her dress is shiny and ornate, scrunched up where the fabric meets the furniture. Her chair and pillows are lavish and decorated, adding a luxurious effect. These elements can all be seen in ''Phaedra'' in the dark background illuminating her pale body, the luscious fabrics that shine and ripple, and the opulent luxury of her bedchamber's adornments. Further, Cabanel's model for the work was a distinguished banker's wife, alluding to the popularity of his portraiture techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Musée Fabre, "Cabanel, Alexandre, ''Phaedra''," http://nga.gov.au/exhibition/frenchpainting/Detail.cfm?IRN=126586.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Female Nude===
[[File:Alexandre Cabanel - The Birth of Venus - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|Alexandre Cabanel, ''Birth of Venus'', 1863. Oil on canvas, 130 x 225 cm. Musée d'Orsay, Paris.]]
Cabanel's most famous female nude figure is his ''[[The Birth of Venus (Cabanel)|Birth of Venus]]''. This work shows a reclining female nude with her hands above her head, harkening back to Titian's ''[[The Bacchanal of the Andrians|Bacchanal of the Andrians]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, "Pointing the Way Ahead," 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Her sexualized pose emphasizes the erotic nature of Venus, while her overlapped legs suggest a soft modesty. While ''Phaedra'' is not overtly sexual, she is a horizontal nude whose character is associated with lustful love, showing continuity between Cabanel's past works and this one.

==What the critics thought==
Cabanel reached the height of his popularity when he showed the ''Birth of Venus'', receiving critical acclaim for its innovation and beauty, recognizable even by [[Napoleon III]] who purchased the work.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, "Pointing the Way Ahead," 62.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time he painted ''Phaedra'', admiration for his style had dramatically lessened. Critics called the work lackluster and confusing. This was likely due to the odd mixture of Cabanel's wish to please the public while retaining the academic style and adding a personal, unique perspective. Academic critics thought Cabanel's portrayal of the classical ''Phaedra'' in a weak state was unbefitting, and his composition boring, especially in contrast to the luxurious setting.&lt;ref&gt;Musée Fabre, "Cabanel, Alexandre, ''Phaedra''," http://nga.gov.au/exhibition/frenchpainting/Detail.cfm?IRN=126586.&lt;/ref&gt; The avant-gardists completely rejected the academic style as a part of their struggle for artistic progression. Further, his public was either strictly academic or progressive, so Cabanel's in-between style appeared flat and uninteresting to his contemporaries. Even after his death in 1889, later critics looked back on Cabanel's works with disdain. [[Camille Mauclair]] in ''The Great French Painters'' described other of Cabanel's works from the Salon of 1880 as “unpleasant,” “without life or emotion,” and “pictures that do not take their proper place in the building.”&lt;ref&gt;Mauclair, ''The Great French Painters'', 27-8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a modern audience can view the work with a different perspective, not bound by the French Academy or the need to expressly think in terms of the avant-garde.  Cabanel's ''Phaedra'' can be seen as a culmination of the artist's practices and experiences melding together as a retrospective of his past, while struggling to retain a foothold in a fast-pace art world. Now, the richness of painting can be appreciated as it appears from an expert hand, finding the beauty in the “unpleasant” and emotion in the mundane, asserting, finally, a “proper place.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2817">'''Pouncing''' is an art technique used for transferring an image from one surface to another.  It is similar to tracing, and is useful for creating copies of a sketch outline to produce finished works.
[[File:Tracing wheel - 01.jpg|thumb|A pounce wheel, also known as a tracing wheel]]
Pouncing has been a common technique for centuries, used to create copies of portraits and other works that would be finished as oil paintings, engravings, and so on. The most common method involves laying semi-transparent paper over the original image, then tracing along the lines of the image by creating pricked marks on the top sheet of paper.  This pounced drawing made of pricked holes is laid over a new working surface. A powder such as chalk, graphite or pastel is forced through the holes to leave an outline on the working surface below, thus transferring the image. The powder is applied by being placed into a small bag of thin fabric such as cheesecloth, then dabbed onto the pricked holes of the pounced drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several techniques of jewelry making were used in producing adornments, buttons, appliques etc.: not limited to casting in moulds, welding of small gold balls (granules) or fine gold wire [[filigree]], inlays of pearls and multi-colored [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]].
 
The owner of the necklace (see on the left) was probably under the protection of [[Virgin Mary]], who is portrayed on both central medallions. It is possible that [[Peter I of Bulgaria]] gave this beautiful jewelry as a wedding gift to his bride, [[Irene Lekapene]], the [[Byzantine]] princess, in 927 in [[Constantinople]]. It is assumed that the necklace was a wedding present because the images of water-birds symbolize family happiness and fidelity.

[[File:QuedlinburgItalaFolio2rIllus1KingsChap15.jpg|thumb|270px|Scenes from Chapter 15 of [[1 Samuel]] from the Quedlinburg ''Itala'' fragment (the text illustrated given below)]]
[[File:Quedlinburg4.jpg|thumb|270px|A text page]]

The '''Quedlinburg ''Itala'' fragment''' (Berlin, Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Cod. theol. lat. fol. 485) is a fragment of six folios from a large 5th-century [[illuminated manuscript]] of an [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin ''Itala'']] translation of parts of [[1 Samuel]]&lt;ref&gt;another name is 1 King (there are several names for the same book)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Old Testament. It was probably produced in Rome in the 420s or 430s. It is the oldest surviving illustrated biblical manuscript and has been in the [[Berlin State Library]] since 1875-76.  The pages are approximately 305 x 205 mm large.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, 27&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fragments were found from 1865 onwards (two in 1865, two in 1867, one in 1887) re-used in the bindings of different books that had been bound in the 17th century in the town of [[Quedlinburg]], home of [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], a large Imperial monastery, where the manuscript may well have spent much of its life. 

The illustrations are grouped in framed miniatures occupying an entire page, with between two and five miniatures per page, with the corresponding text being on the other side of the pages; there are fourteen miniatures in total. One folio contains only text.  The illustrations, although much damaged, are done in the illusionistic style of [[late antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 21; also [https://books.google.com/books?id=EqGvw5G-BOkC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Quedlinburg+Itala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5B_VT8C4N_KY0QW_x_GFBA&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Quedlinburg%20Itala&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and context==
Much of the paint surface is lost revealing the underlying writing that gives instructions to the artist who would execute the pictures, such as: "Make the tomb [by which] Saul and his servant stand and two men, jumping over pits, speak to him and [announce that the asses have been found]. Make Saul by a tree and [his] servant [and three men who talk] to him, one carrying three goats, one [three loaves of bread, one] a wine-skin."  This suggests that the programme of images was newly devised for this volume, rather than merely copying an earlier work.  This, the usual conclusion, was disputed by [[Ernst Kitzinger]], who argued that they were to aid the artist who was copying images from the different format of a [[scroll]].  However Walter Cahn sees the instructions as far more detailed than would be needed for that.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 99 and Cahn, 22 thinks the designs are original, the latter describing Kitzinger's view in a different work from that cited here.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether original or not, the images are "the fruit of what we must imagine to have been a thoroughly rationalized and quasi-industrial method of production", in "a stable craft with settled routines".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cahn, 22&lt;/ref&gt; They are painted in "an illusionistic style with an emphasis on imperial imagery" (Saul and David are dressed as emperors in military costume), and gold is used for highlights and the [[titulus (inscription)|''tituli'']] or captions to the images.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 99 (quoted); Kitzinger, 68, 71&lt;/ref&gt;  The text is in a "superior [[uncial]] script", while the instructions to the artist are in "an eccentric Roman cursive".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 99 &lt;/ref&gt;  

The full extent of the original manuscript is not known.  Some of the episodes illustrated are very minor, suggesting that the whole manuscript may have been illustrated at this density, which is greater than any later Biblical manuscript; according to [[Kurt Weitzmann]] "It staggers the imagination to picture what a fully illustrated manuscript of the two books of Samuel and the two books of Kings must have looked like".  The style suggests it may have been made by the same workshop responsible for the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]], and has links with the mosaics of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 68-72 (fullest comparison with the mosaics and Virgil MS); Weitzmann, 15, 40 (quoted); Williams, 99; Cahn, 22&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kitzinger: "Evidently this book was commissioned by a patron who belonged to the same social stratum as the sponsors of ''de luxe'' editions of the classics and who shared many of the same cultural values".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 71&lt;/ref&gt;  The other very early illustrated biblical manuscripts that have survived are similar densely illustrated texts of specific books from the [[Old Testament]], mostly the [[Book of Genesis]] ([[Vienna Genesis]], [[Cotton Genesis]]), which, with some specific details of the illustrations, leads scholars to postulate an earlier tradition of Jewish luxury manuscripts, perhaps in scroll format, in the Hellenized Jewish world. The Books of Kings feature strongly in the uniquely extensive wall-paintings of the [[Dura-Europos Synagogue]] from the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

The figures have landscape backgrounds, "atmospheric, autumnal settings, with softly shaded skies of pink and light blue", that are "very close" to those of the Vergilius Vaticanus,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; whereas the Santa Maria Maggiore mosaics see the beginning of the use of a plain gold background in some scenes, the start of what was to become a very common feature in religious art for the next thousand years.  But in many respects, the mosaics look (at the expense of visibility, given their high placement) like enlarged miniatures, just as the miniatures of both manuscripts draw on the styles of larger paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Saul and Samuel==
[[File:QuedlinburgItalaFolio2rIllus1KingsChap15.jpg|thumb|270px|Scenes from Chapter 15 of [[1 Samuel]] from the Quedlinburg Itala fragment (again)]]
The fragment includes a full page with four miniatures illustrating the episode at [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 15:13-33:
{{Smaller block|
:13 When Samuel reached him, Saul said, “The Lord bless you! I have carried out the Lord’s instructions.”
:14 But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?”
:15 Saul answered, “The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.” [Upper left, Saul sacrifices at an altar, as Samuel arrives in a two-horse [[Biga (chariot)|''biga'']] (chariot) at left]
:16 “Enough!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night.” “Tell me,” Saul replied.
:17 Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord anointed you king over Israel. 18 And he sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.’ 19 Why did you not obey the Lord? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the Lord?”
:20 “But I did obey the Lord,” Saul said. “I went on the mission the Lord assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. 21 The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God at Gilgal.”
:22 But Samuel replied: “Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices/ as much as in obeying the Lord?/ To obey is better than sacrifice,/ and to heed is better than the fat of rams. 
:23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination,/ and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord,/ he has rejected you as king.”
:24 Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I violated the Lord’s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them. 25 Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord.”
:26 But Samuel said to him, “I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you as king over Israel!”
:27 As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. [Upper right] 
:28 Samuel said to him, “The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to one better than you. 
:29 He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.”
:30 Saul replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God.” 
:31 So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the Lord. [Lower left]
:32 Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.”  Agag came to him in chains.[c] And he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”
:33 But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women.”  And Samuel put Agag to death before the Lord at Gilgal.[Lower right&lt;ref&gt;Text from [[NIV]], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2015&amp;version=NIV Biblegateway], related to images by Cahn, 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;]

==Personal history==
One of seven children,&lt;ref name="DAILY"&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_25-8-2005_pg7_39 Shots fired at Pakistani-born comic’s Oslo restaurant], ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'', 25 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; she moved with her family to [[Norway]] in 1977.

===Marriage ===
She married writer [[Dagfinn Nordbø]] in 2003, the two having initially met on the stand-up circuit in 1999. Tabloid newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'' listed the couple among the country's most influential opinion shapers.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,685999,00.html Nice Witch of the North], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 22 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of marriage the couple split up as Rehman was moving to the United States for studies. Then in August 2007 the couple announced that they were divorcing though still remaining friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Carina |last= Opsann |title= Shabana Rehman skilles |url= http://www.seher.no/php/art.php?id=400538 |format= |work= Seher.no |publisher= [[Se og Hør (Norway)|Se og Hør]] |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date= 14 August 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-21 |language= Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 she married Martin Gaarder, a journalist in the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Geir Helge |last= Skattebo |title= Shabana + Martin = sant |url= http://www.avisa-valdres.no/artikkel.asp?Artid=277245 |format=  |work= Avisa Valdres |publisher= Avisa Valdres |location=  |id=  |pages=  |page=  |date= 22 August 2008 |accessdate= 2009-11-19 |language= Norwegian |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20080824110903/http://www.avisa-valdres.no/artikkel.asp?Artid=277245 |archivedate= 24 August 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
[[File:Shabana Rehman Gaarder.jpg|thumb|Shabana Rehman Gaarder standup during the Girl Dinner 2011 arranged by Start NHH]]
She is active in several arenas and is devoted to breaking taboos and creating more openness.

Rehman started her career as a columnist in ''[[Verdens Gang|VG]]'' in 1996, her debut as a [[stand-up comedian]] came in 1999.&lt;ref name="NOR"&gt;[http://www.norway.org/culture/performing/Shabana+Rehman+in+New+York.htm Standup comedian and writer Shabana Rehman in New York]
&lt;/ref&gt;  She later started working as a columnist for ''[[Dagbladet]]'' in 2000 and now regularly writes for newspapers and magazines.

Rehman has received international publicity and has been interviewed by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="NOR" /&gt;  Her shows have played for full houses in Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands. She is fluent in Norwegian, Urdu and English, and has performed in German.&lt;ref name="NOR" /&gt;

In 2006 Shabana joined the [[American Comedy Institute]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="NOR" /&gt;

==Debate==
[[File:Performance by the mullah-lifting Shabana Rehman.webm|thumb|Shabana performing at the London International Conference on Free Expression and Conscience 2017.]] 
These are some of the events that have created debate around her persona. In [[Scandinavia]] it is referred to as the "Shabana debate".&lt;ref name="NOR" /&gt;  She has police protection.&lt;ref name="DAILY"/&gt;

Anthropologist [[Marianne Gullestad]] accused Rehman of reinforcing stereotypes about Muslims, and making Norwegians think it's ok to discriminate against immigrants.&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt;

*25 August 2005 - Shots were fired at a restaurant owned by Rehman's sister.&lt;ref name="DAILY" /&gt;
*21 August 2005 - Rehman was invited to the opening of the [[Norwegian International Film Festival]] and was granted huge press attention after kissing the then cultural minister of Norway [[Valgerd Svarstad Haugland]] (Haugland represents the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]] (KrF) of Norway and has worked extensively towards gay rights). She also flashed her naked bottom saying "I want to show that in Norway, you can do such things without being lynched or arrested."&lt;ref name="DAILY" /&gt;
*19 March 2005 - In a [[Political criticism|commentary]] in [[Dagbladet]], ''Fødemaskinens fødselsarv'' (Translated: The birth heritage of the breeding machine) she talked openly about her own abortion.
*27 April 2004 - Rehman was granted enormous publicity both in national and international press after lifting [[Mullah Krekar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article783368.ece |title=Immigrant comedienne maddens Mullah |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=28 April 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010042825/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article783368.ece |archivedate=2004-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event resulted in a complaint to the police but was later closed with the reasoning: 'there is currently no reasonable ground for the public to search for perpetrations that the public should persecute'. Her own reason for doing this stunt was: A person that can be lifted is not that dangerous.
*2000 - Posed nude on the cover of Dagbladet with the [[Norwegian flag]] painted on her, saying "I take my clothes off to provoke the authoritarians in order to expose them."&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt;

==Prizes==
*2001 - [[Lions Clubs International]] award
*2002 - [[Fritt Ord Award]] (Free Word Award)

==Storylines==
===1993–2007=== 
Sonia and her family move to [[Albert Square]]. She is the third of [[Carol Jackson]]'s ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) four children and the result of her mother's [[one-night stand]] with Terry Cant, whom Sonia never knew. During her childhood, she becomes close friends with [[Clare Bates|Clare Tyler]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]) and the two are inseparable until Clare falls in with the wrong crowd at school and starts bullying Sonia but they reconcile before Clare leaves in 1998. Sonia has sex with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Alexandrou]]) but starts dating [[Jamie Mitchell]] ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]). Not knowing she is pregnant, Sonia goes into labour and gives birth to Martin's daughter. Baby [[Bex Fowler|Chloe]] (later renamed Rebecca) is subsequently given up for adoption, despite protests from Martin's mother [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]). However, Sonia becomes obsessed with her daughter and abducts her, locking herself in her house with the baby. Despite pleas from Rebecca's adoptive parents, it is Sonia's step-grandmother, [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]), that persuades Sonia to return the baby.

Sonia and Jamie get engaged, but due to Jamie's fling with [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) and constant rowing, the relationship ends. Sonia dates [[Gus Smith]] ([[Mohammed George]]), who plans to propose, but he is devastated when Sonia reconciles with Jamie after he is brutally assaulted by [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). Sonia helps him, nursing him through his injuries and they decide to marry but their happiness is short-lived as Martin accidentally hits Jamie with his vehicle. Sonia keeps a bedside vigil and is with Jamie when he dies.

Sonia eventually forgives Martin and as they grow closer, they fall in love and eventually elope. Sonia begins nursing training and she and Martin live with Pauline but struggle to cope with her interference. Martin gets unwittingly involved with a stalker, [[Sarah Cairns]] ([[Alison Pargeter]]), who tries to ruin his marriage. This culminates in Sarah holding Sonia and Martin hostage and stabbing Martin, until Sonia knocks her unconscious. Sonia and Martin face further upset when they discover that their daughter's adoptive parents have died in a car crash. They visit Rebecca's ([[Jade Sharif]]) guardian, [[Margaret Wilson (EastEnders)|Margaret Wilson]] ([[Janet Amsden]]), hiding their true identity but when Margaret realises who they are, she asks them to leave. Pauline also interferes and visits Rebecca with Martin. Sonia is furious when she learns this and animosity in the Fowlers' home puts a strain on Martin and Sonia's relationship so she spends her time with a colleague, [[Naomi Julien]] ([[Petra Letang]]); feelings develop and they begin an affair. Martin is heartbroken when his marriage ends and the situation is complicated further by Rebecca, who, on Margaret's request, is spending more time at the Fowlers'. Margaret decides to make the Fowlers' Rebecca's legal guardians but does not include Sonia when she finds out about her lesbian fling. Margaret dies and Martin takes custody of Rebecca and Pauline tries to stop Sonia having any contact with Rebecca. This makes Sonia distraught and preoccupied with Rebecca. Feeling neglected, Naomi ends their relationship.

Sonia becomes depressed and begins to neglect her work and drink alcohol, until Gus helps her straighten her life out. Sonia and Gus begin a second romance, which ends due to Sonia's lingering feelings for Martin. Sonia and Martin receive their divorce papers. However, both regret getting divorced and they reconcile. Pauline eventually finds out and tells Martin that she is dying from a brain tumour to stop him moving in with Sonia. Just as Pauline intends, Martin ends his relationship with Sonia in order to care for her, but when the truth finally comes out, a furious Martin moves out anyway. Pauline responds with ire, threatening to cut her son from her life. Sonia tries to build bridges with Pauline but an argument ends with Sonia slapping Pauline. When Pauline is found dead later that day, Sonia fears that she caused her death. She discovers that Rebecca witnessed the slap and tries to silence her daughter, but Rebecca tells Dot at Pauline's funeral. Appalled, Martin refuses Sonia access to Rebecca. Fearing imprisonment Sonia goes [[wiktionary:on the run|on the run]], abducting Rebecca. Martin is frantic, but days later Sonia returns and she is arrested on a murder charge; however, that night Dot uncovers the identity of Pauline's real murderer — Pauline's husband [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]]), who had argued with Pauline on Christmas Day and struck her over the head, causing her death. Sonia is released and decides to leave Walford for Manchester. After making peace with Martin, she takes a taxi and is about to leave Walford when she sees Martin and Rebecca obstructing the road; Martin has decided that he wants to go with Sonia. The Fowlers reunite and leave as a family. They spend time touring the USA before settling in Manchester.

===2010–2011===

In January 2010, Bianca contacts Sonia to invite her to her wedding to Ricky. Sonia texts Bianca, saying that she and Martin will attend. She arrives alone and says Martin and Rebecca are doing fine, but later rejects a phonecall from Martin and gets very drunk. The following day, Sonia walks in on Dot slapping her granddaughter [[Dotty Cotton]] ([[Molly Conlin]]) across the legs, leading to Dot's arrest, though she is soon released without charge. A week into her return, Bianca notices Sonia has continuously avoided talking about Martin and Rebecca. Sonia visits Jamie's grave and later returns to The Queen Victoria, drunken and verbally lays into Phil, Jamie's godfather about his treatment of Jamie. Phil cools her down by telling her he considers Jamie one of his kids and tells her to go upstairs to sober up. She misunderstands him and gets into his bed, naked. As soon as Phil sees Sonia in bed, his girlfriend [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) walks in and gets the wrong idea and slaps Phil across the face. Sonia later apologizes to Phil after a telling off from Shirley. She confides in Carol about her marriage problems with Martin and Carol advises her to give it another shot for Rebecca's sake. After the wedding of Ricky and Bianca, Sonia decides it is time for her to make a fresh start with Martin,  and she leaves the Square once again. However, it is later revealed that Sonia and Martin are no longer together.

===2014–===
In January 2014, Carol informs Sonia, who is having marital problems with Martin again, about her [[breast cancer]] diagnosis. Carol has the [[BRCA gene]] and Sonia finds out she has inherited it. Sonia kisses [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), which Tina's girlfriend, [[Fiona "Tosh" Mackintosh]] (Rebecca Scroggs), finds out about, so Tina end her friendship with Sonia to protect her relationship. Sonia, who has started a weight loss class, arranges to have a [[gastric band]] in [[Bulgaria]], telling friends and family she is on a course. When she returns, she tries to confess to her class but collapses before she can do so. Sonia and Martin (now played by [[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) separate and Sonia starts to feel isolated and depressed. Sonia is supported by Tina but Sonia backs away when Tina goes to kiss her as Sonia is unsure of her feelings.

Martin moves back into the area and Rebecca (now played by [[Jasmine Armfield]]) moves in with him, as she resents Sonia for leaving Martin. Martin believes he can repair his marriage, but Tina and Sonia share a kiss, which Martin sees. He tells everyone in The Vic about Sonia and Tina, but Sonia ends their relationship. Martin sends Rebecca, who now wants to be called Bex, to live with Sonia so she can spend more time with her mother. Sonia also repairs her relationship with Tina. Martin moves in with [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), while Sonia and Tina embark on a full relationship. Sonia and Martin's divorce is finalised. After Tina drunkenly humiliates Sonia at an awards ceremony and Sonia rejects her, Tina has sex with [[Sophie Dodd]] ([[Poppy Rush]]) and regrets it, but before she can tell Sonia, Sonia reveals she has found a lump in her breast. Sonia forgives Tina for the humiliation, but Sophie tells Sonia that Tina cheated and their relationship ends, but they soon reunite. After having her breast lump checked, Sonia is given the all-clear.

Sonia receives a lucrative job offer at a private hospital in Kettering and, having realised she no longer loves Tina, ends their relationship. Bex is furious and thinks Sonia is abandoning her. Bex later calms down and she says an emotional farewell. Several months later, following [[Madison Drake]] (Seraphina Beh), [[Alexandra D'Costa]] (Sydney Craven) and her former friend [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]) continuously bullying Bex, Sonia returns after Bex phones her in tears. Sonia accuses Martin and Stacey of not caring about Bex and tells Martin she wants Bex to live with her. Sonia meets Bex's teachers before returning to Kettering. Sonia returns to Walford and lets herself into Dot's house, finding Dot on the floor after tripping. Sonia and Robbie, who has also returned, move in with Dot to help care for her. It is revealed that Sonia is hiding a secret from her time in Kettering meaning she no longer wants to return there. Although Sonia wants Bex to move in with them, Bex chooses to stay with Martin and Stacey.

Sonia starts dating Bex's teacher [[Gethin Pryce]] ([[Cerith Flinn]]) but is unaware that Bex is infatuated with him. Bex and Gethin kiss and after Bex's attempts to pursue him and he eventually confesses to Sonia. Gethin subsequently resigns his job at the school and leaves Walford, and Sonia tells Bex that she has done nothing wrong.

==Creation==
[[File:Young sonia.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Sonia as she looked in 1993]]
1994 was a "historic" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April, a third weekly episode was introduced.&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Among them were the Jackson family: mother [[Carol Jackson|Carol]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), her four children, [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), [[Robbie Jackson|Robbie]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]), Sonia ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), and [[Billie Jackson|Billie]] ([[Devon Anderson]]), as well as Carol's partner [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]). Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. The family was created by writer [[Tony McHale]].&lt;ref name="Larry Jaffee"&gt;{{cite book |author= Larry Jaffee|title=Albert Square &amp; Me: The Actors of Eastenders|year=2009|publisher=iUniverse.com|isbn= 978-1-4401-5987-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of [[Albert Square]]. Their slow introduction was a deliberate attempt by the programme makers to introduce the whole family over a long period.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; The Jacksons have been described by ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] as a "classic problem family".&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

Cassidy was 10 years old when she joined the soap as Sonia.&lt;ref name="break"/&gt; She was spotted doing improvisations at the Anna Scher Theatre School by Tony McHale and ''EastEnders''' Casting Advisor Jane Deitch. They liked Cassidy and she was asked to audition at Elstree studios, after which she was offered the part. None of the actors cast as the Jackson family were matched for appearance or screen compatibility. Cassidy commented, "it was all decided without doing that. I don't think it particularly mattered that none of us Jackson kids looked like each other because all our characters had different dads!"&lt;ref name="Larry Jaffee"/&gt;

==Development==
Early on in the character's narrative, Sonia was given a trumpet to play, which she did badly, infuriating her family and neighbours. According to Cassidy, this was on the behest of Storyliner and future Executive Producer of ''EastEnders'', [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]]. Cassidy revealed that she took lessons to play the trumpet, but that when she began to play well, she was asked by the producers to pretend to play it badly as Sonia was supposed to be playing it badly.&lt;ref name="Larry Jaffee"/&gt; Other storylines included a period where Sonia was bullied by her friend [[Clare Bates]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]) after she fell in with the wrong crowd at school. Despite the bullying storyline, Cassidy said that she and Bissix were good friends during their time together on the soap.&lt;ref name="Larry Jaffee"/&gt;

In 1997, the actress who played Sonia's mother Carol decided to quit ''EastEnders''. It was at this stage that the producers made a decision to write the majority of the Jackson family out. Cassidy commented, "I thought I was out of a job [on ''EastEnders''] forever!". Cassidy made several temporary returns on-screen months later to visit Clare or Bianca, but she was still uncertain about the future of her character: "I didn't come back to the show for about four months or so after [ I was written out in 1997]. And after Clare left the Square [in 1998] I was gone for another eight months. I just got on with school and all that". However, later in 1998 the producers asked Cassidy to return to the serial full-time, which she said she was "thrilled" about.&lt;ref name="Larry Jaffee"/&gt;

===Departure (2007)===
In April 2006, it was announced that Cassidy would take a break from ''EastEnders'', saying "it's time to try new things. But it doesn't mean Sonia won't be back".&lt;ref name="break"/&gt; A BBC spokesperson added, "Natalie is a valued member of the ''EastEnders'' cast and we wish her all the very best during her break from the show".&lt;ref name="break"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4895214.stm|title=Cassidy set for EastEnders break |date=10 April 2006|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonia departed on screen in February 2007, along with her former husband Martin, as his actor, [[James Alexandrou]], also left the serial. Their departing storyline was the culmination of the death of [[Pauline Fowler]], following actress [[Wendy Richard]]'s high-profile resignation from the serial in 2006. In the storyline, Pauline dies in suspicious circumstances and Sonia is blamed for killing her, although Sonia is eventually vindicated when Pauline's husband [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]]) admits to manslaughter. Sonia and Martin and their daughter Rebecca leave Walford as a united family for the [[United States]]. In 2010, Cassidy said one of the reasons she decided to leave the show was because of Sonia's affair with [[Naomi Julien]] ([[Petra Letang]]), saying it was wrong for the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a197691/natalie-cassidy-bemoans-lesbian-storyline.html|title=Natalie Cassidy bemoans lesbian storyline|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Paul|last=Millar|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Cassidy's departure being specified as a "break", Cassidy commented in 2008, "I feel that door's closed now and I need to go and do other stuff [...] Maybe in nine years I might go back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a89852/natalie-cassidy-misses-patsy-palmer.html|title=Natalie Cassidy misses Patsy Palmer|date=21 February 2008|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in 2009, press reports suggested that the actress was keen to reprise the role. [[Patsy Palmer]], who returned to ''EastEnders'' as Sonia's sister Bianca, publicly called for the actress's return: "I would love her to come back. I mean, she is family! I've told bosses that it's a good time, when you think about it, as the Jacksons are back now as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a142436/cassidy-eyes-eastenders-return.html|title=Cassidy eyes 'EastEnders' return|date=14 January 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Returns (2010, 2011 and 2014)===
On 25 October 2009 it was announced that Cassidy would return to the soap to reprise her role as Sonia, along with Coulson, Gaffney and Anderson. The characters would reunite with Bianca who returned in 2008. Cassidy is quoted as saying "To be invited back to ''EastEnders'' is such an honour and I am very, very excited that Sonia is coming back. For me, to be reunited with the original Jacksons is a dream come true and I think it will be a fantastic storyline."&lt;ref name="2010return"/&gt; A source told entertainment website [[Digital Spy]]: "Everything's being kept hush-hush about the Jacksons' return at the moment, but there are certainly a load of questions to be answered. Will the frosty relationship between Carol and Bianca thaw? Are Sonia and Martin still together? And how will Robbie react when he learns of his beloved Wellard's death? Everyone's so pleased to have them back."&lt;ref name="2010return"/&gt; The family returned for Bianca's second wedding to [[Ricky Butcher]] as part of the show's 25th anniversary. Executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] explained that he wanted great stories to get people talking, saying "The wedding is the perfect opportunity for us to bring back the much-loved Jackson characters – Carol, Sonia, Robbie and Billie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a189597/eastenders-exec-teases-2010-storylines.html|title='EastEnders' exec teases 2010 storylines|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After departing once again in 2011, Sonia returned permanently on 14 January 2014.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/natalie-cassidy-returns-eastenders-sonia-2343477|title=Natalie Cassidy returns to EastEnders as Sonia Fowler in dramatic New Year storyline|last=Watts|first=Halina|date=6 October 2013|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a523538/eastenders-confirms-sonia-fowler-return.html|title='EastEnders' confirms Sonia Fowler return|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=15 October 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Cassidy announced she was expecting her second child, meaning she would be taking maternity leave. Cassidy confirmed the baby is due in "summer" 2016.&lt;ref name="maternity"/&gt; It was expected that Cassidy would leave in spring 2016, with Sonia departing on-screen in summer 2016. Sonia departed on-screen on 20 September 2016.&lt;ref name="maternity"/&gt; After returning for a short stint from 14 April 2017 to 18 April 2017, Cassidy returned to the role of Sonia permanently, with the return being broadcast on 27 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/10/eastenders-spoilers-sonia-fowlers-back-and-she-exposes-louise-mitchells-role-in-bexs-bullying-nightmare-6560434/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Natalie Cassidy won the award for "Best Actress" for the role of Sonia, at the 2001 ''[[British Soap Awards]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1353527.stm|title=EastEnders triumph at UK soap awards|date=26 May 2001|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 2004, Cassidy was awarded "best dramatic performance by a young actor or actress" for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3694405.stm|title=EastEnders wins battle of soaps|date=8 May 2004|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referencing Sonia's foray into lesbianism in 2005, TV critic [[Grace Dent]] branded the character "the worst lesbian ever", adding, "The only lesbians with less lesbian tendencies than you are the women on the front cover of the Horny Triple-X Lesbian Specials which they keep at eye level by the sweets in my corner shop. Time to make a u-turn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/08/tvandradio.theguide|title=Grace Dent's World of lather|date=8 July 2006|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbian website [[AfterEllen.com]] was also critical of the storyline that saw Sonia experimenting with her sexuality and then returning to her heterosexual orientation shortly after. Sharon Hadrian writes: "It was the first time in over a decade that a lesbian couple had been depicted in the East London drama, lending cautious optimism to the idea that the BBC was finally integrating its traditionally heterosexual soaps [...] Lesbian fans, meanwhile, are struggling to care at all after being led on by the show's failed attempts at writing a decent lesbian story line [...]  Despite their troubles, Martin and Sonia got married in 2004 and — given their past — many fans believe they are meant to be together. If this seems like the most inopportune time to turn Sonia into a lesbian, well, the show's writers did it anyway [...]  Sonia's sudden lesbian affair was met with disapproval from all sides, and nobody — the fans, characters or even the actors — was particularly supportive of her relationship. As a result, perhaps, the writers wrote what was expected of them [...] there was hardly room in the script for any affection or sympathy at all; instead, their relationship was written around its impact on Martin and the other Albert Square residents. The reaction of Rebecca's guardian, Margaret, was especially hurtful. When the [lesbian] relationship became public, she immediately sought to award sole custody of Rebecca to Martin, citing Sonia's sexual orientation as the reason she would be an unfit mother. This vitriolic response to Sonia and Naomi's relationship could have been a pivotal moment had the program's producers used the opportunity to prove either the quality of their relationship or to reinforce Sonia's parenting abilities. Unfortunately, they did neither of these things. Instead, Margaret's reaction was surprisingly representative of the public response to their relationship. Fans of the show were upset that anyone (let alone a lesbian) had come between Sonia and Martin. Naomi came off looking especially predatory — a common trait in media representations of gay and lesbian characters — by seducing a formerly heterosexual woman and convincing her to leave her family [...] not too surprisingly, Naomi and Sonia broke up. Afterward, Naomi faded into the background and Sonia ended up back with Martin, seeming to forget entirely about the same-sex attractions she once had [...] It was a sad but not unexpected ending to a rare chance for the BBC to acknowledge lesbian sexuality in its programming and for viewers to witness a positive lesbian relationship that didn't ruin anybody's life [...] Sonia or Naomi [...] had the potential to develop a loving depiction of lesbian sexuality but were failed by the show's writers and, arguably, the BBC's institutionalized homophobia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/3/eastenders?page=0%2C1|title=No More Lesbians on "EastEnders"|date=28 February 2007|work=[[AfterEllen.com]]|accessdate=18 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306075547/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/3/eastenders?page=0%2C1|archivedate=6 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strettweger Opferwagen.JPG|right|thumb| Cult Wagon of Strettweg as depicted in 1886 Jahrbuch des Kaiserlich Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts.]]
[[File:Kultwagen von Strettweg - 2.jpg|thumb|detail]]
The '''Cult Wagon of Strettweg''', or '''Strettweg Sacrificial Wagon''', or '''Strettweg Chariot''' is a bronze cult wagon from ca. 600 [[Before Christ|BC]], which was found as part of a princely grave of the [[Hallstatt culture]] in Strettweg near [[Judenburg]], [[Austria]] in 1851.  Besides the wagon, other [[grave goods]], like jewelry, bronze [[amphorae]], iron weapons, and [[horse tack|tack]] and [[horse harness|harness]] gear were found.

The wagon consists of a square-shaped, open-worked base plate with four spoked wheels. A female figure approx. 32&amp;nbsp;cm high holding a bowl-shaped object in upraised hands stands in the center of the wagon.  The bowl is also held on the sides by two scissor-shaped supports.   Recent restoration work and examination by experts has concluded that the bowl attributed to the wagon up to now cannot be conclusively proven to originally have been part of the cult wagon {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.  In addition to the kettle bearer, numerous other figures in the form of both standing and mounted people as well as animals similar to deer and to horses are present on the wagon. The depicted scene is interpreted as a [[sacrifice]]. The wagon presumably served as a [[cult]] object for the consumption of a [[libation]].

The Strettweg Sacrificial Wagon was restored in 2009 and is on display in the newly redesigned Archaeology Museum of [[Styria|Styrian]] [[Universalmuseum Joanneum]] at [[Schloss Eggenberg (Graz)|Schloss Eggenberg]] in [[Graz]].  A copy is on display in the museum in Judenburg.

'''''Tales of the Hasidim''''' is a book of collected tales by [[Martin Buber]]. It is based on stories—both written and spoken—based in the [[Hasidim]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of the Hasidim: The Early Masters''. M Buber - O. Marx, New York: [[Schocken Books]], 1947&lt;/ref&gt; Buber wrote these tales based on the lore of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]. Many of the stories are parables passed down via both the written and spoken word.&lt;ref&gt;''Wrapped in a holy flame: teachings and tales of the Hasidic masters''.Z Schachter-Shalomi… - 2003 - Jossey-Bass&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The work is an amalgam of tales based on the [[Midrash]]. Buber's collection includes a focus on the theme of non-judgment. [[Rebbes]] in the work often chastise followers for pious behavior and reward those who keep the spirit and tradition of Judaism alive. Some of the tales in the book (sometimes referred to as "The Early Masters") constitute [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sigmund Freud and the Jewish mystical tradition''. D Bakan - 1969 - Schocken Books&lt;/ref&gt; Buber intended to show how important a sense of community was to the Hasidim rather than expound dogma,&lt;ref&gt;''Martin Buber and the human sciences''. MS Friedman - 1996 - books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Chaim Potok]] remarked that Buber "romanticized" his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Buber. M Buber - ''Information Theory'', 1950 - books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of music in Taoist ceremony is demonstrated by revealing how central beliefs are reflected through elements of music such as pandas, instrumentation and rhythm.  The ritual celebrating the birth of [[Guanyin]] was observed at the [[Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia]], Deagon to identify structure, role of participants, music forms and instrumentation.  Expression of spiritual beliefs through music enables followers of Taoism to enhance their path to enlightenment.

== Music in Taoist ceremony== 
Music has long played an integral part in religious ceremonies.  In [[Taoism|Taoist]] ceremonies, music has several different functions.  Taoists believe that music is a way to speak to the gods, to inspire religious followers and to achieve inner harmony, bringing the listener or participant closer to Tao.  Tao is the path to enlightenment, the goal of all followers of the Taoist faith.  To follow Tao is to recognise the inner harmony and balance in all living things. This belief is often represented in the [[Yin Yang]] symbol. In the ceremony witnessed at the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia, Deagon, the birth of [[Quan Yin]], the goddess of mercy was celebrated.  Music and instrumentation played a central role in this ritual.  The priests sung each chant and prayer to their gods, and accompanied these on musical instruments.  The musical expression of a Taoist ceremony supports the core beliefs of the religion.  Firstly, the role of music in the ceremony will be described, showing its religious importance to Taoism.  Secondly, this relates the structure of the birth of [[Quan Yin]] ceremony to the achievement of Tao.  The principal doctrines of Taoism and the roles of the various participants in the ceremony will also be described. Following this, the demeanour of participants and the physical setting of the ceremony will be illustrated.  Studying the role of music in Taoist ceremony will demonstrate the importance of music in religion as a means to inspire followers, improve and deepen faith, and enable communication with gods.  Describing how the music in the ceremony witnessed communicates and confirms the belief systems of Taoism will reveal music is as intrinsic to the Taoist as the path of Tao itself.

==Background on Taoism==
Taoism or Daoism, as it is commonly referred to, is an ancient Chinese religion and philosophy.  Taoism can be traced to a 6th-century B.C. scripture written by [[Lao Tzu]], the [[Tao Te Ching]] (Verellen, 1995).  Tao Te Ching translates into the classic of the way and its virtue .  The writings of the Tao Te Ching support passive behaviour and promote natural harmony with nature.  The main underlying theme to the writings is the value of wu-wei, (non-striving) “by which one returns to a primitive state closer to the Tao”. (Duyvendak, Chan, Lau, Mitchell, &amp; Mair, 2005).   These writings are considered to be influenced by [[Buddhist]] ideals, [[Confucian]] philosophy and traditional ancient Chinese mysticism ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).

The priests of the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia are devotees of an order of Taoism known as the Evergreen Taoist Religious Order (EVTRO).  They follow the teachings of the “principal canons” of Taoism (Verellen, 1995).  The Taoists of the EVTRO believe in being apart from the need of worldly possessions, and aim at creating a solidarity and harmony between heaven and man.  One way in which they hope to achieve this is by giving freely of their time in public ceremonies to help others come closer to their own inner harmony.

In the Taoist ceremony of the birth of [[Quan Yin]], music was a key component of the service.  The entire dialogue of the ritual was intoned or sung by the priests, and these prayers were always accompanied by instrumentation ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  The chanting and instrumentation are used by the priests of Taoism as a tool to achieving the Tao (Bowker, 2000).  The Tao is described as the way or the path (Park, 2001).  Taoists understand that by following the path of Tao and reaching a balance with all things a human can gain self-realization.  Music assists the follower on his/her path to the Tao by helping to communicate with gods, reach inner harmony and come closer to finding balance with the world.

==Yin and Yang tones==
The principal belief of the [[Yin Yang]] is reflected in the categorisation of musical tones.  The two main forms of Taoist music are the Yin Tone and the Yang Tone ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  Yin stands for all things that are female and soft and Yang stands for all things male and hard.  Through the proper balance of Yin (female) and Yang (male) a Taoist can find harmony and simplicity in all things (Bowker, 2000).  Taoists strive to have these cosmic forces within themselves and around them at peace and in balance (Keown, 2003). 

The Yang tone is used in rituals mainly for the benefit of the priests, spirits and gods [http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  .  The ceremony held to celebrate the birth of the god Quan Yin, one of the deities of Taoism, started with chanting in the Yang tone. The other form, Yin Tone, is music aimed at appeasing and entertaining the general populace.  This creates a harmony with the Yang tone, by giving to the people what the Yang tone gives to the gods and priests.  Yin tones are usually performed at outer altars to inspire the populace in their beliefs and are livelier and more melodic than Yang tunes (Long, 2005).  The ceremony of the birth of Quan Yin consisted of elements of both the Yang tone and the Yin tone.  This combination of tones symbolizes the balance Taoists strive to achieve.  

The Yang tones were initially staged in the hall of the three purities.  The three purities are the highest deities in Taoism and they are said to reside over the heavens (Murashige, 2005).    The ceremony involved three female priests, two of which wore robes of simple red and black and the main priest wore a richly decorated robe of a jade colour.  The priests stood in front of the three purities and read from prayer books before them.  The priests maintained this formation throughout the entire ceremony until the end, when the main priest led them in single file around each of the altars in the temple to pay their respects to the other gods.

The ceremony started with the three priests chanting in a mono syllabic, often repeated phrase with only slight melodic deviation from the tonic.  The melodic deviation was rising in a pentatonic style chord then dropping in similar pentatonic step wise motion until the melody arrived back at the tonic, in a wave type phrase (Figure 2).  Most melodic phrases in the ceremony ended in descending tones, heading back to the tonic (to gain harmony and balance, like yin-yang) before starting the next phrase.  Later on, as the ceremony was finishing off, the music strayed from the Yang Tone and headed more towards the Yin tone.  The priests made their way around the temple to the other places of worship and the forecourt, for the purpose of the general populace observing the ritual.  The prayers in this section were still somewhat intoned.  More melodic phrasing was heard and the rhythms became faster and more syncopated.  These rhythms, syncopations and melodic ideas all relate to the core belief of Taoism, balance and harmony.  

The demeanour and interaction between the priests and worshippers reflected an air of individual focus.  The priests were constantly absorbed on the prayers, chanting, and rhythm and ignored all other matters.  Many other worshippers came and went as the ceremony progressed and paid their respects to the three purities and the two adjoining altars on either side of the main altar, at which the ceremony was held.  The worshippers made no appearance of solemnity towards the ceremony and came and went as they pleased, leaving incense offerings and praying.  In the following of Tao, each of these worshippers had their own inner harmony and this in no way intruded on the Tao of the ceremony, or the Tao of the priests.

==Instruments and gestures==
The priests in the ceremony used a variety of instruments.  The main priest used hand movements and ritual objects influenced by Chinese mysticism.  These gestures are used in Yang tone ceremonies in combination with magical instruments ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  Magical instruments are believed to manifest magical powers during rituals.  The Yang tone is mainly played with magical instruments such as the Qing (metal bowl) and the Faqi (ritual percussion section). The Faqi often consisted of large drums, bells, and wooden fish blocks called Muyu (Jones, 2005).  These are played to help mediation and to compliment the ritual actions of the priests (Hong, 2005).  The musical instruments used in this ceremony, the Qing and the Muyu, are said to be indispensable (Hong, 2005).  These are also used to set the time of the chanting and to add to the religious atmosphere.  Through most of the parts of the ceremony a steady beat on the Muyu (Figure 5) and Qing (Figure 4) accompanied the chanting, with sections between prayers ending with a syncopated rhythm of the Qing and Muyu (Figure 3).

==Themes==
Music has been established as a key element of Taoist ceremony.  By examining the role of music in Taoist rituals, it is evident that instrumentation and vocalisation play central roles.  The structure of the event has been shown to symbolise the balance ideal of Taoism.  The core concept of Yin-Yang balance has been revealed as a theme that is acknowledged in areas of ceremony such as intonation, melodic deviation, rhythm and form.  The conduct of the various participants and the setting of the ceremony have also been outlined.  By examining the ceremony of the birth of Quan Yin, at the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia, it is clear that music is used to guide its followers and practitioners on their path to universal harmony. In the balanced philosophy of Taoism without music there would only be silence, solitary, alone and unbalanced.

'''Tartan Noir''' is a form of [[crime fiction]] particular to [[Scotland]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] writers. It has its roots in [[Scottish literature]] but borrows elements from elsewhere, including from the work of American crime writers of the second half of the twentieth century, especially of the [[hard-boiled]] genre, and of European authors.

==Roots and influences==
The United States crime writer [[James Ellroy]] coined the name when he described [[Ian Rankin]] as "the king of tartan noir" for a book cover.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Ian Rankin actually gave himself the name when he asked Ellroy to sign a book for him and said "I'm a big fan and I write tartan noir". Tartan noir draws on the traditions of Scottish literature, being strongly influenced by [[James Hogg]]'s ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner|Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]'' and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''. These works dwell on the duality of the [[soul]]; the nature of good and [[evil]]; issues of [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], salvation and [[damnation]] amongst others. The Scottish concept of the "[[Caledonian Antisyzygy|Caledonian antisyzygy]]", the duality of a single entity, is a key driving force in Scottish literature, and it appears especially prominently in the tartan noir genre.

Modern crime writers have also been influenced by 1930s and 1940s United States masters of the [[hard-boiled]] genre, particularly [[Dashiell Hammett]] and [[Raymond Chandler]].  [[Allan Guthrie]]'s work shows their influence, as does some of Ian Rankin.  More recent American authors who have influenced Scottish writing include James Ellroy, whose focus on police and societal corruption has proven especially resonant with Rankin. 

Scottish crime writing has also been influenced by European traditions. For instance, [[Georges Simenon]]'s [[Inspector Maigret]] goes after the criminals, but refuses to judge them, seeing crime as a human situation to be understood. [[William McIlvanney]]'s novel ''[[Laidlaw (novel)|Laidlaw]]'' (1977), with its lead character of Inspector Jack Laidlaw, seemed to have been influenced by Maigret. The social criticism in [[Sjöwall and Wahlöö]]'s [[Martin Beck]] detective series appears in many works of tartan noir, such as the dark novels of [[Denise Mina]].

McIlvanney's ''Laidlaw'' novel has been called the first novel of the tartan noir genre, given its combination of humanism and police procedural.  While ''Laidlaw'' is critically important, and a novel that inspired many authors, the TV series ''[[Taggart]]'' established crime in a Scottish setting in the popular imagination. [[Glenn Chandler]], creator of ''Taggart'' and writer of many of its early stories, may have been inspired by ''[[Laidlaw (novel)|Laidlaw]]''. Both share a [[Glasgow]] setting and involve the investigations by [[Strathclyde Police|Glasgow police]] into murders.

==Characteristics==
The world-view of Tartan Noir tends toward the cynical and world-weary, typically "hard-boiled". Many of the protagonists in Tartan Noir stories are [[anti-hero]]es, with readers not automatically being expected to sympathise with them – an illustrative example appears in [[Ian Rankin]]'s ''[[Knots and Crosses]]'' when [[Inspector Rebus]] blatantly steals [[bread roll]]s and [[milk]] from a shop, without apology or remorse. The main characters often go through personal crises in the course of the stories, with these crises often forming a key part of the story. The main character frequently has personal reasons for dealing with the crime, whether from personal history or a sense of right and wrong. [[Val McDermid]]'s presents her character Lindsay Gordon as being motivated by the murder of a friend and [[homophobia|homophobic]] jibes about the death of her former lover as impetus to catch the murderer.

==Criticism==
Literary critics discuss whether the genre is a viable one, or one created by publishers seeking a [[unique selling point]] for an audience tired of much US and English crime fiction. William McIlvanney has said that the whole genre is "[[ersatz]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3654866/A-writers-life-William-McIlvanney.html |title=A writer's life: William McIlvanney |first=Stuart |last=Kelly |date=27 August 2006 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics question whether a genre can encompass such a wide range of authors, reaching from [[Val McDermid]] to [[Ian Rankin]]; some also dislike the name.  Charles Taylor has noted that the term has an "inescapably condescending tinge", noting "it's a touristy phrase, suggesting that there's something quaint about hard-boiled crime fiction that comes from the land of kilts and haggis." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E0DD103AF931A15751C0A9629C8B63 |first=Charles |last=Taylor |title=Paint It Noir |date=22 February 2004 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Tastes like chicken'''" is a declaration used when trying to describe the flavor of an unusual [[food]]. The expression has been used so often in popular culture that it has become a [[cliché]]. As a result, the phrase is also sometimes used to provide incongruous [[humor]], by being used to describe foods or situations where it has no real relevance.

==Possible explanations==
As an explanation of why unusual meats would taste more like [[chicken]] than common alternatives such as [[beef]] or [[pork]], different possibilities have been offered. One idea is that chicken has a bland taste compared to other meats because [[fat]] contributes more flavor than [[muscle]] (especially in the case of a lean cut such as a skinless chicken breast), making it a generic choice for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E3DD1F3BF932A15752C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=%22heritage%20turkey%22&amp;st=cse|title=The Hunt for a Truly Grand Turkey, One That Nature Built |last=Burros|first=Marian|date=November 21, 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, chicken reportedly has lower levels of [[glutamate]]s that contribute to the "savory" aspect of [[taste]] known as [[umami]]; processing or tenderizing other meats would also lower glutamate levels and make them taste more like chicken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Modern poultry, particularly mass-produced chicken and [[domestic turkey|turkey]], is particularly bland in taste, as animals are bred for large muscle mass that grows faster than naturally breeding fowl; trace chemicals in the meat that would give it a distinctive flavor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw10212007/2003957455_pacificpturkeys21.html |title=Pilgrim's Progress |last=Mapes |first=Lynda V. |work=[[Seattle Times]] |date=October 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; would thus be dispersed through larger amounts of muscle with less time to accumulate, thus giving lower concentrations per ounce of meat and creating a more generic taste.

Another suggestion, made by Joe Staton of the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], is that meat flavors are fixed based on the "[[evolution]]ary origin" of the animal. Specifically, he noted that [[tetrapod]]s largely taste like chicken, whereas other animals usually do not. Accordingly, [[bird]]s (the most numerous form of meat by type) would (in most cases) naturally taste more like chicken than [[mammal]]s.{{Clarification needed|reason = the logic of this argument is faulty.|date=February 2015}} Furthermore, because [[dinosaur]]s are ancestral to birds, their meat would hypothetically have also tasted like chicken.  However, the meat of other fowl often tastes nothing like chicken; for example, [[pheasant]] meat is described as a "unique" flavor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bbq.about.com/od/poultry/a/aa121005a.htm |title= About Food: Pheasant|year=2015| access-date= 29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ostrich meat]] is considered very similar to beef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ostrich.ca/cooking/index.htm | title=Cooking Tips | last=Canadian Ostrich Association | date=April 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812065115/http://www.ostrich.ca/cooking/index.htm | archivedate=2016-08-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Seafood]], however, would logically have a more distinctive flavor. Also, although mammals are tetrapods, very few mammals taste like chicken, which implies that there had been a mutation that changed their flavor on that branch of the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name="staton"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume4/v4i4/chicken.htm |first=Joe |last=Staton |title=Tastes Like Chicken? |work=The Annals of Improbable Research |volume=4 |number=4}} [http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/2331/2331.pdf Full article (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is that since much of the meat of a chicken is taken from the chest, which contains the white 'fast fibers' that are necessary for the short, fast flight of a fleeing chicken, it tastes like these other animals due to similar concentrations of fast fibers in the parts that are used for meat. The taste difference is usually attributed to low concentrations of the iron-containing protein [[myoglobin]], a high concentration being more typical of vertebrates and tissues adapted for slow, sustained exertion. Myoglobin-rich meat is contrariwise often called [[red meat]].&lt;ref&gt;Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology Fourth Edition, Martini/Bartholomew and others, page 201, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last Judgment''''' is a [[triptych]] of disputed authorship, either by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], his workshop, or a collaboration between artist and workshop. It was created after 1486.

The triptych currently resides at the [[Groeningemuseum]] in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]. The outside of the shutters are painted in [[grisaille]], while the inside shutters and center are oil on panel.

==History==
The work belonged to E. Gravet's collection, and then to that of Seligman, in [[Paris]]. In 1907 it was acquired by  A. Bernaert, who donated it to the city of Bruges. In 1936 it was cleaned and was restored again in 1959. In that occasion, the [[grisaille]] painting of the external shutters were discovered, although damaged. The painting above the internal frames is lost.

The attribution of the work is dubious, due to its mediocre quality.  [[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronologic]] analysis dated it from not before 1486.&lt;ref name="Varallo"&gt;{{cite book |first=Franca |last=Varallo |title=Bosch |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2004 |isbn=978-88-572-0615-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting's composition has similarities to [[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych)|''The Last Judgment'' triptych]] in Vienna and the ''[[Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': both show the Garden of Eden in the left panel and the Hell at right.

Like in other contemporary [[Flemish art|Flemish]] triptychs, the shutters are externally painted in [[grisaille]] with an ''Coronation with Thorns''.

In the central panel is Christ as a judge within a celestial sphere, flanked by angels who are playing the Trumpets of Last Judgement, and by the apostles. Below him is the punishment of sinners which, like the ''Last Judgement'' of Vienna, continues in the Hell depiction at right. At left is the Paradise, where the blessed souls are being shipped to Eden on a boat with a pink tent. The tower is a symbol of the Fountain of Eternal Youth, a more articulate version of which appears in the ''Garden of Delights''.

The central panel is mostly occupied by insect-like demons who torture the men, punishments including burning, eating impure food (the gluttonous) etc., all inspired by [[Netherlandish Proverbs]]. The infernal city at right is under siege by demons, while a fire is visible in  the far background.

An '''unjuried''' art exhibition or festival is one where all submissions are accepted.

Within theater, it is often referred to as a [[fringe theatre|fringe festival]], following the unjuried [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

== History ==
Traditionally gatherings have had varying degrees of inclusiveness and exclusiveness, hence broadly speaking, the notion of a "[[Juried (competition)|juried]]" or "unjuried" gathering dates to prehistory. More narrowly, the notion of an unjuried exhibition arose in response to the [[Paris Salon]], which began in 1725 and was juried from 1748 onwards.
The Salon was very influential in the western world during the period 1748–1890 as an arbiter of taste, and the revolt against its strictures was a key conflict in the development of western art.
An exhibitions of works refused from the official Salon was referred to as a [[Salon des Refusés]], which became particularly prominent from 1863 onwards, when the French government under Emperor [[Napoléon III]] funded a Salon des Refusés for the large number of rejected artworks in that year.
1884 saw the formation of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]] (Society of Independent Artists), whose device was ''Sans jury ni récompense'' (Without jury nor awards), and which has run unjuried art exhibits from 1884 to the present day, under the title of ''Salon des Indépendants'' (Independents Salon).
The development of these rejected or unjuried exhibits was key in the development of the [[avant-garde]] in painting, particularly the [[Ecole de Paris]] (Paris School), with the SAI being particularly prominent during the [[Gilded Age]], until [[World War I]].

In theater, unjuried festivals rose to prominence in the second half of the twentieth century, most prominently in the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

== Criteria ==
Despite declaring no criteria for inclusion, some unjuried exhibits or festivals have constraints on genre. Thus, while they may accept any work of art, they may reject an object as "not art". Notoriously, [[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was rejected from an unjuried art exhibition in 1917 as "not being art" – this being a stunt staged by Duchamp to challenge the conventional (even within the avant-garde) definition of "art".

[[Image:Aa fitzcarraldo ship.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the side of the Fitzcarraldo]]
'''Walk the Plank''' are a British group of artists, theatre makers, pyrotechnicians and event engineers who specialise in outdoor arts/theatre, touring performance and [[pyrotechnic]]s. 

Their shows are on land and on water and often mix performance, music, lighting, visual images, fire, and [[fireworks]]. The company was established by John Wassell and Liz Pugh in 1991, who identified a [[niche market]] for a touring theatre ship, and other aquatic shows on the waterways. The company's work began when the pair purchased a touring [[theatre]] ship, the MV ''Fitzcarraldo''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The company's work has now extended far beyond the ship and they work on delivering shows and events, varying in scale from intimate to epic. Walk the Plank have produced work for Toronto’s [[Wintercity Festival]], [[Singapore Festival]], [[Euro 2004]], [[Tall Ships 2005]], [[Centerparcs]], Sir [[Paul McCartney]], the [[Commonwealth Games]], as well as multiple city and local councils. Perhaps their most well known credit are the opening and closing ceremonies for Liverpool's Capital of Culture celebrations.

Their administrative base is in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Greater Manchester]] and they have workshop facilities in Ramsbottom and Rawtenstall.

Their work often involves community engagement and they are known for scheduling and leading participation elements which fit the context of the event they are organising.

==Event management and consultancy==
The company's Senior Management Team (including co-founders John Wassell and Liz Pugh and Project Directors Andy Stratford and Billie Klinger) are trusted advisers in the areas of outdoor arts and cultural events.

==MV Fitzcarraldo==
The ''Fitzcarraldo'' [http://www.walktheplank.co.uk/wtp/index.php?page=nauticalia] was built in 1971 in [[Sandnessjøen]], Norway for [[TFDS]] as the MV Bjarkøj. She was 20 years a general cargo and passenger ferry working the islands around [[Tromsø]] in north [[Norway]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In December 1991 Walk the Plank purchased the ship, renaming it the ''Fitzcarraldo''. The ship was registered British in 1992, the same year of its first British national tour. Its hold was adapted as a theatre. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Each summer, from 1992 to 2006 the ''Fitzcarraldo'' set sail from the [[Albert Dock]], [[Liverpool]] and toured ports and harbours in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Audiences of up to 125 people can sit the aft deck to watch as the hatches rise and the cargo holds are [[Crane (machine)|crane]]d open.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 2000, 's co-production (with  Company) of "Moby Dick" won Best Fringe Production at the [[Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards]]. Jim Burke also won the Best New Play award for this adaptation. 

In 2003 the ship went on a national tour to 19 ports with a stage adaption of [[Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea]], to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dorset Echo'', 23 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Evening News'', 2 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; At first the audience sits on the [[quayside]], and the ''Fitzcarraldo'' represents the ''Abraham Lincoln''; later they sit in the ''Fitzcarraldo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hold, which represents the inside of the ''Nautilus'', or occasionally the seabed.

Currently, due to mechanical deterioration to some of its driving components the ship resides in the [[Canning Dock]], which is part of Liverpool's [[Albert Dock]] complex, and is used as a static venue for many events including parties, [[cabaret]] evenings, live music, and drama.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Walk the Plank are currently making plans to sell the Fitzcarraldo, in order to focus on delivering large scale outdoor events, creating touring performance and continue to provide pyrotechnics elements and firework displays to both public sector and private corporate organisations.

==WTP Pyrotechnics==
'''WTP Pyrotechnics''' is a [[limited company]] who donate all their profits to Walk the Plank. This is a major source of income for Walk the Plank other than arts grants and donations. WTP Pyrotechnics creates [[fireshows]], [[firework]] displays, site-specific work, and outdoor spectacles – producing work in landlocked and waterside locations. They have created shows on canals and rivers, in harbours and parks and town centres in the UK and abroad.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Past projects include site-specific events, fireshows and aquatic spectacle, working with [[pyrotechnics]], machines, music, large images, and mobile structures, performance, and fire; usually, one-off specially-commissioned pieces created for a particular site or occasion. The work is often on, near, or by water, but they work inland also.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[File:Maternité Phemba-Kongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Phemba sculpture from a private collection in France]]
'''Phemba''', also known as '''[[Yombe people|Yombe]] maternity figures''', refers to sculptural objects that depict the figures of a mother and child.&lt;ref name="AfAmInstitute1980"&gt;{{cite book | title=Masterpieces of the People's Republic of the Congo: the African-American Institute, September 25, 1980-January 24, 1981 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaPuAAAAMAAJ | accessdate=28 May 2013 | year=1980 | publisher=African-American Institute  |  page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phyllis2009"&gt;{{cite book | author=Phyllis Martin | title=Catholic women of Congo-Brazzaville: mothers and sisters in troubled times | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DWqkajkbmUC&amp;pg=PA197 | accessdate=28 May 2013 | year=2009 | publisher=Indiana University Press | isbn=978-0-253-22055-4 | pages=197–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Phemba are iconic examples of [[Kingdom of Kongo#Art_of_the_Kongo_Kingdom|Kongo art]] and  according to Thompson (1981) "reflect the degree to which women are treasured in Kongo culture, not just for their fecundity, but as seers and guardians of the spirit".&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2018}} 
Kongo societies are [[matrilineal]].&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In special cases, communities honored women by commissioning stone icons depicting a mother and child to be placed on their tombs. This was also considered dangerous, as it represented an insertion of the source of life - the mother - into the world of the dead.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|title=The four moments of the sun : Kongo art in two worlds|year=1981|publisher=National Gallery of Art, Washington|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=089468003X|author2=Cornet, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kikongo]] word ''phemba'' translates to "the white",&lt;ref&gt;Herbert M. Cole, ''ICONS'' (1989), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the white earth ([[Kaolinite]]) that is a sign of fertility in the region. The name is interpreted by  [[John M. Janzen]] (1979) as denoting "'the one who gives children in-potentia.' A phemba child is a magically conceived [[nkisi]] child, a fragile emissary of the spirit world."&lt;ref name="African Religions"&gt;{{cite book|title=African religions: a symposium|year=1979|publisher=NOK Publishers|location=New York|edition=2nd printing, corr.|editor=Newell S. Booth,}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phemba statuary falls into two groups: mothers cradling or holding their babies, and mothers nursing.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;
The very different styles of phemba sculptures illustrate regional and even personal variations on the same theme.
Oral tradition holds that the phemba cult was established by a famous midwife.
