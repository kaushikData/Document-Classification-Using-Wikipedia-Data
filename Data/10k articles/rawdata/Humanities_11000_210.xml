'''''Altazor o el viaje en paracaídas''''', or simply '''''Altazor''''', is the [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] of Chilean poet [[Vicente Huidobro]], published in [[Madrid]] in 1931.

This poem in the shape of a book can be classified as an example of the [[Avant-garde|Avant-garde literature movement]] developed during the first half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-3288.html Vicente Huidobro: Altazor – Memoria Chilena] www.memoriachilena.cl Dirección de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos May 16, 2009, Retrieved January 19, 2015 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be thought of as part of the [[Creacionismo]] (Creationism literary movement) along with [[Pablo Neruda]]s "Residencia en la Tierra", [[César Vallejo]]'s "Trilcel", and [[Pablo de Rokha]]'s "Los gemidos".

The name "altazor" is a combination of the noun "altura" ("altitude") and the adjective "azorado" ("bewildered" or "taken aback"). "Azorado"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordreference.com/sinonimos/azorado Azorado wordreference] 2015 WordReference.com retrieved on February 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; has more than one meaning in Spanish and can be interpreted in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mec.gub.uy/academiadeletras/Boletines/03/Benitez.htm ALTAZOR, la intemperie de Huidobro] Ministerio de Educacion y Cultura de Uruguay, Hebert Benítez Pezzolano Retrieved January 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem is divided in seven "cantos", ("songs"), preceded by a preface. These cantos were written over an extensive period of time, from 1919 to 1931,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookslut.com/poetry/2004_01_001302.php Altazor review] bookslut.com, Laura Felch, January 2004, Retrieved June 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and for that reason the topics seem unrelated. The first canto is the longest with almost seven hundred verses, and its content feels [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]. In this first canto, the poet introduces himself as "Altazor". The second canto, by contrast, is an [[ode]] to women, while in cantos III to VII the author plays with and dismantles the language and its expressive limits.

;A fragment of Altazor:

{{col-begin|class=toc|bgColor=#EFEFEF|width=100%}}
:The waterfall tresses over the night
:While the night beds to rest
:With its moon that pillows the sky
:I iris the sleepy land
:That roads towards the horizon
:In the shade of a shipwrecking tree
{{col-end}}
The book includes a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] portrait of [[Vicente Huidobro|Huidobro]]. In honour of Huidobro's work, the poem has been used to name the Chilean Award of the National Arts, known as the [[Altazor Award]].

'''Anthropological theories of value''' attempt to expand on the traditional [[Value theory|theories of value]] used by [[economics|economists]] or [[value theory|ethicists]]. They are often broader in scope than the theories of value of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Karl Marx]], etc. usually including [[sociological]], [[political]], institutional, and [[historical]] perspectives ([[transdisciplinarity]]).  Some have influenced [[feminist economics]].

The basic premise is that economic activities can only be fully understood in the context of the society that creates them. The concept of "value" is a [[social construct]], and as such is defined by the culture using the concept. Yet we can gain some insights into modern patterns of exchange, value, and wealth by examining previous societies. An anthropological approach to economic processes allows us to critically examine the cultural biases inherent in the principles of modern economics.  [[Anthropological linguistics]] is a related field that looks at the terms we use to describe economic relations and the ecologies they are set within.  Many anthropological economists (or economic anthropologists) are reacting against what they see as the portrayal of modern society as an economic machine that merely produces and consumes.

[[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] for example wrote about objects that circulate in society without being consumed.  [[Georges Bataille]] wrote about objects that are destroyed, but not consumed.  Bruce Owens talks about objects of value that are neither circulating nor consumed (e.g. gold reserves, warehoused paintings, family [[Antique|heirloom]]s).

== Value as meaning-making ==
[[David Graeber]] attempts to synthesize the insights of Karl Marx and Marcel Mauss. He sees value as a model for human [[meaning-making]]. Starting with Marxist definitions of consumption and production, he introduces Mauss's idea of "objects that are not consumed" and posits that the majority of human behavior consists of activities that would not be properly categorized as either consumption or production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value|last=Graeber|first=David|authorlink=David Graeber|date=2001|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]]|isbn=0-312-24044-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== List of things that are neither consumption nor production ===
{{synthesis|date=February 2015}}
A list of things that are neither consumption nor production in 2003 includes those human activities that are not consumption, in the narrow sense of simply purchasing something, and are not production, in the sense of creating or modifying something intended for sale or exchange, namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00141844.1999.9981601 | last1 = Owens | first1 = Bruce McCoy | year = 1999| title = Unruly Readings: Neofetishes, Paradoxical Singularities, and the Violence of Authentic Value, | url = | journal = Ethnos | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–262 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Economists typically use the term consumption in a way that is far broader than merely purchasing something. It is quite common to talk about the consumption of time.  Many of the items on this list can still be considered either production or consumption, or to involve production or consumption at some stage to be accomplished. For example, cooking a meal is production of food for someone's consumption, and it involves consuming (cooking) raw materials previously purchased or gathered; and, writing is production of material for someone to consume through reading.  Both of these activities are often done for some return in value, whether it is for respect or monetary payment.  In a similar way, some of these items are replacements for consumption &amp;ndash; for example, rather than purchase a meal, you can cook the meal yourself.  In cooking the meal, you have now in effect paid for the meal with your own labor rather than earning wages and paying for a meal with those wages. In this way, economists, and in general anyone, could view this list as containing nothing that is not consumption or production, other than possibly turning around in a circle, though this involves consuming calories that would, at some point, have been consumed. For example, even window shoppers are consuming &amp;ndash; the product is marketers’ production (specifically in this case, the window dresser's creation).  Possibly, only in death are we neither consuming nor producing, but merely being consumed, though it could be argued that one's body is consuming space, particularly in a cemetery plot (real estate), but even if cremated and scattered. [[Gary Becker]]'s [[household production function]]s and similar topics note that people often purchase goods and then combine them with time to produce something that has meaning or practicality to them (which produce [[utility]]).

An '''anti-language''' is a language created and used by an anti-society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halliday|first=M. a.

For example, anti-languages borrow words from other languages, create unconventional compounds, or utilize new suffixes for existing words. Anti-languages may also change words using [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]], back formation (e.g. apple to elppa), or by substituting their consonants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, anti-languages are distinct and unique, and are not simply [[dialect]]s of existing languages.

== Origin ==

The concept of anti-languages was first defined and studied by the linguist [[Michael Halliday|Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday]], who used the term to describe the [[lingua franca]] of an [[anti-society]]. In his essay "Anti-Language", Halliday synthesized the research of Thomas Harman, [[Adam Podgórecki]], and Bhaktiprasad Mallik to explore anti-languages and the connection between verbal communication and the maintenance of social structure. For this reason, the study of anti-languages is both a study of [[sociology]] and [[linguistics]]. Halliday's findings can be compiled as a list of nine criteria that a language must meet to be considered an anti-language:

# An anti-society is a society which is set up within another society as a conscious alternative to it. 
# Like the early records of the languages of exotic cultures, the information usually comes to us in the form of word lists. 
# The simplest form taken by an anti-language is that of new words for old: it is a language relexicalised.
# The principle is that of same grammar, different vocabulary. 
# Effective communication depends on exchanging meanings which are inaccessible to the layperson. 
# The anti-language is not just an optional extra, it is the fundamental element in the existence of the “second life” phenomenon. 
# The most important vehicle of reality-maintenance is conversation. All who employ this same form of communication are reality-maintaining others. 
# The anti-language is a vehicle of resocialisation. 
# There is continuity between language and anti-language.

== Examples ==
Examples of anti-languages include [[cockney rhyming slang]], [[CB slang]], the ''[[grypsera]]'' of [[Poland|Polish]] prisons, [[thieves' cant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju4NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA93 |title=An introduction to language and society |author=Martin Montgomery |chapter=Language and subcultures: Anti-language}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polari]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/staff/paulb/polari/home.htm Polari: The Lost Language of Gay Men]", [[Lancaster University]]. ''Department of Linguistics and English Language''.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly [[Palawa kani]] and [[Bangime]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradley M, "The secret ones", ''New Scientist'', 31 May 2014, pp. 42-45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ulti ===
Ulti is a language studied and documented by Bhaktiprasad Mallik in his book ''Languages of the Underworld of West Bengal.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language of the underworld of West Bengal|last=Mallik|first=Bhaktiprasad|publisher=Sanskrit College|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulti is an anti-language derived from Bengali and used by criminals and affiliates. The Ulti word ''kodān,'' meaning 'shop,' is derived from rearranging the letters in the Bengali word ''dokān'', which also means 'shop'. On the other hand, the Bengali word ''thām'', meaning 'pillar', means 'a girl's thigh' in Ulti.

== Anti-language in Fiction ==
Anti-languages are sometimes created by authors and used by characters in novels. These anti-languages do not have complete lexicons, cannot be observed in use for [[linguistic description]], and therefore cannot be studied in the same way that a language that is actually spoken by an existing anti-society would. However, they are still used in the study of anti-languages. Roger Fowler's "Anti-Languages in Fiction" analyzes Anthony Burgess's ''A Clockwork Orange'' and William S. Burroughs' ''Naked Lunch'' to redefine the nature of the anti-language and to describe its ideological purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Roger|date=Summer 1979|title=Anti-Language in Fiction|jstor=42945250|journal=Style|volume=13|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' is a popular example of a novel in which the main character is a teenage boy who speaks an anti-language called Nadsat. This language is often referred to as an argot, but it has been argued that it is an anti-language because of the social structure that it maintains through the social class of the droogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohn|first=Liberty|date=|title=Antilanguage and a Gentleman’s Goloss: Style, Register, and Entitlement To Irony in A Clockwork Orange|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_81291_en.pdf|journal=eSharp|volume=|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Belmont Report''''' is a report created by the [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research]]. Its full title is the ''Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, Report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research''.

The report was issued on  30 September 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors= National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (DHEW) |title= The Belmont Report |url= http://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_belmont_report.pdf |date= 30 September 1978 |issue= DHEW pub. no.

The Belmont Conference Center, once a part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], is in [[Elkridge, Maryland]], 10 miles south of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], and until the end of 2010 was operated by [[Howard Community College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Carson |first= Larry |date= 30 September 2010 |title= HCC to close Belmont Conference Center |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-09-30/news/bs-md-ho-belmont-closing-20100930_1_caleb-dorsey-president-kate-hetherington-main-campus |newspaper= [[The Baltimore Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Belmont Report''&lt;ref name= "Belmont Report"/&gt; summarizes ethical principles and guidelines for research involving human subjects. Three core principles are identified: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Three primary areas of application are also stated. They are informed consent, assessment of risks and benefits, and selection of subjects.
According to Vollmer and Howard, the ''Belmont Report'' allows for a positive solution, which at times may be difficult to find, to future subjects who are not capable to make independent decisions.&lt;ref name= "Vollmer2010"/&gt;

==History==
The ''Belmont Report'' was first written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Services of Biomedical and Behavioral Research.&lt;ref name= "Sims2010"/&gt; Prompted in part by problems arising from the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]] (1932–1972) and based on the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1974–1978), the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)&lt;ref&gt;HEW was split into the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services in 1980. See https://www.hhs.gov/about/hhshist.html&lt;/ref&gt; revised and expanded its regulations for the protection of human subjects 45 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] part 46 in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  In 1978, the Commission’s report ''Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research'' was released, and it was published in 1979 in the Federal Register.  It was named the ''Belmont Report'', for the [[Belmont Estate. Belmont Conference Center. "Moore's Morning Choice"|Belmont Conference Center]], where the National Commission met when first drafting the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Regulations and Ethical Guidelines: The Belmont Report Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research |url= http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html |authors= Office of Human Subjects Research, [[National Institutes of Health]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040405065531/http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html |archivedate= 2004-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Belmont Report'' is one of the leading works concerning ethics and health care research. It allows for the protection of participants in clinical trials and research studies.&lt;ref name= "Sims2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sims |first= Jennifer |title= A brief review of the ''Belmont Report'' |journal= Dimensions of Critical Care Nursing |date= July–August 2010|volume=29|issue=4|pages=173–4|doi=10.1097/dcc.0b013e3181de9ec5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Belmont Report'' explains the unifying ethical principles that form the basis for the National Commission’s topic-specific reports and the regulations that incorporate its recommendations.

The three fundamental ethical principles for using any human subjects for research are:&lt;ref name= "Belmont Report"/&gt;
# [[Respect for persons]]: protecting the autonomy of all people and treating them with courtesy and respect and allowing for informed consent. Researchers must be truthful and conduct no deception;
# [[Beneficence (ethics)|Beneficence]]: The philosophy of "Do no harm" while maximizing benefits for the research project and minimizing risks to the research subjects; and
# [[Justice (ethics)|Justice]]: ensuring reasonable, non-exploitative, and well-considered procedures are administered fairly — the fair distribution of costs and benefits to ''potential'' research participants — and equally.

These principles remain the basis for the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) human subject protection regulations.

Today, the ''Belmont Report'' continues as an essential reference for [[Institutional Review Board|institutional review boards]] (IRBs) that review HHS-conducted or -supported human subjects research proposals involving human subjects, in order to ensure that the research meets the ethical foundations of the regulations.

Applications of these principles to conduct research requires careful consideration of i) informed consent, ii) risks benefit assessment, and iii)selection of subjects of research.

Outlined by Jennifer Sims in her article "A brief review of the ''Belmont Report''", she states 7 things nurses, as primary caregivers for individuals participating in a study, must do to ensure the rights of the participant is met. 
# Ensure the study is approved by an IRB
# Get informed consent from the patient
# Ensure that the patient understands the full extent of the experiment, and if not, will contact the study coordinator 
# Ensure the patient wasn't coerced into doing the experiment by means of threatening or bullying
# Be careful of other effects of the clinical trial that were not mentioned, and report it to the proper study coordinator 
# Support the privacy of the patient's identity, their motivation to join or refuse the experiment.
# Ensure that all patients at least get the minimal care needed for their condition&lt;ref name= "Sims2010"/&gt;

Researchers must share the findings of their procedures regardless of them being good or bad results. Also in the case someone did not want to participate in research but would like treatment they cannot be turned away and must be treated with the same standard care.&lt;ref name= "Sims2010"/&gt;

==Summary==
The summary, from the top of the Report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On July 12, 1974, the [[National Research Act]] (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law, there-by creating the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. One of the charges to the Commission was to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and to develop guidelines which should be followed to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. In carrying out the above, the Commission was directed to consider: (i) the boundaries between biomedical and behavioral research and the accepted and routine practice of medicine, (ii) the role of assessment of risk-benefit criteria in the determination of the appropriateness of research involving human subjects, (iii) appropriate guidelines for the selection of human subjects for participation in such research and (iv) the nature and definition of informed consent in various research settings.

The Belmont Report attempts to summarize the basic ethical principles identified by the Commission in the course of its deliberations. It is the outgrowth of an intensive four-day period of discussions that were held in February 1976 at the Smithsonian Institution's Belmont Conference Center supplemented by the monthly deliberations of the Commission that were held over a period of nearly four years. It is a statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines that should assist in resolving the ethical problems that surround the conduct of research with human subjects. By publishing the Report in the Federal Register, and providing reprints upon request, the Secretary intends that it may be made readily available to scientists, members of Institutional Review Boards, and Federal employees. The two-volume Appendix, containing the lengthy reports of experts and specialists who assisted the Commission in fulfilling this part of its charge, is available as DHEW Publication No. (OS) 78-0013 and No. (OS) 78-0014, for sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.

Unlike most other reports of the Commission, the Belmont Report does not make specific recommendations for administrative action by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Rather, the Commission recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety, as a statement of the Department's policy. The Department requests public comment on this recommendation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Today==
In 1991, 14 other Federal departments and agencies joined HHS in adopting a uniform set of rules for the protection of human subjects, identical to subpart A of 45 CFR part 46 of the HHS regulations.  This uniform set of regulations is the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, informally known as the "Common Rule". The [[Office for Human Research Protections]] (OHRP) was also established within HHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= OHRP Home |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/ |publisher= Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] |accessdate= 2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the ''Belmont Report'' serves as a historical document and provides the moral framework for understanding regulations in the United States on the use of humans in experimental methods.

==Critique==
In a study by Nancy Shore, community-based participatory researchers were interviewed for their interpretation and critique of the ''Belmont Report''. Interviewees expressed concerns regarding the ''Belmont Report''{{'}}s ethical principles and interpretations as being one size fits all and advocated researchers to resist the tendency to rely on those principles systematically.&lt;ref name= "Shore2006"&gt;{{cite journal |first= Nancy |last= Shore |title= Re-conceptualizing the Belmont Report: A community-based participatory research perspective |journal= Journal of Community Practice |volume= 14 |issue= 4 |year= 2006 |pages= 5–26 |pmid= |doi= 10.1300/J125v14n04_02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that the ethical analysis should be extended to take into account more appropriate factors, such as cultural, gender, ethnic and geographical considerations.&lt;ref name= "Shore2006"/&gt; Debate continues over the ethics and regulations of research involving human subjects because of discrepancies over the meaning and priority of the ''Belmont Report''{{'}}s basic ethical principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Notably, the ''Belmont Report'' does not specify how its three ethical principles should be weighted or prioritized. According to Albert R. Jonsen, a member of the National Commission that composed the report, the Institutional Review Board is charged with weighing these principles and deciding how they should be applied. Matters become controversial when deciding if the principles should be interpreted as more or less weighty depending upon the particular circumstances of the research in question, if the principles should be viewed as an obligation that society must undertake on behalf of its members,&lt;ref name= "Vollmer2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vollmer |first1= Sara H. |last2= Howard |first2= George |title= Statistical power, the Belmont Report, and the ethics of clinical trials |journal= Science and Engineering Ethics |date= December 2010 |pages= 675–91 |pmid= 21063801 |doi= 10.1007/s11948-010-9244-0 |volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if it should be viewed as giving absolute priority to respect for persons’ autonomy over the general good of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vanderpool |first= Harold Y. |title= The Ethics of Research Involving Human Subjects: Facing the 21st Century |location= Frederick, MD |publisher= University Pub.

In law, a '''case stated''' is a procedure by which a court or tribunal can ask another court for its opinion on a point of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case stated|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/case-stated|work=CollinsDictionary.com|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Magistrates Courts Act, 1980, section 111|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/section/111|publisher=UK Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two kinds: consultative case stated and appeal by way of case stated. A consultative case stated is made at the discretion of a judge before he or she determines the case before the court. An appeal by way of case stated is made at the request of a party to the proceedings to the judge after the conclusion of a case.

On the hearing of a case stated, the higher court is restricted to consideration of the law alone and is required to accept the statement of facts submitted to it by the lower court.

If the application is granted, the matter is referred to the higher court. This usually takes the form "were we/was I correct to ..." and then the specified aspect of law to which the appeal relates. If the application to state a case is refused, the applicant may be able to seek redress by [[judicial review]]. The higher court will determine whether or not the law was correctly applied. If the appeal is upheld, the higher court will refer the case back to the referring court with directions to correct its decision. Otherwise, the appeal would be dismissed.

'''Courtroom photographing and broadcasting''' is restricted around the world. The law varies from limited film and electronic media coverage in some countries, to a complete ban in others.

==United States==
In the US, photography and broadcasting is permitted in some courtrooms but not in others. Some argue that use of media during courtroom proceedings presents a mockery of the judicial system, though the issue has been contested at length. The presence of cameras can create fallacious information that can damage the reputation for the courts and the trust from the public and/or viewers observing the televised proceedings.  &lt;ref&gt;For an extensive library of materials on this issue, see {{citation|url=http://federalevidence.com/node/1345|title=Cameras And Electronic Devices In The Federal Courtroom Resource Page}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many famous trials, such as the [[O.J. Simpson murder trial]], were televised. In the wake of the O.J. trial, however, many judges decided to ban cameras from their courtrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1025175,00.html|title=Remember Televised Trials?|author=Zoglin, Richard|date=Feb 6, 2005|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after that trial, [[California Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] announced his opposition to televised trials, and he later asked the [[Judicial Council of California|Judicial Council]] to consider reinstituting the ban on film and electronic media coverage of criminal trials. It has been argued, however, that the Simpson case was an anomaly that has little relation to the everyday concerns of media coverage of the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=27750488|title=Justice and the Media: Reconciling Fair Trials and a Free Press|author=Matthew D. Bunker|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure]] 53 states, "Except as otherwise provided by a statute or these rules, the court must not permit the taking of photographs in the courtroom during judicial proceedings or the broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2010/CamerasICt/Cameras_Fed_R_Crim_P_53.pdf|title=Rule 53.

Walker|publisher=Stateline|url=http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=13866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have thus far been unwilling to overturn the ban on cameras, citing "concerns with expenditure of judicial time on administration and oversight of broadcasting; the necessity of sequestering juries so that they will not look at the television program of the trial itself; the difficulty in empaneling an impartial jury in the case of a retrial; the necessity of larger jury panels or increased use of marshals; the psychological effects on witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and judges; and related considerations of 'solemnity,' 'dignity,' and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|vol=752|reporter=F.2d|opinion=16|court=2nd Cir.|url=http://openjurist.org/752/f2d/16/united-states-court-of-appeals-second-circuit|date=1984|litigants=Westmoreland v.

In 1965, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled, "The television industry, like other institutions, has a proper area of activities and limitations beyond which it cannot go with its cameras. That area does not extend into an American courtroom. On entering that hallowed sanctuary, where the lives, liberty and property of people are in jeopardy, television representatives have only the rights of the general public, namely, to be present, to observe the proceedings, and thereafter, if they choose, to report them."&lt;ref&gt;''Estes v. Texas'', {{ussc|381|532|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1981 case ''[[Chandler v. Florida]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that televising trials does not, per se, violate [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chandler v. Florida'', {{ussc|449|560|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[U.S. Constitution]] contains a [[public trial clause]], it has been argued that the requirement of a public trial was created and satisfied when there were no broadcasters or telecasters and few newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=37|publisher=Cornell L.

==United Kingdom==
Photography and broadcasting of a [[Crown Court]] case in the United Kingdom has been illegal since 1925 per code 41 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1925|Criminal Justice Act]] and the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981|Contempt of Court Act]]. In 2004, a small number of cases in the Court of Appeal were filmed in a trial basis. Other courts have begun to allow photography and filming in the early 21st century; the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] has permitted filming since 2009 while the Court of Appeal has allowed it on a regular basis since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Appeal Court lets in cameras as a test for televising trials|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1470504/Appeal-Court-lets-in-cameras-as-a-test-for-televising-trials.html|date=30 Aug 2004|author=Born, Matt|publisher=Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35854485|title=Crown courts to allow filming for first time|work=BBC News|date=20 March 2016|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some disadvantages of televised trials, from the point of view of the media, are that the proceedings are static visually, consume large amounts of [[TV crew]] time, and are sometimes difficult for the viewers to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=60|publisher=A.B.A. J.|pages=294|year=1974|title=Justice in Living Color: The Case for Courtroom Television|author=Wilson, Jerome|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/abaj60&amp;section=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Daniel M. Kolkey argues that televising trials can distort the truth-seeking process of a criminal trial and chill witnesses' willingness to cooperate; that televising trials interferes with the privacy of victims, witnesses and defendants; that the decision whether to televise trials does not lend itself to a case-by-case determination; and that televising trials can transform them into a form of entertainment which can undermine the dignity of, and respect for, our judicial institutions. Bryan Goebel counter-argues that there is no evidence to support claims that cameras have any greater psychological effect than a packed courtroom of strangers or that the cameras undermine truthful testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.calbar.ca.gov/calbar/2cbj/96feb/2cbj19.htm|title=Should cameras be banned from California's courts?|publisher=California Bar Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that inasmuch as no trial can be reproduced in laboratory conditions, [[scientific experimentation]] is not possible, and we thus have no empirical data on the effect of television on a criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=26|publisher=Hofstra L. Rev.|pages=873|date=1997–1998|title=If Courts Are Open, Must Cameras Follow|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/hoflr26&amp;section=39|author=Sloviter, Dolores K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=51|publisher=S.M.U.

Jr.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/smulr51&amp;section=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that because the majority of Americans have had no personal experience with the legal system, and because the majority of Americans get their information about the world solely from television, the portrayal of justice on television is extremely important to the continued viability of the legal system and to the individual's understanding of that system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=58|publisher=Ohio St. L.J.|pages=655|date=1997–1998|title=Turning the Camera on Court TV: Does Televising Trials Teach Us Anything about the Real Law|author=Paul, Angelique M.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/ohslj58&amp;section=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Charles Schumer]] argued, "Courts are an important part of our government, and the more our government institutions are shown to the public, the more dignified they become, and the more the public comes to understand them. Allowing cameras into our courtrooms will help demystify them and let the public evaluate how well the system works."&lt;ref name=Specter/&gt; Justice Otto Moore of the Colorado Supreme Court opined in 1956, "Do we hear complaints that the employment of these modern devices of thought transmission in the pulpits of our great churches destroys the dignity of the service; that they degrade the pulpit or create misconceptions in the mind of the public? The answers are obvious. That which is carried out with dignity will not become undignified because more people may be permitted to see and hear."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.louisianainsurancelitigation.com/2008/03/cameras_in_the_courtroom.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[William O. Douglas]] argued that televising trials should not be allowed because the press can use it to pressure judges to decide a case a certain way, particularly in jurisdictions where judges are elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=46|publisher=A.B.A. J.|pages=840|year=1960|title=Public Trial and the Free Press, The|author=Douglas, William O.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/abaj46&amp;section=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to the argument that cameras make witnesses nervous, former jurist [[Louis Gohmert]] stated, "I think nervousness is a good thing in a witness. It makes potential inaccuracies come to the light and easier to observe." He responded to the argument that cameras may make witnesses more reluctant to testify by saying, "There is a thing called a [[subpoena]]," and noting that he "found that if people are not willing to come to court and they are reluctant to testify, officers with [[handcuffs]] and guns are very helpful."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hearing on: H.R. 2128, the "Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2007"|url=http://federalevidence.com/downloads/blog/2010/Sunshine.in.the.Courtroom.Act.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crystal-Margaret Bennett''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|FSA}} (20 August 1918 – 12 August 1987) was a British [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]. A student of [[Kathleen Kenyon]], Bennett was a pioneer of archaeological research in [[Jordan]] and founded the [[British Institute at Amman for Archaeology and History]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Bennett_Crystal-M.pdf|title=Crystal-M Bennett|last=Balderstone|first=Susan|date=|website=Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology|publisher=Brown University|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101058414/Crystal-Bennett |title=Crystal Bennett (1918–1987)|last=Bienkowski|first=Piotr|year=2004|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=2017-01-01|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/58414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Crystal-Margaret Rawlings was born to George Rawlings, a soldier, and Elizabeth Rawlings (née Jennings) of [[Alderney]], one of the [[Channel Islands]], on 20 August 1918. She was the third of five children. She attended [[La Retraite Roman Catholic Girls' School|La Retraite Convent School]] on Alderney and then [[University of Bristol|Bristol University]], where she studied English. At the age of 22 she married draughtsman Philip Roy Bennett (1907–1986), converting from the [[Church of England]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in order to do so. The marriage lasted six years; the couple separated in 1946, a year after the birth of their only child Simon Bennett.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following the divorce, Bennett moved in with her former mother-in-law and raised her son Simon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1954, Bennett enrolled at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]] in London (now part of [[University College London]]) to study for a [[postgraduate diploma]] in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces in the West. She participated in excavations led by [[Sheppard Frere]], and directed two excavations of her own: a [[Roman villa]] near [[Cox Green, Berkshire]]; and a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] temple near her home in [[Bruton, Somerset]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Talbot|first=Geraldine|year=1987|title=Crystal-M. Bennett, O.B.E., D.Litt., F.S.A.: An Appreciation|journal=Levant|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–2|doi=10.1179/007589187790212121|issn=0075-8914|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then took a second postgraduate diploma in Palestinian Archaeology, which she studied under [[Kathleen Kenyon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Edomite excavations ==
After completing her second postgraduate diploma, Bennett was invited to join Kenyon's final season of excavations at [[Jericho]] in 1957–58, and subsequently contributed to the second volume of Kenyon's monograph on the site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She then went on to work with Peter Parr at [[Petra]] (1958–1963), and again with Kenyon in Jerusalem (1961–1963).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

It was whilst working with Parr at Petra that Bennett first became interested in the [[Edomites]], which was to become the focus of her later career. She conducted excavations at an Edomite site in Petra in 1958, 1960 and 1963.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was here that Bennett also began her reputation for overcoming considerable logistical obstacles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1988|title=Obituary: Crystal-M.

'''Daniel Joseph Boorstin''' (October 1, 1914 – February 28, 2004) was an American historian at the [[University of Chicago]] who wrote on many topics in American and world history. He was appointed the twelfth [[Librarian of Congress|Librarian of the United States Congress]] in 1975 and served until 1987. He was instrumental in the creation of the [[Center for the Book]] at the [[Library of Congress]].

Repudiating his youthful membership in the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] while a Harvard undergraduate (1938–39), Boorstin became a political conservative and a prominent exponent of [[consensus history]]. He argued in ''The Genius of American Politics'' (1953) that ideology, propaganda, and political theory are foreign to America. His writings were often linked with such historians as [[Richard Hofstadter]], [[Louis Hartz]] and [[Clinton Rossiter]] as a proponent of the "consensus school", which emphasized the unity of the American people and downplayed class and social conflict. Boorstin especially praised inventors and entrepreneurs as central to the American success story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alan J.

== Biography ==
Boorstin was born in 1914, in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, into a Jewish family.  His father, Samuel, was a lawyer who participated in the defense of [[Leo Frank]], a Jewish factory superintendent who was accused of the rape and murder of a teenage girl. After Frank's 1915 [[lynching]] led to a surge of [[anti-Semitic]] sentiment in Georgia, the family moved to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where Boorstin was raised. He graduated from Tulsa's [[Central High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Central High School]] in 1930, at the age of 15.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Boorstin"&gt;Wilson, Linda D.

In 1944, he became a professor at the [[University of Chicago]] for 25 years and was the [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1964. He served as director and senior historian of the [[National Museum of History and Technology]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] (now known as the National Museum of American History, Behring Center) from 1973 to 1975.  [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] nominated Boorstin to be [[Librarian of Congress]], in 1975.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

On April 9, 1941, he married a [[Wellesley College]] graduate, Ruth Carolyn Frankel (1917–2013). She quickly became his partner and editor for his first book, ''The Mysterious Science of the Law'', published in the same year.&lt;ref name="ANBO"/&gt;  Boorstin, with Ruth as his collaborator,  wrote more than 20 books, including two major trilogies, one on the American experience and the other on world intellectual history. ''[[The Americans: The Democratic Experience]]'', the final book in the first trilogy, received the [[1974 Pulitzer Prize|1974]] [[Pulitzer Prize in history]]. Boorstin's second trilogy, ''[[The Discoverers]]'', ''[[The Creators]]'' and ''[[The Seekers (book)|The Seekers]],'' examines the scientific, artistic and philosophic histories of humanity, respectively. In his “Author’s Note” for ''The Daniel J. Boorstin Reader'' (Modern Library, 1995), he wrote, “Essential to my life and work as a writer was my marriage in 1941 to Ruth Frankel who has ever since been my companion and editor for all my books.” Her obituary in ''The Washington Post'' (December 6, 2013) quotes Boorstin as saying, “Without her, I think my works would have been twice as long and half as readable.”

Within the discipline of [[social theory]], Boorstin's 1961 book ''The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-events in America'' is an early description of aspects of American life that were later termed [[hyperreality]] and [[postmodernity]]. In ''The Image'', Boorstin describes shifts in American culture – mainly due to advertising – where the reproduction or simulation of an event becomes more important or "real" than the event itself. He goes on to coin the term [[pseudo-event]], which describes events or activities that serve little to no purpose other than to be reproduced through advertisements or other forms of publicity. This book also describes what many today{{who|date=November 2018}} call "fake news". The idea of pseudo-events anticipates later work by [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Guy Debord]]. The work is an often used text in American sociology courses, and Boorstin's concerns about the social effects of technology remain influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel J. Boorstin, RIP |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/daniel-j-boorstin-rip |publisher=The New Atlantis |date=Spring 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722055520/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/daniel-j-boorstin-rip |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boorstin has been credited with saying, "“Ideas need no passports from their place of origin, nor visas for the countries they enter…. We, the librarians of the world, are servants of an indivisible world… Books and ideas make a boundless world.”&lt;ref name="TLP"&gt;[http://thislandpress.com/2016/05/03/land-of-grand-librarians/  ''This Land''  Winter 2016.] Accessed September 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

When President Ford nominated Boorstin to be Librarian of Congress in 1975, the nomination was supported by the [[Authors Guild]] but opposed by liberals, who objected to his perceived conservatism and his opposition to the social revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name="ANBO"/&gt;  He was attacked by the [[American Library Association]] because Boorstin "was not a library administrator". The Senate confirmed the nomination without debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robert Wedgeworth|first=|title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFu99FCJwQC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1993|publisher=American Library Association|pages=137–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boorstin retired in 1987, saying that he wanted to do full-time writing. He died of pneumonia February 28, 2004, in Washington D. C.&lt;ref name = "EOHC-Boorstin" /&gt; He was survived by Ruth, his three sons, Paul, Jonathan and David, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;{{efn|Cole says that his sons earn their livelihood in literary activities or in the performing arts.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;}} David Levy, a history professor at the [[University of Oklahoma]], said in one of his lectures after Boorstin's death: “One can only imagine what he might have achieved, if he had only listened to his father’s advice about where to go to college.”&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt;

=== Boorstin's approach to history ===

Professor Levy delivered a lecture about Boorstin in April 2014 at an Oklahoma University event, the President’s Day of Learning. He had several observations about Boorstin's approach to American history that seem to explain why many contemporary historians opposed his appointment to head the Library of Congress. According to Levy:
* Boorstin believed that the main points of American history were made by what the people agreed upon, rather than what they fought over.
* He emphasized continuities in history, rather than radical changes.
* He distrusted doctrinaire thinking; his writings minimized the role of pure thinkers and emphasized the role of problem solvers.
* He was conservative in politics and his approach to culture. Revolted by what he saw as vulgarities in American life and advertising, he believed that capitalism had the power to cause change to occur.
* He observed the transformative power of seemingly mundane cultural advances as air conditioning, telephones, catalog shopping, canned food and typewriters.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt;

==Impact on the Library of Congress==
John Y. Cole, in the obituary of Boorstin he wrote for the American Antiquarian, credited Boorstin with bringing new intellectual energy to the Library of Congress (LOC), opening the institution to, "the public, to scholars, and to new constituencies.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;  In 1976, he held a press conference to announce that he had discovered the contents of President Lincoln's pockets when he was assassinated in 1865. They had been in a wall safe in the Librarian's office. He had these artifacts put on public display, where they have become the most popular attraction for by tourists visiting the 'American Treasures of the Library of Congress' exhibition in the Library's Jefferson Building. He was instrumental in creating the American Folklife Center in 1976, and the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress in 1977.{{efn|The Center for the Book was an office in the LOC to promote the reading of books both nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;}} In 1979, the LOC and the [[Kennedy Center]] opened a Performing Arts Library in the Kennedy Center. In 1980, he set up the Council of Scholars, a new link between the LOC and the world of scholarship. Another major event during Boorstin's tenure at was the construction and implementation of LOC's James Madison Memorial Building during 1980 - 1982. He obtained private contributions to open the Mary Pickford Theater in the Madison Building in 1983. The theater was intended to increase public awareness of the LOC's large collection of motion pictures.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

In 1984, Boorstin and Architect of the Capitol George White teamed up to persuade Congress to appropriate $81.5 million for rehabilitating two of the LOC's older structures, the Jefferson (1897) and Adams (1939) Buildings. In 1986, Boorstin appeared before Congress to oppose legislation that would have made drastic cuts in the LOC budget. His pleas resulted in substantially restoring the proposed cuts. It also resulted in his being called, "...an intellectual Paul Revere."&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

Overall, Boorstin proved so persuasive that the Federal appropriation increased from $116 million to more than $250 million during his administration.

== Honors ==
His book, ''The Americans: The Colonial Experience (1958)'' won the [[Bancroft Prize]] for best book in history.  The Society of American Historians awarded Boorstin the [[Francis Parkman Prize]] for ''The Americans: The National Experience (1965)''.&lt;ref name="ANBO"/&gt;  Boorstin was awarded the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure|Order of the Sacred Treasure, First Class]], by the Japanese government in 1986. He was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for writing ''The Americans: The Democratic Experience'' (1973).&lt;ref name = "EOHC-Boorstin" /&gt; He was inducted into the Tulsa Hall of Fame in 1989, and received the Oklahoma Book Award in 1993 for ''The Creators''.&lt;ref name = "EOHC-Boorstin" /&gt;

He held twenty honorary degrees, including an honorary Doctor of Laws from the [[University of Tulsa]]&lt;ref name = "EOHC-Boorstin" /&gt; and Doctor of Letters from [[Oglethorpe University]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Degrees Awarded by Oglethorpe University |publisher=Oglethorpe University |url=http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/honorary_degrees.asp |accessdate=2015-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319104000/http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/honorary_degrees.asp |archivedate=March 19, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dedication''' is the expression of friendly connection or thanks by the author towards another person. The dedication has its own place on the ''dedication page'' and is part of the [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]].

==Position and function  of the dedication==
In newer books, the dedication is located on a ''dedication page'' on its own, usually on the [[Recto and verso|recto page]] after the [[Title page|main title page]] inside the [[front matter]]. It can occupy one or multiple lines depending on its importance. It can also be "in a longer version as a dedication letter or dedication preface at the book's beginning".&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Rautenberger (ed.): ''Reclams Sachlexikon des Buches'', p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the dedication's function is mainly part of the self-portrayal of the author in front of his or her readers.

==History==
[[Image:Orfeo libretto dédicace.jpg|thumb|left|The dedication of ''Orfeo'' by [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], 1609]]
Evidence of dedications is provided back into the [[Classical antiquity]]. Besides the wish to express their gratitude towards a certain person, the authors often had also other reasons to dedicate their work to a particular person. Well into the 18th century, it was not usual for [[publisher]]s to remunerate the authors; authors tended to be paid or remunerated as one element of a [[patron-client relationship]], in which the author-client paid tribute, in the dedication, to his or her patron.  A typical writer dedicated "their book to a high standing personality -- to [[Fürst]]s or [[bishop]]s -- or to a city and tried to gain some money through this practice".&lt;ref name="Hiller2002"&gt;Citation after Helmut Hiller, Stephan Füssel: ''Wörterbuch des Buches''. 6. Auflage. Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main, 2002. {{ISBN|3-465-032209}}, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the petitioner was lucky and received a gift from the patron. In some cases, the writer groveled before the patron and a formal dedication "contained often a very elaborate and submissive affection".&lt;ref name="Hiller2002" /&gt; In some cases not only the authors tried to get some money, but also the printers tried through dedications to cover a part of their costs.

==Themes==
A book dedication can provide a fascinating glimpse into the life and times of the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Patricia|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications|date=2015|isbn=0989870839|asin=B00VZ2YRM4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Lord Byron]] (1788–1824) engaged in a famous feud with [[Robert Southey]], who was then England's [[Poet Laureate]]. Byron wrote a mocking 17-verse dedication to his epic poem ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' in which he savagely pilloried Southey as a dull, reactionary "warbler" who had abandoned his political principles for favor and financial reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications|date=2015|isbn=|pages=281–288|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout time, book dedications were used to make political statements or to condemn war and inequality. Author [[Toni Morrison]] dedicated ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', her 1987 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel about a fugitive slave who killed her daughter, to "Sixty Million and more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications|date=2015|isbn=|pages=173|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, book dedications reflect the tastes and mores of society. Whereas many Elizabethan dedications were erudite and witty, some modern authors have abandoned literary pretense, sometimes using profanity to shock or amuse their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications |date=2015|isbn=|pages=13|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handwritten dedication==

The dedication is not to be confounded with the handwritten dedication of a single copy: the [[presentation copy]].

Having poor [[soil]] and aridity, [[Aruba]] was saved from [[plantation]] economics and the [[slave trade]]. In 1515, the [[Spain|Spanish]] transported the entire population to [[Hispaniola]] to work in the [[copper]] [[mining|mines]]; most were allowed to return when the mines were tapped out. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who took control a century later, left the [[Arawaks]] to graze livestock, using the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. 

The population is estimated to be 75% mixed European/Amerindian/African, 15% Black and 10% other ethnicities. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands, and a quite big portion of Arubans who claim their ethnicity as Dutch possess Arawak blood. Although no full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Aboriginals]] remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] heritage. Most of the population is descended from Caquetio Indians and Dutch and to a lesser extent of Africans, Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Sephardic Jewish ancestors. Recently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting [[foreign worker]]s to a maximum of three years residency on the island. Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela. Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants. There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes. As Aruba has a little proximity to Colombia, Colombian residents and their children are found here. Aruba is a home of Chinese, and [[Indo-Caribbeans|Indo Caribbeans]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]], who descend largely from workers contracted from India and the island of [[Java]] in the former [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern [[Indonesia]]).

The two official languages are the [[Dutch language]] and the predominant, national language [[Papiamento]], which is classified as a [[creole language]]. This creole language is formed primarily from 16th century [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and several other languages. Spanish and [[English language|English]] are also spoken. Islanders can often speak four or more languages and are mostly [[Roman Catholic]].

A '''double act''', also known as a '''comedy duo''', is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duo&amp;nbsp;— the straight man, feed, dead wood, or stooge&amp;nbsp;— is portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other one&amp;nbsp;— the funny man, banana man or comic&amp;nbsp;— is portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term "feed" comes from the way a straight man sets up jokes and then "feeds" them to his partner.

Despite the names often given to the roles, the "[[straight man]]" need not be humorless and it is not always the comic who provides the act's humor. Sometimes it is the straight man who gets the laughs through his or her sarcastic reactions to the comic's antics, as was often the case with [[Stewart Lee]]'s [[deadpan]], reasoned reactions to [[Richard Herring]]'s more ridiculous antics in [[Lee and Herring|their pairing]]. Where the "straight man" serves no specific comic purpose, but acts as a device to make the "comic" look good, he is known as a "stooge". This is sometimes considered a derogatory term, and began to fall out of use by the 1930s when [[The Three Stooges]] began identifying itself as all stooges. Most often, however, the humor in a double act comes from the way the two personalities play off each other, rather than from the individual players. In many successful acts the roles are interchangeable.

==History==

===Early development===
[[File:Gallagher-Shean.png|thumb|150px|left|[[Gallagher and Shean]], a popular vaudeville act of the 1920s]]
The template for the modern double act began in the British [[music hall]]s and the American [[vaudeville]] scene of the late nineteenth century. Here, the "straight man" was a necessity, as he would repeat the lines of the "comic". This was done simply because the audience would be noisy, and repeating a joke gave the audience a better chance of hearing it. Soon the dynamic developed so that the "straight man" became a more integral part of the act, setting up jokes to which the comic could then deliver the "punchline." At various stages, acts such as [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]] (who initially operated with Burns as the comic, but quickly switched roles upon recognizing Gracie's greater appeal), [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Flanagan and Allen]], [[Gallagher and Shean]], and [[Smith and Dale]] were all popular draws. The dynamic continued to develop, with Abbott and Costello using a modern and recognizable formula in routines such as [[Who's On First?]] in the 1930s and [[Flanagan and Allen]] using "cross talking".

Though vaudeville would last well into the 1930s, its popularity began to wane owing to the gradual rise of [[motion pictures]], and some acts disappeared, having failed to survive the transition to movies. By the 1920s, double acts were beginning to attract worldwide fame more readily through the [[Silent films|silent era]]. However, because of the obvious restrictions, the comedy was not derived from "cross talk" or clever verbal exchanges but through [[slapstick]] routines and the actions of the characters.

The first double act to gain worldwide fame through film was [[Laurel and Hardy]]. Before meeting, the pair had never worked together on stage (they did as of 1940), though both had worked in vaudeville—[[Stan Laurel]] with [[Charlie Chaplin]] as part of [[Fred Karno]]'s Army and [[Oliver Hardy]] as a singer. Laurel could loosely be described as the comic, though the pair were one of the first not to fit the mold in the way that many double acts do, with both taking a fairly equal share of the laughs. The pair first worked together as a double act in the 1927 film ''[[Duck Soup (1927 film)|Duck Soup]]''. The first Laurel and Hardy film was called ''Putting Pants on Philip'' though their familiar characters had not yet been established.  The first film they both appeared in was ''Lucky Dog'' in 1917. Laurel and Hardy adapted well to silent films, both being skilled at slapstick, and their nonverbal interplay with each other and the audience became famous—Laurel's cry and Hardy's downtrodden glances to the camera whenever something went wrong—and were carried over to their later [[talkies]]. Indeed, they were one of the few silent acts who made a very successful transition to spoken word pictures in the 1930s, showing themselves to be equally adept at verbal wordplay.

===1940s–1960s===
The year 1940 saw the release of Laurel and Hardy's ''[[Saps at Sea]]'', their final film for long-term producer and collaborator [[Hal Roach]]. From here, their popularity began to decline. However, in 1940s America the double act remained a cinema draw, developing into the "[[Buddy film|buddy movie]]" genre, with 1940 seeing Abbott and Costello making the transition from stage to screen and the first of [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]]'s ''[[Road to...]]'' series. Further acts would soon follow; for example, the first pairing of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] occurred in 1946. About the same time [[The Bickersons]] became popular on radio.  [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Carl Reiner]] started their [[2000 Year Old Man]] recordings and subsequent television appearances in 1961.  The genre has continued to exist in cinema while also making a successful transition to radio and later television via [[The Smothers Brothers]] and ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh In]]''.

In Britain, double acts would remain confined to theatres and radio until the late 1950s, when double acts such as [[Morecambe and Wise]] and [[Mike and Bernie Winters]] slowly began the transition to television on variety programmes such as ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]''. It was not until the mid to late 1960s that these acts truly came into their own. When Morecambe and Wise teamed up with writer [[Eddie Braben]], they began to redefine what was meant by a double act, with Wise, the straight man, being developed into a comic character in his own right. They provided the link between music hall and modern comedy for double acts.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;''The Story Of Light Entertainment: Double Acts'', BBC 2, 9pm, 22 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As the two leading double acts of the day, Morecambe and Wise and the Winters brothers enjoyed a playful rivalry—the Winters themselves mocked the slight edge Morecambe and Wise had over them in popularity while Morecambe, when asked what he and Wise would have been if not comedians, replied "''Mike and Bernie Winters''".

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the traditional formula was shunned by [[The Two Ronnies]], who completely dispensed with the need for a "straight man", and [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]], two [[Oxbridge]]-educated comedians who used the double act to deliver satire and edgy comedy.

===1970s===
Light entertainment in Britain in the 1970s was dominated by Morecambe and Wise, who enjoyed very impressive ratings, especially on their Christmas specials. Although Mike and Bernie Winters's popularity declined, The Two Ronnies' success grew greatly while Peter Cook and Dudley Moore sporadically produced acclaimed work, in particular their controversial recordings as [[Derek and Clive]] from 1976 to 1978.

The mid to late 1970s saw a resurgence in American double acts. ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' ([[1974 in film|1974]]) featured a memorable performance between [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Harvey Korman]] (who would team up again in Brooks's [[1981 in film|1981]] follow-up ''[[History of the World, Part I]]''). ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', first broadcast in 1975, provided a group of comedians who were prepared to appear with each other in sketches as double acts and has continued to do so. In particular, it was here that [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]] honed their characters [[The Blues Brothers]], who would soon be propelled to fame in the [[1980 in film|1980]] buddy movie of the same name. [[Gene Wilder]] and [[Richard Pryor]] also embarked on a string of successful buddy films in the 1970s. [[Cheech &amp; Chong]] also gained massive popularity during this time.

Occasionally the straight-man/funny-man dynamic would appear in contexts unexpected and between characters not normally thought of as comics. This often appeared in the [[James T. Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]])/[[Spock|Mr. Spock]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) relationship in several episodes of the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.

===1980s===
Morecambe and Wise had dominated British light entertainment throughout the 1970s, but their presence had begun to wane in the early 1980s. When Morecambe died moments after finishing a solo show in 1984 (his last words were 'I'm glad that's over'), the best-loved double act in British comedy came to an end, and several new acts emerged. However, the two distinct groups could not have been more different.

In the wake of ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' and the breakthrough onto television of '[[alternative comedy]]' came [[French and Saunders]]; [[Fry and Laurie]]; [[Rik Mayall]] and [[Ade Edmondson]]; [[Hale and Pace]]; and [[Alas Smith and Jones|Smith and Jones]]. These edgier comics were more brash and crude—comedy's answer to [[punk rock]].&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; They developed the satire and vulgarity of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore rather than the more gentle humour of Morecambe and Wise and The Two Ronnies. In fact, Smith and Jones showed blatant disregard for their predecessors, openly mocking the Two Ronnies (this may have been a factor in [[Ronnie Barker]]'s decision to retire from comedy in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt;)

===1990s–present day===
The early 1990s saw comedy become "the new rock and roll"&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; in Britain and this was inherent in the work of [[Newman and Baddiel]] and [[Punt and Dennis]] on ''[[The Mary Whitehouse Experience]]''. Newman and Baddiel in particular symbolised this rock and roll attitude by playing the biggest ever British comedy gig at [[Wembley Arena]]. However, with this came tension. Newman and Baddiel fell out with Punt and Dennis, not wishing to share screen time with them, and then with each other. [[David Baddiel]] went on to form another successful double act with [[Frank Skinner]].

The 1990s also saw the introduction of one of comedy's strangest yet most successful double acts in [[Reeves and Mortimer]]. They at the same time deconstructed light entertainment&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; and paid homage to many of the classic double acts (Vic Reeves would even do an Eric Morecambe impression on ''[[Vic Reeves Big Night Out]]''). They simultaneously used very bizarre, idiosyncratic humour and traditional double act staples (in later years they became increasingly reliant on violent slapstick).

Another double act who emerged in the mid to late 1990s were [[Lee &amp; Herring]], who combined a classic [[clash of personalities]] (downbeat and rational Lee contrasting with energetic, childish Herring) with very ironic, often satirical humour.

Also appearing in the latter half of the decade were [[Adam and Joe]], whose low-budget, self-produced [[Channel 4]] series ''[[The Adam and Joe Show]]'' was a very sharp combination of TV and movie parodies and satirical looks at various elements of youth culture.

Indian cinema also had its share of the double act, with [[Tamil cinema]] comedians [[Goundamani]] and [[Senthil]] teaming up for several films throughout the decade, similarly [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] and [[Babu Mohan]] in [[Telugu Cinema]].

In Sri Lankan cinema, the famous double act is found with [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka cinema]] comedians [[Bandu Samarasinghe]] and Tennyson Cooray where they pioneered Sri Lankan commercial film industry in 2000s.

[[Mitchell and Webb]] are another successful double act from the 2000s onwards, having multiple sketch shows on both radio and TV as well as starring in the award winning sitcom [[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]].

However, most of the 2000s' most successful double acts take their inspiration from the odder strain of double-act comedy spearheaded by Reeves and Mortimer. [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]], who had previously worked with Reeves and Mortimer, also took inspiration from the Two Ronnies. [[The Mighty Boosh]] also played with the formula but essentially remained traditional at their roots. Another popular current [[light entertainment]]/[[Television presenter|presenting]] comedy act is [[Ant &amp; Dec]], who are a very basic yet effective example of a double act.

In early 2012, comedians [[Keegan-Michael Key]] and [[Jordan Peele]] appeared in a sketch comedy TV show titled [[Key &amp; Peele]] airing on [[Comedy Central]]. 

Many modern day [[YouTube]] Channels like to use this trope to their advantage. Some examples include [[Smosh]], [[Dan and Phil]], the [[Game Grumps]] and [[Rhett and Link]] of the YouTube channel [[Good Mythical Morning]],

==United Kingdom==
In its [[United Kingdom|British]] form, the two actors would usually be composed of a "straight man" or "feed" and a "comic", the purpose of the feed being to set up jokes for the comic. This would rely heavily on comic timing.

[[Morecambe and Wise]] are arguably the quintessential British double act. They followed the traditional formula with [[Eric Morecambe]] as the comic and [[Ernie Wise]] as the feed. However, other British acts such as [[The Two Ronnies]], [[Hale and Pace]], [[Rik Mayall]] and [[Adrian Edmondson]], [[Vic and Bob|Reeves and Mortimer]], [[French and Saunders]], [[Mitchell and Webb]], [[Mel Smith]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]], [[Fry and Laurie]], [[Lee and Herring]], [[Armstrong and Miller (television)|Armstrong and Miller]], [[The Peacock and Gamble Podcast|Peacock and Gamble]], the role of "comic" and "straight man" are less obvious, largely interchangeable or dispensed with altogether. More obvious British examples of the comic-feed dynamic are [[Cannon and Ball]], [[Little and Large]] or the children's entertainers [[The Chuckle Brothers]], where the straight man acted largely as a humourless set up for the comic.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Derek &amp; Clive.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Moore and Cook as [[Derek and Clive]]]] --&gt;
[[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]] perhaps also deserve a mention as being the first double act to go against the grain, and turn their double act into a complex analysis of the two's relationship. In many of the sketches (especially the [[Pete and Dud]] exchanges) Cook played the domineering know-it-all (who knows nothing) and Moore the put-upon dimwit (who also knows nothing).

This dominance was accentuated by the difference in height between the two, and the speed of Cook's mind, which meant that he could ad-lib, and force Moore to [[corpsing|corpse]] in a Pete and Dud dialogue, leaving him helpless to respond. As the partnership progressed into the often-improvised [[Derek and Clive]] dialogues, these light-hearted attempts to make Moore laugh became, as a result of Cook's growing insecurity and alcoholism, aggressive attacks on the defenceless Moore. However, carrying on the tradition of going against the grain of traditional double acts, when the partnership dissolved in the late 1970s, it was Cook whose career stalled due to boredom, alcoholism and lack of ambition, while Moore went on to become one of Hollywood's most unlikely leading men.

===Sitcoms===
The double act has also become a popular theme in [[British sitcoms]]. One of the earliest examples of this was the relationship between [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]] in the [[Galton and Simpson]] series ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]''. James played a down-to-earth character while Hancock was pompous and had [[delusions of grandeur]], and the comedy was derived from the two playing off each other's characteristics.

A common trend in sitcoms is to place the double act in a situation where they are forced together through uncontrollable circumstance. In another Galton and Simpson production, ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'', a son, with great ambition, was forced to live with his elderly, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] father as a [[rag and bone man]]. The comedy derives from the way the characters interact in their tempestuous relationship. The series also has more heart-rending moments as the son despairs at his inability to escape his needy, selfish, grasping father.

''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]'' saw "an habitual criminal", [[Norman Stanley Fletcher|Fletcher]] (played by [[Ronnie Barker]], already famous for his comedy partnership with [[Ronnie Corbett]]) and a young, naive, first-time prisoner, [[Lennie Godber]]. The two would bicker but endured a relationship of mutual respect. Barker also formed a partnership with [[David Jason]] in [[Open All Hours]], with Jason playing Granville while Barker played Albert Arkwright. Many don't see this as a comedy duo, but the straight-man element coupled with Barker's funny-man antics on the show are still compressed into the script.

[[Rik Mayall]] and [[Ade Edmondson]] combined their success in sitcoms (''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'') and as a double act ([[The Dangerous Brothers]]) in 1991 when they created ''[[Bottom (television)|Bottom]]''. Their characters are a pair of sad, pathetic losers forced together by their mutual hopelessness. However, unlike earlier examples of such, the characters in ''Bottom'' absolutely hate each other, exacerbating their despair. This often leads to slapstick violence, such as hitting each other with frying pans. Mayall and Edmonson have said ''Bottom'' aimed to be more than just a series of toilet gags—it was meant to be a cruder cousin to plays like ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' about the pointlessness of life.

Other popular double acts in British sitcoms include complex relationships involving status and superiority themes: in ''[[Dad's Army]]'', the social climbing envy of [[Captain George Mainwaring]], to his right-hand man (Sergeant Arthur Wilson) who is of higher status than him; and in [[Red Dwarf]], the working class everyman [[Dave Lister]] to the middle class but socially-awkward [[Arnold Rimmer]]. However, the most prominent double act is that of an intelligent person and his inferior sidekick, such as Basil and Manuel of ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', Blackadder and Baldrick of ''[[Blackadder]]'', or Ted and Father Dougal of the Irish sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]''.

In recent years, double acts as sitcoms appear to have gone full circle, as illustrated by the cult success of ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]''. For the relationship between the two main characters this series uses a formula very similar to that between Sid and Tony in ''Hancock's Half Hour'' – that of a pompous character whose best friend can see right through him and brings him back down to earth. A similar dynamic is used in ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'' in which the characters of [[Mitchell and Webb]] were adapted for the sitcom formula. However, in this case both characters suffer from pomposity; the difference between the pair is the laidback, cool arrogance (yet stupidity) of Jeremy and the intellectual arrogance (yet social-awkwardness) of Mark.

==U.S. and Canada==
In the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]], the tradition was more popular in the earlier part of the 20th century with [[vaudeville]]-derived acts such as [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Burns and Allen]], and [[Wheeler &amp; Woolsey]], and continuing into the [[television]] age with [[Martin and Lewis]], [[Kenan &amp; Kel]], [[Bob and Ray]], the [[Smothers Brothers]], [[Wayne and Shuster]], [[Allen &amp; Rossi|Allen and Rossi]], [[Jack Burns]] and [[Avery Schreiber]], [[Rowan and Martin]], [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], the [[Wayans Brothers]], Troy and Abed from ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', Shawn and Gus in ''[[Psych]]'' and [[Dwight Schrute]] and [[Jim Halpert]] in ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. The series ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' was known for its double acts, and [[Lucille Ball]] served as foil to both her husband [[Desi Arnaz]] and to [[Vivian Vance]]; Vance could also serve as foil to [[William Frawley]] when the situation required it.

More recently, the idea has been largely supplanted by that of the "[[buddy film|buddy movie]]" genre, which has introduced several notable comedy partnerships not formally billed as a single "act" in the traditional manner. The earliest example of such a team may have been [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]]; later examples include [[Gene Wilder]] and [[Richard Pryor]], [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] and [[Dana Carvey]], [[David Spade]] and [[Chris Farley]] and child stars [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]].  Based on the gag-man/straight-man concept, "Stoner" duos like [[Cheech and Chong]], [[Jay &amp; Silent Bob]], and [[Harold and Kumar]] have also proven quite popular with audiences.

The double act format can also be used in presenting noncomedic information in an entertaining manner, such as [[Adam Savage|Savage]]/[[Jamie Hyneman|Hyneman]] pair of the Discovery Channel's ''[[MythBusters]]''. From 2006 to 2010, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] used the double-act formula successfully in its popular series of [[Get a Mac|''I'm a Mac/And I'm a PC'']] ads with [[John Hodgman]] and [[Justin Long]].

==China==
{{Main|xiangsheng}}
In [[China]], [[xiangsheng]] (also known as crosstalk) is a traditional comedic performance usually in the form of a dialogue between two performers.

==Japan==
{{Main|manzai}}
In [[Japan]] the [[manzai]] tradition parallels that of the double although it is more formulaic.{{cn|date=December 2015}} Here there is a distinguished straight man (''tsukkomi'') and funny man (''boke'') and the humor consists of quick jokes full of slapstick humor and social misunderstandings.

==Germany==
In Germany [[Tünnes and Schäl]] (since 1803/1850s), two [[Cologne]] puppet theater characters, fit to the concept of fool and straight man.

During the Second World War [[Tran and Helle]] appeared in a number of short films to deter Germans from actions detrimental to Germany's war effort or security.

Between 1950 and 1980, the most popular comedy duo of [[East Germany]], [[Herricht &amp; Preil]], ran a very successful double act, with [[Hans-Joachim Preil]] as the straight man and [[Rolf Herricht]] as the comic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9122">The '''European Union (EU) Centre in Singapore''' is part of a global network of [[European Union Centres of Excellence]]. Following the launch of EU Centres of Excellence in the US and Canada in 1998, there are now 37 Centres located in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/eu-centres/index_en.htm |title=EU Centres in the world |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Singapore Centre, the first in [[Southeast Asia]], opened in June 2008. It is a partnership between the [[European Commission]], the [[National University of Singapore]], [[Nanyang Technological University]] and the [[thinktank]], [[Singapore Institute of International Affairs]]. Its aim is to promote knowledge of the [[European Union]] and its policies. It organises speaker events, discussions and exhibitions; publishes books, papers and teaching materials; and sends staff to visit schools and colleges in Singapore.

==History==
The [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) establishing the Centre was signed by the then [[EU Commissioner]] for Information Society and Media, [[Viviane Reding]], with two local partners, [[National University of Singapore]] and [[Nanyang Technological University]] on 20 June 2008. The Centre in Singapore is the first located in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newshub.nus.edu.sg/pressrel/0806/080620.php "Launch Of European Union Centre In Singapore"], National University of Singapore, 20 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to a joint press release by the Delegation of the European Union to Singapore, that is the EU's diplomatic representation in Singapore, and the Centre's other stakeholders, the three way partnership is between the [[European Commission]], and “two leading universities, both in the region and the world, with extensive networks both across Europe and throughout Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eucentre.sg/events/7/EUC%20Press%20Release.pdf |title=Press Release on EU Centre in Singapore |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU Centre has received another 3-year grant (2013-2015) to continue its mission to promote knowledge of the EU and its policies and raise the visibility of the EU in Singapore. A new partner, the [[Singapore Institute of International Affairs]] (SIIA), the oldest think tank in Singapore, is now part of the consortium. The Director of the Centre is Dr Yeo Lay Hwee

==Aims==
The EU Centre has been cited by Finnlink magazine as a Centre intended to “raise awareness of the longstanding partnership between the EU and Singapore, and the EU and [[ASEAN]], and promote knowledge and visibility of the EU in Singapore through different outreach activities, education, research and publications… the Centre’s objective is to raise awareness of the EU to a local and regional audience, foster a finer understanding of the EU and its member states, and analyze EU policies and their positions on global issues”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbcsg.org/index.htm/images/Finnlink/finlinkmagazines_2009/finnlink_january-march_09.pdf.pdf#page=16 |title=Article on EU Centre by Finnlink magazine |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities since 2008==
The EU Centre's activities revolve around outreach, education and research. The Centre, like other centres and institutes co-funded by the EU, organises lectures, workshops and seminars year round. The events have attracted speakers who are senior policy decision makers, such as [[Klaus Regling]], former Director General of [[Ecofin]] and now the Managing Director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), who spoke on “The Euro After 10 Years” in a distinguished lecture co-hosted by the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]] and European Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spp.nus.edu.sg/docs/events/2009/20090324_10_Years_of_EMU_Infosheet.pdf |title=Flyer from School of Public Policy, NUS |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre held an academic conference on 6‐8 Dec 2009 Networked versus Institutional Regionalism", where Professor [[Tommy Koh]] delivered the keynote speech.Its outreach event mass, the "Green Innovations Symposium" was featured in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smu.edu.sg/news_room/smu_in_the_news/2009/sources/BT_20090601_1.pdf |title=Business Times article |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its "Corporate Social Responsibility Business Schools Debate" drew a 700 strong audience and was moderated by Ms Claire Chiang, Chairperson of Banyan Tree Global Foundation, the [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] arm of [[Banyan Tree Holdings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nus.edu.sg/campuslife/cl-story24.php |title=NUS Campus Life story |publisher=Nus.edu.sg |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU Centre regularly partners research institutions and think tanks such as [[Asia-Europe Foundation]] to host events such as a public talk by Alain Ruche, Deputy Head of Unit, External Relations [[Directorate-General]], European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asef.org/index.php?option=com_project&amp;task=view&amp;id=600 |title=Asia Europe Foundation article |publisher=Asef.org |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborates with others in research, such as in “The EU through the Eyes of Asia” project of the National Centre for Research on Europe ([[National Centre for Research on Europe|NCRE]]), [[University of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euperceptions.canterbury.ac.nz/eyes/book.shtml |title=Perceptions of the EU Project |publisher=Euperceptions.canterbury.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first grant period from 2008 - 2012, the Centre organised more than 100 public events ranging from lectures, talks, seminars and panel discussions. It also organised several competitions to reach out to younger Singaporeans and Southeast Asians.

In support of the official Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process and the 9th ASEM Summit to be held in Vientiane, the EU Centre teamed up with the Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF) and National Library Board (NLB) to put together an Exhibition entitled “Connected Histories, Shared Future” showcasing the work done by ASEF and EU Centre to bring about greater connections and exchanges between Asia and Europe.

The Exhibition was inaugurated at the National Library Building in Singapore by Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister of Singapore from 1991 – 2004) on 17 May 2012. The Exhibition was on displayed for a month at the Main Central Library of the NLB before travelling to four other locations in Singapore – to the Jurong Regional Library, Woodlands Regional Library, NTU Lee Wee Nam Library and NUS Central Library each for 3–4 weeks. As the centrepiece and final destination for 2012, the Exhibition was brought to Vientiane, Laos in November 2012 and set up at the National Convention Centre, where 51 leaders from Asia and Europe were convening for the 9th ASEM Summit. The Exhibition was also viewed by the ASEM senior officials prior to the Leaders meeting.

==Publications ==
The EU Centre sees publications as an important avenue not only to share research findings, build up knowledge on the EU and generate further discussions and debates on issues, but also as an important outreach tool. The EU Centre publishes working papers targeted at the academic community to encourage exploration and discussion of various subjects pertinent to the EU and Southeast Asia, and also a series of background and policy briefs aimed at the policy makers and the broader public to explain the background to some of the EU’s policies, and to discuss their relevance for Singapore or the region. 
Our latest publication is a book containing a collection of essays by European and Asian scholars, policy makers, journalists and young researchers entitled "Changing Tides and Changing Ties - Anchoring Asia-Europe Relations in Challenging Times".

==Outreach to schools and junior colleges==
Staff and Associates of the EU Centre visited some 30 pre-university institutions, mostly [[Junior College]] and [[Integrated Programme]] schools, to bring the European Union and its global relevance to the students, as well as raise the level of interest in European Studies.

The Centre also published three Resource packages for teachers to explain the role of the EU in global trade, its role in conflict management and also to explain monetary integration and the crisis in the Eurozone.

{{Comics navbar|title=Editorial cartoon}}

An '''editorial [[cartoon]]''', also known as a '''political cartoon''', is a drawing containing a commentary expressing the artist's opinion. An artist who writes and draws such images is known as an [[editorial cartoonist]]. They typically combine artistic skill, [[hyperbole]] and [[satire]] in order to question [[authority]] and draw attention to [[corruption]], [[political violence]] and other [[social ills]].&lt;ref name=Sterling&gt;{{cite book | last = Sterling | first = Christopher | title = Encyclopedia of Journalism | publisher = Sage Publications, Inc | location = Thousand Oaks | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-7619-2957-6 |pages=253–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hti.osu.edu/opper/editorial-cartoons|title=Editorial Cartoons: An Introduction {{!}} HTI|last=Shelton|first=Mitchell|website=hti.osu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed in England in the latter part of the 18th century, [[James Gillray]] was a pioneer of the political cartoon.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; Founded in 1841, the British periodical ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' appropriated the term cartoon to refer to its political cartoons, which led to the term's widespread use.{{sfn|Appelbaum|Kelly|1981|p=15}}

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[File:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|thumb|''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', Plate 8, 1735, and retouched by Hogarth in 1763 by adding the Britannia emblem&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;hl=en p.192] "PLATE VIII. ... Britannia 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;hl=en p.193] "Retouched by the Author, 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The pictorial satire has been credited as the precursor to the political cartoons in England: John J. Richetti, in ''The Cambridge history of English literature, 1660–1780'', states that "English graphic satire really begins with Hogarth's ''Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Richetti| first = John J.| title = The Cambridge history of English literature, 1660–1780| date = 2005| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 0-521-78144-2 }}, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwzWAAAAMAAJ|title=The Political Cartoon|author=Charles Press|year=1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hogarth]]’s pictures combined social criticism with sequential artistic scenes. A frequent target of his satire was the corruption of early 18thcentury British politics. An early satirical work was an ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (c.1721), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the [[South Sea Bubble]], in which many English people lost a great deal of money.&lt;ref&gt;See Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'' (3rd edition, London 1989), no. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

His art often had a strong moralizing element to it, such as in his masterpiece of 1732–33, ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', engraved in 1734. It consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from sex workers, and gambling—the character's life ultimately ends in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rake’s Progress|url=http://www.soane.org/collections_legacy/the_soane_hogarths/rakes_progress|work=Sir John Soane's Museum|publisher=Sir John Soane's Museum|accessdate=13 December 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, his work was only tangentially politicized and was primarily regarded on its artistic merits. George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.&lt;ref name="Press" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Birth+of+England%27s+pocket+cartoon%3B+LOCAL+HISTORY+Smile+awhile+through...-a0153110971| title=Birth of England's pocket cartoon|author=Chris Upton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
[[File:Caricature gillray plumpudding.jpg|thumb|James Gillray’s ''[[The Plumb-pudding in Danger]]'' (1805). The world being carved up into spheres of influence between [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Napoleon]]. According to [[Martin Rowson]], it is “probably the most famous political cartoon of all time—it has been stolen over and over and over again by cartoonists ever since."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Rowson]], speaking on The Secret of Drawing, presented by [[Andrew Graham Dixon]], BBCTV&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The medium began to develop in England in the latter part of the 18th century—especially around the time of the [[French Revolution]]—under the direction of its great exponents, [[James Gillray]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]], both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and [[caricature]], and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account, many of Gillray's satires were directed against [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of Revolutionary France and [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Satire, sewers and statesmen: why James Gillray was king of the cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/21/satire-sewers-and-statesmen-james-gillray-king-of-cartoon|agency=''The Guardian''|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The times in which Gillray lived were peculiarly favourable to the growth of a great school of caricature. Party warfare was carried on with great vigour and not a little bitterness; and personalities were freely indulged in on both sides. Gillray's incomparable wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him the first place among caricaturists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/mark-bryant/james-gillray-scourge-napoleon|title=James Gillray: The Scourge of Napoleon|publisher=HistoryToday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Cruikshank]] became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray (1820s–40s). His early career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications. He gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians and was bribed in 1820 "not to caricature His Majesty" ([[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]) "in any immoral situation". His work included a personification of England named [[John Bull]] who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as Gillray and Rowlandson.&lt;ref&gt;Gatrell, Vic.

=== Cartoonist's magazines ===

[[File:BritishLionTenniel1857Punch1.jpg|thumb|right|''The British Lion's Vengeance...'', cartoon by [[John Tenniel]] in the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]]]
[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|thumb|An editorial cartoon of [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]], 1865, entitled ''The Rail Splitter at Work Repairing the Union''. The caption reads: (Johnson): "Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever." (Lincoln): "A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended."]]
The art of the editorial cartoon was further developed with the publication of the British periodical ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1841, founded by [[Henry Mayhew]] and engraver [[Ebenezer Landells]] (an earlier magazine that published cartoons was ''Monthly Sheet of Caricatures'', printed from 1830 and an important influence on ''Punch'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1347521/caricature-and-cartoon/59402/Early-19th-century|title=Caricature and cartoon|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought by [[Bradbury and Evans]] in 1842, who capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies to turn the magazine into a preeminent national institution. The term "[[cartoon]]" to refer to comic drawings was coined by the magazine in 1843; the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and "carttons" for the mural were displayed for the public; the term "cartoon" then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or {{lang|it|cartone}} in Italian.  ''Punch'' humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the ''Punch'' cartoons led to the term's widespread use.{{sfn|Appelbaum|Kelly|1981|p=15}}

Artists who published in ''Punch'' during the 1840s and 50s included [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]], [[John Tenniel]] and [[Charles Keene (artist)|Charles Keene]]. This group became known as "The ''Punch'' Brotherhood", which also included Charles Dickens who joined Bradbury and Evans after leaving [[Chapman and Hall]] in 1843. ''Punch'' authors and artists also contributed to another Bradbury and Evans literary magazine called ''[[Once A Week (magazine)|Once A Week]]'' (est.1859), created in response to Dickens' departure from ''[[Household Words]]''.

The most prolific and influential cartoonist of the 1850s and 60s was [[John Tenniel]], chief cartoon artist for ''Punch'', who perfected the art of physical caricature and representation to a point that has changed little up to the present day. For over five decades he was a steadfast social witness to the sweeping national changes that occurred during this period alongside his fellow cartoonist [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]. The magazine loyally captured the general public mood; in 1857, following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]] and the public outrage that followed, ''Punch'' published vengeful illustrations such as Tenniel's ''Justice'' and ''The British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger''.

=== Maturation ===
[[File:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Nast]] depicts the Tweed Ring: "Who stole the people's money?" / "'Twas him."]]
[[File:School Begins (Puck Magazine 1-25-1899).jpg|thumb|1899 cartoon showing [[Uncle Sam]] lecturing four children labeled [[Philippines]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]]. The caption reads: School Begins. Uncle Sam (to his new class in Civilization)!]]
[[File:Panama canal cartooon 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 political cartoon. The U.S.'s intentions to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to the [[separation of Panama from Colombia]]]]

By the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many countries featured cartoons designed to express the publisher's opinion on the politics of the day. One of the most successful was [[Thomas Nast]] in New York City, who imported realistic German drawing techniques to major political issues in the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Nast was most famous for his 160 editorial cartoons attacking the criminal characteristics of [[William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed]]'s political machine in New York City. Albert Boime argues that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a political cartoonist, Thomas Nast wielded more influence than any other artist of the 19th century. He not only enthralled a vast audience with boldness and wit, but swayed it time and again to his personal position on the strength of his visual imagination. Both Lincoln and Grant acknowledged his effectiveness in their behalf, and as a crusading civil reformer he helped destroy the corrupt Tweed Ring that swindled New York City of millions of dollars. Indeed, his impact on American public life was formidable enough to profoundly affect the outcome of every presidential election during the period 1864 to 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Boime, "Thomas Nast and French Art", ''American Art Journal'' (1972) 4#1 pp. 43–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notable editorial cartoons include [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Join, or Die]]'' (1754), on the need for unity in the American colonies; ''[[The Thinkers Club]]'' (1819), a response to the surveillance and censorship of universities in Germany under the [[Carlsbad Decrees]]; and [[E. H. Shepard]]'s ''The Goose-Step'' (1936), on the rearmament of Germany under Hitler. ''The Goose-Step'' is one of a number of notable cartoons first published in the British ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine.

== Recognition ==
Institutions which archive and document editorial cartoons include the [[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicalgraphics.org/collection|title=CSPG, politicalgraphics|website=CSPG, politicalgraphics|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Cartoon Archive]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/se000465|title=British Cartoon Archive at University of Kent {{!}} Culture24|website=www.culture24.org.uk|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editorial cartoons and [[editorial cartoonist]]s are recognised by a number of awards, for example the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]] (for US cartoonists, since 1922) and the [[British Press Awards]]' "Cartoonist of the Year".

== Modern political cartoons ==
Political cartoons can usually be found on the [[editorial page]] of many newspapers, although a few (such as [[Garry Trudeau]]'s ''[[Doonesbury]]'') are sometimes placed on the regular [[comic strip]] page. Most cartoonists use visual metaphors and caricatures to address complicated political situations, and thus sum up a current event with a humorous or emotional picture.

Yaakov Kirschen, creator of the Israeli comic strip ''[[Dry Bones (comic strip)|Dry Bones]]'', says his cartoons are designed to make people laugh, which makes them drop their guard and see things the way he does. In an interview, he defined his objective as a cartoonist as an attempt to "seduce rather than to offend." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Barry |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=1244 |title='Dry Bones': Row shows clash of civilizations, Jerusalem Post|publisher=Jpost.com |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern political cartooning can be built around traditional visual metaphors and symbols such as [[Uncle Sam]], the [[Democratic donkey]] and the [[Republican elephant]]. One alternative approach is to emphasize the text or the story line, as seen in ''Doonesbury'' which tells a linear story in comic strip format. 

Cartoons have a great potential to political communication capable of enhancing political comprehension and reconceptualization of events, through speciﬁc frames of understanding (Mateus, 2016). Mateus' analysis "seems to indicate that the double standard thesis can be actually applied to trans-national contexts. This means that the framing of politics and business may not be limited to one country but may reﬂect a political world-view occurring in contemporary societies. From the double standard standpoint, there are no fundamental differences in the way Canadian political cartoonists and Portuguese political cartoons assess politics and business life" (Mateus, 2016:216). The paper does not tell that all political cartoons are based on this kind of double standard, but suggests that t[https://www.academia.edu/30728270/Political_Cartoons_as_Communicative_Weapons_the_hypothesis_of_the_Double_Standard_Thesis_in_three_Portuguese_cartoons he double standard thesis in Political Cartoons] may be a frequent frame among possible others.

A political cartoon commonly draws on two unrelated events and brings them together incongruously for humorous effect. The humour can reduce people's political anger and so serves a useful purpose. Such a cartoon also reflects real life and politics, where a deal is often done on unrelated proposals beyond public scrutiny.

== Pocket cartoons ==
A pocket cartoon is a form of cartoon which generally consists of a topical political gag/joke and appears as a single-panel single-column drawing. It was introduced by [[Osbert Lancaster]] in 1939 at the ''[[Daily Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Smith, ''[[The Observer]]'', 23 November 2008, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/23/osbert-lancaster-exhibition Timeless appeal of the classic joke]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 obituary by ''[[The Guardian]]'' of its pocket cartoonist [[David Austin (cartoonist)|David Austin]] said "Newspaper readers instinctively look to the pocket cartoon to reassure them that the disasters and afflictions besetting them each morning are not final. By taking a sideways look at the news and bringing out the absurd in it, the pocket cartoonist provides, if not exactly a silver lining, then at least a ray of hope."&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Jennings and Patrick Barkham, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 November 2005, [https://www.theguardian.com/arts/news/obituary/0,12723,1647210,00.html David Austin: Guardian pocket cartoonist with a sceptically humanist view of the news]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Editorial cartoons sometimes cause controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/opinion/sunday/why-are-political-cartoons-incendiary.html|title=Why Are Political Cartoons Incendiary?|first=Victor S.|last=Navasky|date=12 November 2011|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] (stemming from the publication of cartoons of [[Muhammad]]) and the [[2007 Bangladesh cartoon controversy]].

Libel lawsuits have been rare. In Britain, the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century came in 1921 when [[J.H. Thomas]], the leader of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the [[British Communist Party]]. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of "Black Friday"—when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. Thomas won his lawsuit, and restored his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel S.  Hyde, "'Please, Sir, he called me “Jimmy!' Political Cartooning before the Law: 'Black Friday,' J.H. Thomas, and the Communist Libel Trial of 1921," ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#4 pp 521–550&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Very Serious Paper Cuts,''''' a series of poems created using [[cut-up technique]] to create new poetry by cutting up and rearranging the pages of well-known books.

Other poems in this series have included ''The Arabian Nights Before Christmas'', ''Romeo and Dracula and Juliet,'' and variations on Edgar Allan Poe's ''The Raven.'' These poems are then collected into books, with some books distributed by secretly placing on the shelves of libraries and bookstores, in what Millikin calls "reverse shoplifting."&lt;ref name="Pride Prejudice and Frankenstein"&gt;Milllikin, Eric (June 2012).

==Activism==
Millikin is known for his political and social activism, with his artwork often tackling controversial  issues. He has championed Barack Obama's [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], commonly referred to as "Obamacare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.freep.com/article/20120325/OPINION01/203250484/Editorial-Editorial-Uphold-affordable-care | title = Uphold affordable health care | accessdate =2012-04-14 | last = | first =  | date =  | work = | publisher =| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Millikin has also championed [[green energy]], ridiculing the "Drill, Baby, Drill Brigade" of "oil producers, free-market zealots and [[global warming]] deniers." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.realclearenergy.org/2011/12/12/please_ignore_the_quotdrill_baby_drillquot_brigade_243565.html| title =Please Ignore The "Drill, Baby, Drill" Brigade| accessdate =2012-04-14| last =Millikin| first =Eric| date =| work =| publisher =Real Clear Energy| quote =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120616181201/http://www.realclearenergy.org/2011/12/12/please_ignore_the_quotdrill_baby_drillquot_brigade_243565.html| archivedate =2012-06-16| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reaction==
The [[American Library Association]]'s ''[[Booklist]]'' describes how Millikin's expressionistic visual style "crosses [[Edvard Munch]] with an incipient victim of high-school suicide" &lt;ref name="booklist"&gt;Flagg, Gordon (August 2006). "Attitude 3: The New Subversive Online Cartoonists". ''[[Booklist]]'', Pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Hindu]]'' describes his paintings as "haunting images."&lt;ref name="The Hindu" /&gt; In his book ''[[Attitude: The New Subversive Cartoonists|Attitude 3: The New Subversive Online Cartoonists]],'' syndicated newspaper editorial cartoonist [[Ted Rall]] describes Millikin's work as "one of the most interesting webcomics around."&lt;ref name="attitude"&gt;Rall, Ted (2006).

''[[Making Comics]]'', New York: Harper Collins Publishers. {{ISBN|0-06-078094-0}}. Pg. 227&lt;/ref&gt; and is described as "mind-blowing" by [[Comic Book Resources]].&lt;ref name="ComicBookResources"&gt;Reed, Bill "Sunday Brunch" http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/11/sunday-brunch-71110/&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' has written that Millikin's comics "use the newspaper format for far more daring, entertainingly perverse work" than most comics and is "perfectly at home at a good alternative weekly or a great college paper." &lt;ref name="TCJ"&gt;Wood, Mariko (March 2003). "Download: Good Comics and Baud Web Comics". ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', No. 251, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Webcomics Examiner'' has called Millikin's work "one of the sharpest political commentaries available."&lt;ref name="The Best Webcomics of 2004" /&gt;

Millikin's artwork has won many awards from organizations including the [[Associated Press]],&lt;ref name="Detroit Free Press" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/1/winners-named-in-michigan-apme-newspaper-contest/?page=alll|title=Winners named in Michigan APME newspaper contest|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1 June 2014|website=The Washington Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Society of Professional Journalists]],&lt;ref name="Detroit Free Press SPJ"&gt;"Free Press wins big with SPJ; Journalists sweep the year's top awards".

The series resulted in Kilpatrick's being sent to jail and in the newspaper's 2009 [[Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting]].&lt;ref name="Detroit Free Press IRE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Detroit Free Press Pulitzer"&gt;"Free Press wins its 9th Pulitzer; Reporting led to downfall of mayor".

His front-page artwork in the ''Detroit Free Press'' advocating for U.S. government loans as a solution to the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008–2009]] was described as a "gutsy move" that "stretch[es] the limits of the medium"&lt;ref name="Society for News Design"/&gt; and  CNN's [[Kyra Phillips]] described it as "full front page and in your face".&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;Phillips, Kyra. "Big Three Push For Bridge Loan". (Dec. 5, 2008).  [[CNN Newsroom]], 2:00 PM EST&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[John D. Dingell]] displayed it on the House floor urging passage of government loans to  automakers and reiterated the central theme of the piece, saying "now is the time for us to 'Invest in America'."&lt;ref name="Dingell"&gt;Dingell, John D. "[http://www.house.gov/dingell/110/081210autosvote.html Dingell Statement on Auto Industry Loan Bill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307185158/http://www.house.gov/dingell/110/081210autosvote.html |date=2010-03-07 }}. (Dec. 10, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Millikin's October 2011 ''Wizard of Oz''-themed ''Detroit Free Press'' front-page "Lions, Tigers and Bears: Oh my!" illustration (about the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Chicago Bears]]) was praised by [[ESPN]]'s [[Mike Tirico]] during the [[Monday Night Football]] half time show.&lt;ref name="Lions, Tigers and Bears"&gt;Detroit Free Press staff (Oct. 10, 2011) [http://www.freep.com/article/20111010/SPORTS02/111010033/  Purchase today's special Tigers, Lions front page]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all criticism of Millikin's artwork has been positive. Since 2000, Millikin has been the target of protest campaigns organized by the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] for what they call his "blasphemous treatment of Jesus".&lt;ref name="CatholicLeague"&gt;"[http://www.catholicleague.org/catalyst/2000_catalyst/1100_catalyst.htm#MICHIGAN%20STATE%20PRESIDENT%20ACTS%20PRESIDENTIAL Michigan State President Acts Presidential] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710142219/http://www.catholicleague.org/catalyst/2000_catalyst/1100_catalyst.htm |date=2007-07-10 }}". (November 2000). ''Catalyst Journal of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights''&lt;/ref&gt; "[''Fetus-X''] is offensive to Catholics and Christians," Catholic League spokesman Patrick Scully said in August 2002. "It completely ridicules the Catholic faith and is not funny."&lt;ref name="StateNews"/&gt; The ''[[Hartford Advocate]]'' has called Millikin a "borderline sociopath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.ctnow.com/custom/nmm/hartfordadvocate/hce-hta-0201-ht06comics06.artfeb01,0,3994240.story| title =Stand-Up Comics| accessdate =2007-03-19| last =| first =| date =| format =| work =Hartford Advocate| publisher =| quote =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070223190648/http://www.ctnow.com/custom/nmm/hartfordadvocate/hce-hta-0201-ht06comics06.artfeb01,0,3994240.story| archivedate =2007-02-23| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The GALA Hispanic theatre was founded in 1976 by Hugo and Rebecca Read Medrano and their supporters with the aim of preserving and promoting Hispanic language and culture.

=== Latino Heritage in Washington D.C. ===

There are many theaters in Washington, D.C., but there was not one for Hispanics until the opening of GALA. Their playwrights and their actors are of Hispanic heritage, hailing from countries including [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Peru]].

== Gender Equality  ==
{{See also|Gender equality}}
In 2015, Gala was awarded the ''50/50 Applause Award'' by The International Center for Women Playwrights, for having more than 50% of its plays written by female playwrights.

== Awards ==

The GALA Hispanic Theatre was given an award by the King of Spain, Carlos I, in 2008, in recognition of their promotion and dissemination of Spanish culture in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.galatheatre.org/2016/05/gala-awards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3439">'''''Gangster Stories''''' was a controversial [[pulp magazine]] of the early 1930s. It featured [[hardboiled]] crime fiction that glorified the gun-toting [[gangsters]] of the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era. It was published by [[Harold Hersey]], as part of his [[Good Story Magazine Company]] pulp chain. The inaugural issue was dated November 1929;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gang Pulp|url=http://offtrailpublications.com/gangster.html|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=Off Trail Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; the final issue was dated November 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/mags/gangster_stories.html Galactic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; When Hersey sold his assets to another company, ''Gangster Stories'' was continued under the title ''[[Greater Gangster Stories]]'', under which it lasted through the May 1934 issue.

''Gangster Stories'' (and its companion, ''[[Racketeer Stories]]'') quickly came under censorship pressure in [[New York (state)|New York]] state, instigated by [[John S. Sumner]] of the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], a state entity empowered to recommend obscenity cases to prosecutorial authorities. Hersey was forced to agree to abide by certain rules, e.g. not letting gangsters triumph over lawmen.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, Harold. ''Pulpwood Editor''. [[Frederick A. Stokes]], 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John; editor. ''Gang Pulp''. Off-Trail Publications, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-935031-00-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fiction in ''Gangster Stories'' (and ''[[Racketeer Stories]]'') constitutes a unique genre. Though properly categorized as [[crime fiction]], the emphasis was on action and gunplay. The stories only tangentially resemble the traditional [[detective fiction|detective story]] or [[mystery fiction|mystery]]. A typical ''Gangster Stories'' epic featured rival mobs shooting it out in the streets with [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy guns]].

Perhaps the most popular author in the magazine was [[Anatole Feldman]], with his stories of the [[Chicago]] mobster [[Big Nose Serrano]]. Playwright Feldman initially based Serrano on the character of [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]. The first Big Nose story, "Serrano of the Stockyards" (''Gangster Stories'', May 1930), roughly followed the plot and characters of the famous play. Thereafter, Serrano evolved into an unlikely crusader against the social ills of the [[Great Depression|Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Anatole &amp; [[Will Murray (writer)|Will Murray]] (introductions). ''The Gangland Sagas of Big Nose Serrano: Volumes 1-3''. Off-Trail Publications, 2008-09. {{ISBN|978-1-935031-01-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-935031-04-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-935031-07-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular author was former newspaper reporter [[Margie Harris]], a clever writer with an ear for the distinctive vernacular of the mobs. Other authors include [[Arthur J. Burks]], former [[Sing Sing]] convict [[Henry Leverage]], [[C. B. Yorke]], [[Walt S. Dinghall]], [[George Bruce (screenwriter)|George Bruce]], [[Richard Credicott]],&lt;ref&gt;Credicott, Richard.

'''''Glittering Images: A Journey Through Art from Egypt to Star Wars''''' is a 2012 book by American cultural critic [[Camille Paglia]], in which the author discusses notable works of [[Applied arts|applied]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]] from ancient to modern times. Paglia wrote that she intended it to be a personalized "journey" through [[art history]], focusing on [[Western world|Western]] works. Paglia writes that she felt inspired to write given that she worries 21st century Americans are overexposed to visual stimulation by the "all-pervasive mass media" and must fight to keep their capacity for [[contemplation]].&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

The book features twenty-nine sections, with glossy full-color illustrations, each focused on a specific piece.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Artists detailed include [[Titian]], [[Manet]], [[Picasso]], and [[Jackson Pollock]] among others. After its October 16, 2012 release, the book received positive reviews from publications such as ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Derakhshani|first=Tirdad|title=Camille Paglia hopes to reignite regular folks' interest in the arts|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-10-17/entertainment/34500629_1_camille-paglia-sexual-personae-western-art|date=October 17, 2012|publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it also picked up more critical, negative reviews from publications such as ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Charioteer of Delphi-2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia discusses the [[Charioteer of Delphi]], a notable [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] work.&lt;ref name=delphi/&gt;]]

While touching on the themes of Paglia's previous work, ''Glittering Images'' focuses on modern cultural [[ignorance]].&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Paglia wrote what she intended as a personalized "journey" through art history since she believes people today have become visually overexposed by the mass-media and disconnected from the past.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; In it, she argues, "the eye is assaulted, coerced, desensitized."&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

Paglia discusses twenty-nine examples of visual artwork. Paglia begins by describing the [[ancient Egypt]]ian funerary images of [[Nefertari (18th dynasty)|Queen Nefertari]],&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; a royal whose name means "the most beautiful of them all". Paglia refers to how the civilization "dreamed of conquering the terrors of death", and she notes how "Egyptian painted figures float in an abstract space that is neither here nor there", describing the visual power of this "eternal present" depicted.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.3-5&lt;/ref&gt; She then turns to the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] statuettes carved by [[Bronze Age]] residents of several [[Aegean Sea]] islands, which feature "coolly geometric" designs unlike that of the voluptuous figures carved by earlier, [[Stone Age]] people (such as the '[[Venus of Willendorf]]') while still displaying [[vulva]]e markings and prominent breasts that convey femininity. These pieces of [[Cycladic art]] are cited as "daring explorations of form and structure" foreshadowing the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The author then describes the '[[Charioteer of Delphi]]', a work from the fifth century BC that she writes embodies well the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ideals of "young male beauty" and the building of character through personal striving. She states how she finds the chariot racing athlete "grave and dignified" with his meditative expression, giving a "look that would become canonical for gods and heroes in the classic tradition".&lt;ref name=delphi&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.15-18&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to write about the '[[Erechtheion#The Porch of the Caryatids|Porch of the Maidens]]' in the [[Erechtheion]] in [[Athens, Greece]], with columns carved into feminine shapes that she labels as "a remarkable display of female power" as "muscular strength" co-exists with womanly curves,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.21&lt;/ref&gt; and then the piece '[[Laocoön and His Sons]]', a violent scene carved in marble in which [[sea serpent]]s attempt to slay a man and his three sons that stridently addresses the problem of [[theodicy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KellsFol007vMadonnaChild V2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia praises the intricacy of the [[Book of Kells]], the section devoted to [[Virgin Mary]] pictured here.&lt;ref name=kells/&gt;]]

The book goes on next to the famous [[mosaic]] of [[Saint John Chrysostom]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]], a piece that Paglia writes as having an "implacable intensity of gaze" making it a great piece of [[Byzantine art]],&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.36-37&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally to the late eighth century Ireland's [[Book of Kells]], an "intricately decorated manuscript of the Gospels that is one of the most beautiful objects surviving from medieval Europe."&lt;ref name=kells&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.39&lt;/ref&gt; The eight piece included is [[Donatello]]'s '[[Mary Magdalene (Donatello)|Mary Magdalene]]', a work of the [[Italian Renaissance]] created in 1453 that showed the artist's ability to be "harsh and imposing".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.43&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia then discusses [[Titian]]'s '[[Venus with a Mirror]]'; she writes about the artistic changes it symbolizes as the strong brushwork and liberal use of paint allow for warm flesh tones, Titian creating "opulent nudes that thrust sexual display and fantasy" onto the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Paglia next discusses [[Bronzino]]'s 'Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune', writing that as a work of the [[Mannerism]] movement it shows a "polished theatricality" arresting to the viewer,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.53&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s '[[Chair of Saint Peter]]' in the [[Vatican City]], a 17th-century work showing how [[Baroque art]] often "overwhelms the senses with flamboyant grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.59&lt;/ref&gt;

She takes a nuanced view of the lasting influence of [[pop art]], writing that, generally, the artistic movement "projects an innocent child’s view of the world."&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; She also argues that works by artists such as [[Andy Warhol]], whom she praises, conveyed powerful subtleties with their pieces. The book details '[[Marilyn Diptych]]', a 1962 silkscreen that replicates a photo of [[Marilyn Monroe]] over and over with image variations, and the work is lauded for strongly showing the "multiplicity of meanings" in the actress' life and legacy.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

The book additionally cites [[Eleanor Antin]]'s [[conceptual art]] project '100 Boots'. Paglia praises the work, writing that "boots, like their creator, are outsiders, eternal migrants questing for knowledge and experience."&lt;ref name=roth/&gt;

==Reception==
Writer John Adams of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' published a critical review of the book, viewing it as being "so agenda driven and so riddled with polemic asides that its potential to persuade is forever being compromised." Adams noted that the book avoided discussions of [[Giotto]], [[Michelangelo]], [[El Greco]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], and [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], which he criticized. He supported how Paglia "encourages us to read more closely and to look more imaginatively" at the world of [[art history]], though concluded that her praise of [[George Lucas]] was assessing art "by its reach rather than its depth", and thus Paglia "has journeyed to the wrong continent, and what she has found glittering there is fool's gold."&lt;ref name="on-art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=John|title=Paglia on Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/glittering-images-by-camille-paglia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|date=November 30, 2012|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Gary Rosen of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', however, praised the book's "impressive range" and accessibility for a general audience. He argued that "[f]or the most part, Ms. Paglia chooses well, from works both celebrated and obscure", and he stated that the author "is especially good at the difficult trick of providing context for the newcomer to art history without being tedious for a more experienced reader."&lt;ref name=WSJ1&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Gary|title=The Pagan Aesthetic|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390443675404578058504002593338|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=July 17, 2014|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' ran a supportive article that labeled the book a "magisterial, poetically composed, and masterly study".&lt;ref name=inquirer/&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a supportive review by [[Michael S. Roth]], an author and the president of [[Wesleyan University]]. He wrote, "Artists, questing outsiders, are still with us, still finding their way, making their way. Perhaps some of them will be inspired by the glittering images Camille Paglia offers here."&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Michael S. Roth]]|title=Art appreciation 101: 'Glittering Images' by Camille Paglia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/28/entertainment/la-ca-jc-camille-paglia-20121230|date=December 28, 2012|publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Good Books International''' is an online bookstore based in [[New Zealand]]. Since its foundation, the company has operated as a [[non-profit]], donating all its proceeds to [[Oxfam]].

The profits donated to [[Oxfam]] are then invested in projects throughout the world to reduce [[poverty]]. Dr. Jane Cherrington setup Good Books NZ in early 2006.

The initial offering was an online bookstore, which donated all its profits to charity. Good Books International signed a partnership with [[Oxfam]] recently, to donate the company's profits from book sales to joint venture projects with the charitable foundation.&lt;ref name=oxfam&gt;{{cite web|title=A new chapter in the fight against inequality with Good Books|url=https://www.oxfam.org.nz/what-we-do/issues/good-books|publisher=[[Oxfam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company received critical acclaim in 2012 for their viral online video, promoting the Good Books ethos.&lt;ref name=inspiration&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maclaed|first1=Duncan|title=Good Books Great Writers|url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2012/good-books-great-writers/|publisher=The Inspiration Room|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hotnheavy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahy|first1=Ben|title=Getting hot'n'heavy with Good Books|url=http://idealog.co.nz/venture/2012/11/getting-hotnheavy-good-books|publisher=Idealog|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Books by String Theory|url=http://www.luerzersarchive.com/en/features/campaigns/good-books-by-string-theory-224.html|publisher=Lurzer's Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; It compared how other large online booksellers often made huge profits on book sales while other parts of the world struggled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collazo|first1=Angelo|title=Interview with Buck: Good Books “Metamorphosis”|url=http://motionographer.com/2012/03/26/interview-buck-good-books-metamorphosis/|publisher=Motionographer|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement went on to win a gold and bronze award at the [[London International Awards]] later that year, as well as many others including the coveted D&amp;AD Yellow Pencil for Film Advertising Craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D&amp;AD Awards Winners 2013|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/june/dad-awards-winners-2013/|publisher=Creative review|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D&amp;AD hands out three Kiwi pencils as Axis winners keep winning|url=http://stoppress.co.nz/news/dad|publisher=StopPress|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacLeod|first1=Duncan|title=D&amp;AD Awards 2013|url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2013/dad-nominations-2013/|publisher=Inspiration Room|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colenso BBDO wins one D&amp;AD Yellow Pencil for 'Donation Glasses'; DraftFCB NZ wins one Yellow Pencil for 'Call Girl' campaign and String Theory wins one Yellow Pencil for 'Metamorphosis' work|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/nz/2013/06/colenso-bbdo-nz-wins-one-dad-y.html|publisher=Campaign Brief|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital campaign known as "Good Books Great Writers Series", where each short film attempts to creatively tell the Good Books story in the style of the world's most famous literary talents, and hand-picked directors donate their skill and time, free of charge, to create films for the charity.&lt;ref name=hotnheavy /&gt;&lt;ref name=inspiration /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Books launches 2nd installment 'Havana Heat' in Great Writers series via String Theory|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/2012/11/good-books-launches-2nd-instal.html|publisher=Campaign Brief|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series had a follow-up advertisement in late 2012. Named ‘Havana Heat’, it was written as a steamy love letter to Good Books, in the bodice-ripping language made famous by Mills &amp; Boon books.&lt;ref name=hotnheavy /&gt;

In 2014, it was announced that the [[non-profit]] had begun to work on a similar project with [[Oxfam|Oxfam Canada]], as well as Oxfam New Zealand. During an interview, it was stated that it had taken over five years for the deal to be reached. The reason for the project's delay was due to the innovative nature of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahy|first1=Ben|title=Horse's mouth: Dr Jane Cherrington|url=http://stoppress.co.nz/news/horses-mouth-dr-jane-cherrington|publisher=StopPress|date=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good Books again received attention in 2015 for a for the third installment of the Good Books Great Writers Series, We Need to Talk About Alice, an ethereal rendition of [[Alice in Wonderland]], which was a finalist in the 2016 AXIS Awards For Good category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bagge|first1=Holly|title=String Theory and Plenty go on an adventure to wonderland for Good Books|url=http://stoppress.co.nz/news/good-books-story|publisher=StopPress|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Axis Awards - Winners|url=http://caanz.co.nz/awards/axis/2016-axis-awards-winners/|publisher=Caanz|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxfam partnership==
Good Books have run a number of schemes with [[Oxfam]] to provide charitable donations to fund projects in partnership with [[Oxfam]]. Each time a book is purchased from Good Books, a percentage is given to [[Oxfam]] to fund these projects. Much of the work carried out by the projects has been based in the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] regions of [[Asia]] including, [[East Timor]], [[Fiji]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. Their work varies dependent on the region, but includes clean water, [[sanitation]], agriculture development and access to [[education]].&lt;ref name=oxfam /&gt;

As part of the scheme, Good Books International also suggests that customers sign up to [[Oxfam]]'s donation service.&lt;ref name=oxfam /&gt;

[[Image:Triptych Harbaville Louvre OA3247 recto.jpg|thumb|250px|Recto, full view. 28 x 24 cm.]]
The '''Harbaville Triptych'''  is a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[ivory]] [[triptych]] of the middle of the 10th century with a [[Deesis]] and other saints, now in the [[Louvre]].  Traces of colouring can still be seen on some figures.  It is regarded as the finest, and best-preserved, of the "Romanos group" of ivories from a workshop in [[Constantinople]], probably closely connected with the Imperial Court.  

The group takes its name from the [[Romanos Ivory | Romanos and Eudokia ivory plaque]] in the [[Cabinet des Médailles]] of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris showing Christ crowning an Emperor, named as Romanos, and his Empress.  This is thought to be either [[Romanos II]] crowned in 959, or possibly [[Romanos IV]], crowned in 1068.  Related works are in Rome, the Vatican, and Moscow, this last another coronation probably datable to 944.&lt;ref&gt;David Talbot-Rice, ''Byzantine Art'', 3rd edn 1968, Penguin Books Ltd, pp. 442-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Of this "Romanos group" the ''Harbaville Triptych'' is considered "by far the finest, for it shows an elegance and delicacy which are absent in the others.  All are in the polished, elegant style typical of the Court school."&lt;ref&gt;Talbot-Rice, op. cit. p.446&lt;/ref&gt;  Other groups of ivories have also been identified, presumably representing the output of different workshops, perhaps also employed by the Court, but generally of lower quality, or at least refinement.&lt;ref&gt;Originally by Goldschmidt and [[Kurt Weitzmann]], ''Die byzantinischen Elfenbeinskulpturen des X.-XIII. Jahrhunderts'', Berlin, 1930-34&lt;/ref&gt;  Since much greater numbers of ivories survive than panel paintings from the period, they are very important for the history of [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]].

All sides of the triptych are fully carved, with more saints on the outsides of the side leaves, and an elaborate decorative scheme on the back of the central leaf.

The ivory's early history is unrecorded. It derives its name from its first known owner, the antiquarian Louis-François Harbaville (1791-1866), who inherited it from his in-laws, the Beugny de Pommeras family of [[Arras]]. It was purchased for the Louvre in 1891 from Harbaville's grandsons and heirs.

The '''Hello Pappy scandal''', alluding to the nickname of involved host [[Willie Revillame]] and the [[Hello Garci scandal]],&lt;ref name="gma830"/&gt; was a scandal surrounding an incident during the August 20, 2007 episode of the [[Culture of the Philippines|Filipino]] [[variety show]] ''[[Wowowee]]'', broadcast by [[ABS-CBN]]. During the episode, a technical error occurred during the final jackpot round of the show's ''Wilyonaryo'' segment which raised allegations within the media that the segment was, or could be, [[Fraud|rigged]] by the producers. The incident prompted an investigation by the country's [[Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines)|Department of Trade and Industry]], and was also the catalyst of an on-air feud between Revillame and [[Joey de Leon]], a personality from the rival [[GMA Network]].&lt;ref name="gma830"/&gt;

ABS-CBN, who claimed that the incident was the result of a "design flaw" that had been fixed, was fined ₱290,000 by the Department of Trade and Industry for violating the country's Consumers Act.

==Development==

During the episode, a contestant named Weng&lt;ref name="pep-honest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/14540/Wowowee-controversy-is-an-honest-mistake%E2%80%94ABS-CBN-executive|title="Wowowee" controversy is an "honest mistake" -- ABS-CBN executive|last=Bonifacio|first=Julie|date=August 26, 2007|publisher=PEP.ph|language=Tagalog|accessdate=2009-04-10| quote=ng contestant na nagngangalang Weng", "a contestant named Weng}}&lt;/ref&gt; participated in the ''Wilyonaryo'' segment of the show.  In the earlier rounds, she had won [[Philippine peso|₱]]37,000. For the jackpot portion of the game, out of the 12 "wheels" used in the game; she was randomly given a white-colored wheel. Weng now had to choose between two big prizes: the ₱100,000 that the host [[Willie Revillame]] was offering her, or whatever was inside the white wheel, which, according to the rules, could be a jackpot prize of ₱2,000,000 (US$45,000), a jackpot prize of ₱1,000,000 (US$22,500), a jackpot prize of ₱500,000 (US$11,250), a house and lot, or nothing at all (which would be signified by the numeral zero).&lt;ref name="gma-nocheating"/&gt;

At first, she decided to go with what was inside the white wheel.  However, after being prodded by the hosts to take the money instead, Weng decided to forgo the possible jackpot prize revealed in the white wheel and instead take home the ₱100,000 for this round, plus the ₱37,000 from the earlier round. After this, Willie pulled the dark film from the window embedded in the wheel to reveal what prize the contestant had lost by choosing to take home the ₱137,000. Pulling the dark film revealed the numeral zero.  This meant that if she had chosen the white wheel instead, she would have gone home with only ₱37,000.&lt;ref name="gma-nocheating"/&gt;

After the decision, Willie went on to reveal where the other prizes—the ₱2,000,000 cash prize, the ₱1,000,000 cash prize, the ₱500,000 cash prize, and the house and lot—were hidden.  He said that the symbol for the ₱2,000,000 cash prize—the numeral "2"—was in the window of the violet wheel.  He was handed the violet wheel, and he reached behind the wheel, supposedly to pull the dark film in order to reveal the numeral "2."  However, when he pulled the film, the numeral "0" appeared instead.  He appeared to fiddle with the back of the wheel and then he pulled out two films: one dark film (supposedly the "cover" film) and another film with the numeral "2" printed on it.  As he held those two films in his hand, the numeral "0" was still visible in the window of the violet wheel.&lt;ref name="gma-nocheating"/&gt;

Although ABS-CBN officials stated that this occurrence with the then-new game was a "mechanical glitch" and an honest mistake, controversy erupted as many critics asked whether the mistake was a sign that the show—or at least this portion of the show—could be or was rigged.&lt;ref name="pep-honest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gma-nocheating"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/58327/ABS-CBN-No-cheating-in-Wowowees-Wilyonaryo|title=ABS-CBN: No cheating in Wowowee's 'Wilyonaryo'|date=August 30, 2007|publisher=GMA News and Current Affairs|accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions and criticisms==
The scandal grew after [[Joey de Leon]], one of the hosts of ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]''—a rival variety show broadcast by [[GMA Network]], began making comments about the incident - ending an edition of his [[Manila Bulletin]] entertainment column about the incident with the statement, "Teasing is not bad.  Cheating is ... on TV."&lt;ref name="gma829"&gt;{{cite news | title =Joey: It's impossible to live without a heart | publisher = GMA News and Current Affairs |accessdate=2007-10-13 | date = 29 August 2007 | url =http://www.gmanews.tv/story/58242/Joey-de-Leon-Teasing-is-not-bad-Cheating-is-on-TV |language=Tagalog |quote="Regular columnist ng Manila Bulletin si Joey at nang mabasa namin kaninang umaga ang kanyang column na 'De Leon's Den...' (Joey de Leon is a regular columnist of Manila Bulletin and when we read his latest article on 'De Leon's Den...')"... "Kaya, walang pikunan. Paliwanagan lang. Biruan lang. Teasing is not bad. Cheating is... on TV! (So there's no need to be touchy.  It's all just about explaining and poking fun on the issue.  Teasing is not bad.  Cheating is... on TV!)"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the August 29, 2007 episode of ''Wowowee'', Willie Revillame emotionally, but obviously no shed of tears, addressed Joey de Leon and insisted that he had not been cheating.&lt;ref name="gma-explain"/&gt; Joey retaliated Willie's statement the following day in a 15-minute-long [[monologue]] on ''Eat Bulaga!'' by advising his rival to "explain before you complain"; not mentioning Willie or ''Wowowee'' directly at all during the speech, but clearly directing the speech at him.&lt;ref name="gma-explain"/&gt; He also accused Willie of resorting to personal attacks in order to dodge questions about the incident.&lt;ref name="gma-explain"/&gt;  Joey also clarified in the address that he was not directly accusing Willie or the ''Wowowee'' staff of cheating; noting that the only information he got about the incident was through video postings on [[YouTube]] and [[text message]]s he had received about the incident.&lt;ref name="gma-explain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/58382/Joey-tells-Willie-Explain-before-you-complain|title=Joey tells Willie: Explain before you Complain|date=August 30, 2007|publisher=GMA News and Public Affairs|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2007, [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Mar Roxas]], chair of the Senate trade and commerce committee, announced that he would propose an inquiry into this alleged game rigging after getting information from the [[Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) and concerned parties. Joey had jokingly called upon lawmakers to stop probing the [[Hello Garci scandal]], and to start probing the "Hello Pappy" scandal during his speech the previous day.&lt;ref name="gma830"&gt;{{cite news | title=Roxas seeks probe on 'Hello, Pappy' game show 'scam' | publisher = GMA News and Current Affairs | date = 30 August 2007 | accessdate=2007-11-03 |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/58395/Roxas-seeks-probe-on-Hello-Pappy-game-show-scam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also later discontinued from the show.&lt;ref name="gma-wrapup"/&gt;

The [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] also became increasingly concerned about the scandal due to the escalating on-air feuds between Willie and Joey{{emdash}}asking Willie to make an on-air apology about his remarks towards Joey on the September 4 episode of ''Wowowee''.&lt;ref name="pep-sorry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/14698/Joey-de-Leon-to-Willie-Revillame:-Sorry,-hindi-ko-matatanggap-ang-sorry-mo./1/1|title=Joey de Leon to Willie Revillame: "Sorry, hindi ko matatanggap ang sorry mo."|last=Ancheta|first=Michael|date=September 9, 2007|publisher=PEP.ph|language=English, Tagalog|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the incident, network Vice President Bong Osorio stated that a fixed "design flaw" was the cause of the incident, further remarking that "[we] have no intention to manipulate results, but rather to add excitement and suspense."&lt;ref name="pep-designflaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/14588/ABS-CBN-explains-Hello-Pappy-incident-as-a-design-flaw|title=ABS-CBN explains Hello Pappy incident as a design flaw|last=Lim|first=Candice|date=August 30, 2007|publisher=PEP.ph|accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osorio also stated that a game shows can experience "glitches" during development, and re-enforced that all game shows broadcast by the network were operated in accordance with ABS-CBN's corporate values of honesty and integrity.&lt;ref name="pep-designflaw"/&gt;

===DTI probe, administrative fine and appeal===
On October 13, 2008, the DTI ordered ABS-CBN to pay an administrative fine of ₱290,000, ruling that the ''Wilyonaryo'' segment violated the Consumers Act of the Philippines, ruling that “A reasonable assessment of the existing game mechanics and procedures reveals that the game show segment allowed for reasonable likelihood of error and provided the host and organizers significant latitude in controlling the outcome of the contest.”&lt;ref name="gma-wrapup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/126787/DTI-wraps-up-Wowowee-prob|title=DTI wraps up Wowowee probe|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=GMA News and Current Affairs|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sunstar-violation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2008/10/14/dti.wowowee.s.wilyonaryo.has.violation.(1.34.p.m.).html |title=DTI: Wowowee’s Wilyonaryo has violation |date=October 14, 2008 |publisher=SunStar Network |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226171556/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2008/10/14/dti.wowowee.s.wilyonaryo.has.violation.%281.34.p.m.%29.html |archivedate=February 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ABS-CBN later released a statement that they would file an appeal on the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/127047/PEP-ABS-CBN-appeals-DTIs-Wowowee-decision|title=PEP: ABS-CBN appeals DTI's Wowowee decision|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=GMA News and Current Affairs|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''heteroglossia''''' describes the coexistence of distinct [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] within a single "[[Language#Linguistic diversity|language]]" (in Greek: ''hetero-'' "different" and ''glōssa'' "tongue, language"). In this way the term translates the [[Russian language|Russian]] разноречие [''raznorechie''], which was introduced by the Russian linguist [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] in his 1934 paper ''Слово в романе'' [Slovo v romane], published in [[English language|English]] as "Discourse in the Novel."

Bakhtin argues that the power of the novel originates in the coexistence of, and conflict between, different types of speech: the speech of characters, the speech of narrators, and even the speech of the author. He defines heteroglossia as "another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way"(1934). Bakhtin identifies the direct narrative of the author, rather than dialogue between characters, as the primary location of this conflict.

==Languages as points of view==
Bakhtin viewed the modern [[novel]] as a literary form best suited for the exploitation of heteroglossia, in direct contrast to epic [[poetry]] (and, in a lesser degree, poetry in general). The linguistic energy of the novel was seen in its expression of the conflict between voices through their description to different elements in the novel's discourse.

Any language, in Bakhtin's view, stratifies into many voices: "social dialects, characteristic group behaviour, professional jargons, generic languages, languages of generations and age groups, tendentious languages, languages of the authorities, of various circles and of passing fashions".  This diversity of voice is, Bakhtin asserts, the defining characteristic of the novel as a genre.

Traditional stylistics, like epic poetry, do not share the trait of heteroglossia. In Bakhtin's words, "poetry depersonalizes 'days' in language, while prose, as we shall see, often deliberately intensifies difference between them..."

Extending his argument, Bakhtin proposes that all languages represent a distinct point of view on the world, characterized by its own meaning and values. In this view, language is "shot through with intentions and accents" (1981: 324), and thus there are no neutral words. Even the most unremarkable statement possesses a taste, whether of a profession, a party, a generation, a place or a time. To Bakhtin, words do not exist until they are spoken, and that moment they are printed with the signature of the speaker.

Bakhtin identifies the act of speech, or of writing, as a literary-verbal performance, one that requires speakers or authors to take a position, even if only by choosing the dialect in which they will speak. Separate languages are often identified with separate circumstances. Bakhtin gives an example of an illiterate peasant, who speaks [[Church Slavonic]] to [[God]], speaks to his family in their own peculiar dialect, sings songs in yet a third, and attempts to emulate officious high-class dialect when he dictates petitions to the local government. The prose writer, Bakhtin argues, must welcome and incorporate these many languages into his work.

==The hybrid utterance==

The hybrid utterance, as defined by Bakhtin, is a passage that employs only a single speaker—the author, for example—but one or more kinds of speech. The juxtaposition of the two different speeches brings with it a contradiction and conflict in belief systems.

In examination of the English comic novel, particularly the works of [[Charles Dickens]], Bakhtin identifies examples of his argument. Dickens parodies both the 'common tongue' and the language of Parliament or high-class banquets, using concealed languages to create humor. In one passage, Dickens shifts from his authorial narrative voice into a formalized, almost epic tone while describing the work of an unremarkable bureaucrat; his intent is to parody the self-importance and vainglory of the bureaucrat's position. The use of concealed speech, without formal markers of a speaker change, is what allows the parody to work. It is, in Bakhtin's parlance, a hybrid utterance. In this instance the conflict is between the factual narrative and the biting hyperbole of the new, epic/formalistic tone.

Bakhtin goes on to discuss the interconnectedness of conversation. Even a simple dialogue, in his view, is full of quotations and references, often to a general "everyone says" or "I heard that.." Opinion and information are transmitted by way of reference to an indefinite, general source. By way of these references, humans selectively assimilate the discourse of others and make it their own.

Bakhtin identifies a specific type of discourse, the "authoritative discourse," which demands to be assimilated by the reader or listener; examples might be religious dogma, or scientific theory, or a popular book. This type of discourse is viewed as past, finished, hierarchically superior, and therefore demands "unconditional allegiance" rather than accepting interpretation. Because of this, Bakhtin states that authoritative discourse plays an insignificant role in the novel. Because it is not open to interpretation, it cannot enter into hybrid utterance.

Bakhtin concludes by arguing that the role of the novel is to draw the authoritative into question, and to allow what was once considered certain to be debated and open to interpretation. In effect, novels not only function through heteroglossia, but must promote it; to do otherwise is an artistic failure.

==Influence of the concept==
Bakhtin's view of heteroglossia has been often employed in the context of the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] critique of the perceived teleological and authoritarian character of modernist art and culture. In particular, the latter's strong disdain for popular forms of art and literature—archetypically expressed in [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]]'s analysis of the [[culture industry]]—has been criticised as a proponent of ''monoglossia''; practitioners of [[cultural studies]] have used Bakhtin's conceptual framework to theorise the critical reappropriation of mass-produced entertainment forms by the public.

'''Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children''' is a migrant children's detention center in [[Homestead, Florida]]. The center is currently being run by [[Comprehensive Health Services, Inc.]] (CHSi).

An '''inverted sentence''' is a sentence in a normally [[Subject-verb-object|subject-first language]] in which the predicate (verb) comes before the subject (noun)..

:''Down the street '''lived the man and his wife''' without anyone suspecting that they were really spies for a foreign power.''
Because there is [[Intransitive verb|no object following the verb]], the noun phrase after the verb "lived" can be decoded as subject without any problem.
In English, such an inversion often introduces [[do-support]].

==Examples==
[[Inversion (linguistics)|Inversion]] after initial negatives:
*Never again '''will you do''' that.
*Never a day '''had she missed''' her lessons.
*Rarely '''have I eaten''' better food.
*Hardly ever '''does he come''' to class on time.
*Not until a frog develops lungs '''does it leave''' the water and live on the land.
*Not only '''was [[Mary Ann Shadd]]''' famous for helping escaped slaves, but she was also the first African Canadian woman to establish a newspaper.
*Hardly ever '''have [[English_grammar#There_as_pronoun|there]] been so many choices''' for young people entering the work force as there are today.
*'''Mourn''' them '''do not'''. '''Miss''' them '''do not'''.  &lt;!-- This is Yoda-speak, not grammatical English; does it belong? --&gt;

Inversion after other structures:
*Up '''jumped the frog'''.
*So high '''is [[Mount Everest]]''' that climbers can take only a couple of steps per minute as they near the summit.
*Off the coast of North Carolina '''lie the Barrier Islands''', a popular summer resort area.
*Only after the earthquake had taken place '''did the lack of safety measures become''' obvious.

'''Legal psychology''' involves [[empirical]], [[psychology|psychological]] research of the law, legal institutions, and people who come into contact with the law. Legal psychologists typically take basic social and cognitive principles and apply them to issues in the legal system such as [[eyewitness memory]], jury decision-making, investigations, and interviewing. The term "legal psychology" has only recently come into usage, primarily as a way to differentiate the [[experimental research|experimental]] focus of legal psychology from the [[clinical psychology|clinically]]-oriented [[forensic psychology]].

Together, legal psychology and forensic psychology form the field more generally recognized as "psychology and law". Following earlier efforts by psychologists to address legal issues, psychology and law became a field of study in the 1960s as part of an effort to enhance justice, though that originating concern has lessened over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis R. Fox]] (1999). [http://dennisfox.net/papers/injustice.html Psycholegal Scholarship's Contribution to False Consciousness About Injustice.]''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 23,'' 9-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary [[American Psychological Association]]'s Division 41, the [[American Psychology-Law Society]], is active with the goal of promoting the contributions of [[psychology]] to the understanding of [[law]] and [[legal system]]s through [[research]], as well as providing education to psychologists in legal issues and providing  education to legal personnel on psychological issues. Further, its mandate is to  inform the psychological and legal communities and the public at large  of current research, educational, and service in the area of psychology and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ap-ls.org/
|title=American Psychology and the Law Society
|accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar societies in Britain and Europe.

==Areas of research==
Generally speaking, any research that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts could be considered legal psychology (although research involving [[clinical psychology]], e.g., mental illness, [[competency evaluation (law)|competency]], [[insanity defense]], [[offender profiling]], etc., is typically categorized as [[forensic psychology]], and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to [[eyewitness testimony]] and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research and move on to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Saks]] (1986). The Law Does Not Live on Eyewitness Testimony Alone. ''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 10'', 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several legal psychology [[academic journal|journal]]s, including ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', ''[[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]]'', ''Psychology, Crime, and Law'', and ''Journal of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law'' that focus on general topics of [[criminology]], and the [[criminal justice system]]. In addition, research by legal psychologists is regularly published in more general journals that cover both basic and applied research areas.

In March 1893 J. McKeen Cattell posted questions to fifty-six of his students at Columbia University, the questions he asked his students were comparable to those asked in a court of justice. What he found was that it was reasonable to conclude eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable. His students were all sure they were mostly correct, even when they weren’t, and some were hesitant when they were in fact correct.  He could not figure out specifically why each student had inaccurate testimonies. Cattell suggested that “an unscrupulous attorney” could discredit a witness who is being truthful by asking “cunningly selected questions”. Although a jury, or the judge, should know how normal errors are in eyewitness testimonies given different conditions. However, even Cattell was shocked by the level of incorrectness displayed by his students. Cattell’s research has been depicted as the foundation of forensic psychology in the United States. His research is still widely considered a prevailing research interest in legal psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been thought that in America psychologists have been used as expert witnesses in court testimonies since the early 1920’s. Consultation within civil courts was most common, during this time criminal courts rarely consulted with psychologists. Psychologists were not considered medical experts, those who were like, physicians and psychiatrists, in the past were the ones consulted for criminal testimonies. This could be because in criminal cases, the defendant's mental state almost never  mattered "As a general rule, only medical men — that is, persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine — can testify as experts on the question of insanity; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and education==
Legal psychologists typically hold a [[PhD]] in some area of psychology (e.g., [[clinical psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], etc.), and apply their knowledge of that field to the law. Although formal legal training (such as a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] or Master of Legal Studies degree) can be beneficial, most legal psychologists hold only the PhD. In fact, some argue{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} that specialized legal training dilutes the psychological empiricism of the researcher. For instance, to understand how eyewitness memory "works", a psychologist should be concerned with memory processes as a whole, instead of only the aspects relevant to the law (e.g., lineups, accuracy of testimony).

A growing number of universities offer specialized training in legal psychology as either a standalone [[PhD]] program or a joint [[Juris Doctor|JD]]/PhD program. A list of American universities that offer graduate training in legal psychology can be found [http://ap-ls.org/education/GraduatePrograms.php here] on the website of the [http://www.ap-ls.org/ American Psychology-Law Society].

==Roles of a legal psychologist==
===Academics and research===
Many legal psychologists work as [[professors]] in university psychology departments, criminal justice departments or law schools. Like other professors, legal psychologists generally conduct and publish empirical research, teach various classes, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Many legal psychologists also conduct research in a more general area of psychology (e.g., social, clinical, cognitive) with only a tangential legal focus. Those legal psychologists who work in law schools almost always hold a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] in addition to a [[PhD]]

===Expert witnesses===
{{Main|Expert witness}}
Psychologists specifically trained in legal issues, as well as those with no formal training, are often called by legal parties to testify as expert witnesses. In criminal trials, an expert witness may be called to testify about eyewitness memory, [[mistaken identity]], competence to stand trial, the propensity of a [[death-qualified jury]] to also be "pro-guilt", etc. Psychologists who focus on clinical issues often testify specifically about a defendant's competence, intelligence, etc. More general testimony about perceptual issues (e.g., adequacy of police sirens) may also come up in trial.

Experts, particularly psychology experts, are often accused of being "hired guns" or "stating the obvious".{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Eyewitness memory experts, such as [[Elizabeth Loftus]], are often discounted by judges and lawyers with no empirical training because their research utilizes undergraduate students and "unrealistic" scenarios.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} If both sides have psychological witnesses, jurors may have the daunting task of assessing difficult scientific information.

===Policy making and legislative guidance===
Psychologists employed at public policy centers may attempt to influence legislative policy or may be called upon by state (or national) lawmakers to address some policy issue through empirical research. A psychologist working in public policy might suggest laws or help to evaluate a new legal practice (e.g., eyewitness lineups).&lt;ref&gt;Examples of legal psychologists in these positions can be found at the [[American Bar Foundation]] ([http://www.abf-sociolegal.org/ Website]) and [[Federal Judicial Center]] ([http://www.fjc.gov Website]), among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advisory roles===
Legal psychologists may hold advisory roles in court systems. They may advise legal decision makers, particularly judges, on psychological findings pertaining to issues in a case. The psychologist who acts as a court adviser provides similar input to one acting as an expert witness, but acts out of the domain of an [[adversarial system]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm Court Appointed Scientific Expert Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229052858/http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm |date=2008-02-29 }}, [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amicus briefs===
Psychologists can provide an [[amicus brief]] to the court. The [[American Psychological Association]] has provided briefs concerning mental illness, retardation and other factors. The amicus brief usually contains an opinion backed by scientific citations and statistics. The impact of an amicus brief by a psychological association is questionable. For instance, Justice Powell&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0435_0223_ZC2.html Ballew v. Georgia&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; once called a reliance on statistics "numerology" and discounted results of several empirical studies. Judges who have no formal scientific training also may critique experimental methods, and some feel that judges only cite an amicus brief when the brief supports the judge's personal beliefs.

===Trial consulting===
Some legal psychologists work in [[trial consulting]]. No special training nor certification is needed to be a trial consultant, though an advanced degree is generally welcomed by those who would hire the trial consultant. The American Society of Trial Consultants does have a code of ethics for members, but there are no legally binding ethical rules for consultants.&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the trial consulting process is provided by the [[American Society of Trial Consultants]], [http://www.astcweb.org/ ASTC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists who work in academics are hired as trial consultants when their expertise can be useful to a particular case. Other psychologists/consultants work for or with established trial consultant firms. The practice of law firms hiring "in-house" trial consultants is becoming more popular, but these consultants usually can also be used by the firms as practicing attorneys.

Trial consultants perform a variety of services for lawyers, such as picking jurors (usually relying on in-house or published statistical studies) or performing "mock trials" with focus groups. Trial consultants work on all stages of a case from helping to organize testimony, preparing witnesses to testify, [[scientific jury selection|picking juries]], and even arranging "shadow jurors" to watch the trial unfold and provide input on the trial. There is some debate on whether the work of a trial consultant is protected under attorney-client privilege, especially when the consultant is hired by a party in the case and not by an attorney.

Political dissidents are people who question and criticize state policy or the 'dominate narrative' which is broadcast by mainstream media and accepted by the majority of the population.

They are not necessarily the only or most important dissidents, but they become famous or semi-famous often through the stories told by themselves or by others.

[[File:Paul Fürst, Der Doctor Schnabel von Rom (Holländer version).png|thumb|Copper engraving of Doctor Schnabel [i.e. Dr. Beak] (a [[plague doctor]] in 17th-century Rome) with a satirical macaronic poem ("''Vos Creditis, als eine Fabel,'' / ''quod scribitur vom Doctor Schnabel''")]]

'''Macaronic language''' refers to text using a mixture of [[language]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/macaronic|title=Macaronic|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022203122/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/macaronic|archivedate=22 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly [[bilingual pun]]s or situations in which the languages are otherwise used in the same context (rather than simply discrete segments of a text being in different languages). The term can also denote [[hybrid word]]s, which are effectively "internally macaronic". A rough equivalent in spoken language is [[code-switching]], a term in [[linguistics]] referring to using more than one language or dialect within the same conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2012/04/12.html |title=Definition of Macaronic |publisher=dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419181212/http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2012/04/12.html |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macaronic Latin''' in particular is a jumbled [[jargon]] made up of [[vernacular]] words given [[Latin language|Latin]] endings, or for Latin words mixed with the vernacular in a [[pastiche]] (compare [[dog Latin]]).

The word ''[[wikt:Macaronic|macaronic]]'' comes from the [[New Latin]] ''macaronicus'' which is from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''maccarone'' ("dumpling", regarded as coarse peasant fare).  The term can have derogatory overtones, and is usually reserved for works where the mixing of languages has a humorous or [[satire|satirical]] intent or effect.  It is a matter of debate whether the term can be applied to mixed-language literature of a more serious nature and purpose.

==History==

===Mixed Latin-vernacular lyrics in Medieval Europe===
Texts that mixed [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[vernacular language]] apparently arose throughout Europe at the end of the [[Middle Ages]]—a time when Latin was still the working language of scholars, clerics and university students, but was losing ground to vernacular among poets, [[minstrel]]s and storytellers.

An early example is from 1130, in the [[Gospel book]] of [[Munsterbilzen Abbey]].  The following sentence mixes late [[Old Dutch]] and Latin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Tesi samanunga was edele unde scona
et omnium virtutum pleniter plena
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translated: ''This community was noble and pure, and completely full of all virtues.''

The ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' (collected c.1230) contains several poems mixing Latin with Medieval German or French.  Another well-known example is the first stanza of the famous [[Carol (music)|carol]] ''[[In Dulci Jubilo]]'', whose original version (written around 1328) had Latin mixed with German, with a hint of [[Greek language|Greek]].  While some of those early works had a clear humorous intent, many use the language mix for lyrical effect.

Another early example is in the [[Middle English language|Middle English]] recitals ''[[Wakefield Mystery Plays|The Towneley Plays]]'' (c.1460).  In ''[[The Talents (play)|The Talents]]'' (play 24), [[Pontius Pilate]] delivers a rhyming speech in mixed English and Latin.

A number of English political poems in the 14th century alternated (Middle) English and Latin lines, such as in MS Digby 196:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The taxe hath tened [ruined] vs alle,
      Probat hoc mors tot validorum
  The Kyng þerof had small
      fuit in manibus cupidorum.
  yt had ful hard hansell,
      dans causam fine dolorum;
  vengeaunce nedes most fall,
      propter peccata malorum
  ''(etc)''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several [[Anthem]]s also contain both Latin and English. In the case of 'Nolo mortem pecatoris' by [[Thomas Morley]], the Latin is used as a refrain:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Nolo mortem peccatoris; Haec sunt verba Salvatoris.
Father I am thine only Son, sent down from heav’n mankind to save.
Father, all things fulfilled and done according to thy will, I have.
Father, my will now all is this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
Father, behold my painful smart, taken for man on ev’ry side;
Ev'n from my birth to death most tart, no kind of pain I have denied,
but suffered all, and all for this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translated: "'I do not wish the death of the wicked'; These are the words of the Saviour." An allusion to John 3:17 and 2 Peter 3:9.

===Latin–Italian macaronic verse===
The term ''macaronic'' is believed to have originated in [[Padua]] in the late 15th century, apparently from ''maccarona'', a kind of pasta or [[dumpling]] eaten by peasants at that time.  (That is also the presumed origin of  ''[[maccheroni]]''.)&lt;ref name="linphil"&gt;{{cite web |author=Fran Hamilton |url=http://porticobooks.com/edu/archive/issue55.htm |title=LinguaPhile online magazine, September 2007 |publisher=Porticobooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210181651/http://porticobooks.com/edu/archive/issue55.htm |archivedate=10 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its association with the genre comes from the ''[[Macaronea]]'', a comical poem by [[Tifi Odasi]] in mixed Latin and Italian, published in 1488 or 1489.  Another example of the genre is ''[[Tosontea]]'' by [[Corrado of Padua]], which was published at about the same time as Tifi's ''Macaronea''.

Tifi and his contemporaries clearly intended to [[satire|satirize]] the broken Latin used by many doctors, scholars and bureaucrats of their time.  While this "macaronic Latin" (''macaronica verba'') could be due to ignorance or carelessness, it could also be the result of its speakers trying to make themselves understood by the vulgar folk without resorting to their speech.&lt;ref name="macver"&gt;{{cite web |author=Giorgio Bernardi Perini |title=Macaronica Verba.

An important and unusual example of mixed-language text is the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of [[Francesco Colonna]] (1499), which was basically written using Italian syntax and morphology, but using a made-up vocabulary based on roots from Latin, [[Greek (language)|Greek]], and occasionally others.  However, while the ''Hypnerotomachia'' is contemporary with Tifi's ''Macaronea'', its mixed language is not used for plain humor, but rather as an aesthetic device to underscore the fantastic but refined nature of the book.

Tifi's ''Macaronea'' was a popular success, and the writing of [[humour|humorous]] texts in macaronic Latin became a fad in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in Italian, but also in many other European languages. An important Italian example was ''[[Baldo (Teofilo Folengo book)|Baldo]]'' by [[Teofilo Folengo]], who described his own verses as "a gross, rude, and rustic mixture of flour, cheese, and butter".&lt;ref name="folenmac"&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, Oxford University Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caten"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06124a.htm |title=Teofilo Folengo in The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1909-09-01 |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022034217/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06124a.htm |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other mixed-language lyrics===
Macaronic verse is especially common in cultures with widespread [[bilingualism]] or [[language contact]], such as Ireland before the middle of the nineteenth century.  Macaronic traditional songs such as ''[[Siúil A Rúin]]'' are quite common in Ireland.  In Scotland, macaronic songs have been popular among [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] immigrants to [[Glasgow]], using English and [[Scottish Gaelic]] as a device to express the alien nature of the anglophone environment.  An example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/primary/tunein/mixer/lyrics.shtml?lyrics=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425195304/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/primary/tunein/mixer/lyrics.shtml?lyrics=3 |archivedate=25 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I came down to Glasgow first,&lt;br /&gt;

I was like a man adrift,&lt;br /&gt;

Folk and popular music of the [[Andes]] frequently alternates between Spanish and the given [[South American]] language of its region of origin.

Some [[Persian poetry|Classical Persian poems]] were written with alternating [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] verses or hemistichs, most famously by [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sadi-sirazi|title=SAʿDI – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117020202/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sadi-sirazi|archivedate=17 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hafez Shirazi|Hafez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hafez-iii|title=HAFEZ   iii.

Macaronic verse was also common in [[medieval]] [[India]], where the influence of the Muslim rulers led to poems being written in alternating indigenous [[Hindi]] and the [[Persian language]].  This style was used by the famous poet [[Amir Khusro]] and played a major role in the rise of the [[Urdu]] or [[Hindustani language]].

The [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] song "Caress Me Down" alternates between English and Spanish lyrics, at some points between verses, at others between lines within a verse, and occasionally between phrases within a line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/caress-me-down-lyrics-sublime.html|title=Sublime - Caress Me Down Lyrics - MetroLyrics|author=|date=|website=www.metrolyrics.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426200541/http://www.metrolyrics.com/caress-me-down-lyrics-sublime.html|archivedate=26 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintentional macaronic language===
{{main|Homophonic translation}}

Occasionally language is unintentionally macaronic. One particularly famed piece of schoolyard Greek in France is [[Xenophon]]'s line "they did not take the city; but in fact they had no hope of taking it" ({{lang|grc|οὐκ ἔλαβον πόλιν· άλλα γὰρ ἐλπὶς ἔφη κακά}}, ''ouk élabon pólin; álla gàr elpìs éphē kaká''). [[Mondegreen|Read]] [[Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching#France|in the French manner]], this becomes "Où qu'est la bonne Pauline? A la gare. Elle pisse et fait caca." ("Where is Pauline the maid? At the [railway] station. She's pissing and taking a shit.")&lt;ref&gt;Arbre d'Or eBooks. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172950/http://www.arbredor.com/vmchk/pluton-ciel-que-janus-proserpine Pluton ciel que Janus Proserpine...]". {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Genette, Gérard &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbYzNp94C9oC&amp;pg=PA41 ''Palimpsests'', {{nowrap|p. 41}}].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English literature]], the untranslated line makes an appearance in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;FinnegansWiki. "[http://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Ouk_elabon_polin Ouk elabon polin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711003628/http://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Ouk_elabon_polin |date=11 July 2011 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern macaronic literature==

===Prose===
Macaronic text is still used by modern Italian authors, e.g. by [[Carlo Emilio Gadda]] and [[Beppe Fenoglio]].  Other examples are provided by the character Salvatore in [[Umberto Eco]]'s  ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', and the peasant hero of his ''[[Baudolino]]''.  [[Dario Fo]]'s ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' ("''Comic Mystery Play''") features [[grammelot]] sketches using language with macaronic elements.

The 2001 novel ''[[The Last Samurai (novel)|The Last Samurai]]'' by [[Helen DeWitt]]&lt;ref name="lastsam"&gt;DeWitt, Helen. ''The Last Samurai'' (Chatto and Windus, 2000: {{ISBN|0-7011-6956-7}}; Vintage, 2001: {{ISBN|0-09-928462-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; includes portions of Japanese, [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]], and [[Inuktitut]], although the reader is not expected to understand the passages that are not in English.

Macaronic games are used by the literary group [[Oulipo]] in the form of interlinguistic [[homophonic transformation]]: replacing
a known phrase with homophones from another language.  The archetypal example is by [[François Le Lionnais]], who transformed [[John Keats]]' "A thing of beauty is a joy forever" into "Un singe de beauté est un jouet pour l'hiver": 'A monkey of beauty is a toy for the winter'.&lt;ref name="genette"&gt;{{cite book

|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbYzNp94C9oC
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the book ''[[Mots d'Heures]]''.

Macaronisms figure prominently in ''[[The Trilogy]]'' by the [[Poland|Polish]] novelist [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], and are one of the major compositional principles for James Joyce's novel ''Finnegans Wake''.

===Poetry===
Two well-known examples of non-humorous macaronic verse are [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Maid of Athens, ere we part (George Byron)|Maid of Athens, ere we part]]'' (1810, in English with a [[Greek language|Greek]] refrain);&lt;ref name="maidat"&gt;{{cite web |first=George |last=Byron |url=http://readytogoebooks.com/MOA-P43.htm |title=Maid of Athens |publisher=readytogoebooks.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070133/http://readytogoebooks.com/MOA-P43.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Lucas de Pearsall|Pearsall]]'s translation of the carol ''In Dulci Jubilo'' (1837, in mixed English and Latin verse).

An example of modern humorous macaronic verse is the anonymous English/Latin poem ''[[Carmen Possum]]'' ("''The Opossum's Song''"), which is sometimes used as a teaching and motivational aid in elementary Latin language classes.  Other similar examples are ''[[The Motor Bus]]'' by [[A. D. Godley]], and the anonymous ''[[Up I arose (poem)|Up I arose in verno tempore]]''.

Recent examples are the ''mużajki'' or 'mosaics' (2007) of [[Malta|Maltese]] poet [[Antoine Cassar]]&lt;ref name="mosaics"&gt;Grech, Marija. [http://www.alwatan.com.kw/Default.aspx?MgDid=537975&amp;pageId=327 "Mosaics: A symphony of multilingual poetry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328134017/http://www.alwatan.com.kw/Default.aspx?MgDid=537975&amp;pageId=327 |date=28 March 2009 }}, ''The Daily Star'' (Kuwait), 25 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; mixing English, Spanish, [[Maltese language|Maltese]], Italian, and French; works of Italian writer [[Guido Monte]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/genesis-creation/ |title=see for ex. |publisher=Wordswithoutborders.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092233/http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/genesis-creation/ |archivedate=12 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late poetry of Ivan Blatný combining Czech with English.&lt;ref name="Blatny"&gt;Wheatley, David. [http://www.cprw.com/Wheatley/blatny.htm "The Homeless Tongue: Ivan Blatný"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081150/http://www.cprw.com/Wheatley/blatny.htm |date=5 June 2011 }}. ''Contemporary Poetry Review'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Brian P. Cleary]]'s "What Can I C'est?" makes use of macaronic verse, as do other poems in his book "Rainbow Soup: Adventures in Poetry":

&lt;blockquote&gt;My auntie Michelle is big in the BON&lt;br /&gt;
(As well as the hip and the thigh).&lt;br /&gt;
And when she exhales, OUI haul out our sails&lt;br /&gt;
And ride on the wind of VERSAILLES.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A whole body of comic verse exists created by John O'Mill, pseudonym of [[John O'Mill|Johan van der Meulen]], a teacher of English at the Rijks HBS (State Grammar School), [[Breda]], the [[Netherlands]].  These are in a mixture of English and Dutch, often playing on common mistakes made when translating from the latter to the former.

===Theatre===
The finale of act 1 of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy Opera]] [[Iolanthe]] has several instances of humorous macaronic verse. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stagebeauty.net/plays/th-iola1.html|title=W.S.Gilbert - Iolanthe, ACT I|author=|date=|website=www.stagebeauty.net|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425195304/http://www.stagebeauty.net/plays/th-iola1.html|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the three Lords mix Italian and Latin phrases into their discussion of Iolanthe's age:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Lord Mountararat:''' This gentleman is seen, / With a maid of seventeen, / A-taking of his ''dolce far niente''...&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lord Chancellor:''' Recollect yourself, I pray, / And be careful what you say- / As the ancient Romans said, ''festina lente''...&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lord Tolloller:''' I have often had a use / For a thorough-bred excuse / Of a sudden (which is English for ''repente'')...&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lord Mountararat:''' Now, listen, pray to me, / For this paradox will be / Carried, nobody at all ''contradicente''...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then, the chorus of peers sing macaronic verse as they attempt to resist the fairies' powers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our lordly style you shall not quench with base ''canaille''! (That word is French.)&lt;br /&gt; 	 
Distinction ebbs before a herd of vulgar ''plebs''! (A Latin word.)&lt;br /&gt;
Twould fill with joy and madness stark the ''oι πoλλoί''! (A Greek remark.)&lt;br /&gt; 	 
One Latin word, one Greek remark, and one that's French.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Film===
'Macaronisms' are frequently used in films, especially comedies.  In [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] comedy ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', the title character  speaks English mixed with a parody of German (e.g. "Cheese-und-cracken").  This was also used by Benzino Napaloni, the parody character of [[Benito Mussolini]], using Italian foods (such as [[salami]] and [[ravioli]]) as insults.

Other movies featuring macaronic language are the Italian historical comedies ''[[L'armata Brancaleone]]'' and ''[[Brancaleone alle crociate]]'' (d. [[Mario Monicelli]]), which mix modern and medieval Italian as well as Latin (sometimes in rhyme, and sometimes with regional connotations, such as the [[Italo-Normans]] using words from modern [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]).

===Song===

Macaronic language appearing in popular songs include [[Dean Martin]]'s "[[That's Amore]]" (Italian and English), the [[Beatles]]’ "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]" (French and English), [[The Clash]]’s "[[Spanish Bombs]]" and [[José Feliciano]]’s "[[Feliz Navidad (song)|Feliz Navidad]]" (Spanish and English), the [[Talking Heads]] "[[Psycho Killer]]" (French and English), and [[The Weeknd]]'s [[Echoes of Silence|Montreal]] (French and English).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">'''Manuscriptology''' is another word for [[codicology]], namely the study of history and literature through the use of hand-written documents. 

The term is in use particularly among scholars of South Asian cultural history because many South Asian manuscripts are not [[Codex|codices]] in the strict sense of the word.  That is to say, South Asian manuscripts are typically written on unbound sheets of paper or palm leaves, in a landscape format.  [[Vellum]] or [[parchment]] - typical writing supports used in the European codex - are unknown in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/books/9783110225631/9783110225631.159/9783110225631.159.xml|title=Indian Manuscripts|last=Wujastyk|first=Dominik|language=en|doi=10.1515/9783110225631.159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are exceptions.  The codex format is used for [https://archive.org/stream/MokshopayaSharadaManuscript6/Mokshopaya_Sharada%20Manuscript-6#page/n0/mode/1up manuscripts in Kashmir, for example], where the concept of the manuscript book was influenced from European models transmitted by Islamic culture.

The '''mean center of the United States population''' is determined by the [[United States Census Bureau]] from the results of each national census. The Bureau defines it as follows:
{{"|The concept of the center of population as used by the U.S. Census Bureau is that of a balance point. The center of population is the point at which an imaginary, weightless, rigid, and flat (no elevation effects) surface representation of the 50 states (or 48 conterminous states for calculations made prior to 1960) and the District of Columbia would balance if weights of identical size were placed on it so that each weight represented the location on one person. More specifically, this calculation is called the mean center of population.&lt;ref name=calculation&gt;[http://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/cenpop2010/COP2010_documentation.pdf Centers of population computation], a [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] publication, issued March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After moving roughly {{convert|600|miles|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[Boxing the compass|west by south]] during the 19th century, the shift in the [[Center_of_population|mean center of population]] during the 20th century was less pronounced, moving {{convert|324|miles|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} west and {{convert|101|miles|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} south. Nearly 79% of the overall southerly movement happened between 1950 and 2000.

[[File:Puss-in-Boots-1695.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1||A page from a late 17th-century handwritten and illustrated version of [[Charles Perrault]]'s ''Contes de ma mère l'Oye'',  depicting [[Puss in Boots]]]]

The figure of '''Mother Goose''' is the imaginary author of a collection of French [[fairy tale]]s and later of English [[nursery rhyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Dictionary for Students'' Macmillan, Pan Ltd. (1981), page 663. Retrieved 2010-7-15.&lt;/ref&gt; As a character, she appeared in a song, the first stanza of which often functions now as a nursery rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, item 364 in [[Peter and Iona Opie]], ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, was  dependent on a Christmas [[pantomime]], a successor to which is still performed in the United Kingdom. 
 
The term's appearance in English dates back to the early 18th century, when [[Charles Perrault]]’s fairy tale collection, ''Contes de ma Mère l'Oye'', was first translated into English as ''Tales of My Mother Goose''.  Later a compilation of English nursery rhymes, titled ''Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle'', helped perpetuate the name both in Britain and the United States.

==The character==
Mother Goose's name was identified with English collections of stories and nursery rhymes popularised in the 17th century. English readers would already have been familiar with [[Old Mother Hubbard|Mother Hubbard]], a stock figure when [[Edmund Spenser]] published the satire [[Mother Hubberd's Tale]] in 1590, as well as with similar fairy tales told by "Mother Bunch" (the pseudonym of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]]) in the 1690s.&lt;ref&gt;Ryoji Tsurumi, "The Development of Mother Goose in Britain in the Nineteenth Century" ''Folklore'' '''101'''.1 (1990:28–35) p. 330 instances these, as well as the "Mother Carey" of sailor lore— "Mother Carey's chicken" being the [[European storm-petrel]]— and the Tudor period prophetess "[[Mother Shipton]]".&lt;/ref&gt;  An early mention appears in an aside in a versified French chronicle of weekly events, [[Jean Loret]]'s ''La Muse Historique'', collected in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shahed |first=Syed Mohammad |title=A Common Nomenclature for Traditional Rhymes |jstor=1178946 |journal=Asian Folklore Studies |volume=54 |number=2 |date=1995 |pages=307–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remark, ''comme un conte de la Mère Oye''&lt;!--Oye in original--&gt; ("like a Mother Goose story") shows that the term was readily understood.   Additional 17th-century Mother Goose/Mere l'Oye references appear in French literature in the 1620s and 1630s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux46AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Les+satyres+de+Saint-Regnier&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lu0gTevnJIP98AaO5fjdDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Les satyres de Saint-Regnier – ...

Alternatively, the original Mother Goose lived in Boston in the 1660s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[ Displaying Abstract ] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03EFDC163AE033A25753C2A9669D94679FD7CF |title=MOTHER GOOSE. - Article - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=20 October 1886 |access-date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly as the second wife of Isaac Goose (alternatively named Vergoose or Vertigoose), who brought to the marriage six children of her own to add to Isaac's ten.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Susan. ''Literary Trail of Greater Boston''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 23. {{ISBN|0-618-05013-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Isaac died, Elizabeth went to live with her eldest daughter, who had married Thomas Fleet, a publisher who lived on Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street). According to Early, "Mother Goose" used to sing songs and ditties to her grandchildren all day, and other children swarmed to hear them. Finally, her son-in-law gathered her jingles together and printed them, though no evidence of such prints has been found.

[[Iona and Peter Opie]], leading authorities on nursery lore, give no credence to either the Elwes-Thomas or the Boston suppositions. It is generally accepted that the term does not refer to any particular person.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, Oxford University Press 1997; see the section "Mother Goose in America", pp.36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perrault's ''Tales of My Mother Goose''==
{{Main|Tales of Mother Goose}}
[[File:Houghton FC6.P4262.Eg729s - Perrault, frontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|Frontispiece from the only known copy of the first English translation, 1729]]
[[Charles Perrault]], one of the initiators of the literary [[fairy tale]] genre, published a collection of such tales in 1695 called ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé|Histoires ou contes du temps passés, avec des moralités]]'' under the name of his son, which became better known under its subtitle of ''Contes de ma mère l'Oye'' or ''Tales of My Mother Goose''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motifs: An Introduction to French|last=Jansma|first=Kimberly|last2=Kassen|first2=Margaret|publisher=Thomson Higher Education|year=2007|isbn=1413028101|location=Boston, MA|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perrault's publication marks the first authenticated starting-point for Mother Goose stories.

In 1729, an English translation appeared of Perrault's collection, [[Robert Samber]]'s ''Histories or Tales of Past Times, Told by Mother Goose'',&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted, Garland Publishing Co., 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'', ''[[Puss in Boots]]'', ''[[Cinderella]]'', and other Perrault tales to English-speaking audiences. The first public appearance of the Mother Goose stories in the America was in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where printer Isaiah Thomas reprinted Samber's volume under the same title in 1786.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Francis Potter, "Mother Goose", ''Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legends'' II (1950), p. 751f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Ravel]] ‘s ''[[Ma mère l'oye]]'' suite is dependent on Perrault’s collection. Starting with five pieces for piano duet in 1908-10, he then orchestrated them for a [[Mother Goose (ballet)|ballet]] in which two of the episodes were named after the fairy tale characters [[Sleeping Beauty]] and [[Tom Thumb]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cso.org/uploadedFiles/1_Tickets_and_Events/Program_Notes/041510_ProgramNotes_Ravel_MotherGoose.pdf Programme notes]&lt;/ref&gt; The ballet was first performed in Paris in 1912 and later that year in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;A performance of the ballet score on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w7RqLSDeFw You Tube]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Mother Goose's nursery rhymes==
[[John Newbery]] was once believed to have published a compilation of English nursery rhymes titled ''{{visible anchor|Mother Goose's Melody}}, or, Sonnets for the cradle''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/mothergoosesmelo00pridiala |title=Mother Goose's melody : Prideaux, William Francis, 1840–1914 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; some time in the 1760s, but the first edition was probably published in 1780 or 1781 by Thomas Carnan, one of Newbery's successors (and stepson). This edition was registered with the [[Stationers' Company]], London in 1780. However, no copy has been traced, and the earliest surviving edition is dated 1784.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Tattersfield in ''Mother Goose's melody ...'' (a facsimile of an edition of c. 1795, Oxford: Bodleian Library, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Mother Goose" has been associated in the English-speaking world with children's poetry ever since.&lt;ref name="IntrotoPoetry"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Driscoll |first1=Michael |last2=Hamilton |first2=Meredith |last3=Coons |first3=Marie |title=A Child's Introduction Poetry |publisher=Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publishers |year=2003 |page=10 |isbn=1-57912-282-5 |url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Childs-Introduction-to-Poetry/Michael-Driscoll/e/9781579122829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, [[John Bellenden Ker Gawler]] published a book (with a 2nd-volume sequel in 1840) deriving the origin of the ''Mother Goose'' rhymes as arising from political disaffection expressed in a largely invented [[Flemish]] language,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archive.org/stream/b29309670#page/n7/mode/2up/search/Horner+p.133 ''An Essay on the Archaiology of Popular English Phrases and Nursery Rhymes''], Southampton 1834&lt;/ref&gt; an effort described by the Opies as "the most extraordinary example of misdirected labour in the history of English letters".&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'', p.26&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mother Goose riding.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The opening verse of "Old Mother Goose and the Golden Egg", from an 1860s chapbook]]

==Pantomime== 
[[File:Danleno.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dan Leno]] as Mother Goose]]
In addition to being the purported author of nursery rhymes, Mother Goose is herself the title character in one recorded by the Opies, only the first verse of which figures in later editions of their book.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'', pp.373-4]&lt;/ref&gt; Titled  "Old Mother Goose and the Golden Egg", this verse prefaced a 15-stanza poem that rambled through a variety of adventures involving not only the egg but also Mother Goose's son Jack. There exists an illustrated chapbook omitting their opening stanza that dates from the 1820s&lt;ref&gt;[https://static.torontopubliclibrary.ca/da/pdfs/37131053604708d.pdf Available as a PDF] from Toronto Public Library&lt;/ref&gt; and another version was recorded by [[James Halliwell-Phillipps|J. O. Halliwell]] in his ''The Nursery Rhymes of England'' (1842).&lt;ref&gt;Google Books, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7CkEAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.32-4]&lt;/ref&gt; Other shorter versions were also recorded later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://is.muni.cz/th/d8wlo/Diploma_Thesis_Corpus.pdf Diploma thesis]&lt;/ref&gt; 

All of them, however, were dependent on a very successful [[pantomime]] first performed in 1806, and it is only by reference to its script that the unexplained gaps in the poem’s narration are made clear.&lt;ref&gt;Jeri Studebaker, ''Breaking the Mother Goose Code'', Moon Books 2015, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5P1JBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Chapter 6]&lt;/ref&gt; The pantomime was the work of [[Thomas John Dibdin]] and its title, ''Harlequin and Mother Goose, or The Golden Egg'', signals how it combines the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' tradition and other folk elements with fable - in this case ''[[The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858004934059;view=1up;seq=9 Script online]&lt;/ref&gt; The stage version became a vehicle for the clown [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played the part of Avaro, but there was also a shorter script for shadow pantomime which allowed special effects of a different kind.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YM9ZAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Special effects were needed since the folk elements in the story made a [[witch]]-figure of Mother Goose. In reference to this, and especially the opening stanza, illustrations of Mother Goose began depicting her as an old lady with a strong chin who wears a tall pointed hat and flies astride a goose.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=''The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature''|last=Cullinan|first=Bernice|last2=Person|first2=Diane|publisher=Continuum|year=2001|isbn=0826415164|location=New York|pages=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryoji Tsurumi has commented on the folk aspects of this figure in his monograph on the play.&lt;ref&gt;Ryoji Tsurumi (1990) "The Development of Mother Goose in Britain in the Nineteenth Century", ''Folklore'' 101:1, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0015587X.1990.9715776?journalCode=rfol20 pp.28-35]&lt;/ref&gt; In the first scene, the stage directions show her raising a storm and, for the very first time onstage, flying a gander&amp;nbsp;– and she later raises a ghost in a macabre churchyard scene.  These elements contrast with others from the [[harlequinade]] tradition in which the old miser Avaro transforms into Pantaloon, while the young lovers Colin and Colinette become Harlequin and Columbine.

A new Mother Goose pantomime was written for the comedian [[Dan Leno]] by J. Hickory Wood in 1902. This had a different story line in which the poor but happy Mother Goose is tempted with wealth by the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Radcliffe, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ULOADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=Leno+%22Mother+goose%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijnrLJ08LdAhXiJcAKHan0BJgQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Leno%20%22Mother%20goose%22&amp;f=false p.127-9 "Dan Leno, Dame of Drury Lane"] in ''Victorian Pantomime: A Collection of Critical Essays'', Palgrave Macmillan 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This was the ancestor of all the pantomimes of that title that followed, adaptations of which continue to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Billington’s Mother Goose review, ''The Guardian'', [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/12/mother-goose-review-roy-hudd-wiltons-music-hall-london 12 Dec. 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because nursery rhymes are usually referred to as Mother Goose songs in the US,&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; however, children’s entertainments in which a medley of nursery characters are introduced to sing their rhymes often introduced her name into American titles. Early 20th century examples of these include ''A dream of Mother Goose and other entertainments'' by J.C. Marchant and S.J. Mayhew (Boston, 1908);&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxdltb;view=1up;seq=7 Hathi Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Miss Muffet Lost and Found : a Mother Goose play'' by Katharine C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9301">The '''Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus''', or '''Oracc''', is an ongoing project designed to make the corpus of [[cuneiform]] compositions from the [[ancient Near East]] available online and accessible to users.  The project, created by Steve Tinney of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], incorporates a number of sub-projects, including online publications of [[lemma (morphology)|lemmatized]] texts in different genres, as well as extensive annotations and other tools for studying and learning about the ancient Near East.  The sub-projects are directed by individual scholars specializing in the relevant topic.  The overall project is led by a steering committee of Tinney, [[Eleanor Robson]] of [[Cambridge University]], and Niek Veldhuis of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/|title= The Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus|accessdate = 18 June 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Oracc currently includes several different kinds of projects.  Some gather and present historical information for studying certain areas of ancient Near Eastern life or scholarship, including projects designed to contextualize specific textual corpora ("portals").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao|title=State Archives of Assyria Online (SAAo)
|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others provide interfaces for searching corpora.  These usually incorporate full transliterations and translations of texts in a given corpus, and many offer supplementary material such as an introduction to the corpus, discussion of its historical context, and interpretive syntheses of its content.  A few other projects serve as research tools for Assyriological studies (dictionary, sign list).

The '''Zeiss-Planetarium''' in [[Jena]], [[Germany]] is the oldest continuously operating [[planetarium]] in the world. It was opened on July 18, 1926. The Zeiss-Planetarium is a projection planetarium. The planets and fixed stars are projected onto the inner surface of a white cupola.

The Zeiss-Planetarium is owned and operated by the [[Ernst-Abbe-Stiftung]].

It was engineered by German engineer [[Walther Bauersfeld]].

'''Seattle''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=GT Seattle AE.ogg|s|i|ˈ|æ|t|əl}} {{respell|see|AT|əl}}) is a [[port|seaport]] city on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. It  is the [[county seat|seat]] of [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. With an estimated 730,000 residents {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, Seattle is the largest city in both the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of [[North America]]. According to [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] data released in 2018, the [[Seattle metropolitan area]]’s population stands at 3.87 million, and ranks as the 15th largest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-just-one-of-5-big-metros-last-year-that-had-more-people-move-here-than-leave-census-data-show/|title=Seattle just one of 5 big metros last year that had more people move here than leave, census data show|last=Balk|first=Gene|date=March 26, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=May 7, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, it was the fastest-growing major city in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/fyi-guy/2014/05/22/census-seattle-is-the-fastest-growing-big-city-in-the-u-s/|title=Census: Seattle is the fastest-growing big city in the U.S.|last=Balk|first=Gene|series=FYI Guy|work=Seattle Times|date=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in the Top 5 in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-no-longer-americas-fastest-growing-big-city/|title=Seattle no longer America's fastest-growing big city|last=Balk|first=Gene|series=FYI Guy|work=Seattle Times|date=May 21, 2015 |access-date=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Seattle was again the fastest-growing major U.S. city, with a 3.1% annual growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-once-again-nations-fastest-growing-big-city-population-exceeds-700000/|title=Seattle once again nation’s fastest-growing big city; population exceeds 700,000|last=Balk|first=Gene|date=May 25, 2017|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle is the northernmost large city in the [[contiguous United States]].

The city is situated on an [[isthmus]] between [[Puget Sound]] (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and [[Lake Washington]], about {{convert|100|mi}} south of the [[Canada–United States border]]. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seaport Statistics|url=http://www.portseattle.org/About/Publications/Statistics/Seaport/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Port of Seattle|accessdate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seattle area was inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers.&lt;ref name=Discovery_Park&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/article/Feel-the-beat-of-history-in-the-park-and-concert-1251579.php|title=Feel the beat of history in the park and concert hall at two family-friendly events|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=October 4, 2007|author=Doree Armstrong|access-date=November 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur A. Denny]] and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the [[Denny Party]], arrived from Illinois via Portland, Oregon, on the schooner ''Exact'' at Alki Point on November 13, 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Craig Magnuson|date=July 20, 2014|url=http://www.craigmagnuson.com/exact.htm|title=In Search of the Schooner Exact|publisher=Andrew Craig Magnuson|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay and named "Seattle" in 1852, in honor of [[Chief Seattle|Chief Si'ahl]] of the local [[Duwamish people|Duwamish]] and [[Suquamish]] tribes.

[[Logging]] was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to [[Alaska]] during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. Growth after [[World War II]] was partially due to the local [[Boeing]] company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed into a technology center from the 1980s onwards with companies like [[Microsoft]] becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder [[Bill Gates]] is a Seattleite by birth. Internet retailer [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major airline [[Alaska Airlines]] was founded in [[SeaTac, Washington]], serving Seattle's international airport, [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]]. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000.

Seattle has a noteworthy musical history. From 1918 to 1951, nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of [[Ray Charles]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Ernestine Anderson]], and others. Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician [[Jimi Hendrix]], as well as the origin of the bands [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Foo Fighters]] and the [[alternative rock]] movement [[grunge]].&lt;ref name=Seattle_Sound&gt;{{cite book|last=Heylin|first=Clinton|title=Babylon's Burning: From Punk to Grunge|publisher=Conongate|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84195-879-8|page=606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding===
Archaeological excavations suggest that Native Americans have inhabited the Seattle area for at least 4,000 years.&lt;ref name=Discovery_Park/&gt; By the time the first European settlers arrived, the people (subsequently called the [[Duwamish tribe]]) occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around [[Elliott Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Lange|date=October 15, 2000|publisher=HistoryLink|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=1660|title=Seattle and King County's First European Settlers|accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 4, 2003|url=http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/learn/CDROM/SongStorySpeech/Content/SalishArtCulture.htm|title=The people and their land|work=Puget Sound Native Art and Culture|publisher=Seattle Art Museum|accessdate=April 21, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613093932/http://seattleartmuseum.org/Learn/CDROM/SongStorySpeech/Content/SalishArtCulture.htm|archivedate=June 13, 2010}} (Publication date per "Native Art of the Northwest Coast: Collection Insight")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Walt Crowley|authorlink=Walt Crowley|date=March 13, 2003|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=5402|title=Native American tribes sign Point Elliott Treaty at Mukilteo on January 22, 1855|publisher=HistoryLink|accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European to visit the Seattle area was [[George Vancouver]], in May 1792 during his [[Vancouver Expedition|1791–95 expedition]] to chart the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref name=Vancouver1801&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Vancouver|author2=John Vancouver|title=A voyage of discovery to the North Pacific ocean, and round the world|publisher=J.

In 1851, a large party led by Luther Collins made a location on land at the mouth of the [[Duwamish River]]; they formally claimed it on September 14, 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=5390|title=Luther Collins Party, first King County settlers, arrive at mouth of Duwamish River on September 14, 1851.|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Greg Lange|date=March 8, 2003|accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen days later, members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the Denny Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=2765|title=Collins party encounters Denny party scouts at Duwamish Head near future site of Seattle on September 27, 1851.|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Greg Lange|date=December 16, 2000|accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Denny Party claimed land on [[Alki Point, Seattle|Alki Point]] on September 28, 1851.&lt;ref name="founding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=303|title=Seattle – a Snapshot History of Its Founding|date=August 31, 1998|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Walt Crowley|accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the Denny Party set sail from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, and landed on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13, 1851.&lt;ref name=founding/&gt;

After a difficult winter, most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]],&lt;ref name=founding/&gt; naming this new settlement ''Duwamps''.

Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it "New York," but renamed "New York Alki" in April 1853, from a [[Chinook Jargon|Chinook]] word meaning, roughly, "by and by" or "someday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Seattle-at-150-Charles-Terry-s-unlimited-energy-1069610.php|title=Seattle at 150: Charles Terry's unlimited energy influenced a city|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|author=James R.

For the next few years, New York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance, but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=3142|title=Charles Terry homesteads site of Alki business district on May 1, 1852.|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Greg Lange|date=March 28, 2001|accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incorporations===
The name "Seattle" appears on official [[Washington Territory]] papers dated May 23, 1853, when the first [[plat]]s for the village were filed. In 1855, nominal land settlements were established. On January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a [[trustee model of representation|board of trustees]] managing the city. The Town of Seattle was disincorporated on January 18, 1867, and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869, with a [[mayor–council government]].&lt;ref name=founding/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Lange|author2=Cassandra Tate|date=November 4, 1998|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=168|title=Legislature incorporates the Town of Seattle for the first time on January 14, 1865.|publisher=HistoryLink|accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date "1869" and a likeness of Chief Sealth in left profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/facts/symbols.htm|title=Seattle City Symbols|publisher=City of Seattle|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles, like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has risen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure.&lt;ref name=shear&gt;

The first such boom, covering the early years of the city, rode on the lumber industry. (During this period the road now known as [[Yesler Way]] won the nickname "Skid Road," supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to [[Henry Yesler]]'s sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as ''[[Skid Row]]''.)&lt;ref name=yesler&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Like much of the American West, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between [[working class|labor]] and [[capitalism|management]], as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the [[History of Seattle before 1900#Relations between whites and Chinese|anti-Chinese riots of 1885–1886]].&lt;ref&gt;

Seattle had achieved sufficient economic success that when the [[Great Seattle Fire]] of 1889 destroyed the central business district, a far grander city-center rapidly emerged in its place.&lt;ref name=fire&gt;

===Gold Rush, World War I, and the Great Depression===
[[File:Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition - Rainier Vista.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] had just over 3.7&amp;nbsp;million visitors during its 138-day run&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=696|title=Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition's final day is on October 16, 1909.|date=January 14, 1999|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Greg Lange|accessdate=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The second and most dramatic boom resulted from the Klondike Gold Rush, which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of 1893. In a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the ''S.S. Portland'' docked with its famed "ton of gold," and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon. Few of those working men found lasting wealth. However, it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]], [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], and [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than [[mother lode]]s for extraction, of precious metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=687|title=Klondike Gold Rush|publisher=HistoryLink.org|date=January 14, 1999|author=Greg Lange|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century, and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old [[James E. Casey]] borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the [[American Messenger Company]] (later [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include [[Nordstrom]] and [[Eddie Bauer]].&lt;ref name=Klondike-foundings/&gt; Seattle brought in the [[Olmsted Brothers]] landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/parks/parkspaces/olmsted.htm|title=Park History – Olmsted Parks|publisher=Seattle Parks and Recreation|access-date=November 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gold Rush era culminated in the [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] of 1909, which is largely responsible for the layout of today's [[University of Washington]] campus.&lt;ref name="aypexpo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=5371|title=Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition opens for a 138-day run on June 1, 1909.|date=May 5, 2003|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Greg Lange|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town. The subsequent retrenchment led to the [[Seattle General Strike|Seattle General Strike of 1919]], the first [[general strike]] in the country.&lt;ref name=generalstrike&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrick McRoberts|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=861|title=Seattle General Strike, 1919, Part I|publisher=HistoryLink|date=February 4, 1999|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1912 city development plan by [[Virgil Bogue]] went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the [[Maritime Strike of 1934]] cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the [[Port of Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;BOLA Architecture + Planning &amp; Northwest Archaeological Associates, Inc., {{cite web|url=http://www.portseattle.org/downloads/business/realestate/development/northbay/Appendix_I_Historic_Cultural.pdf|title=Port of Seattle North Bay Project DEIS: Historic and Cultural Resources|accessdate=July 26, 2008|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723025013/http://www.portseattle.org/downloads/business/realestate/development/northbay/Appendix_I_Historic_Cultural.pdf|archivedate=July 23, 2011|df=}}, Port of Seattle, April 5, 2005, pp. 12–13 (which is pp. 14–15 of the PDF).

The [[Great Depression]] in Seattle affected many minority groups, one being the Asian Pacific Americans; they were subject to racism, loss of property, and failed claims of unemployment due to citizenship status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nash|first=Phil|date=2009|title=Asian Pacific Americans During the Great Depression|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/367348258?accountid=14784&amp;rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo|journal=AsianWeek|volume=5|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle was one of the major cities that benefited from programs such as the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], UCL, and [[Public Works Administration|PWA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Washington|last=Dorpat|first=Paul|last2=McCoy|first2=Genevieve|publisher=Tartu Publications|year=1998|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seattle 1921-1940: From Boom to Bust|last=Berner|first=Richard|publisher=Charles Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workers, mostly men, built roads, parks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record sites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as [[Los Angeles]] prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]], but lost to LA as well. Seattle’s eastern farm land faded due to [[Oregon]]’s and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]’s, forcing people into town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Depression and the Urban West Coast, 1929-1933|last=Mullins|first=William|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Indianapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=San Francisco and Seattle During the Hoover Years of the Depression: 1929-1933|last=Mullins|first=William|publisher=University of Washington|year=1975|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous ''[[Hooverville]]'' arose during the Depression, leading to Seattle’s growing homeless population. Stationed outside Seattle, the Hooverville housed thousands of men but very very few children and no women. With work projects close to the city, Hooverville grew and the WPA settled into the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hooverville: A Study of a Community of Homeless Men in Seattle|last=Roy|first=Donald|publisher=University of Washington|year=1935|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A movement by women arose from Seattle during the Depression. Fueled by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]’s book ''It’s Up to the Women'', women pushed for recognition, not just as housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals ''Working Woman'' and ''The Woman Today'', women pushed to be seen as equal and receive some recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orleck|first=Annelise|date=1993|title=We Are the Mythical Thing Called the Public|url=|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=19|pages=147–172|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle’s [[University of Washington]] was greatly affected during the Depression era. As schools across Washington lost funding and attendance, the UW actually prospered during the time period. While [[Seattle Public Schools|Seattle public schools]] were influenced by Washington’s superintendent Worth McClure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schools in the Great Depression|last=Moreo|first=Dominic|publisher=Garland Publishing|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; they still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance. The UW, despite academic challenges that plagued the college due to differing views on teaching and learning, focused on growth in student enrollment rather than improving the existing school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Century at the University of Washington|last=Gates|first=Charles|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle was also the home base of impresario [[Alexander Pantages]] who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting [[vaudeville]] acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival [[John Considine (Seattle)|John Considine]], Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. [[B. Marcus Priteca]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the ''Pantages'' name; Seattle's surviving [[Paramount Theatre (Seattle)|Paramount Theatre]], on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.

War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the [[Japanese American internment]]. After the war, the local economy dipped.

Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading "Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=1287|title=Billboard appears on April 16, 1971, near Sea–Tac, reading: Will the Last Person Leaving Seattle—Turn Out the Lights.|date=June 8, 1999|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Greg Lange|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}

==Geography==
With a land area of 83.9 square miles (217.3&amp;nbsp;km²),&lt;ref name="quickfacts"/&gt; Seattle is the northernmost city with at least 500,000 people in the United States, farther north than Canadian cities such as Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal, at about the same latitude as Salzburg, Austria.

The topography of Seattle is hilly. The city lies on several hills, including Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Magnolia, Denny Hill, and Queen Anne. The Kitsap and the Olympic peninsulas along with the Olympic mountains lie to the west of Puget Sound, while the Cascade Range and Lake Sammamish lie to the east of Lake Washington. The city has over {{convert|5540|acres|0|abbr=on}} of parkland.

Seattle is located between the saltwater Puget Sound (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and Lake Washington to the east. The city's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic port. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the [[Kitsap Peninsula]] and [[Olympic Mountains]] on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]] suburbs, are [[Lake Sammamish]] and the [[Cascade Range]]. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]] (consisting of two man-made canals, [[Lake Union]], and the [[Hiram M. Chittenden Locks]] at [[Salmon Bay]], ending in [[Shilshole Bay]] on Puget Sound).

The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies.

Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent [[Puget Sound]], greater [[Pacific Ocean]], and [[Lake Washington]]. Thus extreme heat waves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below about {{convert|15|F|C}}). The Seattle area is the most cloudy region of the United States, due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. Despite having a reputation for frequent rain, Seattle receives less precipitation than many other U.S. cities like Chicago or New York City. However, unlike many other U.S. cities, Seattle has many more "rain days", when a very light drizzle falls from the sky for many days.&lt;ref name=rainshadow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komonews.com/weather/faq/4306627.html|title=What Is The Olympic Rain Shadow?|publisher=KOMOTV.com|accessdate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot temperature extremes are enhanced by dry, compressed wind from the west slopes of the Cascades,&lt;ref name="Sistek2006a"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is offshore flow?|url=http://komonews.com/weather/faq/what-is-offshore-flow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126002256/http://komonews.com/weather/faq/what-is-offshore-flow |dead-url=no |archive-date=January 26, 2016|first=Scott|last=Sistek|date=October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while cold temperatures are generated mainly from the [[Fraser Valley]] in [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the different snow scenarios?|url=http://www.komonews.com/weather/faq/4307422.html#1a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1981 to 2010, the average annual precipitation measured at [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]] was 37.49 inches (952&amp;nbsp;mm). Annual precipitation has ranged from {{convert|23.78|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1952 to {{convert|55.14|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1950; for water year (October 1 – September 30) precipitation, the range is {{convert|23.16|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1976–77 to {{convert|51.82|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1996–97.&lt;ref name = NOWData/&gt; Due to local variations in [[microclimate]], Seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than some other locations west of the Cascades. Around {{convert|80|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the west, the [[Hoh Rain Forest]] in [[Olympic National Park]] on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains receives an annual average precipitation of {{convert|142|in|m|2|abbr=on}}. Sixty miles (95&amp;nbsp;km) to the south of Seattle, the state capital [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], which is out of the Olympic Mountains' rain shadow, receives an annual average precipitation of {{convert|50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = NOWData/&gt; The city of [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], about {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} west of downtown Seattle on the other side of the Puget Sound, receives {{convert|56.4|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually.&lt;ref name = NOWData/&gt;

Conversely, the northeastern portion of the [[Olympic Peninsula]], which lies east of the [[Olympic Mountains]] is located within the Olympic rain shadow and receives significantly less precipitation than its surrounding areas. Prevailing airflow from the west is forced to cool and compress when colliding with the mountain range, resulting in high levels of precipitation within the mountains and its western slopes. Once the airflow reaches the leeward side of the mountains it then lowers and expands resulting in warmer, and significantly dryer air. [[Sequim, Washington]], nicknamed "Sunny Sequim," is located approximately {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of downtown Seattle and receives just {{convert|16.51|in|mm|abbr=out}} of annual precipitation, more comparable to that of [[Los Angeles]]. Oftentimes an area devoid of cloud cover can be seen extending out over the [[Puget Sound]] to the north and east of Sequim. On average Sequim observes 127 sunny days per year in addition to 127 days with partial cloud cover. Other areas influenced by the Olympic rain shadow include [[Port Angeles, Washington|Port Angeles]], [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]], extending as far north as [[Victoria, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympicrainshadow.com/|title=Olympic Rain Shadow – Information and Resources|last=olympicrainshadow.com|website=www.olympicrainshadow.com|access-date=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, Seattle averages more rainfall than any other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation. Conversely, the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from June to September. Seattle is one of the five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the [[Continental United States|lower 48 states]], along with some cities in the Northeast, Ohio and Michigan. Thunderstorms are rare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofseattle.net/html/visitor/weather.htm|title=Seattle Weather and Climate|accessdate=September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225941/http://www.cityofseattle.net/html/visitor/weather.htm|archivedate=September 26, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year.&lt;ref name="Sperling"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperling|first=Bert|author2=Peter Sander|title=Cities Ranked and Rated|publisher=Wiley|year=2007|isbn=978-0-470-06864-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[Fort Myers, Florida]], reports thunder on 93 days per year, [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] on 52, and New York City on 25.

Seattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during the months of November, December and January, receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall (by volume) during this period. In late fall and early winter, atmospheric rivers (also known as "[[Pineapple Express]]" systems), strong frontal systems, and Pacific low pressure systems are common. Light rain &amp; drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year; for instance, on average, less than {{convert|1.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain falls in July and August combined when rain is less common. On occasion, Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events. One such event occurred on December 2–4, 2007, when sustained [[hurricane]]-force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong Pineapple Express event occurred in the greater Puget Sound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon. Precipitation totals exceeded {{convert|350|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} in some areas with winds topping out at {{convert|209|km/h|abbr=on}} along coastal Oregon.&lt;ref name="ncdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2007/12|title=State of the Climate – National Overview – December 2007|date=January 2008|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little over {{convert|130|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain fell on Seattle in a 24-hour period.

Seattle typically receives some snowfall on an annual basis but heavy snow is rare. Average annual snowfall, as measured at Sea-Tac Airport, is {{convert|6.8|in|cm|1}}.

The [[Puget Sound Convergence Zone]] is an important feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in [[convection]].&lt;ref name="Sistek2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://komonews.com/weather/faq/what-is-a-puget-sound-convergence-zone|title=What is a Puget Sound Convergence Zone?|publisher=KOMO |archive-date=January 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126002111/http://komonews.com/weather/faq/what-is-a-puget-sound-convergence-zone|first=Scott|last=Sistek|date=December 17, 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The [[Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm of 2006|Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm]] in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to {{convert|69|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}}, an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.

One of many exceptions to Seattle's reputation as a damp location occurs in [[El Niño]] years, when marine weather systems track as far south as California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003297665_webnino10.html|title=El Niño could cause Northwest drought, mild winter elsewhere, forecasters say|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=October 10, 2006|author=Randolph E.

Seattle has three major men's [[professional sports]] teams: the [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB)'s [[Seattle Mariners]], and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS)'s [[Seattle Sounders FC]]. Other professional sports teams include the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA)'s [[Seattle Storm]], who won the [[WNBA Finals|WNBA championship]] in [[2004 WNBA Finals|2004]] and [[2010 WNBA Finals|2010]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=7330|title=Seattle Storm wins WNBA championship on October 12, 2004.|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Cassandra Tate|date=May 25, 2005|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Seattle Reign]] of the [[National Women's Soccer League]].

The Seahawks' [[CenturyLink Field]] has hosted [[National Football League playoffs|NFL playoff]] games in [[2005–06 NFL playoffs|2006]], [[2007–08 NFL playoffs|2008]], [[2010–11 NFL playoffs|2011]], [[2013–14 NFL playoffs|2014]], [[2014–15 NFL playoffs|2015]], and [[2016–17 NFL playoffs|2017]]. The Seahawks have advanced to the [[Super Bowl]] three times: [[Super Bowl XL|2005]], [[Super Bowl XLVIII|2013]] and [[Super Bowl XLIX|2014]]. They defeated the [[Denver Broncos]] 43–8 to win their first [[List of Super Bowl champions|Super Bowl championship]] in [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], but lost 24–28 against the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl XLIX]]. The Seahawks also held the NFL playoffs at the [[Kingdome]] in [[1983–84 NFL playoffs|1983]], [[1984–85 NFL playoffs|1984]] and [[1999–2000 NFL playoffs|2000]]. The 2000 playoff game was the last game of football of any type and of any sport at The Kingdome.

Seattle Sounders FC has played in Major League Soccer since 2009, sharing CenturyLink Field with the Seahawks, as a continuation of earlier teams in the [[American soccer pyramid|lower divisions of American soccer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/sounders-fc-debuts-with-dazzling-3-0-victory/|title=Sounders FC debuts with dazzling 3–0 victory|last=Romero|first=José Miguel|date=March 20, 2009|newspaper=The Seattle Times|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sounders have won the [[MLS Supporters' Shield]] in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 25, 2014|title=Seattle Sounders FC capture first-ever MLS Supporters' Shield with victory over LA Galaxy|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/10/25/seattle-sounders-fc-capture-first-ever-mls-supporters-shield-victory-over-la|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] on four occasions: [[2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|2009]], [[2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|2010]], [[2011 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|2011]], and [[2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pentz|first=Matt|date=September 18, 2014|title=Sounders win 4th U.S. Open Cup|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/sounders-win-4th-us-open-cup/|newspaper=The Seattle Times|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sounders won their first [[MLS Cup]] after defeating [[Toronto FC]], 5-4 in penalty kicks, in [[MLS Cup 2016]]. With the Sounders' first MLS Cup championship in franchise history, the Mariners are the only men's professional sports team in the city without a championship, let alone a championship series appearance.

Seattle's professional sports history began at the start of the 20th century with the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association|PCHA]]'s [[Seattle Metropolitans]], which in 1917 became the first American hockey team to win the [[Stanley Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5414|title=Seattle Metropolitan hockey team wins the Stanley Cup on March 26, 1917.|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Greg Lange|date=March 14, 2003|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Seattle was also home to a previous Major League Baseball franchise in 1969: the [[Seattle Pilots]]. The Pilots relocated to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] and became the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for the 1970 season.

Seattle also boasts a strong history in collegiate sports. The [[University of Washington]] and [[Seattle University]] are [[NCAA Division I]] schools. The University of Washington's athletic program, nicknamed the [[Washington Huskies|Huskies]], competes in the [[Pac-12 Conference]], and Seattle University's athletic program, nicknamed the [[Seattle Redhawks|Redhawks]], competes in the [[Western Athletic Conference]].

[[Gas Works Park]] features the preserved [[superstructure]] of a [[coal gasification]] plant closed in 1956. Located across Lake Union from downtown, the park provides panoramic views of the Seattle skyline.

Also popular are hikes and skiing in the nearby Cascade or Olympic Mountains and kayaking and sailing in the waters of Puget Sound, the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], and the [[Strait of Georgia]]. In 2005, ''[[Men's Fitness]]'' magazine named Seattle the [[physical fitness|fittest]] city in the United States.&lt;ref name=mensfitness&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6790560/|title=Seattle named fittest city in America|publisher=MSNBC|date=January 6, 2005|accessdate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{main|Government and politics of Seattle|Mayor of Seattle}}
[[File:Seattle City Council District map.png|thumb|upright=1.0|The city council consists of two at-large positions and seven district seats representing the areas shown.]]
Seattle is a [[charter city]], with a [[Mayor–council government|mayor–council form of government]]. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions.&lt;ref name="archive-chrono"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/Facts/councilchron.htm|title=Seattle City Council Members, 1869–present Chronological Listing|publisher=Seattle City Archives|access-date=July 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the [[district attorney|city attorney]] and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially [[Non-partisan democracy|non-partisan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ci.seattle.wa.us/ethics/votersguide.asp?e=20071106&amp;p=01_03|title=Seattle Form of Government|publisher=City of Seattle|author=Ethics and Elections Commission |access-date=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people).

[[Jenny Durkan]] was elected as mayor in the [[Seattle mayoral election, 2017|2017 mayoral election]] and took office on November 28, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beekman |first=Daniel |date=November 28, 2017 |title=Jenny Durkan sworn in as Seattle's 1st female mayor since 1920s |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/jenny-durkan-sworn-in-as-seattles-1st-female-mayor-since-1920s/ |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor's office also includes two [[deputy mayor]]s, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; {{as of|2017}}, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beekman |first=Daniel |date=November 29, 2017 |title=Seattle's new mayor, Jenny Durkan, names her City Hall team |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattles-new-mayor-jenny-durkan-names-her-city-hall-team/ |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle's political culture is very liberal and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

{{main|Medical facilities of Seattle}}

The University of Washington is consistently ranked among the country's top leading institutions in medical research, earning special merits for programs in neurology and neurosurgery. Seattle has seen local developments of modern paramedic services with the establishment of [[Medic One]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=cobb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/mednews/vol6/no33/cobb.html|title=Cobb honored as one of 'Resuscitation Greats'|publisher=UW School of Medicine Online News|date=August 16, 2002|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' story on the success of the then four-year-old Medic One paramedic system called Seattle "the best place in the world to have a heart attack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrokc.gov/health/medicone/history.htm|title=King County Medic One: A History of Excellence|publisher=King County|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=October 3, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707064715/http://www.metrokc.gov/health/medicone/history.htm|archivedate=July 7, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of Seattle's largest medical centers are located on First Hill. [[Harborview Medical Center]], the public county hospital, is the only Level I [[trauma center|trauma hospital]] in a region that includes Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwmedicine.org/Facilities/Harborview/CentersOfEmphasis/Trauma/|title=Trauma Center|publisher=UW Medicine|accessdate=October 3, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024055225/http://www.uwmedicine.org/Facilities/Harborview/CentersOfEmphasis/Trauma/|archivedate=October 24, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Mason Medical Center]] and [[Swedish Medical Center]]'s two largest campuses are also located in this part of Seattle, including the [[Virginia Mason Hospital]]. This concentration of hospitals resulted in the neighborhood's nickname "Pill Hill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002445189_virginiamason19.html|title=Pill Hill property sells for a bundle|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|author=Tom Boyer|date=August 19, 2005|accessdate=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the [[Laurelhurst, Seattle|Laurelhurst]] neighborhood, [[Seattle Children's]], formerly [[Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center]], is the pediatric referral center for Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. The [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood. The University District is home to the [[University of Washington Medical Center]] which, along with Harborview, is operated by the University of Washington. Seattle is also served by a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] hospital on [[Beacon Hill, Seattle|Beacon Hill]], a third campus of Swedish in Ballard, and [[Northwest Hospital and Medical Center]] near [[Northgate Mall (Seattle)|Northgate Mall]].

===Transportation===

{{further|Street layout of Seattle}}
[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Interstate 5 in Washington]] as it passes through downtown Seattle]]
The [[Seattle Street Railway|first streetcars]] appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the [[Trolleybuses in Seattle|Seattle trolleybus system]] brought the end of [[Seattle Street Railway|streetcars in Seattle]] in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.&lt;ref name="interurbanrail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=2667|title=Interurban Rail Transit in King County and the Puget Sound Region – A Snapshot History|date=September 19, 2000|publisher=HistoryLink.org|author=Walt Crowley|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King County Water Taxi Downtown Seattle.jpg|thumb|[[King County Water Taxi]] and downtown Seattle]]
[[King County Metro]] provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county, as well as the [[South Lake Union Streetcar]] line and the [[First Hill Streetcar]] line.&lt;ref name=slustreetcar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/slustreetcar.htm|title=The South Lake Union Streetcar|publisher=Seattle Department of Transportation|accessdate=September 29, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095905/http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/slustreetcar.htm|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle is one of the few cities in North America whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses. [[Sound Transit]] provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area, two [[Sounder commuter rail]] lines between the suburbs and downtown, and its [[Central Link]] [[light rail]] line between the University of Washington and Angle Lake. [[Washington State Ferries]], which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world, connects Seattle to [[Bainbridge Island, Washington|Bainbridge]] and [[Vashon, Washington|Vashon Islands]] in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and [[Southworth, Washington|Southworth]] on the Kitsap Peninsula.&lt;ref name=ferries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/your_wsf/index.cfm?fuseaction=our_history|title=History|publisher=Washington State Department of Transit|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Link trains at University St station in 2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Central Link]] light rail trains in the [[Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel]] at the [[University Street (Link station)|University Street Station]]]]
According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 18.6% of Seattle residents used one of the three public transit systems that serve the city, giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or light rail prior to the completion of Sound Transit's Central Link line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Yorkers are Top Transit Users|publisher=CNNMoney.com|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm|author=Les Christie|date=June 29, 2007|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has also been described by [[Bert Sperling]] as the fourth most walkable U.S. city and by [[Walk Score]] as the sixth most walkable of the fifty largest U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cindy Perman|title=Most Walkable Cities|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/42668491/Most_Walkable_Cities?slide=8|website=CNBC|accessdate=August 28, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203040628/http://www.cnbc.com/id/42668491/Most_Walkable_Cities?slide=8|archivedate=February 3, 2015|date=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings|publisher=Walk Score|accessdate=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]], locally known as Sea-Tac Airport and located just south in the neighboring city of SeaTac, is operated by the Port of Seattle and provides commercial air service to destinations throughout the world. Closer to downtown, [[Boeing Field]] is used for general aviation, cargo flights, and testing/delivery of Boeing airliners.

[[File:Alaskan Way Viaduct Seattle Twilight.jpg|thumb|[[Alaskan Way Viaduct]], port of Seattle on the right, stadium in the background]]
The main mode of transportation, however, relies on Seattle's streets, which are laid out in a [[cardinal direction]]s [[grid plan|grid pattern]], except in the central business district where early city leaders [[Arthur A. Denny|Arthur Denny]] and [[Carson Boren]] insisted on orienting their plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=315|title=Maynard, Dr. David Swinson (1808–1873)|date=November 10, 1998|publisher=HistoryLink|author=Junius Rochester|accessdate=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two roads, [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and [[Washington State Route 99|State Route 99]] (both limited-access highways), run uninterrupted through the city from north to south. State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on the [[Alaskan Way Viaduct]], which was built in 1953. However, due to damage sustained during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel. The {{convert|2|mi|adj=on}} [[Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel]] was originally scheduled to be completed in December 2015 at a cost of US$4.25&amp;nbsp;billion. Unfortunately, due to issues with the worlds largest tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is nicknamed "Bertha" and is {{convert|57|ft}} in diameter, the projected date of completion has been pushed back to fall 2018 (with tolling set to begin in 2019).&lt;ref&gt;[http://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-viaduct-to-close-for-3-weeks-this-fall-before-new-tunnel-opens Seattle viaduct to close for 3 weeks this fall before new tunnel opens] [[KOMO-TV|KOMO]] News.

From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Documents/FactBook/APTA_2006_Fact_Book.pdf|title=Public Transportation Fact Book|page=14|edition=57th|date=April 2006|publisher=American Public Transportation Association}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Documents/FactBook/APTA_2011_Fact_Book.pdf|title=Public Transportation Fact Book|page=9|edition=62nd|date=April 2011|publisher=American Public Transportation Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2 (Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five [[bus rapid transit]] lines called [[RapidRide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/metrotransit/transitnow.aspx|title=Transit Now|publisher=King County Department of Transportation|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rejecting a [[Roads and Transit|roads and transit measure]] in 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service, extend the [[Link light rail]] system, and expand and improve [[Sounder commuter rail]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://future.soundtransit.org/|title=Future.soundtransit.org|publisher=Future.soundtransit.org|accessdate=October 13, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205083718/http://future.soundtransit.org/|archivedate=February 5, 2016|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits.

A '''short story''' is a piece of [[prose]] [[fiction]] that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a "single effect" or mood, however there are many exceptions to this.

A dictionary definition is "an invented prose narrative shorter than a novel usually dealing with a few characters and aiming at unity of effect and often concentrating on the creation of mood rather than plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/short%20story|title=Definition of SHORT STORY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a [[novel]], but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the [[novel]] or [[novella]] (a shorter novel), authors generally draw from a common pool of [[literary technique]]s.

Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form. They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation.

Short stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognised in modern society for hundreds of years. The short form is, conceivably, more natural to us than longer forms. We are drawn to short stories as the well-told story, and as William Boyd, the award-winning British author and short story writer has said:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[short stories] seem to answer something very deep in our nature as if, for the duration of its telling, something special has been created, some essence of our experience extrapolated, some temporary sense has been made of our common, turbulent journey towards the grave and oblivion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/william-boyd-short-history-of-the-short-story|title=A short history of the short story|last=Boyd|first=William|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In terms of length, [[word count]] is typically anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 for short stories, however some have 20,000 words and are still classed as short stories. Stories of fewer than 1,000 words are sometimes referred to as "short short stories", or "[[flash fiction]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/Portland/Arts/63088-Who-reads-short-shorts/|title=Who reads short shorts?|author=Deirdre Fulton|date=2008-06-11|publisher=thePhoneix.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821224948/http://thephoenix.com/Portland/Arts/63088-Who-reads-short-shorts|archivedate=2009-08-21|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-06-06|quote="each of their (less-than-1000-word) stories"|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Short stories today ==
[[:Category:21st-century short story writers|21st-century short story writers]] run into the thousands.

Global sales of short story fiction are very strong. In the UK sales jumped 45 per cent in 2017, driven by collections from international names such as Alice Munro, new writers to the genre such as Tom Hanks, and the revival of short story [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], such as those held by short fiction company, Pin Drop Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/short-story-collections-surge-half-value-and-third-volume-2017-709376|title=Sales of short story collections surge  {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 690,000 short stories and anthologies were sold in the UK in 2017, generating £5.88 million, the genre’s highest sales since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/short-story-revival-cuts-novels-down-to-size-mj6xzz535|title=Short story revival cuts novels down to size|last=Media Correspondent|first=Matthew Moore|date=2018|work=The Times|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nobel Prize in Literature==
[[Alice Munro]], "master of the contemporary short story" according to her citation for the 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], said she hopes the award would bring readership for the short story in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2013/munro-telephone.html|title=Telephone|author=Munro|date=2013|website=Nobel Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short story adaptations==
Short stories are sometimes adapted for radio, TV and film:
* [[Radio drama]]s, as on ''[[NBC Presents: Short Story]]'' (1951–52). A popular example of this is "[[The Hitch-Hiker (radio play)|The Hitch-Hiker]]", read by [[Orson Welles]].
* [[Short film]]s, often rewritten by other people, and even as feature-length films; such is the case of "[[Children of the Corn]]", "[[The Shawshank Redemption]]", "[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]", "[[Brokeback Mountain]]", "[[Who Goes There?]]", "[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]", "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", "[[The Body (2001 film)|The Body]]", "[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]", "[[The Lawnmower Man]]", "[[Hearts in Atlantis]]", and "[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]".
* [[Television special]]s, such as "[[12:01 PM]]" (1993 television movie), "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]" (October 11, 1963, on ''The Twilight Zone''), "[[The Lottery]]", and "[[Button, Button (The Twilight Zone)|Button, Button]]" (on ''The Twilight Zone'').

==Length==

Determining what exactly separates a short story from longer fictional formats is problematic. A&amp;nbsp;classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[essay]] "[[The Philosophy of Composition]]" (1846).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eldritchpress.org/nh/nhpoe1.html|title=Edgar Allan Poe: Essays and Reviews|last=Poe|first=Edgar Allan|publisher=Library of America|year=1984|pages=569–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpreting this standard nowadays is problematic, because the expected length of "one sitting" may now be briefer than it was in Poe's era.

Short stories have no set length. In terms of word count there is no official demarcation between an [[anecdote]], a short story, and a novel. Rather, the form's parameters are given by the rhetorical and practical context in which a given story is produced and considered, so that what constitutes a short story may differ between genres, countries, eras, and commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|publisher=Penguin|year=1999|edition=3rd|location=London|page=864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the novel, the short story's predominant shape reflects the demands of the available markets for publication, and the evolution of the form seems closely tied to the evolution of the publishing industry and the submission guidelines of its constituent houses.&lt;ref name="Abrams1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=Glossary of Literary Terms|last=Abrams|first=M.H.|publisher=Harcourt Brace|year=1999|isbn=0-155-05452-X|edition=7th|location=Orlando, FL|pages=286–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a point of reference for the genre writer, the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] define short story length in the [[Nebula Award]]s for [[science fiction]] submission guidelines as having a word count of fewer than 7,500 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nebulas.sfwa.org/about-the-nebulas/nebula-rules|title=Complete Nebula Awards Rules Including the Ray Bradbury and Andre Norton Awards (Revised &amp; Updated)|publisher=sfwa.org|accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longer stories that cannot be called novels are sometimes considered "[[novellas]]" or novelettes and, like short stories, may be collected into the more marketable form of "collections", often containing previously unpublished stories. Sometimes, authors who do not have the time or money to write a novella or novel decide to write short stories instead, working out a deal with a [[E-book|popular website]] or [[magazine]] to publish them for profit.

==History==

Emerging from earlier oral [[storytelling]] traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization.

With the rise of the [[realism (arts)|realistic]] novel, the short story evolved in a parallel tradition, with some of its first distinctive examples in the tales of [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]. The character of the form developed particularly with authors known for their short fiction, either by choice (they wrote nothing else) or by critical regard, which acknowledged the focus and craft required in the short form. An example is [[Jorge Luis Borges]], who won American fame with "[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]", published in the August 1948 ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]''. Another example is [[O. Henry]] (author of "[[The Gift of the Magi (O. Henry story)|Gift of the Magi]]"), for whom the [[O. Henry Award]] is named. Other of his most popular, inventive and most often reprinted stories (among over 600) include: ''A Municipal Report'', ''An Unfinished Story'', ''A Blackjack Barginer'', ''A Lickpenny Lover'', ''Mammon and the Archer'', ''Two Thanksgiving Day Gentlemen'', ''The Last Leaf''. American examples include: [[Jack London]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[John Cheever]], and [[Raymond Carver]]. [[Science fiction]] short story with a special poetic touch was a genre developed with great popular success by [[Ray Bradbury]].
The genre of the short story was often neglected until the second half of the 19th century.

The evolution of printing technologies and periodical editions were among the factors contributing to the increasing importance of short story publications. Pioneering role in founding the rules of the genre in the [[Western canon]] include, among others, [[Rudyard Kipling]] (United Kingdom), [[Anton Chekhov]] (Russia), [[Guy de Maupassant]] (France), [[Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera]] (Mexico) and [[Rubén Darío]] (Nicaragua).

An important theoretical example for storytelling analysis is provided by Walter Benjamin in his illuminated essay ''The Storyteller'' where he argues about the decline of storytelling art and the incommunicability of experiences in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Storyteller|title="The Storyteller" Commentary by Leo Hall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar Wilde's essay ''The Decay of Lying'' and Henry James's ''The Art of Fiction'' are also partly related with this subject.

=== Predecessors ===
Short stories date back to oral storytelling traditions which originally produced epics such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. Oral narratives were often told in the form of rhyming or [[rhythm]]ic [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], often including recurring sections or, in the case of Homer, ''[[Homeric epithet]]s''. Such stylistic devices often acted as [[mnemonic]]s for easier recall, rendition and adaptation of the story. Short sections of verse might focus on individual narratives that could be told at one sitting. The overall arc of the [[Narrative|tale]] would emerge only through the telling of multiple such sections.

The other ancient form of short story, the [[anecdote]], was popular under the [[Roman Empire]]. Anecdotes functioned as a sort of [[parable]], a brief realistic narrative that embodies a point. Many surviving Roman anecdotes were collected in the 13th or 14th century as the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]''. Anecdotes remained popular in Europe well into the 18th century, when the fictional anecdotal letters of Sir [[Roger de Coverley]] were published.

In Europe, the oral story-telling tradition began to develop into written stories in the early 14th century, most notably with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]''. Both of these books are composed of individual short stories (which range from farce or humorous anecdotes to well-crafted literary fictions) set within a larger narrative story (a [[frame story]]), although the frame-tale device was not adopted by all writers.  At the end of the 16th century, some of the most popular short stories in Europe were the darkly tragic "[[novella]]" of [[Matteo Bandello]] (especially in their French translation).

The mid 17th century in France saw the development of a refined short novel, the "nouvelle", by such authors as [[Madame de Lafayette]]. In the 1690s, traditional [[fairy tale]]s began to be published (one of the most famous collections was by [[Charles Perrault]]). The appearance of [[Antoine Galland]]'s first modern translation of the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' (or ''Arabian Nights'') (from 1704; another translation appeared in 1710–12) would have an enormous influence on the 18th-century European short stories of [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]] and others.

=== 1790–1850 ===
There are early examples of short stories published separately between 1790 and 1810, but the first true collections of short stories appeared between 1810 and 1830 in several countries around the same period.&lt;ref&gt;''Short Story'' in Jacob E. Safra e.a., ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th edition, Micropaedia volume 10, Chicago, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first short stories in the United Kingdom were [[gothic fiction|gothic tales]] like [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]]'s "remarkable narrative" "The Poisoner of Montremos" (1791).&lt;ref&gt;Internet Book List: Book Information: Oxford Book of Gothic Tales.&lt;/ref&gt; Great novelists like Sir [[Walter Scott]] and [[Charles Dickens]] also wrote some short stories.

One of the earliest short stories in the United States was [[Charles Brockden Brown]]'s "Somnambulism" from 1805. [[Washington Irving]] wrote mysterious tales including "[[Rip van Winkle]]" (1819) and "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" (1820). [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] published the first part of his ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'' in 1837. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote his tales of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]]
and imagination between 1832 and 1849. Classic stories are "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]", "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]", "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]", "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]", and the first [[detective fiction|detective story]], "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]". In "[[The Philosophy of Composition]]" (1846) Poe argued that a literary work should be short enough for a reader to finish in one sitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guides7/philcomp.html |title=Poe's The Philosophy of Composition: a Study Guide |publisher=Cummingsstudyguides.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the first collection of short stories was by [[Heinrich von Kleist]] in 1810 and 1811. The [[Brothers Grimm]] published their [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|first volume of collected fairy tales]] in 1812. [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] followed with his own original [[fantasy]] tales, of which "[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]" (1816) is the most famous.

In France, [[Prosper Mérimée]] wrote ''Mateo Falcone'' in 1829.

=== 1850–1900 ===
In the latter half of the 19th century, the growth of print magazines and journals created a strong demand for short fiction of between 3,000 and 15,000 words.

In the United Kingdom, [[Thomas Hardy]] wrote dozens of short stories, including "[[The Three Strangers]]" (1883), "[[A Mere Interlude]]" (1885) and "[[Barbara of the House of Grebe]]" (1890). Rudyard Kipling published [[short story collection]]s for grown-ups, e.g. ''[[Plain Tales from the Hills]]'' (1888), as well as for children, e.g. ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894). In 1892 [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] brought the [[detective fiction|detective story]] to a new height with ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]''. [[H.G. Wells]] wrote his first [[science fiction]] stories in the 1880s. One of his best known is "[[The Country of the Blind]]" (1904).

In the United States, [[Herman Melville]] published his story collection ''[[The Piazza Tales]]'' in 1856.  "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]" was the title story of [[Mark Twain]]'s first book one year later. In 1884, [[Brander Matthews]], the first American professor of dramatic literature, published ''The Philosophy of the Short-Story''. At that same year, Matthews was the first one to name the emerging genre "short story". Another theorist of [[narrative]] [[fiction]] was [[Henry James]]. James wrote a lot of short stories himself, including "[[The Real Thing (story)|The Real Thing]]" (1892), "Maud-Evelyn" and ''[[The Beast in the Jungle]]'' (1903). In the 1890s [[Kate Chopin]] published short stories in several magazines.

The most prolific French author of short stories was Guy de Maupassant. Stories like "''[[Boule de Suif]]''" ("Ball of Fat", 1880) and "''L'Inutile Beauté''" ("The Useless Beauty", 1890) are good examples of French [[Literary realism|realism]].

In Russia, [[Ivan Turgenev]] gained recognition with his story collection ''[[A Sportsman's Sketches]]''. [[Nikolai Leskov]] created his first short stories in the 1860s. Late in his life [[Fyodor Dostoyevski]] wrote "[[A Gentle Creature|The Meek One]]" (1876) and "[[The Dream of a Ridiculous Man]]" (1877), two stories with great psychological and philosophical depth. [[Leo Tolstoy]] handled ethical questions in his short stories, for example in "[[Ivan the Fool (story)|Ivan the Fool]]" (1885), "[[How Much Land Does a Man Need?]]" (1886) and "[[Alyosha the Pot]]" (1905). The greatest specialist of the Russian short story, however, was Anton Chekhov. Classic examples of his realistic prose are "[[The Bet (short story)|The Bet]]" (1889), "Ward No. 6" (1892), and "[[The Lady with the Dog]]" (1899). [[Maxim Gorky]]'s best known short story is "[[Twenty-six Men and a Girl]]" (1899).

The prolific Indian author of short stories [[Munshi Premchand]], pioneered the genre in the [[Hindustani language]], writing a substantial body of short stories and novels in a style characterized by realism and an unsentimental and authentic introspection into the complexities of Indian society. [[Premchand]]'s work, including his over 200 short stories (such as the story "Lottery") and his novel [[Godaan]] remain substantial works.

A master of the short story, the Urdu language writer [[Saadat Hasan Manto]], is revered for his exceptional depth, irony and sardonic humour. The author of some 250 short stories, radio plays, essays, reminiscences and a novel, Manto is widely admired for his analyses of violence, bigotry, prejudice and the relationships between reason and unreason. Combining realism with surrealism and irony, Manto's works such as the celebrated short story [[Toba Tek Singh]] are aesthetic masterpieces which continue to give profound insight into the nature of human loss, violence and devastation.

In India, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] published short stories, on the lives of the poor and oppressed such as peasants, women and villagers under colonial misrule and exploitation.

In Poland, [[Bolesław Prus]] was the most important author of short stories. In 1888 he wrote "[[A Legend of Old Egypt]]".

[[Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis|Machado de Assis]], one of the majors novelist from Brazil was the most important short story writer from his country at the time, under influences (among others) of [[Xavier de Maistre]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], [[Guy de Maupassant]]. In the end of the 19th century the writer [[João do Rio]] became popular by short stories about the [[bohemianism]]. Writing about the former slaves, and very ironical about [[nationalism]], [[Lima Barreto]] died almost forgotten, but became very popular in the 20th century.

In Portuguese literature, the major names of the time are [[Almeida Garrett]] and the [[historian]] and novelist [[Alexandre Herculano]]. Still influential, [[Eça de Queiroz]] produced some short stories with a style influenced by [[Émile Zola]], [[Balzac]] and [[Dickens]].

=== 1900–1945 ===
In the United Kingdom, periodicals like ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' and ''[[Story-Teller]]'' contributed to the popularity of the short story. Hector Hugh Munro (1870–1916), also known by his pen name of [[Saki]], wrote [[satire|satirical]] short stories about [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] England. [[W. Somerset Maugham]], who wrote over a hundred short stories, was one of the most popular authors of his time. [[P.G. Wodehouse]] published his first collection of comical stories about valet [[Jeeves]] in 1917. Many [[detective fiction|detective stories]] were written by [[G.K. Chesterton]], [[Agatha Christie]] and [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]. Short stories by [[Virginia Woolf]] are "[[Kew Gardens (short story)|Kew Gardens]]" (1919) and "Solid Objects," about a politician with mental problems. [[Graham Greene]] wrote his [[Twenty-One Stories]] between 1929 and 1954. A specialist of the short story was [[V.S. Pritchett]], whose first collection appeared in 1932. [[Arthur C. Clarke]] published his first [[science fiction]] story, "[[Travel by Wire!]]" in 1937. [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Muriel Spark]] and [[L.P. Hartley]] were other popular British storytellers whose career started in this period.

In Ireland, [[James Joyce]] published his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' in 1914. These stories, written in a more accessible style than his later novels, are based on careful observation of the inhabitants of his birth city.

In the first half of the 20th century, a number of high-profile American magazines such as ''The [[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' published short stories in each issue. The demand for quality short stories was so great and the money paid for such so well that F. Scott Fitzgerald repeatedly turned to short-story (as Matthews preferred to write it) writing to pay his numerous debts. His first collection ''[[Flappers and Philosophers]]'' appeared in book form in 1920. William Faulkner wrote over one hundred short stories. ''[[Go Down, Moses (book)|Go Down, Moses]]'', a collection of seven stories, appeared in 1941. Ernest Hemingway's concise writing style was perfectly fit for shorter fiction. Stories like "[[A Clean, Well-Lighted Place]]" (1926), "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" (1927) and "[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]" (1936) are only a few pages long, but carefully crafted. [[Dorothy Parker]]'s bittersweet story "Big Blonde" debuted in 1929. A popular [[science fiction]] story is "[[Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall]]" by [[Isaac Asimov]].

[[Katherine Mansfield]] from New Zealand wrote many short stories between 1912 and her death in 1923. "[[The Doll's House (short story)|The Doll's House]]" (1922) treats the topic of social inequity.

Two important authors of short stories in the [[German language]] were [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Franz Kafka]]. In 1922 the latter wrote "[[A Hunger Artist]]", about a man who [[Fasting|fasts]] for several days.

[[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]] (1892–1927) is called the Father of the Japanese short story.

In Brazil, the most famous modern short story writer is [[Mário de Andrade]]. At the time, [[São Paulo|Paulistan]] writer [[António de Alcantâra Machado]] became very popular from his collection of short stories titled, ''Brás, Bexiga e Barra Funda'' (1928), about several Italian neighborhoods, but now he is mostly read in just São Paulo. Also, novelist [[Graciliano Ramos]] and poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]] have significant short story works.

Portuguese writers like [[Mário de Sá-Carneiro]], [[Florbela Espanca]] and [[Fernando Pessoa]] wrote well-known short stories, although their major genre was poetry.

=== 1945 to modern day ===
The period following [[World War II]] saw a great flowering of literary short fiction in the United States. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' continued to publish the works of the form's leading mid-century practitioners, including [[Shirley Jackson]], whose story, "[[The Lottery]]", published in 1948, elicited the strongest response in the magazine's history to that time. Other frequent contributors during the last 1940s included [[John Cheever]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Jean Stafford]], and [[Eudora Welty]]. [[J.D. Salinger]]'s  ''Nine Stories'' (1953) experimented with point of view and voice, while [[Flannery O'Connor]]'s story "[[A Good Man is Hard to Find]]" (1955) reinvigorated the [[Southern Gothic]] style. Cultural and social identity played a considerable role in much of the short fiction of the 1960s. [[Philip Roth]] and [[Grace Paley]] cultivated distinctive Jewish-American voices. [[Tillie Olsen]]'s "[[I Stand Here Ironing]]" (1961) adopted a consciously feminist perspective. [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]'s collection ''[[Going to Meet the Man]]'' (1965) told stories of African-American life. [[Frank O'Connor]]'s ''[[The Lonely Voice]]'', an exploration of the short story, appeared in 1963. [[Wallace Stegner]]'s short stories are primarily set in the American West. [[Stephen King]] published many short stories in men's magazines in the 1960s and after. The 1970s saw the rise of the postmodern short story in the works of [[Donald Barthelme]] and [[John Barth]]. Traditionalists including [[John Updike]] and [[Joyce Carol Oates]] maintained significant influence on the form. [[Minimalism]] gained widespread influence in the 1980s, most notably in the work of [[Raymond Carver]] and [[Ann Beattie]].

Canadian short story writers include [[Alice Munro]], [[Mavis Gallant]], and Lynn Coady.

In the United Kingdom, [[Daphne du Maurier]] wrote [[suspense]] stories like "[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]" (1952) and "[[Don't Look Now]]" (1971). [[Roald Dahl]] was the master of the twist-in-the-tale. Short story collections like ''Lamb to the Slaughter'' (1953) and ''[[Kiss Kiss (book)|Kiss Kiss]]'' (1960) illustrate his dark humour.

In Italy, [[Italo Calvino]] published the short story collection ''[[Marcovaldo]]'', about a poor man in a city, in 1963.

In Brazil, the short story became popular among female writers like [[Clarice Lispector]], [[Lygia Fagundes Telles]], [[Adélia Prado]], who wrote about their society from a feminine viewpoint, although the genre has great male writers like [[Dalton Trevisan]], [[Autran Dourado]] [[Moacyr Scliar]] and [[Carlos Heitor Cony]] too. Also, writing about poverty and the [[favela]]s, [[João Antonio]] became a well known writer. Other post-modern short fiction authors include writers [[Hilda Hilst]] and [[Caio Fernando Abreu]]. Detective literature was led by [[Rubem Fonseca]]. It is also necessary to mention [[João Guimarães Rosa]], wrote short stories in the book ''Sagarana'' using a complex, experimental language based on tales of oral traditional.

Portuguese writers like [[Virgílo Ferreira]], [[Fernando Goncalves Namora]] and [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]] are among the most influential short story writers from 20th-century Portuguese language literature. [[Manuel da Silva Ramos]] is one of the most well-known names of [[postmodernism]] in the country. [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[José Saramago]] published few short stories, but became popular from his novels.

The [[Angloa|Angolan]] writer [[José Luandino Vieira]] is one of the most well-known writers from his country and has several short stories. [[José Eduardo Agualusa]] is also increasingly read in Portuguese-speaking countries.

[[Republic of Mozambique|Mozambican]] [[Mia Couto]] is a widely known writer of post modern prose, and he is read even in non-Portuguese speaking countries. Other Mozambican writers such as [[Suleiman Cassamo]], [[Paulina Chiziane]] and [[Eduardo White]] are gaining popularity with Portuguese-speakers too.

The [[Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] is one of the most famous writers of short stories in the [[Spanish language]]. "[[The Library of Babel]]" (1941) and "[[The Aleph (short story)|The Aleph]]" (1945) handle difficult subjects like [[infinity]]. Two of the most representative writers of the [[Magical realism]] genre are also widely known Argentinian short story writers: [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] and [[Julio Cortázar]].

The [[Uruguay]]an writer [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] is known as one of the most important magical realist writer from Latin America.

In [[Colombia]], the [[Nobel prize]] laureate author [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]] is the main novelist and short story writer, known by his magical realist stories and his defense of the [[Communist Party]] in his country.

The [[Peruvian]] writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], also a [[Nobel prize]] winner, has significant short story works.

The [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Nobel Prize]]-winner Naguib Mafouz is the most well-known author from his country, but has only a few short stories.

Japanese world-known short story writers include [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] ([[Nobel prize]] winner of 1994), [[Yukio Mishima]] and [[Haruki Murakami]].

Multi-awarded [[Philippine]] writer [[Peter Solis Nery]] is one of the most famous writers of short stories in [[Hiligaynon language]]. His stories "Lirio" (1998), "Candido" (2007), "Donato Bugtot" (2011), and "Si Padre Olan kag ang Dios" (2013) are all gold prize winners at the [[Palanca Awards]] of [[Philippine Literature]].

==Characteristics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
As a concentrated, concise form of narrative and descriptive prose fiction, the short story has been theorized through the traditional elements of [[dramatic structure]]: '''exposition''' (the introduction of setting, situation and main characters), '''complication''' (the event that introduces the conflict), [[rising action]], '''crisis''' (the decisive moment for the protagonist and his commitment to a course of action), '''climax''' (the point of highest interest in terms of the conflict and the point with the most action) and '''resolution''' (the point when the conflict is resolved). Because of their length, short stories may or may not follow this pattern. For example, modern short stories only occasionally have an exposition, more typically beginning in the middle of the action (''[[in medias res]]''). As with longer stories, plots of short stories also have a climax, crisis, or turning point. However, the endings of many short stories are abrupt and open and may or may not have a moral or practical lesson. As with any art form, the exact characteristics of a short story will vary by creator.

'''Subjectivity''' is a central [[philosophical]] concept, related to [[consciousness]], [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[personhood]], [[reality]], and [[truth]], which has been variously defined by sources. Three common definitions include that subjectivity is the quality or condition of:
* Something being a ''[[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]'', narrowly meaning an individual who possesses conscious experiences, such as perspectives, feelings, beliefs, and desires.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon|Solomon, Robert C.]] "Subjectivity," in Honderich, Ted. ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] (Oxford University Press, 2005), p.900.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Something being a ''subject'', broadly meaning an entity that has [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], meaning that it acts upon or wields power over some other entity (an ''[[Object (philosophy)|object]]'').&lt;ref name=Allen2002&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09672550210121432 |title=Power, Subjectivity, and Agency: Between Arendt and Foucault |journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=131–49 |year=2002 |last1=Allen |first1=Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some information, idea, situation, or physical thing considered true only from the perspective of a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] or subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 |title=Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography |journal=Geoforum |volume=75 |pages=249–52 |year=2016 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These various definitions of subjectivity are sometimes joined together in philosophy. The term is most commonly used as an explanation for that which influences, informs, and biases people's judgments about truth or reality; it is the collection of the perceptions, experiences, expectations, personal or cultural understanding, and beliefs specific to a person. 

Subjectivity is contrasted to the philosophy of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], which is described as a view of truth or reality that is free of any individual's biases, interpretations, feelings, and imaginings.&lt;ref name="solomon" /&gt; 

==Philosophy==
The rise of the notion of subjectivity has its philosophical roots in the thinking of [[Descartes]] and [[Kant]], and its articulation throughout the modern era has depended on the understanding of what constitutes an individual. There have been various interpretations of such concepts as the self and the soul, and the identity or [[self-consciousness]] which lies at the root of the notion of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strazzoni |first1=Andrea |year=2015 |title=Subjectivity and individuality: Two strands in early modern philosophy: Introduction |journal=Societate si Politica |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=5–9 |hdl=1765/92270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjectivity is, for instance, frequently the implicit topic of [[existentialism]], Sartre as one of its main proponents emphasizing subjectivity in his phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.ophen.org/2016/11/02/jean-paul-sartre-subjectivity-2/ |title=Jean-Paul Sartre: What is Subjectivity?
 |last=Thalos |first=Mariam |date=2016 |website=http://reviews.ophen.org/ |publisher=(Article review of Sartre's 'What is Subjectivity' published byVerso Books) |access-date=11/10/18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his colleague [[Merleau-Ponty]], Sartre believed that, even within the material force of human society, the ego was an essentially transcendent being- posited, for instance, in his opus ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' through his arguments about the 'being-for-others' and the 'for-itself' (i.e., an objective and subjective human being).

==Sociology==
Subjectivity is an inherently social mode that comes about through innumerable interactions within society. As much as subjectivity is a process of [[individuation]], it is equally a process of socialization, the individual never being isolated in a self-contained environment, but endlessly engaging in interaction with the surrounding world.
Culture is a living totality of the subjectivity of any given society constantly undergoing transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, H.J. ed., 2014. Questioning foundations: truth, subjectivity and culture. Routledge.{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectivity is both shaped by it and shapes it in turn, but also by other things like the economy, political institutions, communities, as well as the natural world.

Though the boundaries of societies and their cultures are indefinable and arbitrary, the subjectivity inherent in each one is palatable and can be recognized as distinct from others. Subjectivity is in part a particular experience or organization of [[reality]], which includes how one views and interacts with humanity, objects, consciousness, and nature, so the difference between different cultures brings about an alternate experience of existence that forms life in a different manner. A common effect on an individual of this disjunction between subjectivities is [[culture shock]], where the subjectivity of the other culture is considered alien and possibly incomprehensible or even hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00330124.2012.693876 |title=Learning Wisdom Through Geographical Dislocations |journal=The Professional Geographer |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=390–5 |year=2013 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political subjectivity]] is an emerging concept in social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref name=Allen2002/&gt; Political subjectivity is a reference to the deep embeddedness of subjectivity in the socially intertwined systems of power and meaning.  "Politicality," writes [http://artsandscience.usask.ca/profile/SRahimi Sadeq Rahimi] in ''[http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/ Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity]'', "is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject ''is''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rahimi|first1=Sadeq|title=Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity: A Study of Schizophrenia and Culture in Turkey|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxford &amp; New York|isbn=1138840823|page=8|url=http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/|ref=Rahimi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bog People: Iron-Age Man Preserved''''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] study of the [[bog bodies of Northern Europe]] written by the Danish archaeologist [[Peter Glob|P.V. Glob]]. First published in 1965 by [[Gyldendal]] under the Danish title of ''Mosefolket: Jernalderens Mennesker bevaret i 2000 År'', it was translated into English by the English archaeologist [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]] and published by [[Faber and Faber]] in 1969. In 1966 it was translated into German by Thyra Dohrenburg and published by Winkler Werlag Munich under the title ''Die Schläfer im Moor'' (English: ''The Sleepers in the Bog'').

''The Bog People'' is divided into six chapters. The first is devoted to [[Tollund Man]], and the second to [[Grauballe Man]], two of the best known Iron Age bog bodies to have been discovered in [[Jutland]], [[Denmark]]. The third and fourth chapters are devoted to the wider context of bog bodies first in Denmark and then in other parts of Europe. The final two chapters are devoted to a wider exposition of life and death in Iron Age Denmark.

Glob's book received positive reviews from both [[Barry Cunliffe]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and Ralph M. Rowlett in ''[[American Anthropologist]]''. They praised Glob's arguments as well as his writing style and use of illustrations, alongside Bruce-Mitford's translation. In subsequent decades, it has received both praise and criticism from specialists in the field, who have lauded the publicity which it brought to the subject, but rejected many of Glob's conclusions as being based on insufficient evidence.

==Synopsis==
Chapter one, "The Tollund Man", is devoted to [[Tollund Man|the bog body of the same name]] that was discovered in 1950 in Tollund Fell, Bjaeldskov Dal in Jutland, Denmark. Glob discusses the excavation of the corpse, and his own personal involvement with the operation. Outlining the find's removal to the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]], he then outlines the manner in which the head was [[Conservation-restoration|conserved]] for public display at the [[Silkeborg|Silkeborg Museum]]. Alongside this he also discusses the archaeological context of Tollund Man, examining the manner in which he was executed, his clothing, and the contents of his last meal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glo69|Glob 1969]]. pp. 21&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt; The second chapter, entitled "The Grauballe Man", deals with the [[Grauballe Man|eponymous bog body]] found in 1952 at Nebelgård Fen, located  {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} east of Tolland. Like with the previous chapter, Glob discusses his own personal investigation into the body, outlining its discovery and conservation, as well as the context of his death and burial.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glo69|Glob 1969]]. pp. 33&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tollundmannen.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Tolland Man, one of the Danish corpses discussed by Glob.]]

In the third chapter, "Bog People in Denmark", Glob notes that there have been over 150 bog bodies found in Denmark, and proceeds to provide a number of examples including [[Haraldskær Woman]] and the [[Borremose bodies]], in doing so highlighting the similarities that exist between them. Noting that many of these were discovered in the 19th and early 20th centuries, he explains that little can be known for most of them because methods of archaeological investigation and conservation were unavailable at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glo69|Glob 1969]]. pp. 49&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four, "Bog People in Other Countries", explores similar bog bodies which have been discovered in neighbouring Germany and the Netherlands, such as [[Windeby I]], making reference to the cataloging project undertaken by the German archaeologist [[Alfred Dieck]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glo69|Glob 1969]]. pp. 75&amp;ndash;86.&lt;/ref&gt;

"How They Lived" is the title of the fifth chapter, and explores the wider context of life in Iron Age Denmark, dealing with such issues as class divisions, houses and garments.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glo69|Glob 1969]]. pp. 87&amp;ndash;104.&lt;/ref&gt; The final chapter, "When Death Came", looks at the place of death in Iron Age Denmark, outlining ordinary funerary remains, which include both cremation and inhumation. Contrasting these methods of dealing with the dead to the corpses left in the bogs, he argues that the latter must represent evidence for a widespread tradition of [[human sacrifice]] devoted to a fertility goddess, citing the writings of [[Tacitus]] as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glo69|Glob 1969]]. pp. 105&amp;ndash;132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Academic reviews===
The ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal published a review provided by the English archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]] of the [[University of Southampton]]. He expresses only one disappointment with Glob's work, that there is what he sees as a lack of information on the daily life and social structure of Iron Age Denmark. He nevertheless feels compensated by the final chapter, which he describes as representing Glob "at his best, building-up, in detective-style fashion", a picture of ritual behavior in the Iron Age. Praising the use of photographs as "brilliant", he refers to the "attractive" translation of Bruce-Mitford, and considers the overall effect to be "stimulating and provocative". Summarizing ''The Bog People'', he labels it a "splendid book, full of detail and fascination" for both specialists and a wider readership interested in archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cun69|Cunliffe 1969]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralph M. Rowlett of the [[University of Missouri]] wrote a review of ''The Bog People'' for the journal ''[[American Anthropologist]]''. He began his review by describing his background interest in bog bodies, and highlighting that he had married one of Glob's graduate students. He proceeds to note that there is much in the book that would be of interest to anthropologists, and he hoped that they would not be put off by its use of "gossip and anecdote" and its "intensely personal and culturally ultra-Danish tone", which he attributes to Glob's attempts to reach a wider, non-academic audience. Praising Glob's use of ethnohistory and epic literature to illuminate the Early Iron Age, he claims that ''The Bog People'' represents "one of the best modern ethnographic descriptions of the North Germani of that era" and that it furthermore provides evidence in support of Tacitus' claims. Rowlett goes on to praise Bruce-Mitford's translation, but believes that he has a "slight tendency to over-translate" with place names, and also disagrees with his decision to convert centimeters into inches. Ending his review, Rowlett notes that along with Alfred Deick's catalog of bog bodies, ''The Bog People'' represented "a starter for a by no means exhausted field."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Row70|Rowlett 1970]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider reception===
In an [[academic paper]] discussing the bog bodies which was published in 1995, C.S. Briggs criticised Glob for jumping to conclusions that were not supported by the evidence, exclaiming "Can Glob's book today actually pass muster as responsible popular scholarship?". In particular, they highlighted that he ascribed many bodies to the Iron Age when they had not been securely [[carbon dating|carbon dated]] and that he overconfidently proclaimed the [[Drumkeeragh Lady]] from Medieval Ireland to be a Danish Viking despite a lack of supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bri95|Briggs 1995]]. p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book on bog bodies, Wijnand Van der Sanden paid homage to Glob's ''The Bog Bodies'', describing it as a "highly accessible work" which had done more than any other to bring publicity to the bog cadavers. Exclaiming that he was filled with admiration for the work, he noted that he wished that he himself had written it 30 years before.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San96|Van der Sanden 1996]]. pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2007 edited volume on the reinvestigation of Grauballe Man, Pauline Asingh and Niels Lynnerup stated that Glob's book had represented a "major contribution" to the study of bog bodies which "awoke many people's interest in prehistory".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Asi07|Asingh and Lynnerup 2007]]. pp. 9&amp;ndash;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2009 study of the cultural and artistic reception of the bog bodies, Karin Sanders noted that she had first become interested in archaeology through reading a copy of ''Mosefolket'' in her primary school's library, near to Copenhagen. Proceeding to describe the book as "a classic", she noted that even in the 21st century, it continued to offer the "source book" for artistic expressions of bog bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San09|Sanders 2009]]. pp. xiii&amp;ndash;xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeding to explore the influence of Glob's tome, she noted that many artists and writers had used it as a basis for learning more about the bog bodies, to whom their works were dedicated, and that Glob himself had successfully blended an engaging narrative with archaeological information, and that he was "profoundly influenced by the potentiality of interaction between fact and fiction."&lt;ref&gt;[[#San09|Sanders 2009]]. pp. 17&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Discovery of India''''' was written by India's first [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Pandit|Pt.]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] during his imprisonment in 1942–46 at [[Ahmednagar fort]] in [[Maharashtra]], India by British during the rule of East India Company. ''The Discovery of India'' is an honour paid to the rich cultural heritage of India, its history and its philosophy as seen through the eyes of a patriot fighting for the independence of his country. The book is widely considered one of the finest modern works on Indian history.{{cn|date=February 2018}} book written in 1944 but published in 1946 as per ground sources

==Synopsis==
The journey in The Discovery of India begins from ancient history, leading up to the last years of the [[British Raj]]. He uses his knowledge of the [[Upanishads]], [[Vedas]], and textbooks on ancient history to introduce to the reader the development of India from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], through the changes in socio-political old scene scenario every foreign invader brought, to the present day conditions.

Nehru was jailed for his participation in the [[Quit India]] movement along with other Indian leaders, and he used this time to write down his thoughts and knowledge about India's history. The book is widely regarded as a classic in India since its first publication in 1946{{cn|date=February 2018}}, and provides a broad view of Indian [[History of India|history]], philosophy and [[Culture of India|culture]], as viewed from the eyes of a liberal Indian fighting for the [[independence]] of his country.&lt;ref name="das"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Das |first=Taraknath|title=India--Past, Present and the Future |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=295–304|date=June 1947 |doi=10.2307/2144210 |jstor=2144210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Discovery of India'', Nehru argued that India was a historic nation with a right to sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, Craig, Nations Matter: Culture, History and the Cosmopolitan Dream, Routledge, p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt; This book also analyses in depth the philosophy of Indian life.

==Other Contributors==
Nehru attributes some of the content of the book to his fellow prisoners at Ahmednagar jail. He gives special mention to four of them namely, [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]],  [[Govind Ballabh Pant]],  [[Narendra Deva]] and [[Asaf Ali]]. All his fellow prisoners (eleven of them) were political prisoners from various parts of the country, having deep knowledge about the various aspects of India which the book discusses. They also participated in proofreading Nehru's work and providing him with creative suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;The Discovery of India by Jawaharlal Nehru (paperback, thirteenth edition), {{ISBN|0-19-562359-2}}, Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edition==
The book is presently published by the 'Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund' and the copyright for the book is held by his grand daughter-in-law [[Sonia Gandhi]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''''The Extremists''''' is a 2009 [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[C.J. Hopkins]], published by [[Broadway Play Publishing]]. A political satire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Extremists-CJ-Hopkins/dp/0881454419|title=The Extremists|last=Hopkins|first=C. J.|date=2010-11-01|publisher=Broadway Play Pub|isbn=9780881454413|edition= first |location=NY, NY|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing  [[United States|American]] views on [[extremism]] and foreign [[terrorism]], it revolves around a television talk show host interviewing a counterterrorist expert on the imminent danger of the extremist threat. The play first premiered at the English Theatre Berlin, in [[Berlin, Germany]], in February 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etberlin.de/production/the-extremists/|title=The Extremists {{!}} English Theatre Berlin|website=www.etberlin.de|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a production at Seven Stages Theatre in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in March 2009.

==Plot==
The play begins by welcoming audiences to "Issues in Focus," a political news and talk program based out of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and introduces them to the show's host, self-described Washington insider Dick Hedgerow. Dick announces the entirety of the night's program will be devoted to an in-depth discussion on the threat of extremism and welcomes his guest; Norman "Norm" Krieger, a co-founder of the fictitious polling and counterterrorism organization, the Center of Advanced Strategic Studies. Norm has been invited on the show to discuss his newly-published book, ''Extremism in the 21st Century'', which focuses on the mindset of extremists and their psychological motivations, as well as how they're able to spread their beliefs globally. Norm explains that he believes extremism should be considered the final threat to a democratic world (albeit there are other, manageable threats that are easy to handle), and tells Dick that while the government should be constantly fighting back against this threat, it's important to keep the public placated, and allow them to carry on with their normal lives.

Norm further elaborates that as the threat of extremism is combated, the public's understanding of it will be skewed, and it will ultimately become too difficult to keep up with the narrative, and the majority of the details will be indiscernible. Dick insists that this isn't an issue, suggesting that they refrain from complete transparency with the American people, citing security concerns, and instead try and help them adjust the way they see things, which Norm claims were his motivations for writing his book. As their discussion continues, Dick inquires about a concrete definition of the word "extremism," which Norm initially struggles with; he eventually decides that extremism is primarily defined by violence, or advocating for its use. When Dick asks if this definition transcends political leanings, such as [[conservativism|conservative]] or [[liberalism|liberal]] views, Norm proposes that these labels have lost their meaning beyond the competition aspect, but later contradicts himself when he says it is absolutely necessary for America to maintain the two-party system, as a country with no ideological opposition would be undemocratic.

The interview then shifts gears as it begins to investigate the extremists' intentions, which Norm believes is not only to incite violence but to make people think, asking complicated and dangerous questions that will only lead to insanity. Instead of engaging in the destructive act of thinking, Norm insists that the viewers need to stick to the facts provided by those in power in the government and the media and unquestionably devote their minds to the programming that "freedom-loving people" such as himself are trying to ensure all of society conforms to. When Dick objects to this concept, claiming it is nothing better than the brainwashing that extremists are guilty of, Norm reassures him that this is brainwashing people with the truth, while the other option is to be brainwashed with "made-up extremist nonsense." As the play carries on, Dick and Norm constantly renege on their stances and their beliefs, and at its conclusion, they nearly break the [[fourth wall]], seemingly aware that they are actors in an elaborate performance and are no less extremists than the terrorists they have warned the audience of.

==Production History==
''The Extremists'' was first produced at the English Theatre Berlin, in February 2009, directed by [[Walter D. Asmus]]. It was followed by a production at Seven Stages Theatre, who co-produced the original showing, in Atlanta, Georgia, in March of the same year.

In 2010, a staged reading of the play was performed at the [[Schauspielhaus Bochum]] in [[Bochum, Germany|Bochum]], Germany, as well as the Acker Stadt Palast performing arts center in Berlin, 2012. A German translation of the play translated by Jasna Miletic was used for both productions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cjhopkins.com/stage-plays/the-extremists/|title=The Extremists|date=2013-01-09|work=CJ Hopkins|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy Productions &amp; Assembly produced the play at the 2013 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], with David Calvitto in the role of Norman Krieger, and Carol Scudder playing Jane Woolwraith, a female counterpart to the script's Dick Hedgerow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alledinburghtheatre.com/the-extremists-c-j-hopkins-interviewed/|title=The Extremists’ C.J. Hopkins interviewed  : All Edinburgh Theatre.com|website=www.alledinburghtheatre.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 production was performed at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], directed by Raymond Munro, with Jake Rosenthal as Norman Krieger, and Brett Iarrobino as Dick Hedgerow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovercentralma.org/sp/the-extremists/|title=The Extremists - ClarkArts|date=2018-04-18|work=CJ Hopkins|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Reception==
Critics have praised the play for its complex and intricate text; a review of the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe production describes Hopkins' script as a "fiendishly complex rollercoaster."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critics found the performances of Calvitto and Scudder dazzling, citing an incredible pace, and noting that audiences would leave the show questioning their understanding of western democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/the-extremists-assembly-roxy-9151|title=Theatre review: The Extremists at Assembly Roxy|website=www.britishtheatreguide.info|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolja Reichert of the German newspaper [[Der Tagesspiegel]] called the performance at the English Theatre Berlin "heady theater in the truest sense," and focused on the question of reality: "Hopkins builds a construct of ideas out of rhetoric until everything revolves around one thing - what is the truth for the good guys and what is it for the bad guys?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/kurz-und-kritisch/1447974.html|title=KURZ &amp; KRITISCH|language=de|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the production in [[Die Tageszeitung]] claimed the play was an excellent example of the advantages theater holds over film, in that it lays bare the mechanisms of the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Who Killed Johnny''''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]–[[United States of America|US]] [[screwball-comedy]] film by [[Yangzom Brauen]], filmed and produced in [[Los Angeles]] in 2013.

== Plot==
Melanie and Max, two actors who are unknown in the USA, have ambitious expectations and want to write a script for a Hollywood blockbuster. Working for the perfect script in the home of the Swiss actress, Melanie Winiger, she and her school friend, Max Loong, also a Swiss actor, and two friends watch a hit and run from their house, and it is none other than [[Johnny Depp]], obviously dead. What to do with such a well known body ... as to take to their change! Unintentionally taken hashish, sex, at least in their minds, philosophy, overboarding phantasies and talks, a mix of love and little violence and the everyday life behind the scenes of the glittering metropolis, [[Los Angeles]]: four immigrants and their friends demonstrate the craziness of the movie business, but also the loving and bizarre people of LA. The actors are narcissistic, the director phlegmatic and the crew on the brink of a nervous breakdown. Shooting days will be full of mishaps and in the end the corpse is given a second chance at life, almost.

== Plot ==
In the first scene of the film, Melanie is at six in the morning brewing ''[[Espresso]]'' in her kitchen; a scene that will be repeated several times. Her alleged boyfriend tries quietly to come in the house,  there is a dispute because of his infidelity, and Melanie is stabbed by ''Carlos'' in the kitchen.

''Melanie'' ([[Melanie Winiger]]) lives in [[Los Angeles]] and tried with her childhood friend ''Alex'' ([[Max Loong]]) who also grew up in Zürich in Switzerland, to write the screenplay for a movie in her living room. Both Swiss live in Los Angeles, as actress and actors unknown in their new home, but full of dreams and ambitions in the movie business. They seem to agree only about the planned movie's opening scene in the kitchen, and the male actor ''Carlos''; but not about the further story, whether there should be a comedy, tragedy, a horror movie or thriller. Throughout the day, they muse about the script, fooling around, interrupted by two of their neighbours, ''Jambo'' (Ernest Allan Hausmann) and his girlfriend ''Gudrun'' ([[Jordan Carver]]), which like to enjoy themselves in Melanie's pool in the garden. Alex is watching fascinated the hustle and bustle of the two, in particular of Gudrun in the pool during a work break, developing the screenplay in thoughts, as Melanie in the living room, where she thinks about it, the protagonists of the film to make their quirky friends in Los Angeles, also originating in Switzerland. Both unaware that the brownies from Jambo not for the hosts were intended, as they included hashish and tremendously stimulate, the shown fantasies of Alex and Melanie in the movie, which had consumed wine before ...

In a later scene, the quartet discovers from the balcony a man lying at the bottom of the street, and seems to the victim of a car accident. Jambo wants to help, Melanie denies to avoid problems with the police, as they are foreigners in the United States; Gudrun and Jambo come from Germany, Jambo is illegal in the United States, and three of them are also colored people, as Melanie sets them apart after Jambo brought the supposedly dead in Melanie's apartment. Now in panic, they think about how 'to rid of the dead'. Before they can implement that idea, they notice that the dead man is undoubtedly [[Johnny Depp]] ...

The quartet misuse the 'godsend' amateurish, to integrate the supposed star in snippets of their film: love scenes with Gudrun and Melanie, a scene inspired with Melanie in a car inspired by ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' etc. They are interrupted by a self-claimed policeman who inquires on the doorstep to witness a probable [[hit-and-run]] and the remains of the victim, Alex' hash dealer, and ''Hasso'' and friend which each unannounced bursts in the apartment. Melanie would like to the dead 'get rid of' and Alex knows a ''[[Cleaner (crime)|cleaner]]'', which takes the supposed corpse out of the house. In a very short scene, the plastic bag used for that suppose moves, and the non-visible cleaner (but being the police officer) "You had to be dead" says and hits with a stick on his victim.

Three months later the first scene of the film is taken finally: Alex (Director), Jambo (sound), [[Yangzom Brauen]] and two other friends for camera, script and mask, and Melanie (writer, cover). Gudrun acts as the lead actress and [[Carlos Leal]] as ''Marcel'' in the male lead role. Because Carlos is concerned about his motivation and especially the unpleasant role as villain, as he claims, the production is delayed more and more, and growing disputes between him as 'professional' and Gudrun as 'amateur', so he shouts, thus the eighth take ends in a disaster – Alex is excited about the setting, but now the movie team now notices that Gudrun actually is stabbed by Marcel in effect.

In the final scene of the film, the fictional Swiss television channel CH1 reports in its newscast, that Carlos Leal, actor and former member of ''[[Sens Unik]]'',  has been arrested in Los Angeles for [[manslaughter]], as well as Melanie Winiger and Alex Loong are suspected to be enrolled in a pre-trial detention. A possible link is mentioned with a [[look-alike]] of Johnny Depp, found death three months ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9718">'''William Reynolds Ferris''' (born February 5, 1942) is an American author and scholar and former chairman of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. With [[Judy Peiser]] he co-founded the [[Center for Southern Folklore]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; he was the founding director of the [[Center for the Study of Southern Culture]] at the [[University of Mississippi]], and is co-editor of ''The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture''.

==Biography==

William R. Ferris was born 5 February 1942 in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. He attended public school in Vicksburg until high school, when he was accepted to [[Brooks School]] in North Andover, Mass. Ferris got his B.A. in English Literature at [[Davidson College]] in 1964, and an M.A. in English Literature from [[Northwestern University]] in 1965. He attended [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin, Ireland, for one year from 1965 to 1966, and returned to the U.S. to continue his graduate studies. In 1967, he received a Master's and, in 1969, a Ph.D. in folklore from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

Ferris's scholarship has focused on southern [[African American]] folklore and culture, through a variety of media: print, sound, film, and photography. From 1970 to 1972, he was an assistant professor in the Department of English at [[Jackson State University]] in Mississippi. From 1972 to 1979, he was an associate professor in the American and Afro-American Studies Programs at [[Yale University]]. During his tenure at Yale, Ferris co-founded the Center for Southern Folklore in Mississippi, and was its director from 1972 to 1984. Ferris returned to the South, and, from 1979 to 1997, he was the founding director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture and a professor of anthropology at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. While there, he established several annual conferences, including the Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha Conference.

President [[Bill Clinton]] nominated Ferris to be the seventh [[Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities|Chair]] of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) in 1997, a post Ferris held through 2001. Ferris was the subject of some controversy in 2000 when the National Council on the Humanities, the NEH's advisory board, selected President Clinton for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], which the NEH describes as "the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jefferson Lecture honor had never been given to an elected official before; Ferris said that his intent was to establish a new tradition for every President to deliver a Jefferson Lecture during his or her presidency, and that this was consistent with the NEH's broader efforts under his leadership to increase public awareness of the humanities.  However, some scholars and political opponents objected that the choice of Clinton represented an inappropriate and unprecedented politicization of the NEH.  [[William J. Bennett]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and former chairman of the NEH under President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]], charged that the proposal was an example of how Clinton had "corrupted all of those around him."&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Molotsky, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE7D91F3CF932A1575AC0A96F958260 "Choice of Clinton to Give Humanities Lecture Meets Resistance," ] ''[[New York Times]]'', September 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of the controversy, President Clinton declined the honor; a [[White House]] spokesperson said the President "didn't want the work of the National Endowment for the Humanities to be called into question."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E3DC173FF931A1575AC0A96F958260 "National News Briefs; Clinton Declines Offer To Give Scholarly Talk,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', September 22, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;   Despite this controversy, and even after the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] replaced Clinton with Republican [[George W. Bush]], Ferris retained the strong support of Mississippi's two Republican senators, [[Trent Lott]] and [[Thad Cochran]].  They stressed Ferris's efforts during his tenure at NEH to reduce the ideological battles that had troubled the NEH under prior administrations, as well as his popularity among the state humanities leaders, and they publicly asked President Bush to retain Ferris.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Molotsky, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE7D81531F93AA35751C0A9679C8B63&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "2 in G.O.P. Ask Bush to Keep Clinton's Chief of Humanities,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', February 9, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bush ultimately decided to replace Ferris with his own appointee, [[Bruce Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Sciolino, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01EED71E3CF932A35755C0A9679C8B63 "Bush to Replace Chairman of Humanities Endowment,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', June 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Ferris was a Visiting Public Policy Scholar at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and joined the faculty at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] as the Senior Associate Director of the Center for the Study of the American South, professor of history, and adjunct professor in the Curriculum in Folklore. He currently teaches two seminars-- "Southern Music" and "Southern Literature and the Oral Tradition"—per year.

Ferris is an author of ten books, including ''You Live and Learn. Then You Die and Forget It All: Ray Lum's Tales of Horses, Mules and Men,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Ferris, William R. |author2=Lum, Ray | title=You live and learn, then you die and forget it all: Ray Lum's tales of horses, mules, and men | year=1992 | publisher=Anchor Books | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-385-41926-0 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-editor of the ''Encyclopedia of Southern Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Wilson, Charles Henry |author2=Ferris, William R. | title=Encyclopedia of Southern culture | year=1989 | publisher=University of North Carolina Press | location=Chapel Hill  | isbn=978-0-8078-1823-7 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent book, ''The South in Color: A Visual Journal'', was published in September, 2016, by UNC Press.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=3803&lt;/ref&gt; He has written fiction, poetry, and numerous articles on folklore and literature, as well as book, record, and film reviews. Ferris has recorded blues albums, produced 15 documentary films on southern folklore, and, for ten years, hosted the weekly Mississippi Public Radio blues show, Highway 61. Ferris's photography, documenting aspects of African American southern folklore, has been featured nationally, including in an exhibit by the Smithsonian Museum and an article by the New York Times.

Ferris has traveled and lectured extensively throughout Europe and the U.S. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including the [[National Humanities Medal|Charles Frankel Prize]] in the Humanities, bestowed by President Clinton, and France's Chevalier and Officer in the Order of Arts and Letters.  He has been honored by the [[Blues Hall of Fame]], which recognized his book ''Blues from the Delta''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Ferris, William R. |author2=Taylor, Billy | title=Blues from the Delta | year=1984 | publisher=Da Capo Press | location=New York, N.Y.  | isbn=978-0-306-80327-7 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the "Classics of Blues Literature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php4?ArtistId=23 Blues Hall of Fame Inductees: Blues from the Delta - Dr. William Ferris.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferris has four siblings. His brother, Grey, was a senator in the Mississippi State Legislature from 1992 to 2001, prior to his death from cancer in June 2008. Ferris is married to Marcie Cohen Ferris and has a daughter named Virginia.
