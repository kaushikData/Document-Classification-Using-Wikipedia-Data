      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4555">An '''absorption wavemeter''' is a simple electronic instrument used to measure the [[frequency]] of [[radio wave]]s.  It is an older method of measuring frequency, widely used from the birth of radio in the early 20th century until the 1970s, when the development of inexpensive [[frequency counter]]s, which have far greater accuracy, made it largely obsolete.  A wavemeter consists of an adjustable [[resonant circuit]] calibrated in frequency, with a meter or other means to measure the voltage or current in the circuit.  When adjusted to resonance with the unknown frequency, the resonant circuit absorbs energy, which is indicated by a dip on the meter.  Then the frequency can be read from the dial. 

Wavemeters are used for frequency measurements that do not require high accuracy, such as checking that a [[radio transmitter]] is operating within its correct frequency band, or checking for [[harmonic]]s in the output. Many radio amateurs keep them as a simple way to check their output frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darleys.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Radio/advanced/measure1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825164850/http://www.darleys.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Radio/advanced/measure1.htm |archivedate=2004-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com/content/neets/14188/css/14188_63.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125023832/http://www.tpub.com/content/neets/14188/css/14188_63.htm |archivedate=2006-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightbell.com/radio/antenna1.html#awavemeter |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208135406/http://www.brightbell.com/radio/antenna1.html |archivedate=2006-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar devices can be made for detection of mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creative-science.org.uk/absorb.html|title=A Mobile Phone Absorption Wave Meter|website=www.creative-science.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative, a [[dip meter]] can be used.

There are two categories of wavemeters: ''transmission wavemeters'', which have an input and an output port and are inserted into the signal path, or ''absorption wavemeters'', which are loosely coupled to the radio frequency source and absorb energy from it.

== HF and VHF ==

{{further|High frequency|Very high frequency}}

The most simple form of the device is a variable [[capacitor]] with a coil wired across its terminals. Attached to one the terminals of the [[LC circuit]] is a [[diode]], then between the end of the diode not wired to the LC circuit and the terminal of the LC circuit not bearing the diode is wired a ceramic decoupling capacitor. Finally a [[galvanometer]] is wired to the terminals of the decoupling capacitor.

The device will be sensitive to strong sources of radiowaves at the [[frequency]] at which the LC circuit is [[resonant]].

This is given by
&lt;math&gt;f = {1 \over 2 \pi \sqrt {LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

When the device is exposed to an RF field which is at the resonant frequency a DC voltage will appear on the terminals on the left hand side. The coil is often outside the case of the unit so it can be brought close to the object being probed.

== UHF and SHF ==

[[File:Ondamtr.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Resonant cavity wavemeter for measuring microwave frequencies in the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]]

{{further|Ultra high frequency|Super high frequency}}

At the higher frequencies it is not possible to use [[lumped component]]s for the tuned circuit. Instead methods such as [[stripline]] or resonant cavities are used. One design for ultra high frequencies (UHF) and super high frequencies (SHF) is a resonant λ/4 (quarter wave) rod which can vary in length. Another design for [[X-band]] (10&amp;nbsp;GHz) is a [[microwave cavity|resonant cavity]] which can be changed in length.

As an alternative for UHF, Lecher transmission lines can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intuitor.com/resonance/standingEwaveDemo.html|title=The Physics of Resonance|website=www.intuitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to measure roughly the frequency of a transmitter using [[Lecher lines]].

An '''air compressor''' is a device that [[energy conversion|converts power]] (using an electric motor, diesel or gasoline engine, etc.) into [[potential energy]] stored in pressurized air (i.e., [[compressed air]]). By one of several methods, an air compressor forces more and more air into a storage tank, increasing the pressure. When tank pressure reaches its engineered upper limit the air compressor shuts off. The compressed air, then, is held in the tank until called into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a151/how-air-compressors-work/|title=How Do Air Compressors Work?|date=2015-03-18|newspaper=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The energy contained in the compressed air can be used for a variety of applications, utilizing the kinetic energy of the air as it is released and the tank depressurizes. When tank pressure reaches its lower limit, the air compressor turns on again and re-pressurizes the tank.
An air compressor must be differentiated from pump because it works for any gas/air and pump work on liquid.

==Classification==

Compressors can be classified according to the pressure delivered:
# Low-pressure air compressors (LPACs), which have a discharge pressure of 150 psi or less
# Medium-pressure compressors which have a discharge pressure of 151 psi to 1,000 psi
# High-pressure air compressors (HPACs), which have a discharge pressure above 1,000 psi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com/fireman/102.htm|title=CLASSIFICATION OF AIR COMPRESSORS|website=www.tpub.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They can also be classified according to the design and principle of operation:

# Single-Stage Reciprocating Compressor
# Two-Stage Reciprocating Compressor
# Compound Compressor
# [[Rotary-screw compressor]]
# Rotary Vane Compressor
# Scroll Compressor
# [[Turbo compressor]]
# [[Centrifugal compressor]]

==Displacement type==

There are numerous methods of air compression, divided into either positive-displacement or roto-dynamic types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/products/reference/14970|title=Air Compressor Types and Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural Resources Canada|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive displacement===

Positive-displacement compressors work by forcing air in a chamber whose volume is decreased to compress the air. Once the maximum pressure is reached, a port or valve opens and air is discharged into the outlet system from the compression chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecompressedairblog.com/compressor-selection-basics-positive-displacement-versus-dynamic-compression/|title=Compressor Selection Basics: Positive Displacement versus Dynamic Compression|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-01-12|via=The 5th Utility}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common types of positive displacement compressors are
* Piston-type: air compressors use this principle by pumping air into an air chamber through the use of the constant motion of pistons. They use one-way valves to guide air into and out of a chamber whose base consists of a moving piston.  When the piston is on its down stroke, it draws air into the chamber.  When it is on [[File:Two-Stage_Air_Compressor_assembled_on_a_vertical_tank_and_equipped_with_a_Joule-Thomson_(JT)_type_refrigerated_compressed_air_dryer.jpg|thumb|Technical Illustration of a two-stage air compressor]]its up stroke, the charge of air is forced out and into a storage tank. Piston compressors generally fall into two basic categories, single-stage and two-stage.  Single stage compressors usually fall into the fractional through 5 [[horsepower]] range. Two-stage compressors normally fall [[File:Portable_Single_Stage_Air_Compressor.jpg|thumb|Technical Illustration of a portable single-stage air compressor]]into the 5 through 30 horsepower range.  Two-stage compressors provide greater efficiency than their single-stage counterparts. For this reason, these compressors are the most common units within the small business community.  The capacities for both single-stage and two-stage compressors is generally provided in horsepower (HP), [[Standard cubic feet per minute|Standard Cubic feet per Minute]] (SCFM)* and [[Pounds per square inch|Pounds per Square Inch]] (PSI).   *To a lesser extent, some compressors are rated in [[Actual cubic feet per minute|Actual Cubic Feet per Minute]] (ACFM).  Still others are rated in [[Cubic feet per minute|Cubic Feet per Minute]] (CFM). Using CFM to rate a compressor is incorrect because it represents a flow rate that is independent of a pressure reference.  i.e. 20 CFM ''at 60 PSI.'' 
* [[Rotary-screw compressor|Rotary screw compressors]]: use positive-displacement compression by matching two helical screws that, when turned, guide air into a chamber, whose volume is decreased as the screws turn.
* Vane compressors: use a slotted rotor with varied blade placement to guide air into a chamber and compress the volume. This type of compressor delivers a fixed volume of air at high pressures.

=== Dynamic displacement ===

Dynamic displacement air compressors include [[centrifugal compressor]]s and axial compressors. In these types, a rotating component imparts its kinetic energy to the air which is eventually converted into pressure energy. These use centrifugal force generated by a spinning impeller to accelerate and then decelerate captured air, which pressurizes it.

== Cooling ==
Due to [[Adiabatic heating#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic heating]], air compressors require some method of disposing of [[waste heat]].  Generally this is some form of air- or water-cooling, although some (particularly rotary type) compressors may be cooled by oil (that is then in turn air- or water-cooled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-compressor-types-d_441.html|title=Types of Air Compressors|last=|first=|date=|website=The Engineering ToolBox|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmospheric changes are also considered during cooling of compressors. The type of cooling is determined by considering the factors such as inlet temperature, ambient temperature, power of the compressor and area of application. There is no single type of compressor that could be used for any application.

== Applications ==
[[File:CompAir Fahrbarer Kompressor Typ C38.jpg|thumb|Portable air compressor for powering tools, such as [[jackhammer]]s]]
Air compressors have many uses, including: supplying high-pressure clean air to fill [[gas cylinder]]s, supplying moderate-pressure clean air to a submerged [[surface supplied diving|surface supplied diver]], supplying moderate-pressure clean air for driving some office and school building [[pneumatic]] [[HVAC control system]] valves, supplying a large amount of moderate-pressure air to power [[pneumatic tool]]s, such as [[jackhammer]]s, filling high pressure air tanks (HPA), for filling [[tire]]s, and to produce large volumes of moderate-pressure air for large-scale industrial processes (such as oxidation for petroleum coking or cement plant bag house purge systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/pumps-fans-compressors/compressor-drives/applications-for-compressors/pages/default.aspx|title=Applications for Compressors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.industry.siemens.com|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most air compressors either are reciprocating piston type, rotary vane or [[rotary screw compressor|rotary screw]]. [[Centrifugal compressors]] are common in very large applications, while rotary screw, scroll, and reciprocating air compressors are favored for smaller, portable applications. 

There are two main types of air-compressor pumps: oil-injected and oil-less. The oil-less system has more technical development, but is more expensive, louder and lasts for less time than oil-lubed pumps. The oil-less system also delivers air of better quality.

Air compressors are designed to utilize a variety of power sources. While gas/diesel-powered and electric air compressors are among the most popular, air compressors that utilize vehicle engines, [[Power take-off|power-take-off]], or hydraulic ports are also commonly used in mobile applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vmacair.com/blog/easy-guide-to-rotary-screw-air-compressors-for-trucks-vans/|title=Easy Guide To Rotary Screw Air Compressors For Vehicles – By VMAC|date=2018-10-16|work=VMAC|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of a compressor is measured in HP ([[horsepower]]) and CFM ([[cubic foot|cubic feet per minute]] of intake air).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truetex.com/aircompressors.htm|title=Evaluating True Horsepower and CFM Ratings of Air Compressors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The gallon size of the tank specifies the volume of compressed air (in reserve) available. Gas/diesel powered compressors are widely used in remote areas with problematic access to electricity. They are noisy and require ventilation for exhaust gases. Electric powered compressors are widely used in production, workshops and garages with permanent access to electricity. Common workshop/garage compressors are 110-120 Volt or 230-240 Volt. Compressor tank shapes are: "pancake", "twin tank", "horizontal", and "vertical". Depending on a size and purpose compressors can be stationary or portable.

== Maintenance ==
To ensure all compressor types run efficiently with no leaks, it is imperative to perform routine maintenance, such as monitoring and replacing air compressor fittings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.compressedairsystems.com/aircompressor-fittings.html|title=Air Compressor Fittings|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Compressed Air Systems|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that air compressor owners perform daily inspections of their equipment, such as:
* Checking for oil and air leaks
* Checking the differential pressure in the compressed air filter
* Determining whether or not the oil in the compressor should be changed
* Verifying safe operating temperature
* Draining [[Condensation|condensation]] from air receiver tanks

[[File:Agitated vessel.svg|thumb|right|350px|Cross-sectional diagram of [[Continuous stirred-tank reactor|stirred tank reactor]]]]
'''Baffles''' are flow-directing or obstructing vanes or panels used in some [[industrial process]] vessels (tanks), such as [[shell and tube heat exchanger]]s, [[chemical reactor]]s, and [[static mixer]]s.  Baffles are an integral part of the shell and tube heat exchanger design. A baffle is designed to support tube bundles and direct the flow of [[fluid]]s for maximum efficiency.  Baffle design and tolerances for heat exchangers are discussed in the standards of the [[Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association]] (TEMA).

==Use of baffles==
The main roles of a baffle in a shell and tube heat exchanger are to:


* Hold tubes in position (preventing sagging), both in production and operation
* Prevent the effects of [[steam starvation]], which is increased with both fluid  velocity and the length of the exchanger
* Direct shell-side fluid flow along tube field. This increases fluid  velocity and the effective [[heat transfer]] co-efficient of the exchanger

In a static mixer, baffles are used to minimize tangential component of velocity which cause vortex formation thus promote [[Mixing (process engineering)|mixing]].&lt;ref&gt;''SPE/ANTEC 1999 Proceedings'' edited by SPE Staff pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;  

In a chemical reactor, baffles are often attached to the interior walls to promote mixing&lt;ref&gt;''Chemical reactor modeling: multiphase reactive flows'' by Hugo A. Jakobsen,
published in 2008 by Springer-Verlag in Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 681–683
&lt;/ref&gt; and thus increase [[heat transfer]] and possibly [[Reaction rate|chemical reaction rate]]s.

==Types of baffles==
Implementation of baffles is decided on the basis of size, cost and their ability to lend support to the tube bundles and direct 
* Longitudinal Flow Baffles (used in a two-pass shell)
* Impingement Baffles (used for protecting bundle when entrance velocity is high)
* Orifice Baffles
* Single segmental
* Double segmental
* Support/Blanking baffles
* Deresonating (detuning) baffles used to reduce tube vibration

==Installation of baffles==
As mentioned, baffles deal with the concern of support and fluid direction in heat exchangers. In this way it is vital that they are spaced correctly at installation. The minimum baffle spacing is the greater of 50.8&amp;nbsp;mm or one fifth of the inner shell diameter. The maximum baffle spacing is dependent on material and size of tubes.  The Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tema.org/ Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; sets out guidelines. There are also segments with a "no tubes in window" design that affects the acceptable spacing within the design. An important design consideration is that no recirculation zones or dead spots form – both of which are counterproductive to effective heat transfer.

A '''basement''' or '''cellar''' is one or more [[Storey|floors]] of a building that are either completely or partially below the [[storey|ground floor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/basement|title=Basement - FEMA.gov|website=www.fema.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally used as a utility space for a building where such items as the [[boiler]], [[water heater]], [[breaker panel]] or [[fuse box]], [[parking garage|car park]], and [[air-conditioning system]] are located; so also are amenities such as the electrical distribution system, and [[cable television]] distribution point. However, in cities with high property prices such as [[London]], basements are often fitted out to a high standard and used as living space.

In [[British English]], the word ''basement'' is used for underground floors of, for example, department stores, but the word is only used with houses when the space below their ground floor is habitable, with windows and (usually) its own access. The word ''cellar'' or ''cellars'' is used to apply to the whole underground level or to any large underground room. A ''subcellar'' is a cellar that lies further underneath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Subcellar Subcellar] – definition of Subcellar by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose, geography, and history==
A basement can be used in almost exactly the same manner as an additional above-ground floor of a house or other building. However, the use of basements depends largely on factors specific to a particular geographical area such as climate, soil, seismic activity, building technology, and real estate economics.

Basements in small buildings such as [[single-family detached]] houses are rare in wet climates such as Great Britain and Ireland where flooding can be a problem, though they may be used on larger structures. However, basements are considered standard on all but the smallest new buildings in many places with temperate continental climates such as the American Midwest and the Canadian Prairies where a concrete [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] below the [[frost line]] is needed in any case, to prevent a building from shifting during the [[freeze-thaw cycle]]. Basements are much easier to construct in areas with relatively soft soils and may be foregone in places where the soil is too compact for easy excavation. Their use may be restricted in earthquake zones, because of the possibility of the upper floors collapsing into the basement; on the other hand, they may be required in tornado-prone areas as a shelter against violent winds. Adding a basement can also reduce heating and cooling costs as it is a form of [[earth sheltering]], and a way to reduce a building's [[surface area-to-volume ratio]]. The [[housing density]] of an area may also influence whether or not a basement is considered necessary.

Historically, basements have become much easier to build (in developed countries) since the [[industrialization]] of home building. Large powered excavation machines such as [[backhoes]] and [[front-end loaders]] have reduced the time and manpower needed to dig a basement dramatically as compared to digging by hand with a [[spade]], although this method may still be used in the developing world.

For most of its early history, the basement took one of two forms. It could be little more than a cellar, or it could be a section of a building containing rooms and spaces similar to those of the rest of the structure, as in the case of basement flats and basement offices.

However, beginning with the development of large, mid-priced suburban homes in the 1950s, the basement, as a space in its own right, gradually took hold. Initially, it was typically a large, concrete-floored space, accessed by indoor stairs, with exposed columns and beams along the walls and ceilings, or sometimes, walls of poured concrete or concrete [[cinder block]].

==Types of basement==

===Daylight basement===
A '''daylight basement''' is contained in a house where at least part of the floor goes above ground to provide reasonably-sized windows. Generally, the floor's ceiling should be enough above ground to provide nearly full-size windows. Some daylight basements are located on slopes, such that one portion of the floor is at-grade with the land. A walk-out basement almost always results from this.

Most daylight basements naturally result from raised bungalows and at-grade walk-out basements. However, there are instances where the terrain dips enough from one side to another to allow for 3/4 to full-size windows, with the actual floor remaining below grade.

In most parts of North America, it is legal to set up apartments and legal bedrooms in daylight basements, whether or not the entire basement is above grade.

Daylight basements can be used for several purposes—as a [[Garage (house)|garage]], as maintenance rooms, or as living space. The buried portion is often used for storage, [[laundry room]], hot water tanks, and [[HVAC]].

Daylight basement homes typically appraise higher than standard-basement homes, since they include more viable living spaces. In some parts of the US, however, the appraisal for daylight basement space is half that of ground and above ground level square footage. Designs accommodated include split-foyer and [[split-level home]]s. Garages on both levels are sometimes possible. As with any multilevel home, there are savings on roofing and foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, R. Dodge. Build Your Dream Home for Less. Cincinnati: Betterway Books, 1985, pp 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeller, Dirk. Success as a Real Estate Agent for Dummies. Wiley, 2006, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:brownstonebasement.jpg|thumb|A [[townhouse]] with basement windows showing.]]

===Walk-out basement===
A walk-out basement is any basement that is partially underground but nonetheless allows egress directly outdoors and has floating walls. This can either be through a stairwell leading above ground, or a door directly outside if a portion of the basement is completely at or above grade.

Many walk-out basements are also daylight basements. The only exceptions are when the entire basement is nearly entirely underground, and a stair well leads up nearly a floors worth of vertical height to lead to the outdoors. 

Generally, basements with only an emergency exit well do not count as walk-out. Walk-out basements with at-grade doors on one side typically are worth a lot more, but are more costly to construct since the foundation is still constructed to reach below the frost line. At-grade walk-out basements are on the door-side often used as livable space for the house, with the buried portion used for utilities and storage.[[File:daylightbasement.jpg|thumb|A walkout basement.]]

===Subbasement===
{{Main|Subbasement}}
A subbasement is a floor below the basement floor. In the homes where there is any type of basement mentioned above such as a look-out basement, all of the volume of subbasements from floor to ceiling are located well below ground. Therefore, subbasements have no windows nor an outside door. In the homes that have subbasements, all of basement can be used as part of main home where people relax and do recreational things while all of subbasement can be used for storage.

===Finished fully underground cellar===
[[File:Sklep cejkovice.JPG|thumb|[[Wine cellar]]]]

According to the international ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]'', a finished fully underground cellar is a room below ground level in a house that is often used for the storage of [[wine]] or [[coal]];&lt;ref&gt;Soanes, Catherine and Stevenson, Angus (ed.) (2005). ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', 2nd Ed., revised, Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, p. 278. {{ISBN|978-0-19-861057-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it may also refer to the stock of wine itself. A cellar is intended to remain at a constant cool (not freezing) temperature all year round and usually has either a small window/opening or some form of air ventilation (air/draught bricks, etc.) in order to help eliminate damp or stale air. Cellars are more common in the UK in older houses, with most terraced housing built during late 19th and early 20th centuries having cellars. These were important shelters from [[airstrike|air raids]] during [[World War II]]. In parts of North America that are prone to [[tornado]]es (e.g. [[Tornado Alley]]), cellars still serve as shelter in the event of a direct hit on the house from a tornado or other storm damage caused by strong winds.

Except for Britain, Australia and New Zealand, cellars are popular in most western countries. In the UK, almost all new homes built since the 1960s have no cellar or basement due to the extra cost of digging down further into the sub-soil and a requirement for much deeper foundations and waterproof tanking. The reverse has recently become common, where the impact of smaller home-footprints has led to roof-space being utilised for further living space and now many new homes are built with third-floor living accommodation. For this reason, especially where lofts have been converted into living space, people tend to use [[Garage (house)|garages]] for the storage of food freezers, tools, bicycles, garden and outdoor equipment. The majority of continental European houses have cellars,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} although a large proportion of people live in apartments or flats rather than houses. In North America, cellars usually are found in rural or older homes on the coasts and in the South. However, full basements are commonplace in new houses in the Canadian and American Midwest and other areas subject to tornado activity or requiring foundations below the frost line.

===Underground crawl space===
{{anchor|Crawl space}}
[[File:crawl-space-inside.jpg|thumb|A typical crawl space showing [[crawl space vent]]s and concrete rat-proofing. Rat-proofing is a thin, irregular concrete covering applied over the soil to prevent rodents from burrowing under the foundation wall and entering the crawl space.]]

An underground crawl space (as the name implies) is a type of basement in which one cannot stand up—the height may be as little as one foot (30&amp;nbsp;cm), and the surface is often soil. Crawl spaces offer a convenient access to pipes, substructures and a variety of other areas that may be difficult or expensive to access otherwise. While a crawl space cannot be used as living space, it can be used as storage, often for infrequently used items. Care must be taken in doing so, however, as water from the damp ground, water vapour (entering from crawl space vents), and moisture seeping through porous concrete can create a perfect environment for mould/mildew to form on any surface in the crawl space, especially cardboard boxes, wood floors and surfaces, drywall and some types of insulation.

Health and safety issues must be considered when installing a crawl space. As air warms in a home, it rises and leaves through the upper regions of the house, much in the same way that air moves through a chimney. This phenomenon, called the "stack effect", causes the home to suck air up from the crawl space into the main area of the home. Mould spores, decomposition odours, and fecal material from dust mites in the crawl space can come up with the air, aggravating asthma and other breathing problems, and creating a variety of health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/926104064.html |title=Mold Allergies |publisher=Healthlink.mcw.edu |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122072350/http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/926104064.html |archivedate=2009-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually desirable to finish a crawl space with a plastic vapour barrier that will not support mould growth or allow humidity from the earth into the crawl space. This helps insulate the crawl space and discourages the habitation of insects and vermin by breaking the ecological chain in which insects feed off the mould and vermin feed on the insects, as well as creating a physical inorganic barrier that deters entrance into the space. Vapour barriers can end at the wall or be run up the wall and fastened to provide even more protection against moisture infiltration. Some pest control agencies recommend against covering the walls, as it complicates their job of inspection and spraying. Almost unheard of as late as the 1990s, vapour barriers are becoming increasingly popular in recent years.{{when| date= October 2016}} In fact, the more general area of conditioned vs. unconditioned crawl spaces has seen much research over the last decade.

Alternatively, some find it desirable to create a "breathing home" with ample air flow, rather than "finish" a crawl space. There are contrary opinions as to what is healthier with many{{who|date=October 2013}} suggesting that vapor barriers simply create a new space where mould and mildew can flourish, trapping moisture below it and still creating a problem inside the home.

==Design and structural considerations==
[[File:Basement of Diocletian's Palace.JPG|thumb|Basement of [[Diocletian's Palace]]]]

Structurally, for houses, the basement walls typically form the foundation. In warmer climates, some houses do not have basements because they are not necessary (although many still prefer them). In colder climates, the foundation must be below the frost line. Unless constructed in very cold climates, the [[frost line]] is not so deep as to justify an entire level below the ground, although it is usually deep enough that a basement is the assumed standard. In places with oddly stratified soil substrata or high [[water table]]s, such as most of [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Arkansas]], and areas within {{convert|50|mi|km}} of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], basements are usually not financially feasible unless the building is a large apartment or commercial structure.

[[Earthworks (engineering)|Excavation]] using a [[backhoe]] or [[excavator]] is commonly used to dig a basement. If [[shelf rock]] is discovered, the need for [[Rock blasting|blasting]] may be cost prohibitive. Basement walls may need to have the surrounding earth backfilled around them to return the soil to grade. A water stop, some [[gravel]] and a [[french drain]] may need to be used to prevent water from entering the basement at the bottom of the wall. Walls below grade may need to be sealed with an impervious coating (such as [[tar]]) to prevent water seepage. A [[Low-density polyethylene|polyethylene]] of about 6 mil ([[visqueen]]) serves as a water barrier underneath the basement.

Some designs elect to simply leave a crawl space under the house, rather than a full basement due to structural challenges. Most other designs justify further excavations to create a full-height basement, sufficient for another level of living space. Even so, basements in Canada and the northern United States were typically only {{convert|7|ft|10|in|m}} in height, rather than the standard full {{convert|8|ft|m}} of the main floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Judy |last=Rose |date=April 21, 2002  |title=The Hole Story: House construction starts with digging out the basement and pouring its concrete walls |work=Detroit Free Press |url=http://www.freep.com/realestate/renews/house21_20020421.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602163904/http://www.freep.com/realestate/renews/house21_20020421.htm |archivedate=2002-06-02 |access-date=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older homes may have even lower basement heights as the basement walls were [[concrete block]] and thus, could be customized to any height. Modern builders offer higher basements as an option. The cost of the additional depth of excavation is usually quite expensive. Thus, houses almost certainly never have multi-storey basements though {{convert|9|ft|m}} basements heights are a frequent choice among new home buyers. For large office or apartment buildings in prime locations, the cost of land may justify multi-storey basement parking garages.

The concrete floor in most basements is structurally not part of the foundation; only the basement walls are. If there are posts supporting a main floor [[Beam (structure)|beam]] to form a [[Pole building framing|post and beam]] system, these posts typically go right through the basement floor to a [[Foundation (architecture)|footing]] underneath the basement floor. It is the footing that supports the post and the footing is part of the house foundation. Load-bearing wood-stud walls rest directly on the concrete floor. Under the concrete floor is typically [[gravel]] or [[crushed stone]] to facilitate draining. The floor is typically four inches (100&amp;nbsp;mm) thick and it rests on top of the foundation footings. The floor is typically sloped towards a drain point, in case of [[leak]]s.

Modern construction for basement walls typically falls into one of two categories: they will be made of poured-in-place [[concrete]] using concrete forms with a [[concrete pump]], or they will use [[concrete masonry unit]]s (block walls). Rock may also be used, but is less common. In [[monolithic architecture]], large parts of the building are made of concrete; in [[insulating concrete form]] construction, the concrete walls may be hidden with an exterior finish or [[siding]]. Inside the structure, a single [[Lally column]], steel basement jack, wooden [[column]] or support post may hold up the floor above in a small basement. A series of these supports may be necessary for large basements; many basements have the support columns exposed.

Since warm air rises, basements are typically cooler than the rest of the house. In summer, this makes basements damp, due to the higher [[relative humidity]]. [[Dehumidifiers]] are recommended. In winter, additional heating, such as a fireplace or [[baseboard|baseboard heaters]] may be required. A well-defined [[central heating]] system may minimize this requirement. Heating ducts typically run in the ceiling of the basement (since there is not an empty floor below to run the ducts). Ducts extending from the ceiling down to the floor help heat the cold floors of the basement. Older or cheaper systems may simply have the heating vent in the ceiling of the basement.

The finished floor is typically raised off the concrete basement floor. In countries such as Canada, laminate flooring is an exception: It is typically separated from the concrete by only a thin foam underlay. [[Radiant heating]] systems may be embedded within the concrete floor. Even if unfinished and unoccupied, basements are heated in order to ensure relative warmth of the floor above, and to prevent water supply pipes, drains, etc. from freezing and bursting in winter. It is recommended that the basement walls be insulated to the frost line. In Canada, the walls of a finished basement are typically insulated to the floor with vapor barriers to prevent moisture transmission. However, a finished basement should avoid wood or wood-laminate flooring, and metal framing and other moisture resistant products should be used. Finished basements can be costly to maintain due to deterioration of waterproofing materials or lateral earth movement etc. Below-ground structures will never be as dry as one above ground, and measures must be taken to circulate air and dehumidify the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_1727_1.html |title=Full Height Basement Insulation and Drainage Layer Requirements |origyear=June 30, 2003 |date=August 20, 1996 |location=Ontario |publisher=Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing |accessdate=May 24, 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815132200/http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_1727_1.html |archivedate=2004-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drainage considerations==
Basement [[floor drain]]s that connect to sanitary sewers need to be filled regularly to prevent the trap from drying out and [[sewer gas]] from escaping into the basement. The drain trap can be topped up automatically by the [[condensation]] from [[air conditioner]]s or high-efficiency [[furnace]]s. A small tube from another downpipe is sometimes used to keep the trap from drying out. Health Canada advocates the use of special [[radon]] gas traps for floor drains that lead to soil or to a sealed sump pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/radon_canadians-canadiens/index-eng.php|title=Radon - Reduction Guide for Canadians - Canada.ca|first=Health|last=Canada|website=www.hc-sc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where storm and [[sanitary sewer]]s are combined, and there is the risk of flooding and sewage backing up, [[backflow|backwater valve]]s in all basement drains may be mandated by code and definitely are recommended even if not mandated.

The main water cut-off valve is usually in the basement. Basements often have "clean outs" for the sanitary and storm sewers, where these pipes can be accessed. The storm sewer access is only needed where the [[weeping tile]]s drain into the storm sewers.

Other than with walk-out or look-out basements, windows in basements require a well and are below grade. A clear [[window well cover]] may be required to keep the window wells from accumulating rain water. There should be drains in the window well, connected to the foundation drains.

[[File:Diagram of water seeping into basement.jpg|thumb|right|Water can seep into a basement from elevated places nearby, such as a raised driveway. Solutions include: re-mortaring bricks; silicone in cracks; elevating areas next to exterior walls; sloping gutters so water flows away from house.]]
If the [[water table]] outside the basement is above the height of the basement floor, then the foundation drains or the weeping tiles outside the footings may be insufficient to keep the basement dry. A [[sump pump]] may be required. It can be located anywhere and is simply in a well that is deeper than the basement floor.

Even with functioning sump pumps or low water tables, basements may become wet after rainfall, due to improper drainage. The ground next to the basement must be graded such that water flows away from the basement wall. Downspouts from [[roof gutters]] should drain freely into the [[storm sewer]] or directed away from the house. Downspouts should not be connected to the foundation draintiles. If the draintiles become clogged by leaves or debris from the rain gutters, the roof water would cause basement flooding through the draintile. [[Damp-proofing]] or [[waterproofing]] materials are typically applied to outside of the basement wall. It is virtually impossible to make a concrete wall waterproof, over the long run, so drainage is the key. There are draining membranes that can be applied to the outside of the basement that create channels for water against the basement wall to flow to the foundation drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basement Waterproofing|url=https://windowwellexperts.com/basement-waterproofing/|website=Window Well Experts|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where drainage is inadequate, waterproofing may be needed. There are numerous ways to waterproof a basement, but most systems fall into one of three categories:

*Tanking – Systems that bond to the basement structure and physically hold back groundwater.
*Cavity Drainage – Dimpled plastic membranes are used to line the floors and walls of the basement, creating a "drained cavity." Any water entering this drained cavity is diverted to a sump pump and pumped away from the basement.
*Exterior Foundation Drain – Installing an exterior foundation drain that will drain away by gravity is the most effective means to waterproof a basement. An exterior system allows water to flow away from the basement without using pumps or electricity. An exterior drain also allows for the installation of a waterproof membrane to the foundation walls.

The waterproofing system can be applied to the inside or the outside walls of a basement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aquaguard-pittsburgh.com/pittsburgh_basement_waterproofing.php |title=Signs of a Leaky Basement &amp; Basement Waterproofing Issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123005705/http://aquaguard-pittsburgh.com/pittsburgh_basement_waterproofing.php |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When waterproofing existing basements it is much cheaper to waterproof the basement on the inside. Waterproofing on the outside requires the expense of excavation, but does offer a number of advantages for a homeowner over the long term. Among them are:
* Gravity system
* No pumps or electrical wiring required
* Membrane applied to exterior walls to prevent dampness, mold, moisture, and soil gases from entering the home
* Permanent solution

==Basement culture and finishings==
[[File:Casa abandonada en la Tercera Avenida, Dawson City, Yukón, Canadá, 2017-08-27, DD 51.jpg|thumb|Example of the result of houses constructed in the beginning of the 20th century in [[Dawson City]] ([[Yukon Territory]]) without a basement.]]

===Unfinished basement===
The unfinished design, found principally in spaces larger than the traditional cellar, is common in residences throughout the U.S. and Canada. One usually finds within it a water heater, various pipes running along the ceiling and downwards to the floor, and sometimes a workbench, a freezer or refrigerator, or a washer/dryer set. Boxes of various materials, and objects unneeded in the rest of the house, are also often stored there; in this regard, the unfinished basement takes the place both of the cellar and of the [[attic]]. Home workshops are often located in the basement, since sawdust, metal chips, and other mess or noise are less of a nuisance there. The basement can contain all of these objects and still be considered to be "unfinished", as they are either mostly or entirely functional in purpose.

===Finished basement===
[[File:Fetid basement of Wikipediocracy headquarters.JPG|thumb|A finished basement]]

In this case the space has been designed, either during construction or at a later point by the owners, to function as a fully habitable addition to the house. Frequently most or all of the basement is used as a [[recreation room]] or living room, but it is not uncommon as well to find there (either instead of or alongside the living/recreation room) a guest bedroom or teenager's room, a bathroom, a [[home office]], a home gym, a [[home cinema|home theater]], a basement bar, a [[sauna]], and one or more closets. Occasionally a part of the basement is unfurnished and is used for storage, a workshop, and/or a laundry room; when this is the case the water heater and furnace will also often be located there, although in some cases the entire basement is finished, and the water heater and furnace are boxed off into a closet.

===Partially finished basement===
The main point of distinction between this type of basement and the two others lies in its being either entirely unmodified (unlike the finished basement) beyond the addition of furniture, recreational objects and appliances, and/or exercise equipment on the bare floor, or slightly modified through the installation (besides any or all of the aforementioned items) of loose carpet and perhaps simple light fixtures. In both cases, the objects found there—many of which could be found in a finished basement as well—might include the following: weight sets and other [[exercise equipment]]; the [[boom box]]es or entertainment systems used during exercise; [[musical instrument]]s (which are not in storage, as they would technically be in an unfinished basement; an assembled drum set would be the most easily identified of these); [[Table football|football tables]], chairs, couches and entertainment appliances of lesser quality than those in the rest of the house; refrigerators, stand-alone freezers, and microwaves (the first and the second being also sometimes used as supplementary storage units in an unfinished basement); and [[Pennant (sports)|sports pennant]]s and/or other types of posters which are attached to the walls.

As the description suggests, this type of basement, which also might be called "half-finished", is likely used by teenagers and children. The entire family might utilize a work-out area. It is also common to have a secondary (or primary) home office in a partially finished basement, as well as a workbench and/or a space for laundry appliances.

Toilets and showers sometimes exist in this variety of basement, as many North American basements are designed to allow for their installation.

===Fully finished basement – retro fit===
In [[London]] the construction of finished retrofit basements is big business with a large number of projects in the 100–200 square meter bracket. There are a smaller number of projects in the 200–500 square meter bracket under construction. It is also not unusual to see multi-level retrofit basements. These are considerable works of civil engineering and require some skill and intuitive understanding as well as good engineering.  Some of the more grandiose of these basement projects have been widely reported in the national media, notably the "[[Witanhurst]]" project in the Highgate area of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2007919/Move-Buckingham-Palace-Furious-locals-massive-underground-extension-mystery-owner-Londons-incredible-home.html |title=Move over Buckingham Palace!

===Use in hospitals===
Hospitals often place their nuclear chemistry and radiation therapy and diagnostic resources in basements to utilize the shielding from the earth.

==Real estate floorspace measures==
In [[Canada]], historically the basement area was excluded from advertised square footage of a house as it was not part of the living space. For example, a "2,000-square-foot bungalow" would, in reality, have {{convert|4000|sqft|m2}} of floor space. More recently, finished space has become increasingly acceptable as a measure which includes the developed basement areas of a home. Due to fire code requirements, most jurisdictions require an emergency egress (through either egress-style windows, or, in the case of a walk-out basement, a door) to include the basement square footage as living space.

'''Brake to Vacate''' (BTV) is additional software planned by [[Airbus]] for incorporation on its line of [[airliner]]s, intended to reduce [[runway]] overruns.  A more tangible benefit is the increased ability to exit the runway at a specified turnoff point.  The [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] certified the system, initially for use on the [[Airbus A380]], in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/easa-clears-a38039s-brake-to-vacate-and-overrun-protection-333978 EASA clears A380's brake-to-vacate and overrun protection]&lt;/ref&gt;  The second Airbus product to incorporate BTV will be the [[Airbus A320 family]], which is much more widely used around the world than the A380.  However, an A320 BTV system would be more modest, since its flight computer does not incorporate the extensive electronic architecture of the A380.

==Operation==
The BTV is a subset of the airliner's auto-flight computer, and allows that computer to be programmed for a pre-selected stopping distance.  It indicates (and to some extent directs) which combination of brakes and [[Thrust reversal|thrust reversers]] are required to achieve that distance.

===On approach===
The BTV uses the airliner's existing warning systems to alert the crew if unsafe conditions exist.  If the system computes that the runway is too short when wet, an amber message appears in the primary flight display.  If it computes that the runway is too short even under dry surface conditions, ''RWY TOO SHORT'' (in red letters) is flashed on the primary flight display, accompanied by an aural signal.

===During rollout===
When the aircraft landing gear is firmly on the runway surface, the BTV combines audio and visual prompts to the flight crew in order to achieve the calculated required deceleration to achieve the designated turnoff point.  If BTV senses that the aircraft will overrun the runway end, it automatically applies maximum wheel braking, and it sends an aural message (to the flight crew) to apply maximum reverse thrust, along with a red message in the primary flight display.  It continues to call out ''keep max reverse'' until the computer figures the desired turnoff point can be achieved at a safe turnoff speed.  If the taxiway departs the runway at 90 degrees, the BTV automatically disconnects when the aircraft groundspeed reduces to 10 knots.  If the taxiway is a [[taxiway|rapid-exit taxiway]], the BTV automatically disconnects at 40 to 50 knots groundspeed (depending on conditions).&lt;ref&gt;ainonline.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Proponents of the system point out that using BTV will reduce wear on brakes and tires (estimated at 20% reduction over present wear rates), less time that the aircraft spends within the active area of the runway, and enhanced ability to predict required cool-down time on the brakes (and thus to better control minimum gate turnaround time).

The greatest potential advantage of the system is its ability to predict whether an aircraft will be able to stop safely on a specified runway.  The pilot selects the runway and enters the reported surface conditions (wind direction, windspeed, wet or dry, cleared or slushy), and the computer uses stored runway information, computed aircraft weights and required approach speeds, and computed flare/touchdown characteristics to predict whether the stopping point will lie outside the runway's endpoint.

==Inputs==
The flight crew inputs the selected runway, and the reported runway surface conditions.  The flight computer updates its calculations using predicted speed and wind conditions until the airplane is 500 feet (150 m) above the surface, after which it uses actual speed and wind inputs.

==Timeline==
The BTV concept was born in a 1998 Ph.D. thesis by French engineer Fabrice Villaumé, who became head of Airbus' BTV program and who holds patents on the process.&lt;ref&gt;FR. 1. 20080234882 Method and Device to assist in the piloting of an aircraft in a landing phase, issued 25 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FR. 1. 20090150068  Method and Device for generating a taxiing trajectory for an aircraft, issued 11 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 2002 and 2006 the computer routines were worked out, and the process was first tested on an [[Airbus A340]],
&lt;ref&gt;Airbus engineers conducted much of the preliminary development work on the BTV using the smaller but similarly-configured (i.e. 4 engines) [[Airbus A340]] in 2004-2005; see http://www.eads.com/xml/content/OF00000000400004/0/12/42330120.pdf EADS Test Flight Description&lt;/ref&gt; with the first test landing in that aircraft accomplished in March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/pilot-report-airbus-a380/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705212347/http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/pilot-report-airbus-a380/ |archivedate=2009-07-05 |df= }} "Pilot Report - Airbus A380"&lt;/ref&gt;  The first test landing of an A380 using the BTV system was performed in May 2008.

Airbus initially announced its plan to make the BTV system available by 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/a380/flight_deck.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825173400/http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/a380/flight_deck.html |archivedate=2006-08-25 |df= }} : "The system will be offered as an option on all A380s by 2007,  . ."&lt;/ref&gt; but the production bottlenecks that Airbus encountered in meeting the initial A380 delivery schedules apparently pushed back development of several such planned improvements.  As of 2009 the company is seeking [[Type certificate|certification]] initially on the A380, after which it will announce planned incorporation schedules for other aircraft in the Airbus airliner product line.  In 2006 Airbus indicated that following its introduction on the A380, the BTV "[would] be followed by retrofits available on all of other Airbus aircraft families."&lt;ref&gt;Airbus.com&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as of 2009 the company is indicating only that it will work on incorporating the feature on new A320s, and no definite availability schedule has been announced.

In 2005 Airbus also announced its intention to incorporate BTV into the upcoming [[Airbus A350]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avtoday.com/av/categories/commercial/1088.html&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since then that project has suffered several redesign phases, and it is not clear whether the BTV will still be offered when the A350 does come to market.

As of 2018, the system is indeed incorporated in the [[Airbus A350]].

A '''content management system''' ('''CMS''')&lt;ref name ="MEC-UCS"&gt;''Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy''. Ann Rockley, Pamela Kostur, Steve Manning. New Riders, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The content management handbook''. Martin White. Facet Publishing, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Content Management Bible'', Bob Boiko. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; manages the creation and modification of [[digital content]]. It  typically supports multiple users in a [[Collaborative software|collaborative environment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Moving Media Storage Technologies: Applications &amp; Workflows for Video and Media S2011. Page 381&lt;/ref&gt;

CMS features vary widely. Most CMSs include [[Electronic publishing|Web-based publishing]], format management, history editing and [[version control]], indexing, [[search algorithm|search]], and retrieval. By their nature, content management systems support the separation of content and presentation.

A [[web content management system]] (WCM or WCMS) is a CMS designed to support the management of the content of Web pages. Most popular CMSs are also WCMSs. Web content includes text and embedded [[graphics]], [[photos]], [[video]], [[Digital audio|audio]], [[map]]s, and [[Source code|program code]] (e.g., for applications) that displays content or interacts with the user.

Such a content management system (CMS) typically has two major components:
* A content management application (CMA) is the front-end user interface that allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify, and remove content from a website without the intervention of a [[webmaster]].
* A content delivery application (CDA) compiles that information and updates the website.
[[Digital asset management|Digital asset management systems]] are another type of CMS. They manage content with clearly defined author or ownership, such as documents, movies, pictures, phone numbers, and scientific data. Companies also use CMSs to store, control, revise, and publish documentation.

Based on market share statistics, the most popular content management system is [[WordPress]], used by over 28% of all websites on the internet, and by 59% of all websites using a known content management system, followed by [[Joomla]] and [[Drupal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all/ |title=W3Techs content management usage | date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Automated, of dubious accuracy, see talk page|date=August 2016}}

== Common features ==
Content management systems typically provide the following features:{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

* [[search engine optimization|SEO]]-friendly URLs
* Integrated and online help
* Modularity and extensibility
* User and group functionality
* Templating support for changing designs
* Install and upgrade wizards
* Integrated audit logs
* Compliance with various accessibility frameworks and standards, such as [[WAI-ARIA]]

== Advantages ==
* Reduced need to code from scratch
* Easy to create a unified look and feel
* [[Version control]]
* Edit permission management

==Disadvantages==
* Limited or no ability to create functionality not envisioned in the CMS (e.g., layouts, web apps, etc.)
* Increased need for special expertise and training for content authors.

A '''derailment''' occurs when a vehicle such as a [[train]] runs off its rails. This does not necessarily mean that it leaves its [[Train track|track]]. Although many derailments are minor, all result in temporary disruption of the proper operation of the railway system, and they are potentially seriously hazardous to human health and safety. Usually, the derailment of a train can be caused by a collision with another object, an operational error, the mechanical failure of tracks, such as broken rails, or the mechanical failure of the wheels. In emergency situations, deliberate derailment with [[derail]]s or [[catch points]] is sometimes used to prevent a more serious accident.&lt;!--See causes below--&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}

Railroad wrecks in the 19th century were sensational, and the newspapers claimed them to be due to human failure or the consequence of corporate greed. It took railroads several decades to improve train-control practices and adopt safety devices sufficient to make railroad travel truly safe. Very few passengers were killed in train wrecks in the US before 1853. The early trains ran slowly and made short trips, night travel was rare, and there were not many of them in operation. While trains were convenient for travel and for transporting goods, they had become a greater danger over the years as their speed had increased. While fatal railway accidents occurred about once a year previously, there was a sudden 800 percent increase in accidents in 1853. Some railroad accidents were caused by [[human error]], but other causes included derailment, explosions on board, equipment failures, and bridge collapses. Thereafter, the rate of accidents returned to its former level.

Boiler explosions had been noted in locomotive-type fire tube boilers when the top of the firebox (called the crown sheet) failed. This had to be covered with a significant layer of water at all times or the heat of the fire would weaken it to the point of failure, even at normal working pressures. Low water levels in the boiler when traversing a significant grade could expose parts of the crown sheet. Even a well-maintained firebox could fail explosively if the water level in the boiler was allowed to fall far enough to leave the top plate of the firebox uncovered. Due to the constant expansion and contraction of the firebox a form of "stress corrosion" could also take place at the ends of the firebox plates. This corrosion was accelerated by poor water quality and the build-up of boiler scale. A fuel explosion within the confines of the firebox (actually the ignition of unburned gases caused by an inappropriate air/fuel mixture) could also damage the pressurized boiler tubes and interior shell, potentially triggering a structural failure. The majority of locomotive explosions were found to be related to these circumstances, and constant attention to the engine was found to be the best defense against catastrophe.

On 6 January 1853, the Boston &amp; Maine express, traveling from Boston to Lawrence, MA, derailed at forty miles an hour when an axle broke, and the single coach went down an embankment breaking in two. Only one person was killed, the eleven-year-old son of President-elect Franklin Pierce, who was also on board but was only badly bruised. A few days later, on 23 January 1853, at Glen Rock, PA, the conductor B.A. Stells was lost after the caboose was detached from its train cars in a forest during a blizzard. The body of the man and the car were not found until Spring. On 6 May 1853, a New Haven Railroad train ran through an open drawbridge at Norwalk, CT and plunged into the Norwalk River. Forty-six passengers were crushed to death or drowned. This was the first major railroad drawbridge accident. 

On 17 July 1856, at Fort Washington, PA, there was one of the most infamous train wrecks to ever occur in the US and the deadliest in the world up to that time. Known as the Great Train Wreck, two North Pennsylvania Railroad trains, one of them carrying 1,500 Sunday School children to a picnic, collided. Upon impact, the boiler of the passenger train exploded and the train carrying the children derailed. Fifty-nine people were instantly killed, and dozens more died from their injuries. The conductor of the passenger train committed suicide the same day, although he was later absolved of any responsibility. 

Finally in this sampling, on 11 May 1858, at Utica, NY, two New York Central trains, a westbound freight and the eastbound Cincinnati Express, passed on parallel tracks on a forty-foot wooden trestle over Sauquoit Creek. It collapsed under their combined weight, utterly destroying the passenger train, killing nine and injuring 55 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volo|first1=James M.|title=Railroad Raiders of the Civil War|date=2016|publisher=CreateSpace|location=Charleston, SC|page=26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century derailments were commonplace, but progressively improved safety measures have resulted in a stable lower level of such incidents. In the US, derailments have dropped dramatically since 1980 from over 3,000 annually (1980) to 1,000 or so in 1986, to about 500 in 2010.&lt;ref name = bibel&gt;George D Bibel, ''Train Wreck – the Forensics of Rail Disasters'', Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = wu&gt;Huimin Wu and Nicholas Wilson, ''Railway Vehicle Derailment and Prevention'', in ''Handbook of Railway Vehicle Dynamics''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:British Rail Class 165 165124 derailed at Paddington, 2016.jpg|thumb|A derailed [[British Rail Class 165]] at [[London Paddington station]].

{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Derailments result from one or more of a number of distinct causes; these may be classified as:

* the primary mechanical failure of a track component (for example broken rails, gauge spread due to sleeper (tie) failure)
* the primary mechanical failure of a component of the running gear of a vehicle (for example axlebox failure, wheel breakage)
* a fault in the geometry of the track components or the running gear that results in a quasi-static failure in running (for example rail climbing due to excessive wear of wheels or rails, earthworks slip)
* a dynamic effect of the track-vehicle interaction (for example extreme [[Hunting oscillation|hunting]], vertical bounce, track shift under a train, excessive speed)
* improper operation of points, or improper observance of signals protecting them (signal errors)
* as a secondary event following collision with other trains, road vehicles, or other obstructions ([[level crossing]] collisions, obstructions on the line)
* train handling (snatches due to sudden traction or braking forces, referred to as slack action in North America).

== Broken rails ==
[[File:Schienenbruch.jpg|thumb|A broken rail, probably starting from [[hydrogen embrittlement|hydrogen inclusion]] in the rail head]]
A traditional track structure consists of two rails, fixed at a designated distance apart (known as the [[track gauge]]), and supported on transverse sleepers (ties). Some advanced track structures support the rails on a concrete or asphalt slab. The running surface of the rails is required to be practically continuous and of the proper geometrical layout.

In the event of a '''broken or cracked rail''', the rail running surface may be disrupted if a piece has fallen out, or become lodged in an incorrect location, or if a large gap between the remaining rail sections arises. 170 broken (not cracked) rails were reported on Network Rail in the UK in 2008, down from a peak of 988 in 1998/1999.

* In [[jointed track]], rails are usually connected with bolted [[fishplate]]s (joint bars). The web of the rail experiences large [[shear force]]s and these are enhanced around the bolt hole. Where track maintenance is poor, [[Fatigue (material)|metallurgical fatigue]] can result in the propagation of star cracking from the bolthole. In extreme situations this can lead to a triangular piece of rail at the joint becoming detached.
* Metallurgical changes take place due to the phenomenon of gauge corner cracking (in which fatigue microcracking propagates faster than ordinary wear), and also due to the effects of [[hydrogen embrittlement|hydrogen inclusion]] during the manufacturing process, leading to [[crack propagation]] under fatigue loading.
* Local embrittlement of the parent metal may take place due to wheel spin (traction units rotating driving wheels without movement along the track).
* Rail welds (where rail sections are joined by welding) may fail due to poor workmanship; this may be triggered by extremely cold weather or improper stressing of continuously welded rails, such that high tensile forces are generated in the rails.
* The fishplates (joint bars) in jointed track may fail, allowing the rails to pull apart in extremely cold weather; this is usually associated with uncorrected rail creep.

Derailment may take place due to excessive '''gauge widening''' (sometimes known as '''road spread'''), in which the sleepers or other fastenings fail to maintain the proper gauge. In lightly engineered track where rails are spiked (dogged) to timber sleepers, spike hold failure may result in rotation outwards of a rail, usually under the aggravating action of crabbing of bogies (trucks) on curves.&lt;ref name = wu/&gt;

The mechanism of gauge widening is usually gradual and relatively slow, but if it is undetected, the final failure often takes place under the effect of some additional factor, such as excess speed, poorly maintained running gear on a vehicle, misalignment of rails, and extreme traction effects (such as high propelling forces). The crabbing effect referred to above is more marked in dry conditions, when the coefficient of friction at the wheel to rail interface is high.

=== Defective wheels ===
The running gear — [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]], [[bogie]]s (trucks), and suspension  — may fail. The most common historical failure mode is collapse of plain bearings due to deficient lubrication, and failure of leaf springs; wheel tyres are also prone to failure due to metallurgical crack propagation.

Modern technologies have reduced the incidence of these failures considerably, both by design (specially the elimination of plain bearings) and intervention (non-destructive testing in service).

=== Unusual track interaction ===
If a vertical, lateral, or crosslevel irregularity is cyclic and takes place at a wavelength corresponding to the natural frequency of certain vehicles traversing the route section, there is a risk of [[resonance|resonant]] [[harmonic oscillation]] in the vehicles, leading to extreme improper movement and possibly derailment. This is most hazardous when a cyclic roll is set up by crosslevel variations, but vertical cyclical errors also can result in vehicles lifting off the track; this is especially the case when the vehicles are in the tare (empty) condition, and if the suspension is not designed to have appropriate characteristics. The last condition applies if the suspension springing has a stiffness optimised for the loaded condition, or for a compromise loading condition, so that it is too stiff in the tare situation.

The vehicle wheelsets become momentarily unloaded vertically so that the guidance required from the flanges or wheel tread contact is inadequate.

A special case is heat related '''buckling''': in hot weather the rail steel expands. This is managed by stressing continuously welded rails (they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral at a moderate temperature) and by providing proper expansion gaps at joints and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated. In addition, lateral restraint is provided by an adequate ballast shoulder. If any of these measures are inadequate, the track may buckle; a large lateral distortion takes place, which trains are unable to negotiate. (In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/9 there were 429 track buckle incidents in Great Britain).&lt;ref group = note&gt;On Network Rail, so excluding certain "Metro" networks.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = cummersdale&gt;Rail Accident Investigation Board (UK), ''Derailment of a Train at Cummersdale, Cumbria, 1 June 2009'', Derby, England, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improper operation of control systems ===
Junctions and other changes of routing on railways are generally made by means of points (switches — movable sections capable of changing the onward route of vehicles). In the early days of railways these were moved independently by local staff. Accidents — usually collisions — took place when staff forgot which route the points were set for, or overlooked the approach of a train on a conflicting route. If the points were not correctly set for either route — set in mid-stroke — it is possible for a train passing to derail.

The first concentration of levers for signals and points brought together for operation was at Bricklayer's Arms Junction in south-east London in the period 1843-1844. The signal control location (forerunner of the signalbox) was enhanced by the provision of interlocking (preventing a clear signal being set for a route that was not available) in 1856.&lt;ref name = solomon&gt;Brian Solomon, ''Railroad Signaling'', Voyageur Press, Minneapolis, MN, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-7603-1360-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent the unintended movement of freight vehicles from sidings to running lines, and other analogous improper movements, trap points and derails are provided at the exit from the sidings. In some cases these are provided at the convergence of running lines. It occasionally happens that a driver incorrectly believes s/he has authority to proceed over the trap points, or that the signaller improperly gives such permission; this results in derailment. The resulting derailment does not always fully protect the other line: a trap point derailment at speed may well result in considerable damage and obstruction, and even a single vehicle may obstruct the clear line.

=== Derailment following collision ===
If a train collides with a massive object, it is clear that derailment of the proper running of vehicle wheels on the track may take place. Although very large obstructions are imagined, it has been known for a cow [[estray|straying]] on to the line to derail a passenger train at speed such as occurred in the [[Polmont rail accident]].

The most common obstructions encountered are '''road vehicles at level crossings''' (grade crossings); malicious persons sometimes place materials on the rails, and in some cases relatively small objects cause a derailment by guiding one wheel over the rail (rather than by gross collision).

Derailment has also been brought about in situations of war or other conflict, such as during hostility by Native Americans, and more especially during periods when military personnel and materiel&lt;!----this is the correct spelling----&gt; was being moved by rail.&lt;ref name = denevi&gt;Don DeNevi and Bob Hall, ''United States Military Railway Service America's Soldier Railroaders in WWII'', 1992, Boston Mills Press, Erin, Ontario, {{ISBN|1-55046-021-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = wolmar&gt;Christian Wolmar, ''Engines Of War: How Wars Were Won &amp; Lost On The Railways'', Atlantic Books, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-84887-172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/tcrr-tribes/ American Experience: Native Americans and the Transcontinental Railroad]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harsh train handling ===
The handling of a train can also cause derailments. The vehicles of a train are connected by couplings; in the early days{{when|date=January 2015}} of railways these were short lengths of chain ("loose couplings") that connected adjacent vehicles with considerable slack. Even with later improvements there may be a considerable slack between the traction situation (power unit pulling the couplings tight), and power unit braking (locomotive applying brakes and compressing buffers throughout the train). This results in '''coupling surge'''.

More sophisticated technologies in use nowadays generally employ couplings that have no loose slack, although there is elastic movement at the couplings; continuous braking is provided, so that every vehicle on the train has brakes controlled by the driver. Generally this uses compressed air as a control medium, and there is a measurable time lag as the signal (to apply or release brakes) propagates along the train.

If a train driver applies the train brakes suddenly and severely, the front part of the train is subject to braking forces first. (Where only the locomotive has braking, this effect is obviously more extreme). The rear part of the train may overrun the front part, and in cases where coupling condition is imperfect, the resultant sudden closing up (an effect referred to as a "run-in") may result in a vehicle in tare condition (an empty freight vehicle) being lifted momentarily, and leaving the track.

This effect was relatively common in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name = cole&gt;Colin Cole, ''Longitudinal Train Dynamics'', in ''Handbook of Railway Vehicle Dynamics''&lt;/ref&gt;

On curved sections, the longitudinal (traction or braking) forces between vehicles have a component inward or outward respectively on the curve. In extreme situations these lateral forces may be enough to encourage derailment.

A special case of train handling problems is '''overspeed on sharp curves'''. This generally arises when a driver fails to slow the train for a sharp curved section in a route that otherwise has higher speed conditions. In the extreme this results in the train entering a curve at a speed at which it cannot negotiate the curve, and gross derailment takes place. It takes roughly 6.976&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;N to completely derail a train traveling at such circumstances. The specific mechanism of this may involve bodily tipping (rotation) but is likely to involve disruption of the track structure and derailment as the primary failure event, followed by overturning.

An example of speeding on a curve would be the May [[2015 Philadelphia train derailment]] involving an Amtrak train traveling at 106&amp;nbsp;mph (171&amp;nbsp;km/h), twice the maximum allowable speed of 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h).

=== Flange climbing ===
The guidance system of practical railway vehicles relies on the steering effect of the conicity of the wheel treads on moderate curves (down to a radius of about 500&amp;nbsp;m, or about 1,500&amp;nbsp;feet). On sharper curves flange contact takes place, and the guiding effect of the flange relies on a vertical force (the vehicle weight).

A '''flange climbing''' derailment can result if the relationship between these forces, L/V, is excessive. The lateral force L results not only from centrifugal effects, but a large component is from the crabbing of a wheelset which has a non-zero angle of attack during running with flange contact. The L/V excess can result from wheel unloading, or from improper rail or wheel tread profiles. The physics of this is more fully described below, in the section ''wheel-rail interaction''.

Wheel unloading can be caused by '''twist''' in the track. This can arise if the cant (crosslevel, or superelevation) of the track varies considerably over the wheelbase of a vehicle, and the vehicle suspension is very stiff in torsion. In the quasi-static situation it may arise in extreme cases of poor load distribution, or on extreme cant at low speed.

If a rail has been subject to extreme sidewear, or a wheel flange has been worn to an improper angle, it is possible for the L/V ratio to exceed the value that the flange angle can resist.

If weld repair of side-worn switches is undertaken, it is possible for poor workmanship to produce a ramp in the profile in the facing direction, that deflects an approaching wheel flange on to the rail head.

In extreme situations, the infrastructure may be grossly distorted or even absent; this may arise from earthworks movement (embankment slips and washouts), earthquake and other major terrestrial disruption, deficient protection during work processes etc.

==== Wheel-rail interaction ====

Nearly all practical railway systems use wheels fixed to a common axle: the wheels on both sides rotate in unison. Tramcars requiring low floor levels are the exception, but much benefit in vehicle guidance is lost by having unlinked wheels.&lt;ref name = ayasse&gt;Jean-Bernard Ayasse and Hugues Chollet, ''Wheel—Rail Contact'', in ''Handbook of Railway Dynamics''&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefit of linked wheels derives from the '''conicity of the wheel treads'''—the wheel treads are not [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], but [[cone|conical]].&lt;ref name = bibel/&gt;&lt;ref name = ayasse/&gt; On idealised straight track, a wheelset would run centrally, midway between the rails.

The example shown here uses a right-curving section of track.  The focus is on the left-side wheel, which is more involved with the forces critical to guiding the railcar through the curve.

Diagram 1 below shows the wheel and rail with the wheelset running straight and central on the track. The wheelset is running away from the observer. (Note that the rail is shown inclined inwards; this is done on modern track to match the rail head profile to the wheel tread profile.)

Diagram 2 shows the wheelset displaced to the left, due to curvature of the track or a geometrical irregularity.  The left wheel (shown here) is now running on a slightly larger diameter; the right wheel opposite has moved to the left as well, towards the centre of the track, and is running on a slightly smaller diameter. As the two wheels rotate at the same rate, the forward speed of the left wheel is a little faster than the forward speed of the right wheel. This causes the wheelset to curve to the right, correcting the displacement. This takes place without flange contact; the wheelsets  steer themselves on moderate curves without any flange contact.

The sharper the curve, the greater the lateral displacement necessary to achieve the curving. On a very sharp curve (typically less than about 500&amp;nbsp;m or 1,500&amp;nbsp;feet radius) the width of the wheel tread is not enough to achieve the necessary steering effect, and the wheel flange contacts the face of the high rail.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The high rail is considered to be the outer rail in a curve; the low rail is the inner rail.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagram 3 shows the running of wheelsets in a bogie or a four-wheeled vehicle. The wheelset is not running parallel to the track: it is constrained by the bogie frame and suspension, and it is yawing to the outside of the curve; that is, its natural rolling direction would lead along a less sharply curved path than the actual curve of the track.&lt;ref group = note&gt;Yaw describes the situation when the longitudinal axis of the wheelset is not the same as the longitudinal axis of motion.&lt;/ref&gt;

The angle between the natural path and the actual path is called the '''angle of attack''' (or the yaw angle). As the wheelset rolls forward, it is forced to slide across the railhead by the flange contact. The whole wheelset is forced to do this, so the wheel on the low rail is also forced to slide across its rail.&lt;ref group = note&gt;This was understood as early as 1844, when Robert Stephenson gave evidence that "in bringing round the curve, the wheels will all be fixed on the axles, and being of the same size, of course the outside has to go over more ground than the inside and therefore the outside ones slide upon the turn, and consequently, as you see in the Bristol stations [where broad gauge trains were negotiating sharp curves], you will see such wheels grind in their operation." Stephenson was giving evidence in the House of Commons regarding the South Devon Railway bill, on 26 April 1844, quoted in Hugh Howes, ''The Struggle for the South Devon Railway'', Twelveheads Press, Chacewater, 2012, {{ISBN|978 0 906294 74 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sliding requires a considerable force to make it happen, and the friction force resisting the sliding is designated "L", the lateral force. The wheelset applies a force L outwards to the rails, and the rails apply a force L inwards to the wheels. Note that this is quite independent of "centrifugal force".&lt;ref group = note&gt;Centrifugal force is a convenient imaginary concept; strictly speaking it is the inertia of a body being accelerated, equal to the product of the mass of the body and the acceleration.&lt;/ref&gt; However at higher speeds the centrifugal force is added to the friction force to make L.

The load (vertical force) on the outer wheel is designated V, so that in Diagram 4 the two forces L and V are shown.

The steel-to-steel contact has a [[coefficient of friction]] that may be as high as 0.5 in dry conditions, so that the lateral force may be up to 0.5 of the vertical wheel load.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The value of L is determined by the load on both wheels of the wheelset multiplied by the coefficient of friction, plus the centrifugal force. But the sliding on the wheel on the low rail is not lateral -- the wheel tread is actually sliding backwards (i.e rotating less rapidly than the forward speed requires) and the lateral friction force generated is limited by the vector of the sliding action.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this flange contact, the wheel on the high rail is experiencing the lateral force L, towards the outside of the curve. As the wheel rotates, the flange tends to climb up the flange angle. It is held down by the vertical load on the wheel V, so that if L/V exceeds the trigonometrical tangent of the flange contact angle, climbing will take place. The wheel flange will climb to the rail head where there is no lateral resistance in rolling movement, and a '''flange climbing derailment''' usually takes place. In Diagram 5 the flange contact angle is quite steep, and flange climbing is unlikely. However, if the rail head is side-worn (side-cut) or the flange is worn, as shown in Diagram 6 the contact angle is much flatter and flange climbing is more likely.&lt;ref name = wu/&gt;&lt;ref name = ayasse/&gt;

Once the wheel flange has completely climbed onto the rail head, there is no lateral restraint, and the wheelset is likely to follow the yaw angle, resulting in the wheel dropping outside the rail. An L/V ratio greater than 0.6 is considered to be hazardous.&lt;ref name = bibel/&gt;

It is emphasised that this is a much simplified description of the physics; complicating factors are creep, actual wheel and rail profiles, dynamic effects, stiffness of longitudinal restraint at axleboxes, and the lateral component of longitudinal (traction and braking) forces.&lt;ref name = cole/&gt;

== Rerailing ==
[[File:Locomotive derailed 2055744.jpg|thumb|A derailed British Rail (EX. LNER) B1 being lifted back onto the tracks by a rail mounted crane in 1951]]
[[File:Broken rail derailment.jpg|thumb|Rerailing a locomotive using a rerailer and wooden blocks after a broken rail derailment]]

Following a derailment, it is naturally necessary to replace the vehicle on the track. If there is no significant track damage that may be all that is needed. However, when trains in normal running derail at speed, a considerable length of track may be damaged or destroyed; far worse secondary damage may be caused if a bridge is encountered.

With simple wagon derailments where the final position is close to the proper track location, it is usually possible to pull the derailed wheelsets back on to the track using rerailing ramps; these are metal blocks designed to fit over the rails and to provide a rising path back to the track. A locomotive is usually used to pull the wagon.

If the derailed vehicle is further from the track, or its configuration (such as a high centre of gravity or a very short wheelbase) make the use of ramps impossible, jacks may be used. In its crudest form, the process involves lifting the vehicle frame and then allowing it to fall off the jack towards the track. This may need to be repeated.

A more sophisticated process involves a controlled process using slewing jacks in addition. Photographs of early locomotives often indicate one or more jacks carried on the frame of the locomotive for the purpose, presumed to be a frequent occurrence.

When more complex rerailing work is needed, various combinations of cable and pulley systems may be used, or the use of one or more [[Crane (railroad)|rail-borne cranes]] to lift a locomotive bodily.&lt;ref name = tatlow1&gt;Peter Tatlow, ''Railway Breakdown Cranes: Volume 1'', Noodle Books, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1906419691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = tatlow2&gt;Peter Tatlow, ''Railway Breakdown Cranes: Volume 2'', Noodle Books, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1906419974}}&lt;/ref&gt; In special cases road cranes are used, as these have greater lifting and reach capacity, if road access to the site is feasible.

In extreme circumstances, a derailed vehicle in an awkward location may be scrapped and cut up on site, or simply abandoned as non-salvageable.

''Note: there is a large list of railway accidents in general at [[Lists of rail accidents]].''

[[File:Train wreck at Montparnasse 1895.jpg|thumb|right| Train derailment at Gare Montparnasse, Paris in 1895]]

=== Primary mechanical failure of a track component ===
In the [[Hatfield rail crash]] in England in 2000, which killed four people, rolling contact fatigue had resulted in multiple gauge corner cracking in the surface; 300 such cracks were subsequently found at the site. The rail cracked under a high speed passenger train, which derailed.&lt;ref name=hatfield&gt;[http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/297.pdf Office of Rail Regulation, ''Train Derailment at Hatfield: A Final Report by the Independent Investigation Board'', London, 2006] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131001175041/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/297.pdf |date=1 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earlier [[Hither Green rail crash]], a triangular segment of rail at a joint became displaced, and lodged in the joint; it derailed a passenger train and 49 persons died. Poor maintenance on an intensively operated section of route was the cause.&lt;ref name = hithergreen&gt;[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=99 Ministry of Transport, ''Report on the Derailment that Occurred on 5th November 1967 at Hither Green in the Southern Region of British Railways'', Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1968]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary mechanical failure of a component of the running gear of a vehicle ===
In the [[Eschede train disaster]] in Germany, a high speed passenger train derailed in 1998, killing 101 people. The primary cause was the fracture from metal fatigue of a wheel tyre; the train failed to negotiate two sets of points and struck the pier of an overbridge. It was the most serious railway accident in Germany, and also the most serious on any high speed (over {{convert|200|kph|mph}}) line. Ultrasonic testing had failed to reveal the incipient fracture.&lt;ref name = eschede&gt;Erich Preuß, ''Eschede, 10 Uhr 59. Die Geschichte einer Eisenbahn-Katastrophe'', GeraNova Zeitschriftenverlag, 2002, {{ISBN|3-932785-21-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dynamic effects of vehicle - track interaction ===
In 1967 in the UK there were four derailments due to buckling of continuously welded track ("cwr"): at Lichfield on 10 June, an empty carflat train (a train of flat cars for transporting automobiles); on 13 June an express passenger train was derailed at Somerton; on 15 July a freightliner train (container train) was derailed at Lamington; and on 23 July an express passenger train was derailed at Sandy. The official report was not entirely conclusive as to the causes, but it observed that the annual total of buckling distortions was 48 in 1969, having been in single figures in every previous year, and that [heat-related] distortions per 1,000 miles per annum were 10.42 for cwr and 2.98 for jointed track in 1969, having been a maximum of 1.78 and 1.21 in the previous ten years. 90% of the distortions could be attributed to one of the following:
* failure to comply with the instructions for laying or maintaining cwr track
* recent interference with the consolidation of the ballast
* the effect of discontinuities in the cwr track such as points etc.
* extraneous factors such as formation subsidence.&lt;ref name = buckling&gt;[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=1272 Major C F Rose, ''Railway Accidents, Interim Report on the Derailments that occurred on Continuous Welded Track at Lichfield (London Midland Region), Somerton (Western Region) and Sandy (Eastern Region), British Railways, during June and July 1969, and on the General Safety of this form of Track'', Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improper operation of control systems ===
[[File:V90_entgleist.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[DB Class V 90|DB V90]] shunter derailed on a disused point]]
In the [[Connington South rail crash]] on 5 March 1967 in England, a signaller moved the points immediately in front of an approaching train. Mechanical signalling was in force at the location, and it was believed that he improperly replaced the signal protecting the points to danger just as the locomotive passed it. This released the locking on the points and he moved them to lead to a loop line with a low speed restriction. The train, travelling at {{convert|75|mph|kph}}, was unable to negotiate the points in that position and five persons died.&lt;ref name = connington&gt;[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_Connington1967.pdf Lt-Col I K A McNaughton, ''Report on the Derailment that Occurred on 5th March, 1967, at Connington South in the Eastern Region British Railways'', Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1969] {{ISBN|0-11-550079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary events following collision ===
A passenger train was derailed in the [[Polmont rail accident]] in the UK in 1984 upon hitting a cow at speed; the train formation had the locomotive at the rear (propelling) with a light driving-trailer vehicle leading. The cow had strayed on to the line from adjacent agricultural land, due to deficient fencing. 13 persons died in the resulting derailment.&lt;ref name = polmont&gt;Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate, ''Report on the Derailment that occurred on 30th July 1984 near Polmont in the Scottish Region, British Railways'', Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1985, {{ISBN|0-11-550685-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this was thought to be the first occurrence from this cause (in the UK) since 1948.&lt;ref name = ri1984&gt;Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate, ''Railway Safety: Report on the Safety Record of the Railways in Great Britain During 1984'', Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Train handling effects ===
The [[Salisbury rail crash]] took place on 1 July 1906; a first class only special boat train from Stonehousepool, Plymouth England, ran through Salisbury station at about {{convert|60|mph|kph}}; there was a sharp curve of ten chains (660&amp;nbsp;feet, 200&amp;nbsp;m) radius and a speed restriction to {{convert|30|mph|kph}}. The locomotive overturned bodily and struck the vehicles of a milk train on the adjacent line. 28 people were killed. The driver was sober and normally reliable, but had not driven a non-stopping train through Salisbury before.&lt;ref name = salisbury&gt;[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BoT_Salisbury1906.pdf Major J W Pringle, Report for the Board of Trade, London, 31 July 1906]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several other derailments in the UK due to trains entering speed-restricted sections of track at excessive speed; the causes have generally been inattention by the driver due to alcohol, fatigue or other causes. Prominent cases were the [[Nuneaton rail crash]] in 1975 (temporary speed restriction in force due to trackwork, warning sign illumination failed),&lt;ref name = nuneaton&gt;Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate, ''Report on the Derailment that occurred on 6th June 1985 at Nuneaton in the London Midland Region of British Railways'', Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; the Morpeth accident in 1984 (express passenger sleeping car train took {{convert|50|mph|kph}} restricted sharp curve at full speed; alcohol a factor; no fatalities due to the improved [[crashworthiness]] of the vehicles)&lt;ref name = morpeth&gt;Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate, ''Report on the Derailment that occurred on 24th June 1984 at Morpeth in the Eastern Region of British Railways'', Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The total reaction of the cell is C + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
The process in half cell notation:

* Cathode: O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

Despite this release of carbon dioxide, the direct carbon fuel cell is more environmentally friendly than traditional carbon burning techniques. Due to its higher efficiency, it requires less carbon to produce the same amount of energy. Also, because pure carbon dioxide is emitted, [[carbon capture]] techniques are much cheaper than for conventional power stations. Utilized carbon can be in the form of [[coal]], [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], [[char]], or a non-fossilized source of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rady|first1=Adam C.|last2=Giddey|first2=Sarbjit|last3=Kulkarni|first3=Aniruddha|last4=Badwal|first4=Sukhvinder P.S.|last5=Bhattacharya|first5=Sankar|title=Degradation Mechanism in a Direct Carbon Fuel Cell Operated with Demineralised Brown Coal|journal=Electrochimica Acta|date=October 2014|volume=143|pages=278–290|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2014.07.088}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munnings|first1=C.|last2=Kulkarni|first2=A.|last3=Giddey|first3=S.|last4=Badwal|first4=S.P.S.|title=Biomass to power conversion in a direct carbon fuel cell|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=August 2014|volume=39|issue=23|pages=12377–12385|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HyungKuk Ju, Jiyoung Eom, Jae Kwang Lee, Hokyung Choi, Tak-Hyoung Lim, Rak-Hyun Song, and Jaeyoung Lee, Durable power performance of a direct ash-free coal fuel cell, Electrochimica Acta 115 (2014) 511.

At least four types of DCFC exist:

'''First flush''' is the initial [[surface runoff]] of a rainstorm. During this phase, [[water pollution]] entering [[storm drain]]s in areas with high proportions of [[impervious surface]]s is typically more [[concentration|concentrated]] compared to the remainder of the storm. Consequently, these high concentrations of [[urban runoff]] result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to [[surface water]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Metcalf | first = Leonard | author-link = | last2 = Eddy | first2 = Harrison P. | author2-link = | title = American Sewerage Practice: Disposal of Sewage | place = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1916 | volume = III | edition = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ3VAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page= 154 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitt1"&gt;Alex Maestre and Robert Pitt; Center for Watershed Protection (2005).[http://unix.eng.ua.edu/~rpitt/Publications/Stormwater%20Characteristics/NSQD%20EPA.pdf "The National Stormwater Quality Database, Version 1.1: A Compilation and Analysis of NPDES Stormwater Monitoring Information."] Report prepared for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC. September 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|216}}

==First flush effect==
The term "first flush effect" refers to rapid changes in [[water quality]] (pollutant concentration or load) that occur after early season rains. [[Soil]] and vegetation particles wash into streams; [[sediment]]s and other accumulated [[organic compound|organic]] particles on the river bed are re-suspended, and dissolved substances from soil and shallow groundwater can be flushed into streams. Recent research has shown that this effect has not been observed in relatively pervious areas.&lt;ref name="Pitt1" /&gt;{{rp|216}}

The term is often also used to address the first flood after a dry period, which is supposed to contain higher concentrations than a subsequent one. This is referred to as "first flush flood." There are various definitions of the first flush phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Heritage. Canberra. [http://www.deh.gov.au/ssd/glossary "Glossary of Terms."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gupta |first= K. |authorlink= |author2=Saul, A.J. |year= 1996 |title= Specific Relationships for the First Flush Load in Combined Sewer Flows |journal= Water Research |volume= 30 |issue= 5 |pages= 1244–1252 |id= |doi= 10.1016/0043-1354(95)00282-0 |issn= 0043-1354 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Geiger |first= W. |authorlink= |year= 1987 |title= Flushing Effects in Combined Sewer Systems |journal= Proc. 4th Int.

==First foul flush==
Storm water runoff in a [[combined sewer]] produces a '''first foul flush''' with a suspension of accumulated sanitary solids from the sewer in addition to pollutants from surface runoff. [[Infiltration/inflow|Inflow]] may produce a foul flush effect in [[sanitary sewer]]s if flows peak during wet weather. As flow rates increase above average, a relatively small percentage of the total flow contains a disproportionately large percentage of the total pollutant mass associated with overall flow volume through the peak flow event. Sewer solids deposition during low flow periods and subsequent resuspension during peak flow events is the major pollutant source for the first-flush combined-sewer overflow (CSO) phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ssc&gt;{{cite report |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000E6DC.txt |title=Sewer-Sediment Control: Overview of an EPA Wet-Weather Flow Research Program |last1=Fan |first1=Chi-Yuan |last2=Field |first2=Richard |last3=Lai |first3=Fu-hsiung |publisher=EPA |date=2003 |id=EPA 600/J-03/188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanitary sewage solids can either go through the system or settle out in [[laminar flow]] portions of the sewer to be available for washout during peak flows.  The [[wetted perimeter]] of sewers may also be colonized by [[biofilm]] nourished by soluble sanitary wastes. Hydraulic design is the underlying reason for solids deposition in sewers. Combined sewers sized for peak runoff events expected once a decade can carry up to 1,000 times the average sanitary flow. Less dramatically oversized sewers are common in new developments and near the upstream end of collection systems. [[Suspended solids]] may accumulate when low-flow fluid velocities generate insufficient [[turbulence]]. Solids deposition is greatest where velocities are low during dry weather. In large combined sewers it may be impossible to attain sanitary sewage velocities generating sufficient turbulence to keep solids suspended during dry weather.&lt;ref name=ssc/&gt;

Biofilm and previously deposited solids may be scoured and re-entrained during peak flow turbulence.&lt;ref name=mss&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=A.G. |last2=Sakrabani |first2=R. |last3=Ashley |first3=R.M. |last4=Johnstone |first4=F.M. |year=2002 |title=Managing sewer solids for the reduction of foul flush effects--Forfar WTP |journal=Water Science &amp; Technology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=265–272 |publisher=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high pollution load in wastewater at the beginning of a runoff event occurs when increased flow rate erodes accumulated sewer sediment.&lt;ref name=wrro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/8728/5/Sakrabani_Biodegradability1.pdf |title=Biodegradabilty of Organic Matter associated with Sewer Sediments during First Flush |last1=Sakrabani |first1=Ruben |last2=Vollertsen |first2=Jes |last3=Ashley |first3=Richard M. |last4=Hvitved-Jacobsen |first4=Thorkild |website=White Rose Research Online |publisher=[[University of Sheffield]] |accessdate=12 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Erosion of sediments in sewers can release pollutants in concentrations exceeding levels found in contributing sources. The initial highly polluting foul flush is released at the start of wet weather flow during speedy erosion of a weak layer of highly concentrated surficial sediment bed-load.&lt;ref name=wst&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashley |first1=R.M. |last2=Wotherspoon |first2=D.J.J. |last3=Coghlan |first3=B.P. |last4=McGregor |first4=I. |year=1992 |title=The Erosion and Movement of Sediments and Associated Pollutants in Combined Sewers |journal=Water Science &amp; Technology |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=101–114 |publisher=IWA Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; When conditions favor dry-weather solids deposition, the first foul flush may contain as much as 30 percent of the annual total suspended solids discharged to a combined sewer system.  Combined sewer suspended solids concentrations of several thousand milligrams per liter (mg/L) may be observed during the first foul flush.&lt;ref name=ssc/&gt;

Pollutant concentration levels are influenced by the age and condition of the collection system and the amount of infiltration/inflow in comparison to the sanitary flow.  Pollutant concentration peaks depend on size and slope of the piping system, time interval between storms, and solids accumulation in the collection system. Steeper sewer gradients and pipe bottom shapes that maintain high velocity flow during low-flow conditions will reduce sediment accumulation in sewers; and periodic sewer flushing of individual lines during dry weather may move accumulated solids to the [[wastewater treatment plant]] before stormwater runoff causes simultaneous peak flow in the entire collection system.&lt;ref name="EPA-CSO"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=30004MAO.txt |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Control Manual |publisher=EPA |date=September 1993 |pages=5, 9–10&amp;19 |id=EPA/625/R-93/003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
Because the reference of the first flush is not always clear, the terms "concentration-based first flush" (CBFF) and "mass-based first flush" (MBFF) have been introduced.&lt;ref name="Sansalone"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2004)130:11(1301) |last1=Sansalone |first1=John |last2=Christina |first2=Chad M. |date=November 2004 |title=First flush concepts for dissolved solids in small impervious watersheds |journal=Journal of Environmental Engineering |volume= 130 |issue=11 |pages=1301–1314 |issn= 0733-9372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from this definition, there are a number of rating parameters in literature to determine the occurrence of a first flush.&lt;ref name="Sansalone" /&gt;

==Rainwater harvesting==
In the context of [[rainwater harvesting]], a first flush diverter is a simple device that is designed to protect a storage [[cistern]] from contamination by first flush runoff. This leads to a higher quality of water captured, and less silting of the cistern over time in dusty areas. The diverted first flush water is used for irrigation or other purposes in a fashion similar to [[greywater]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Hawai`i Agricultural Extension. Manoa, HI (2008). [http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/hawaiirain/downloads/5_flush.pdf "Rainwater Catchment Solutions: First-Flush Diverters."] Brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many commercial versions are available, these devices are frequently constructed of spare pipe when the cistern is initially installed or thereafter. See ''Texas Manual on Rainwater Harvesting'' for calculations on sizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Texas Water Development Board |location=Austin, TX |date=2005 |url=https://www.twdb.texas.gov/publications/brochures/conservation/doc/RainwaterHarvestingManual_3rdedition.pdf |title=Texas Manual on Rainwater Harvesting |edition=3rd |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flatiron School''' is an education organization founded in 2012 by Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum. The organization is based in [[New York City]] and teaches [[software engineering]], [[computer programming]], and [[data science]]. Until late 2017, Flatiron School's courses were taught at its campus in [[Manhattan]] or online. Since being acquired by [[WeWork]] in October 2017, the school has expanded to five different cities in two countries, having opened campuses in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Brooklyn]], [[London]], and [[Houston]].

== History ==
Flatiron School was founded in 2012 by Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://flatironschool.com/about-flatiron-school/|title=About Flatiron School|website=flatironschool.com|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It received two rounds of funding in 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flatiron-school#section-funding-rounds|title=Flatiron School {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the New York State Attorney fined Flatiron $375,000 after it was found to be operating without a licence and making misleading statements about the employment status and earning potential of graduates. They claimed a 98.5% employment rate but this included apprentices and freelance workers, while the claimed average salary of $74,447 only included graduates in full time employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chapman|first1=Ben|title=Flatiron coding school to pay $375G for operating without a license, making false claims about its graduates|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/flatiron-coding-school-pay-375g-making-false-claims-article-1.3561462|accessdate=2018-04-30|publisher=New York Daily News|date=2017-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisition by WeWork ===
Flatiron School was acquired by WeWork, a collaborative workspace company, in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/23/wework-acquires-flatiron-school/|title=WeWork acquires Flatiron School – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1915">'''Giant Campus, Inc.''' is a defunct Seattle-based [[online education]] company.  

Giant Campus specializied in technology-focused courses for students, grades 9 through 12, as well as for members of the United States military and their families.  Giant Campus was geared towards developing original course content, mapping to both the Washington Career and Technical Education (WA CTE) and Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) frameworks in business innovation, computer science, and digital arts.
==Founder==
Giant Campus was founded in 1997, by president and CEO, Pete Findley.  The idea came when Findley was a business school student at the [[University of Washington]], and he created a detailed business plan for a network of summer camps that would teach middle and high school kids new media skills—including multimedia and web design on college campuses. This project earned him first place in a statewide business plan competition, along with $15,000 in seed money to launch Giant Campus. Within five years, Giant Campus was running Cybercamps at more than 70 colleges, including programs in China, Hong Kong, Korea and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Jason.

In 2008, Findley was named Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ey.com/US/en/Newsroom/News-releases/Media-Release-16-06-08CDC&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4088">The '''Helikon vortex separation process''' is an aerodynamic [[Enriched uranium|uranium enrichment]] process designed around a device called a [[vortex tube]]. [[Paul Dirac]] thought of the idea  for isotope separation and tried creating such a device in 1934 in the lab of [[Peter Kapitza]] at Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul DIrac|last=Farmelo| first=Graham|publisher=Basic Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-465-02210-6|location=New York| pages=248-9,307,311,313-4,321,431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of separation were more practical at that time, but this method was designed and used in [[South Africa]] for producing reactor fuel with a [[uranium-235]] content of around 3–5%, and 80–93% enriched uranium for use in [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons]]. [[NECSA|The Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa, Ltd.]] (UCOR) developed the process, operating a facility at [[Pelindaba]] (known as the 'Y' plant) to produce hundreds of kilograms of [[Enriched uranium|HEU]]. Aerodynamic enrichment processes require large amounts of electricity and are not generally considered economically competitive because of high energy consumption and substantial requirements for removal of [[waste heat]]. The South African enrichment plant has apparently been closed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Process==
In the vortex separation process a mixture of [[uranium hexafluoride]] gas and [[hydrogen]] is injected tangentially into a tube at one end through nozzles or holes, at velocities close to the [[speed of sound]]. The tube tapers to a small exit aperture at one or both ends. This tangential injection of gas results in a spiral or vortex motion within the tube, and two gas streams are withdrawn at opposite ends of the vortex tube; centrifugal force providing the [[isotope|isotopic]] separation. The spiral swirling flow decays downstream of the feed inlet due to friction at the tube wall. Consequently, the inside diameter of the tube is typically tapered to reduce decay in the swirling flow velocity. This process is characterized by a separating element with a very small stage cut (the ratio of product flow to feed flow) of about 1/20, and high process-operating pressures.

Due to the extremely difficult [[plumbing]] required to link stages together, the design was developed into a cascade design technique (dubbed Helikon), in which 20 separation stages are combined into one module, and all 20 stages share a common pair of [[axial-flow compressor]]s. A basic requirement for the success of this method is that the axial-flow compressors successfully transmit parallel streams of different isotopic compositions without significant mixing. A typical Helikon module consists of a large cylindrical steel vessel housing the 20 separator assemblies, along with two compressors (one mounted on each end), and two water-cooled [[heat exchanger]]s.

Advantages of this process are a lack of [[Criticality accident|criticality concerns]] due to the highly diluted feedstock and suitability for batch processing. This means Helikon-type plants can be relatively small, making the technology a [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear proliferation concern]].

Today's [[Airbus|Airbus SE]] is the product of international [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] in the European aerospace industry tracing back to the formation of the ''Airbus Industrie GIE'' consortium in 1970. In 2000, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) [[Naamloze vennootschap|NV]] was established.

==Origins==
''Airbus Industrie'' began as a [[consortium]] of European aviation firms formed to compete with American companies such as [[Boeing]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].&lt;ref name="USAirbushisite"&gt;{{cite web|title=Airbus Industrie |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/Airbus/Aero52.htm |accessdate=5 October 2009 |author=T. A. Heppenheimer |publisher=US Centennial of Flight Commission |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825124308/http://centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/Airbus/Aero52.htm |archivedate=25 August 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many European aircraft were innovative, even the most successful had small production runs.&lt;ref name="airlinerworldspec"&gt;{{cite book |first= |editor=Mark Nicholls |title=Airbus Jetliners: The European Solution|series=Classic Aircraft Series No.6 |year=2001 |publisher=Key Publishing |location=Stamford |isbn=0-946219-53-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors favouring American aircraft manufacturers included: the size of the United States which made air transport popular; a 1942 Anglo-American agreement entrusting transport aircraft production to the US; and the World War II legacy of "a profitable, vigorous, powerful and structured aeronautical industry" in America.&lt;ref name="airlinerworldspec"/&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=20%|quote="For the purpose of strengthening European co-operation in the field of aviation technology and thereby promoting economic and technological progress in Europe, to take appropriate measures for the joint development and production of an Airbus."|source=&lt;small&gt;Airbus Mission Statement&lt;ref name="flightintairhist"/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}} By the mid-1960s, several European aircraft manufacturers had drawn up competitive designs, but were aware of the risks of such a project. For example, in 1959 [[Hawker Siddeley]] had advertised an "Airbus" version of the [[Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA091FFF3D5A1A7493C5A8178BD95F4D8585F9 |work=The New York Times |title = British plan big 'Air-Bus' |date = 17 October 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would "be able to lift as many as 126 passengers on ultra short routes at a direct operating cost of [[£sd|2d.]] per seat mile."&lt;ref&gt;"Flying Without Frills", Hawker Siddeley Aviation, ''The Times'', Friday, 13 Feb 1959; pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The European industry began to accept, along with their governments, that collaboration was required to develop such an aircraft and to compete with the more powerful US manufacturers. Negotiations began over a European collaborative approach and at the 1965 [[Paris Air Show]] the major European airlines informally discussed their requirements for a new "Airbus" capable of transporting 100 or more passengers over short to medium distances at a low cost.&lt;ref name="flightintairhist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Airbus history|work=Flight International |publisher=Reed Business Publishing |date=29 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year Hawker Siddeley (at the urging of the UK government) teamed with [[Société Anonyme des Ateliers d'Aviation Louis Breguet|Breguet]] and [[Nord Aviation|Nord]] to study Airbus designs. The Hawker Siddeley/Breguet/Nord group's HBN 100 became the basis for the continuation of the project. By 1966 the partners were [[Sud Aviation]], later [[Aérospatiale]] (France), Arbeitsgemeinschaft Airbus, later [[Deutsche Airbus]] (West Germany) and Hawker Siddeley (UK).&lt;ref name="flightintairhist"/&gt; A request for funding was made to the three governments in October 1966.&lt;ref name="flightintairhist"/&gt; On 25 July 1967, the three governments agreed to proceed with the proposal.

In the two years following this agreement, both the British and French governments expressed doubts about the project. The [[memorandum of understanding]] had stated that 75 orders must be achieved by 31 July 1968. The French government threatened to withdraw from the project due to its concern over funding all of the Airbus A300, [[Concorde]] and the [[Dassault Mercure]] concurrently, but was persuaded to maintain its support.&lt;ref name="airbus2"/&gt; With its own concerns at the A300B proposal in December 1968, and fearing it would not recoup its investment due to lack of sales, the British government withdrew on 10 April 1969.&lt;ref name="flightintairhist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A10F7355D137A93C3A8178FD85F4D8685F9 |work=The New York Times |title = Britain abandons the European Airbus project; believes building the plane is a losing proposition |date = 11 April 1969 |first = John |last = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Germany took this opportunity to increase its share of the project to 50%.&lt;ref name="airbus2"/&gt; Given the participation by Hawker Siddeley up to that point, France and West Germany were reluctant to take over its wing design. Thus the British company was allowed to continue as a privileged subcontractor.&lt;ref name="airlinerworldspec"/&gt; Hawker Siddeley invested [[Pound sterling|GB£]]35&amp;nbsp;million in tooling and, requiring more capital, received a GB£35&amp;nbsp;million loan from the West German government.&lt;ref name="airbus2"/&gt;

==Formation of Airbus Industrie GIE==


Airbus Industrie was formally established as a ''Groupement d'Intérêt Économique'' (Economic Interest Group or GIE) on 18 December 1970.&lt;ref name="airbus2"/&gt; It had been formed by a government initiative between [[France]], [[West Germany]] and the UK that originated in 1967. Its initial shareholders were the French company [[Aérospatiale]] and the West German company Deutsche Airbus, each owning a 50% share. The name "Airbus" was taken from a non-proprietary term used by the airline industry in the 1960s to refer to a commercial aircraft of a certain size and range, for this term was acceptable to the French linguistically. Aérospatiale and Deutsche Airbus each took a 36.5% share of production work, Hawker Siddeley 20% and the Dutch company [[Fokker|Fokker-VFW]] 7%.&lt;ref name="flightintairhist"/&gt; Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly items. In October 1971 the Spanish company [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA|CASA]] acquired a 4.2% share of Airbus Industrie, with Aérospatiale and Deutsche Airbus reducing their stakes to 47.9%.&lt;ref name="flightintairhist"/&gt; In January 1979 British Aerospace, which had absorbed Hawker Siddeley in 1977, acquired a 20% share of Airbus Industrie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/news/business/757/ |publisher=Seattle Times |title = A special report on the conception, design, manufacture, marketing and delivery of a new jetliner—the Boeing 757 |first = Peter |last = Rinearson |date = 19 June 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority shareholders reduced their shares to 37.9%, while CASA retained its 4.2%.&lt;ref name="airbus5"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/technology-leaders-1977-1979/ |publisher = Airbus |title = History – Technology leaders |accessdate = 30 September 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150925104335/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/technology-leaders-1977-1979/# |archive-date = 2015-09-25 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the Airbus A300===
{{Main|Airbus A300}}
[[File:Airbus A300B2-103 - Airbus Industrie.jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A300]], the first aircraft launched by Airbus, introduced in 1974.]]
The Airbus A300 was to be the first aircraft to be developed, manufactured and marketed by Airbus. By early 1967 the "[[Airbus A300|A300]]" label began to be applied to a proposed 320 seat, twin engined airliner.&lt;ref name="flightintairhist"/&gt; Following the 1967 tri-government agreement, [[Roger Béteille]] was appointed technical director of the A300 development project.&lt;ref name="airbus1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/ |publisher = Airbus |title = History – Early days |accessdate = 30 September 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110705195621/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/# |archive-date = 2011-07-05 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Béteille developed a division of labour that would be the basis of Airbus' production for years to come: France would manufacture the cockpit, flight control and the lower centre section of the fuselage; Hawker Siddeley, whose [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Trident]] technology had impressed him, was to manufacture the wings;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D10F63B55127B93C7AB178BD95F4D8685F9 |work=The New York Times |title = Hawker-Siddeley starts wing work for Europe Airbus |date = 25 October 1969 | first=London | last=Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Germany should make the forward and rear fuselage sections, as well as the upper centre section; the Dutch would make the flaps and spoilers; finally Spain (yet to become a full partner) would make the horizontal tailplane.&lt;ref name="airbus1"/&gt; On 26 September 1967 the West German, French and British governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding in London which allowed continued development studies. This also confirmed Sud Aviation as the "lead company", that France and the UK would each have a 37.5% work share with West Germany taking 25%, and that [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] would manufacture the engines.&lt;ref name="airlinerworldspec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="airbus1"/&gt;

[[File:Eastern Air Lines A300B4-100 N201EA MIA 1990-5-31.png|thumb|The first North American customer was [[Eastern Air Lines]] with this Airbus A300B4]]

In the face of lukewarm support from airlines for a 300+ seat [[Airbus A300]], the partners submitted the A250 proposal, later becoming the A300B, a 250-seat airliner powered by pre-existing engines.&lt;ref name="flightintairhist"/&gt; This dramatically reduced development costs, as the Rolls-Royce RB207 to be used in the A300 represented a large proportion of the costs. The RB207 had also suffered difficulties and delays, since [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] was concentrating its efforts on the development of another jet engine, the [[Rolls-Royce RB211|RB211]], for the [[Lockheed L-1011]]&lt;ref name="airbus2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/people/company-evolution/trouble-and-strife/ |title=History – Trouble and strife |publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227193841/http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/people/company-evolution/trouble-and-strife/ |archivedate=27 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rolls-Royce entering into administration due to bankruptcy in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ClIVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ceUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2007,9468941&amp;dq=a300+airbus&amp;hl=en |title = German Aircraft-makers eye Aust with new jet |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date = 27 April 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1EFD3D5F107B93C7A91789D85F458785F9 |title = Rolls-Royce Is Bankrupt; Blames Lockheed Project |work=The New York Times |date = 5 February 1971 |first = John |last = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A300B was smaller but lighter and more economical than its three-engined American rivals.&lt;ref name="airbus3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/people/company-evolution/first-order-first-flight/ |title=History – First order, first flight |publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227193810/http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/people/company-evolution/first-order-first-flight/ |archivedate=27 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/662134872.html?dids=662134872:662134872&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+19%2C+1971&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=A300B+Airbus+Ahead+of+Its+Time%3F&amp;pqatl=google |title = A300B Airbus ahead of its time? |work=Los Angeles Times |date = 19 December 1971 |first= Joe |last= Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company NV==
{{Predecessors of Airbus Group}}
===Background===
In June 1997, British Aerospace Defence Managing Director [[John Weston (businessman)|John Weston]] commented "Europe... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrea|last=Rothman|author2=Landberg, Reed  |title=Europe Defense Firms Feel Pressure to Unite|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2544541&amp;date=19970615&amp;query=Pressure+to+Unite |work=The Seattle Times|date=1997-06-15|accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business: The Company File: Defense merger on the radar |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/130305.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 July 1998 |accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1995 the German aerospace and defence company [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace]] (DASA) and its British counterpart [[British Aerospace]] were said to be eager to create a transnational aerospace and defence company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Jones|title=Europe cries foul as New BAe emerges |work=The Times |date=1999-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies envisaged including the French company [[Aérospatiale]], the other major European aerospace company, but only after its privatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Pierre|last=Sparaco|author2=Morrocco, John D.  |title=French Government Grapples With Aerospace Strategy |work=Aviation Week and Space Technology |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies |date=1997-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, Aérospatiale and [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas|Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA]] into an integrated company; in this aim BAe and DASA were united against the various objections of Aérospatiale.&lt;ref name="BAeDASArelations"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bernard|last=Gray|author2=[[Michael Skapinker]] |title=Giant waiting in the wings: Bernard Gray and [[Michael Skapinker]] ask if Europe's defence industry can consolidate in time to challenge US dominance|work=Financial Times|date=1997-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as Airbus, British Aerospace and DASA were partners in the [[Panavia Tornado]] and [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] aircraft projects. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998, just as French participation became more likely with the announcement that Aérospatiale was to merge with [[Matra]] and emerge with a diluted French government shareholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAe and Dasa discuss proposals for merger: Aerospace groups still have 'important issues to resolve'|work=Financial Times |page=1 |date=24 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A merger was agreed between British Aerospace Chairman [[Richard Evans (businessman)|Richard Evans]] and DASA CEO [[Jürgen E.

The merger of British Aerospace and MES to form [[BAE Systems]] was announced on 19 January 1999 and completed on 30 November.&lt;ref&gt;BAE Systems Annual Report 1999 22. BAE Systems plc (2000).

In January 2001 Airbus Industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company, with legal and tax procedures being finalised on 11 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=EADS and BAE SYSTEMS complete Airbus integration – Airbus SAS formally established |publisher=BAE Systems plc |date=12 July 2001 |url=http://www.baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2001/press_120720011.html |accessdate=2007-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052508/http://baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2001/press_120720011.html |archivedate=20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="awst formation"&gt;{{cite news|first=Pierre|last=Sparaco|title=Climate Conducive For Airbus Consolidation|work=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology|date=19 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both EADS and BAE transferred ownership of their Airbus factories to the new Airbus SAS in return for 80&amp;thinsp;% and 20&amp;thinsp;% shares in the new company respectively. In April 2001 EADS agreed to merge its missile businesses with those of BAE Systems and [[Alenia Marconi Systems]] (BAE/[[Finmeccanica]]) to form [[MBDA]]. EADS took a 37.5&amp;thinsp;% share of the new company that was formally established in December 2001 and which thus became the world's second-largest missile manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EADS, BAE and Finmeccanica Complete MBDA Merger|work=Defense Daily International |date=2001-12-21 |quote=the new MBDA, the world's second largest missile manufacturer behind Raytheon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Financial performance of Airbus Group}}
On 16 June 2003 EADS acquired BAE's 25&amp;thinsp;% share in [[Astrium]], the satellite and space system manufacturer, to become the sole owner. EADS paid £84&amp;nbsp;million, however due to the lossmaking status of the company BAE invested an equal amount for "restructuring".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Mark| last = Odell| title = BAE agrees new deal for Astrium |work=Financial Times| page =15 | date = 2003-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently renamed [[EADS Astrium]], and had the divisions [[Astrium Satellites]], [[Astrium Space Transportation]] and [[Astrium Services]].

In November 2003, EADS announced that it was considering working with Japanese companies, and the Japanese [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Japan)|METI]], to develop a [[hypersonic]] [[airliner]] intended to be a larger, faster, and quieter, replacement for the [[Concorde]], which was retired in October the same year.

Despite repeated suggestions as early as 2000 that BAE Systems wished to sell its 20&amp;thinsp;% share of Airbus, the possibility was consistently denied by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter|last=Spiegel|title=BAE denies Airbus sale plans|work=Financial Times|date=2005-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 6 April 2006 BBC News reported that it was indeed to sell its stake, then "conservatively valued" at £2.4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="BBC Airbus"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4886154.stm | title =BAE confirms possible Airbus sale |publisher=BBC News | date =2006-04-07 | accessdate =2006-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the slow pace of informal negotiations, BAE exercised its [[put option]], which saw investment bank [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild]] appointed to give an independent valuation. Six days after this process began, Airbus announced delays to the [[Airbus A380|A380]] with significant effects on the value of Airbus shares. On 2 June 2006 Rothschild valued BAE's share at £1.87&amp;nbsp;billion, well below BAE's, analysts' and even EADS' expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =David | last =Gow | url =http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1811589,00.html | title =BAE under pressure to hold Airbus stake | work=The Guardian | location=UK |date =3 July 2006 | accessdate =3 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAE board recommended that the company proceed with the sale and on 4 October 2006 shareholders voted in favour; the sale was completed on 13 October making EADS the sole shareholder of Airbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAE Systems says completed sale of Airbus stake to EADS |work=Forbes |date=2006-10-13 |url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2006/10/13/afx3089453.html |accessdate=2006-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319090922/http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2006/10/13/afx3089453.html |archivedate=19 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007 EADS Defence and Security Systems division was awarded an eight-year, £200m contract to provide the IT infrastructure for the [[FiReControl]] project in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1002882&amp;PressNoticeID=2363 Dept for Communities &amp; Local Govt: Award of state of the art IT contract to improve fire service delivery 7 March 2007, (accessed 9 March 2007)] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition from Airbus Industrie GIE to Airbus SAS===

The retention of production and engineering assets by the partner companies in effect made Airbus Industrie a sales and marketing company.&lt;ref name="FTSAS"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Done|title=Survey – Europe Reinvented: Airbus has come of age|work=Financial Times |date=2 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement led to inefficiencies due to the inherent conflicts of interest that the four partner companies faced; they were both GIE shareholders of, and subcontractors to, the consortium. The companies collaborated on development of the Airbus range, but guarded the financial details of their own production activities and sought to maximise the transfer prices of their sub-assemblies.&lt;ref name="awst formation"/&gt; It was becoming clear that Airbus was no longer a temporary collaboration to produce a single plane as per its original mission statement, it had become a long term brand for the development of further aircraft. By the late 1980s work had begun on a pair of new medium-sized aircraft, the biggest to be produced at this point under the Airbus name, the [[Airbus A330]] and the [[Airbus A340]].&lt;ref&gt;Frawley, Gerald.

In the early 1990s the then Airbus CEO Jean Pierson argued that the GIE should be abandoned and Airbus established as a conventional company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Airbus Tries to Fly in a New Formation;Consortium's Chief Hopes a Revamping Could Aid Its Challenge to Boeing |work=The New York Times |date=2 May 1996 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/02/business/international-business-airbus-tries-fly-new-formation-consortium-s-chief-hopes.html?pagewanted=all | first=John | last=Tagliabue | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the difficulties of integrating and valuing the assets of four companies, as well as legal issues, delayed the initiative. In December 1998, when it was reported that British Aerospace and DASA were close to merging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spiegel |first =Peter |title=End of an era at BAE: how Sir Richard Evans changed the UK defence industry |work=Financial Times |date =17 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aérospatiale paralysed negotiations on the Airbus conversion; the French company feared the combined BAe/DASA, which would own 57.9% of Airbus, would dominate the company and it insisted on a 50/50 split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Platform envy |work=The Economist |date=12 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the issue was resolved in January 1999 when BAe abandoned talks with DASA in favour of merging with [[Marconi Electronic Systems]] to become [[BAE Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/239057.stm |title = GEC spoils DASA / BAe party |publisher=BBC News  |date = 20 December 1998 | accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Navy-International-99/BRITISH-AEROSPACE-AND-MARCONI-ELECTRONIC-SYSTEMS-FORM-THE-THIRD-LARGEST-DEFENCE-UNIT-IN-THE-WORLD.html |title = British Aerospace and Marconi Electronic Systems form the third largest defence unit in the world |publisher=Jane's International |date = 19 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman2000"/&gt; Then in 2000 three of the four partner companies ([[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace]], successor to Deutsche Airbus; [[Aérospatiale-Matra]], successor to Sud-Aviation; and CASA) merged to form EADS, simplifying the process.

[[File:9M-MNF at Heathrow (12792743363).jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A380]], the largest passenger jet in the world, introduced in 2007.]]
In mid-1988 a group of Airbus engineers led by Jean Roeder began working in secret on the development of an ultra-high-capacity airliner (UHCA), both to complete its own range of products and to break the dominance that [[Boeing]] had enjoyed in this market segment since the early 1970s with its [[Boeing 747|747]].&lt;ref&gt;Norris, 2005. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was announced at the 1990 [[Farnborough Air Show]], with the stated goal of 15% lower operating costs than the 747-400.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, 2005. p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Airbus organised four teams of designers, one from each of its partners ([[Aérospatiale]], [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace]], [[British Aerospace]], [[EADS CASA|CASA]]) to propose new technologies for its future aircraft designs. In June 1994 Airbus began developing its own very large airliner, then designated as A3XX.&lt;ref name = 'Beebover'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Airbus will reveal plan for super-jumbo: Aircraft would seat at least 600 people and cost dollars 8bn to develop |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 4 June 1994 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/airbus-will-reveal-plan-for-superjumbo-aircraft-would-seat-at-least-600-people-and-cost-dollars-8bn-to-develop-1420367.html |first = David |last = Bowen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Airbus unveils plans for 854-passenger airliner | website=The Baltimore Sun | date = 8 September 1994 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/111882477.html?dids=111882477:111882477&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+08%2C+1994&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Sun&amp;desc=Airbus+unveils+plans+for+854-passenger+airliner&amp;pqatl=google }}&lt;/ref&gt; Airbus considered several designs, including an odd side-by-side combination of two fuselages from the Airbus A340, which was Airbus's largest jet at the time.&lt;ref name="norris_wagner_book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris |first=Guy |author2=Mark Wagner |title=Airbus A380: Superjumbo of the 21st Century |publisher=Zenith Press |year=2005 |url=http://www.zenithpress.com/ProductDetails_32796.ncm |isbn=978-0-7603-2218-5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507101924/http://www.zenithpress.com/ProductDetails_32796.ncm |archivedate=7 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Airbus refined its design, targeting a 15% to 20% reduction in operating costs over the existing Boeing 747–400. The A3XX design converged on a double-decker layout that provided more passenger volume than a traditional single-deck design.

Five A380s were built for testing and demonstration purposes.&lt;ref name="flight_test_2005"&gt;{{cite news |title = A380 powers on through flight-test |last = Kingsley-Jones |first = Max | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2005/12/20/203708/a380-powers-on-through-flight-test.html |publisher=[[Flight International]] |date = 20 December 2005 |accessdate =25 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043200/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2005/12/20/203708/a380-powers-on-through-flight-test.html| archivedate= 30 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first A380 was unveiled at a ceremony in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, and its maiden flight took place on 27 April 2005.

The Airbus A380 was delayed in October 2006 due to the use of incompatible [[computer-aided design|software used to design]] the aircraft. Primarily, the [[Toulouse]] assembly plant used the latest version 5 of [[CATIA]] (made by [[Dassault]]), while the design centre at the [[Hamburg]] factory were using the older and incompatible version 4.&lt;ref name="matlack2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-10-04/airbus-first-blame-the-software|title=Airbus: First, blame the Software|first=Carol|last=Matlack|work=Businessweek |date=5 October 2006|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was that the 530&amp;nbsp;km of cables wiring throughout the aircraft had to be completely redesigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://manufacturing.cadalyst.com/manufacturing/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=390123|title=What Grounded the Airbus A380?|date=6 December 2006|first=Kenneth|last=Wong|publisher=Cadalyst|accessdate=12 December 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071130002721/http://manufacturing.cadalyst.com/manufacturing/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=390123| archivedate= 30 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no orders had been cancelled, Airbus still had to pay millions in late-delivery penalties.&lt;ref name="matlack2006"/&gt;

===Expansion and sale of BAE stake===
In 2003, Airbus and the Kaskol Group created an Airbus Engineering centre in Russia, which started with 30 engineers and since has emerged as a model of success for Airbus’ globalisation strategy. It was the first engineering facility to open in Europe outside the company's home countries. Equipped with state-of-the-art communications equipment and linked with Airbus engineering sites in France and Germany, the facility performs extensive work in disciplines such as fuselage structure, stress, system installation and design. In 2011, the centre employs some 200 engineers who have completed over 30 large-scale projects for the A320, the A330/A340 and the A380 programmes.

On 6 April 2006 [[BAE Systems]] planned to sell its 20% share in Airbus, then "conservatively valued" at €3.5&amp;nbsp;billion (US$4.17&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref name="bbc_bae_20060406"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4885426.stm |title = BAE Systems to sell Airbus stake |publisher=BBC News  |date = 6 April 2006 | accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts suggested the move to make partnerships with U.S. firms more feasible, in both financial and political terms.&lt;ref name="wsj_bae_20060407"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114439030968919877 |title = BAE in Talks With EADS to Sell its 20% Airbus Stake; British Firm is Focusing Increasingly on Defense Market, Especially in U.S. |author=Michaels, D. |work=The Wall Street Journal  |date = 7 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAE originally sought to agree on a price with EADS through an informal process. Due to lengthy negotiations and disagreements over price, BAE exercised its [[put option]], which saw investment bank [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild]] appointed to give an independent valuation.

In June 2006 Airbus was embroiled in significant international controversy over an announcement of further delays in the delivery of its A380. Following the announcement the value of associated stock plunged by up to 25% in a matter of days, although it soon recovered afterwards. Allegations of [[insider trading]] on the part of [[Noël Forgeard]], CEO of EADS, its majority corporate parent, promptly followed. The loss of associated value was of grave concern to BAE, press described a "furious row" between BAE and EADS, with BAE believing the announcement was designed to depress the value of its share.&lt;ref name="row"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/service/forum/article1014055.ece |title = BAE launches attack on EADS over Airbus superjumbo warning |work=The Independent |accessdate =4 September 2011 |first = Michael |last = Harrison  | date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French shareholder group filed a class action lawsuit against EADS for failing to inform investors of the financial implications of the A380 delays while airlines awaiting deliveries demanded compensation.&lt;ref name="FT 20060711 frontpage"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hollinger |first=Peggy |author2=Done, Kevin |title=Sharp drop in orders at Airbus |pages=1, 14 |publisher=Financial Times Daily |date=11 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, EADS chief [[Noël Forgeard]] and Airbus CEO [[Gustav Humbert]] resigned on 2 July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/03/business/worldbusiness/03airbus.html |title = Top Officials of Airbus and EADS Step Down |work=The New York Times |date = 3 July 2006|first = Carter |last = Dougherty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008–2013==


On 29 February 2008, the [[United States Air Force]] awarded a $35 billion contract for aerial refueling tankers (the [[KC-45]]) to Northrop Grumman, with EADS as a major subcontractor. The contract, one of the largest created by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defence]], is initially valued at $35 billion but has the potential to grow to $100 billion.

Under the contract, [[Northrop Grumman]] and EADS would build a fleet of 179 planes, based on the existing [[Airbus A330]], to provide in-air refueling to military aircraft, from fighter jets to cargo planes. While final assembly of the craft would take place at an Airbus plant near [[Mobile, Alabama]], parts would come from suppliers across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN2861183920080301 | title = Northrop-EADS beats Boeing to build U.S. tanker| accessdate=2008-03-01 |agency=Reuters | date=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the award was protested by [[Boeing]], the other bidder on the project, which was upheld by the [[GAO]]. In response to the new contest, on 8 March 2010, [[Northrop Grumman]] announced it was abandoning its bid for the new contract, with its CEO stating that the revised bid requirement favored Boeing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/northrop-abandons-bid-to-make-us-aerial-tankers-2010-03-08?reflink=MW_news_stmp "Northrop drops out of bid to make Air Force aerial tankers"], MarketWatch, 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April 2010, EADS announced it was re-entering the competition and intended to enter a bid with the KC-45.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kc45now.com/news-press-releases/04-20-2010.asp "EADS North America intends to submit proposal for U.S. Air Force tanker "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131135925/http://www.kc45now.com/news-press-releases/04-20-2010.asp |date=31 January 2011 }}, EADS North America press release, 20 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==From EADS NV to Airbus SE==


In January 2014, EADS was reorganised as ''Airbus Group NV'', with three divisions (Airbus, [[Airbus Defence and Space]], and [[Airbus Helicopters]].&lt;ref name=ft20140102/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/9e29cfb0-73be-11e3-a0c0-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2pGiV3qzr EADS changes name to Airbus], subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23513650 BBC News - EADS to be renamed Airbus Group].

===2007 restructuring of Airbus SAS===
On 9 October 2006 [[Christian Streiff]], Humbert's successor, resigned due to differences with parent company EADS over the amount of independence he would be granted in implementing his reorganisation plan for Airbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6035357.stm |publisher=BBC News  |title=Streiff resigns as CEO of Airbus |date=9 October 2006 | accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by EADS co-CEO [[Louis Gallois]], bringing Airbus under more direct control of its parent company.

On 28 February 2007, CEO Louis Gallois announced the company's restructuring plans. Entitled Power&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, the plan would see 10,000 jobs cut over four years; 4,300 in France, 3,700 in Germany, 1,600 in the UK and 400 in Spain. 5,000 of the 10,000 would be at [[subcontractor]]s.

===2011 A320neo record orders===
At the 2011 [[Paris Air Show]], Airbus received total orders valued at about $72.2 billion for 730 aircraft, representing a new record in the civil aviation industry. The [[A320neo]] ("new engine option") model, announced in December 2010, received 667 orders; this, together with previous orders, resulted in a total of 1029 orders within six months of launch date, creating another industry record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auairs.com/html/99784_I.-The-Paris-Air-Show-Airbus-730-orders-worth-$-72-billion.html |title=I.

===2016 deal with Iran===
In January 2016 Airbus announced it has signed a tentative agreement with [[Iran]] to sell 118 Airbus aircraft along with a comprehensive civil aviation cooperation package as a part of the implementation of the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] (JCPOA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/iran-deal/ |publisher = Airbus |title = Iran selects Airbus for its civil aviation renewal |date = 28 January 2016 |access-date = 2018-05-05 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160709172813/http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/iran-deal/# |archive-date = 2016-07-09 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing has also announced its will to sell 80 jets directly to Iran Air as part of a proposed deal worth up to $17.6bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/proposed-boeing-iran-air-deal-involves-80-jets-1466701529/ |website=The Wall Street Journal |title= Proposed Boeing-Iran Air Deal Involves 80 Jets |date= June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, In early July 2016, [[US House of Representatives]] passed amendments that would block [[US Department of Treasury]] funds from granting [[export]] licences or reexport of passenger commercial aircraft. Boeing reacted that if its deal with Iran is blocked by the [[US Congress]], all other companies that supply to its rivals should be prohibited as well. Airbus, too, has said that it requires US's approval to export airliners to Iran, because parts of its aircraft are made in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-says-if-congress-blocks-its-iran-jet-deal-rivals-should-be-halted-too-1468167871/ |website=The Wall Street Journal |title =Boeing Says If Congress Blocks Its Iran Jet Deal, Rivals’ Should Be Halted Too |date= July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal between Iran Air and Airbus was finally implemented, and the first new purchased Airbus aircraft, an A321, landed in Tehran's International [[Mehr Abad Airport]] on January 12, 2017; Airbus stated that the delivery has been in full compliance with the JCPOA and US government [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] licenses.&lt;ref name=170111PR&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/iran-air-takes-delivery-of-its-first-of-100-airbus-aircraft/ |publisher= Airbus |title= Iran Air takes delivery of its first of 100 Airbus aircraft |date= 11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
On 30 June, Airbus said its airliner sales team would now report directly to [[Tom Enders]] and by-pass [[Fabrice Bregier]], which will lead programs, support and services, engineering, manufacturing, procurement and quality while Enders will lead sales and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-reorganisation-idUSKBN19O0HW |date= Jul 3, 2017 |title= Airbus unveils leaner structure and sales shake-up |author= Tim Hepher and Sudip Kar-Gupta |work= Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October, Airbus and [[Bombardier Aerospace]] announced a partnership on the [[CSeries]] program, with Airbus acquiring a 50.01% majority stake, Bombardier keeping 31% and [[Investissement Québec]] 19%, to expand in an estimated market of more than 6,000 new 100-150 seat aircraft over 20 years; Airbus’ [[supply chain]] expertise should save production costs but headquarters and [[Assembly line|assembly]] remain in Québec while U.S. customers would benefit from a second Final Assembly Line in [[Mobile, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=Airbus16oct2017&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2017/10/airbus-bombardier-cseries-agreement.html |title= Airbus and Bombardier Announce C Series Partnership |publisher= Airbus |date= 16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall, [[Der Spiegel]] investigated systematic corruption and improper intermediates usage in past sales and questioned whether Enders can survive the scandal as he did not react quickly enough, then [[Handelsblatt]] reported the French government wants to control Airbus again and Bregier wants to get Enders fired to gain his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/intrigue-shakespearean-proportions-unfolds-airbus-top-echelon |title= Intrigue Of Shakespearean Proportions Unfolds In Airbus’ Top Echelon |date= Nov 9, 2017 |author= Jens Flottau |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, Paul Eremenko, Airbus's CTO, quit after two years. French unions held him for responsible for the job cuts made at a French research facility nearby Paris.

For 2017, Airbus announced it received 1,109 net orders from 44 customers in 2017, and delivered 718 aircraft to 85 customers: 558 A320 Family (including 181 A320neo); 67 A330s; 78 A350 XWBs and 15 A380s.&lt;ref name=Airbus15jan2018&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2018/01/airbus-commercial-aircraft-delivers-record-performance.html |title= Airbus Commercial Aircraft delivers record performance |publisher= Airbus }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
As the [[UK leaves the EU]], Airbus has been approached by at least seven governments (France, Germany, Spain, U.S., China, Mexico and South Korea) for [[wing]] production [[competitiveness]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Bloomberg30jan2018&gt;--&gt;
Currently produced in [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] and designed in [[Filton]] since 1970, wing production employs 15,000 people, which is over 10% of Airbus staff.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Bloomberg30jan2018&gt;--&gt;
[[carbon composite|Composite]] wings will be needed to lower fuel burn by 30% for the [[A320]] replacement.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg30jan2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/brexit-exposes-u-k-to-worldwide-raid-on-airbus-wing-production |title= Brexit Exposes U.K. to Worldwide Raid on Airbus Wing Production |author= Benjamin D Katz |date= 30 Jan 2018 |agency= Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tom Enders later promised the U.K. government Business Secretary [[Greg Clark]] that Airbus would retain its British operations “long into the future’’ and see the U.K. as a “home country and a competitive place to invest.’’

Airbus will designate a new CEO to succeed Enders by the end of 2018, which will be submitted to shareholders at the spring 2019 annual meeting, with planemaking boss and former Eurocopter head  [[Guillaume Faury]] as the main internal candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-ceo/airbus-to-name-new-ceo-at-the-end-of-the-year-idUSKBN1GW2JX |date= March 20, 2018 |title= Airbus to name new CEO at the end of the year |author= Tim Hepher, Cyril Altmeyer |agency= Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May, in its [[Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing#World_Trade_Organization_litigation|EU appeal ruling]], the WTO concluded that the [[A380]] and [[A350]] received improper [[subsidies]] through repayable launch aids or low [[interest rate]]s which could have been avoided, and Airbus agreed to correct those [[Violation of law|violation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-confirms-a380-and-a350-launch-aid-amendments-448786/ |title= Airbus confirms A380 and A350 launch-aid amendments |date= 22 May 2018 |author= David Kaminski-Morrow |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition with Boeing==
{{Main|Competition between Airbus and Boeing}}
{{Orders and deliveries of Airbus and Boeing}}
Airbus is in tight competition with Boeing every year for aircraft orders although Airbus has secured over 50% of aircraft orders in the decade since 2003.&lt;ref name=AirbusO&amp;D&gt;{{cite web|title=Airbus April 2013 orders and deliveries|url=http://www.airbus.com/no_cache/company/market/orders-deliveries/|publisher=Airbus|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airbus won a greater share of orders in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, Airbus achieved 1111 (1055 net) orders,&lt;ref name="airbuspageorders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/orders_and_deliveries/ |title=Airbus Orders and Deliveries |publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907084244/http://www.airbus.com/en/corporate/orders_and_deliveries/ |archivedate=7 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 1029 (net of 1002) for the same year at rival Boeing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm?content=displaystandardreport.cfm&amp;optReportType=AnnOrd&amp;pageid=m15521|accessdate=30 September 2009|title=Orders and Deliveries |publisher=Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Boeing won 55% of 2005 orders proportioned by value; and in the following year Boeing won more orders by both measures. Airbus in 2006 achieved its second best year ever in its entire 35-year history in terms of the number of orders it received, 824, second only to the previous year.&lt;ref name="airbus2006res"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/store/mm_repository/pdf/att00008917/media_object_file_Airbus2006AnnualReview.pdf |accessdate=7 October 2009 |title=Airbus Annual Review 2006 |publisher=Airbus |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408020435/http://www.airbus.com/store/mm_repository/pdf/att00008917/media_object_file_Airbus2006AnnualReview.pdf |archivedate=8 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Airbus plans to increase production of [[Airbus A320|A320]] airliners to reach 40 per month by 2012, at a time when Boeing is increasing monthly 737 production from 31.5 to 35 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/08/10/345959/airbus-ups-stakes-in-single-aisle-production-war.html
|accessdate=16 August 2010
|title=Airbus ups stakes in single-aisle production war
| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100817184040/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/08/10/345959/airbus-ups-stakes-in-single-aisle-production-war.html| archivedate= 17 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding operational aircraft, there were 7,264 Airbus aircraft operational at April 2013.&lt;ref name="AirbusO&amp;D"/&gt;  Although Airbus secured over 50% of aircraft orders in the decade since 2003, the number of Boeing aircraft still in operation at April 2013 still exceeded Airbus by 21% because Airbus made a late entry into the market, 1972 vs. 1958 for Boeing; this lead is diminishing as older aircraft are progressively retired.

Though both manufacturers have a broad product range in various segments from [[Narrow-body aircraft|single-aisle]] to [[wide-body aircraft|wide-body]], their aircraft do not always compete head-to-head. Instead they respond with models slightly smaller or bigger than the other in order to plug any holes in demand and achieve a better edge. The A380, for example, is designed to be larger than the 747. The A350XWB competes with the high end of the 787 and the low end of the 777. The A320 is bigger than the 737-700 but smaller than the 737–800. The A321 is bigger than the 737–900 but smaller than the previous 757-200. Airlines see this as a benefit since they get a more complete product range, from 100 seats to 500 seats, than if both companies offered identical aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedreed/2014/05/25/at-american-airlines-airbus-a321-is-forcing-out-the-a320/#5f9fdae642e9|title=At American Airlines, Airbus A321 Is Forcing Out the A320|last=Reed|first=Ted|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the [[Boeing 777]] has outsold its Airbus counterparts, which include the A340 family as well as the A330-300. The smaller A330-200 competes with the [[Boeing 767|767]], outselling its Boeing counterpart in recent years. The A380 is anticipated to further reduce sales of the Boeing 747, gaining Airbus a share of the market in very large aircraft, though frequent delays in the A380 programme have caused several customers to consider the refreshed [[Boeing 747-8|747–8]].&lt;ref name="times_delays_20061004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9077-2387999,00.html|title=Airbus will lose €4.8bn because of A380 delays|first=David|last=Robertson|work=The Times |location=UK |date=4 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Airbus has also proposed the [[Airbus A350 XWB|A350 XWB]] to compete with the  [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]], after being under great pressure from airlines to produce a competing model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/landingpage/airbus%20a350.html |title=Aircraft Profile: Airbus A350 |publisher=Flight International |accessdate=1 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022000154/http://www.flightglobal.com/landingpage/airbus%2Ba350.html |archivedate=22 October 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leeham.net/filelib/ScottsColumn040406.pdf |title=Redesigning the A350: Airbus’ tough choice |publisher=Leeham Company |date=4 April 2006 |first=Scott |last=Hamilton |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327094646/http://www.leeham.net/filelib/ScottsColumn040406.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Airbus Group said it was establishing an R&amp;D center and venture capital fund in Silicon Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2015/05/20150529_airbus_group_silicon_valley.html|title=Airbus Group Establishes Venture Capital Fund and Innovation Center in Silicon Valley|publisher=Airbus Group|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/29/airbus-group-idUSL5N0YK4XF20150529|title=Airbus Group starts $150 mln venture fund, Silicon Valley base|publisher=Reuters|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier stated: "What is the weakness of a big group like Airbus when we talk about innovation? We believe that we have better ideas than the rest of the world. We believe that we know because we control the technologies and platforms. The world has shown us in the car industry, the space industry and the hi-tech industry that this is not true. And we need to be open to others' ideas and others' innovations,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/47507116.cms|title=In a first, Bengaluru startups on Airbus radar for mentoring business ideas under BizLabs|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airbus Group CEO [[Tom Enders]] stated that "The only way to do it for big companies is really to create spaces outside of the main business where we allow and where we incentivize experimentation... That is what we have started to do but there is no manual... It is a little bit of trial and error. We all feel challenged by what the Internet companies are doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahles|first1=Andrea|title=A Q&amp;A with Airbus CEO Tom Enders|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/news/business/aviation/sky-talk-blog/article25185454.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=Star-Telegram|date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after launch, the Airbus Group Venture fund in Silicon Valley became fully operational in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2016/01/20160117_airbus_group_silicon_valley.html|title=Airbus Group Becomes Fully Operational in Silicon Valley|publisher=Airbus Group|date=16 January 2016|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hitit Computer Services''' is a [[private company]] that sells commercial IT systems for the [[travel industry]]. Its headquarters is in the [[ITU Arı Technopolis]] science park on the campus of [[Istanbul Technical University]].

Hitit was established as an IT company by executives from Turkish Airlines in 1994.&lt;ref name= Erdinc&gt;{{cite journal| last= Erdinc | first= Ersun|title= Suya Konan Turna |journal= Forbes Turkiye | date=August 2012 | pages= 104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first program sold by the company was Crane FF which became the most common loyalty management system, by number of airline users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eglobaltravelmedia.com.au/amadeus-enters-airline-customer-loyalty-arena-with-acquisition-of-hitit-loyalty/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414050032/http://www.eglobaltravelmedia.com.au/amadeus-enters-airline-customer-loyalty-arena-with-acquisition-of-hitit-loyalty/ |archivedate=2014-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitit introduced its new generation [[airline reservations system]] in 2004. The company opened an office in Dubai due to an increasing number of airline customers in the Middle East. Hitit is one of Turkey’s biggest software exporters: with 83% of its customerbase being overseas and 92% of its revenues coming from exports,around $5million-8$million revenue, it became the 3rd largest service exporter of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.akbank.com.tr/kobi/dis-ticaret/ihracatin-yildizlari/Sayfalar/2011-odulleri.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010213621/https://www.akbank.com.tr/kobi/dis-ticaret/ihracatin-yildizlari/Sayfalar/2011-odulleri.aspx |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxihaber.net/fotolar/2012_foto/haziran_2012/mh_hitit_bilgisayar_02062012.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140414130354/http://www.maxihaber.net/fotolar/2012_foto/haziran_2012/mh_hitit_bilgisayar_02062012.htm |archivedate=2014-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hygrometer''' ({{IPAc-en|h|aɪ|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɒ|m|ᵻ|t|ər}}) is an instrument used for measuring the amount of humidity and [[water vapor|water vapour]] in the atmosphere, in soil, or in confined spaces. Humidity measurement instruments usually rely on measurements of some other quantity such as temperature, pressure, mass, a mechanical or electrical change in a substance as moisture is absorbed. By calibration and calculation, these measured quantities can lead to a measurement of humidity. Modern electronic devices use temperature of condensation (called the [[dew point]]), or changes in electrical [[capacitance]] or [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] to measure humidity differences. The first crude hygrometer was invented by the Italian [[Renaissance]] [[polymath]] [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1480 and a more modern version was created by Swiss polymath [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in 1755.

The maximum amount of water vapour that can be held in a given volume of air (saturation) varies greatly by temperature; cold air can hold less mass of water per unit volume than hot air. Temperature can change humidity.  Most instruments respond to (or are calibrated to read) [[relative humidity]] (RH), which is the amount of water relative to the maximum at a particular temperature expressed as per cent.

== Classic Hygrometer ==
=== Ancient hygrometers ===
Prototype hygrometers were devised and developed during the [[Western Han dynasty]] in Ancient China to study weather.&lt;ref name="Hamblyn 2010 16–17"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Invention of Clouds: How an Amateur Meteorologist Forged the Language of the Skies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbajgFGBrTEC |last=Hamblyn |first=Richard |publisher=Pan Macmillan |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-330-39195-5 |publication-date=June 4, 2010 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken, then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight were used to tally the humidity level.

Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity, such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light, while when the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixed lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures |last=Selin |first=Helaine |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-4559-2 |edition=2nd |publication-date=April 16, 2008 |page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamblyn 2010 16–17" /&gt;

=== Metal-paper coil type ===
The metal-paper coil hygrometer is useful for giving a dial indication of humidity changes. It appears most often in inexpensive devices, and its accuracy is limited, with variations of 10% or more. In these devices, water vapour is absorbed by a salt-impregnated paper strip attached to a metal coil, causing the coil to change shape. These changes (analogous to those in a bimetallic thermometer) cause an indication on a dial. There is usually a metal needle on the front of the gauge that will change where it points to.

=== Hair tension hygrometers ===
[[File:Whalebone hygrometer-MHS 1085-P4070321-gradient.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Jean-André Deluc|Deluc]]'s hair tension whalebone hygrometer ([[Musée d'histoire des sciences de la Ville de Genève|MHS Geneva]])]]

These devices use a human or animal hair under some tension. The hair is [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] (tending toward retaining moisture); its length changes with humidity, and [[indicator (distance amplifying instrument)|the length change may be magnified by a mechanism and indicated on a dial or scale]]. In the late 17th century, such devices were called by some scientists ''hygroscopes''; that word is no longer in current use, but ''hygroscopic'' and ''[[hygroscopy]]'', which derive from it, still are. The traditional folk art device known as a [[weather house]] works on this principle. Whale bone and other materials may be used in place of hair.

In 1783, Swiss physicist and geologist Horace Bénédict de Saussure built the first hair-tension hygrometer using human hair.

The instrument can be made more sensitive by removing oils from the hair, such as by first soaking the hair in [[diethyl ether]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Draper |first=John William |title=A Textbook on Chemistry |year=1861 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKwS7QDh5eMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Psychrometers}} Psychrometer (Wet-and-dry-bulb thermometer) ===
[[File:Stevenson screen interior.JPG|thumb|The interior of a [[Stevenson screen]] showing a motorized psychrometer]]

A psychrometer, or a Wet-and-dry-bulb thermometer, consists of two thermometers, one that is dry and one that is kept moist with distilled water on a sock or wick.&lt;ref name="Gorse Johnston Pritchard 2012 p. 960"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gorse |first=C. |last2=Johnston |first2=D. |last3=Pritchard |first3=M. |title=A Dictionary of Construction, Surveying, and Civil Engineering |publisher=OUP Oxford |series=Oxford Quick Reference |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-104494-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6tGBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT960 |access-date=13 September 2018 |page=960}}&lt;/ref&gt; At temperatures above the freezing point of water, [[evaporation]] of water from the wick lowers the [[temperature]], so that the wet-bulb thermometer usually shows a lower temperature than that of the dry-bulb thermometer. When the air temperature is below freezing, however, the wet-bulb is covered with a thin coating of ice and may be warmer than the dry bulb.
[[File:Psychrometer-MHS 1603-P4070317-gradient.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Psychrometer probably made in Switzerland circa 1850 by Kappeller ([[Musée d'histoire des sciences de la Ville de Genève|MHS Geneva]])]]

[[Relative humidity|Relative humidity (RH)]] is computed from the ambient temperature, shown by the dry-bulb thermometer and the difference in temperatures as shown by the wet-bulb and dry-bulb thermometers. Relative humidity can also be determined by locating the intersection of the wet and dry-bulb temperatures on a [[Psychrometrics|psychrometric chart]]. The two thermometers coincide when the air is fully saturated, and the greater the difference the drier the air.  Psychrometers are commonly used in [[meteorology]], and in the [[HVAC]] industry for proper refrigerant charging of residential and commercial air conditioning systems.

==== Sling Psychrometer ====
[[File:Sling psychrometer.JPG|thumb|A sling psychrometer for outdoor use]]
A sling psychrometer, which uses thermometers attached to a handle or length of rope and spun in the air for about one minute, is sometimes used for field measurements, but is being replaced by more convenient electronic sensors. A whirling psychrometer uses the same principle, but the two thermometers are fitted into a device that resembles a [[Socket wrench|ratchet]] or football rattle.

=== Chilled mirror dew point hygrometer ===
Dew point is the temperature at which a sample of moist air (or any other [[water vapor|water vapour]]) at constant pressure reaches water vapor saturation. At this saturation temperature, further cooling results in condensation of water. Chilled mirror dewpoint hygrometers are some of the most precise instruments commonly available. They use a chilled mirror and optoelectronic mechanism to detect condensation on the mirror's surface. The temperature of the mirror is controlled by electronic feedback to maintain a dynamic equilibrium between evaporation and condensation, thus closely measuring the dew point temperature. An accuracy of 0.2&amp;nbsp;°C is attainable with these devices, which correlates at typical office environments to a relative humidity accuracy of about ±1.2%. These devices need frequent cleaning, a skilled operator and periodic calibration to attain these levels of accuracy. Even so, they are prone to heavy drifting in environments where smoke or otherwise impure air may be present.

More recently, spectroscopic chilled-mirrors have been introduced. Using this method, the dew point is determined with spectroscopic light detection which ascertains the nature of the condensation. This method avoids many of the pitfalls of the previous chilled-mirrors and is capable of operating drift free.

== Modern Hygrometers ==

=== Capacitive ===
For applications where cost, space, or fragility are relevant, other types of electronic sensors are used, at the price of a lower accuracy. In capacitive hygrometers, the effect of humidity on the [[dielectric constant]] of a [[polymer]] or metal oxide material is measured. With calibration, these sensors have an accuracy of ±2% RH in the range 5–95% RH. Without calibration, the accuracy is 2 to 3 times worse. Capacitive sensors are robust against effects such as condensation and temporary high temperatures.&lt;ref name="sensorsmag"&gt;D.K. Roveti. [http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/humidity-moisture/choosing-a-humidity-sensor-a-review-three-technologies-840 Choosing a Humidity Sensor: A Review of Three Technologies]. Sensors Magazine (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Capacitive sensors are subject to contamination, drift and aging effects, but they are suitable for many applications.

=== Resistive ===
In resistive hygrometers, the change in [[electrical resistance]] of a material due to humidity is measured.&lt;ref name="sensorsmag" /&gt; Typical materials are [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[conductive polymer]]s. Resistive sensors are less sensitive than capacitive sensors&amp;nbsp;– the change in material properties is less, so they require more complex circuitry. The material properties also tend to depend both on humidity and temperature, which means in practice that the sensor must be combined with a temperature sensor. The accuracy and robustness against condensation vary depending on the chosen resistive material. Robust, condensation-resistant sensors exist with an accuracy of up to ±3% RH [[Relative humidity|(relative humidity)]].

=== Thermal ===
In thermal hygrometers, the change in [[thermal conductivity]] of air due to humidity is measured. These sensors measure absolute humidity rather than relative humidity.&lt;ref name="sensorsmag" /&gt;

=== Gravimetric ===
A Gravimetric hygrometer measures the mass of an air sample compared to an equal volume of dry air. This is considered the most accurate primary method to determine the moisture content of the air.&lt;ref name="Wexler &amp; Hyland, 1964"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wexler |first1=Arnold |last2=Hyland |first2=Richard W. |title=The NBS standard hygrometer |url=https://archive.org/details/nbsstandardhygro73wexl |website=www.nist.gov |publisher=National Bureau of Standards |accessdate=July 21, 2017 |date=May 1, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; National standards based on this type of measurement have been developed in US, UK, EU and Japan. The inconvenience of using this device means that it is usually only used to calibrate less accurate instruments, called Transfer Standards.

== Applications ==
Aside from greenhouses and industrial spaces, hygrometers are also used in some [[incubators (egg)|incubators]], [[sauna]]s, [[humidor]]s and [[Museum|museums]]. They are also used in the care of wooden musical instruments such as pianos, guitars, violins, and harps which can be damaged by improper humidity conditions. In residential settings, hygrometers are used to assist in humidity control (too low humidity can damage human skin and body, while too high humidity favors growth of [[mildew]] and [[dust mite]]). Hygrometers are also used in the coating industry because the application of paint and other coatings may be very sensitive to humidity and [[dew point]]. With a growing demand on the amount of measurements taken the psychrometer is now replaced by a dewpoint gauge known as a dewcheck. These devices make measurements a lot faster but are often not allowed in explosive environments.

== Difficulty of accurate humidity measurement ==
Humidity measurement is among the more difficult problems in basic metrology. According to the [[WMO]] Guide, "The achievable accuracies (for humidity determination) listed in the table refer to good quality instruments that are well operated and maintained. In practice, these are not easy to achieve." Two thermometers can be compared by immersing them both in an insulated vessel of water (or alcohol, for temperatures below the freezing point of water) and stirring vigorously to minimize temperature variations. A high-quality liquid-in-glass thermometer if handled with care should remain stable for some years. Hygrometers must be calibrated in air, which is a much less effective heat transfer medium than is water, and many types are subject to drift&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veriteq.com/download/whitepaper/catching-the-drift.pdf catching the drift] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509094714/http://www.veriteq.com/download/whitepaper/catching-the-drift.pdf |date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so need regular recalibration. A further difficulty is that most hygrometers sense relative humidity rather than the absolute amount of water present, but relative humidity is a function of both temperature and absolute moisture content, so small temperature variations within the air in a test chamber will translate into relative humidity variations.

In a cold and humid environment, sublimation of ice may occur on the sensor head, whether it is a hair, dew cell, mirror, capacitance sensing element, or dry-bulb thermometer of an aspiration psychrometer. The ice on the probe matches the reading to the saturation humidity with respect to ice at that temperature, i.e. the frost point. However, a conventional hygrometer is unable to measure properly above the frost point, and the only way to go around this fundamental problem is to use a heated humidity probe.&lt;ref&gt;Makkonen, L., Laakso, T (2005) Humidity measurements in cold and humid environments. Boundary-Layer Meteorology, 116: 131–147, doi 10.1007/s10546-004-7955-y&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calibration standards ==

=== Psychrometer calibration ===

Accurate calibration of the thermometers used is fundamental to precise humidity determination by the wet-dry method. The thermometers must be protected from radiant heat and must have a sufficiently high flow of air over the wet bulb for the most accurate results. One of the most precise types of wet-dry bulb psychrometer was invented in the late 19th century by [[Richard Assmann|Adolph Richard Aßmann]] (1845–1918);&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uni-magdeburg.de/mbl/Biografien/1452.htm Aßmann, Adolph Richard]" by Guido Heinrich&lt;/ref&gt; in English-language references the device is usually spelled "Assmann psychrometer." In this device, each thermometer is suspended within a vertical tube of polished metal, and that tube is in turn suspended within a second metal tube of slightly larger diameter; these double tubes serve to isolate the thermometers from radiant heating. Air is drawn through the tubes with a fan that is driven by a clockwork mechanism to ensure a consistent speed (some modern versions use an electric fan with electronic speed control).&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;"[http://www.sil.si.edu/SmithsonianContributions/HistoryTechnology/text/SSHT-0002.txt Smithsonian Catalog of Meteorological Instruments in the Museum of History and Technology]" Prepared by W. E. Knowles Middleton&lt;/ref&gt; According to Middleton, 1966, "an essential point is that air is drawn between the concentric tubes, as well as through the inner one."&lt;ref name="middleton"&gt;A History of the Thermometer {{ISBN|0-8018-7153-0}} by W. E. Knowles Middleton, Johns Hopkins Press 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very challenging, particularly at low relative humidity, to obtain the maximal theoretical depression of the wet-bulb temperature; an Australian study in the late 1990s found that liquid-in-glass wet-bulb thermometers were warmer than theory predicted even when considerable precautions were taken;&lt;ref&gt;J. Warne, [http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/WebPortal-AWS/Tests/ITR648.pdf The Practical Impacts of RTD and Thermometer Design on Wet and Dry Bulb Relative Humidity Measurements]. Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; these could lead to RH value readings that are 2 to 5 percent points too high.

One solution sometimes used for accurate humidity measurement when the air temperature is below freezing is to use a thermostatically-controlled electric heater to raise the temperature of outside air to above freezing. In this arrangement, a fan draws outside air past (1) a thermometer to measure the ambient dry-bulb temperature, (2) the heating element, (3) a second thermometer to measure the dry-bulb temperature of the heated air, then finally (4) a wet-bulb thermometer. According to the [[World Meteorological Organization]] Guide, "The principle of the heated psychrometer is that the water vapour content of an air mass does not change if it is heated. This property may be exploited to the advantage of the psychrometer by avoiding the need to maintain an ice bulb under freezing conditions.".&lt;ref name="WMOGUIDE"&gt;" url={{cite web |url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/documents/gruanmanuals/CIMO/CIMO_Guide-7th_Edition-2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E9CzPWoA?url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/documents/gruanmanuals/CIMO/CIMO_Guide-7th_Edition-2008.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2013 |df=}}{{cite web |url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/documents/gruanmanuals/CIMO/CIMO_Guide-7th_Edition-2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2013 |df=}} archiveurl= WMO Guide To Meteorological Instruments And Methods Of Observation (Seventh edition, 2008), Chapter 4: Humidity, section 4.2.5: Heated psychrometer." World Meteorological Organization&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the humidity of the ambient air is calculated indirectly from three temperature measurements, in such a device accurate thermometer calibration is even more important than for a two-bulb configuration.

=== Saturated salt calibration ===
Various researchers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omega.com/temperature/z/pdf/z103.pdf Salt Calibration of Hygrometers]&lt;/ref&gt; have investigated the use of saturated salt solutions for calibrating hygrometers. Slushy mixtures of certain pure salts and distilled water have the property that they maintain an approximately constant humidity in a closed container. A saturated table salt (Sodium Chloride) bath will eventually give a reading of approximately 75%. Other salts have other equilibrium humidity levels: Lithium Chloride ~11%; Magnesium Chloride ~33%; Potassium Carbonate ~43%; Potassium Sulfate ~97%. Salt solutions will vary somewhat in humidity with temperature and they can take relatively long times to come to equilibrium, but their ease of use compensates somewhat for these disadvantages in low precision applications, such as checking mechanical and electronic hygrometers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5729">An '''illegal prime''' is a [[prime number]] that represents information whose possession or distribution is forbidden in some [[legal jurisdiction]]s. One of the first illegal primes was found in 2001. When interpreted in a particular way, it describes a [[computer program]] that bypasses the [[digital rights management]] scheme used on [[DVD]]s.  Distribution of such a program in the [[United States]] is illegal under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].&lt;ref name=gloss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=Illegal |title=Prime glossary - Illegal prime |publisher=Primes.utm.edu |date=1999-10-06 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An illegal prime is a kind of [[illegal number]].

==History==
[[Image:DeCSS.PNG|right|250px|thumbnail|The [[DeCSS]] code can be used by a computer to circumvent a DVD's [[copy protection]].]]

One of the earliest illegal prime numbers was generated in March 2001 by [[Phil Carmody]]. Its [[binary numeral system|binary]] representation corresponds to a [[data compression|compressed]] version of the [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] of a [[computer program]] implementing the [[DeCSS]] decryption algorithm, which can be used by a computer to circumvent a DVD's [[copy protection]].&lt;ref name=gloss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=Illegal |title=Prime glossary - Illegal prime |publisher=Primes.utm.edu |date=1999-10-06 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=1214 |title=Prime Curios – first known non-trivial executable prime |publisher=Primes.utm.edu |date=2001-09-10 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests against the indictment of DeCSS author [[Jon Lech Johansen]] and legislation prohibiting publication of DeCSS code took many forms.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, David P. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/wsj-04-12-2001.html "Banned Code Lives in Poetry and Song"]&lt;/ref&gt; One of them was the representation of the illegal code in a form that had an ''intrinsically archivable'' quality. Since the bits making up a computer program also represent a number, the plan was for the number to have some special property that would make it archivable and publishable (one method was to print it on a T-shirt). The [[primality]] of a number is a fundamental property of [[number theory]] and is therefore not dependent on legal definitions of any particular jurisdiction.

The large prime database of The [[Prime Pages]] website records the top 20 primes of various special forms; one of them is proof of primality using the [[elliptic curve primality proving]] (ECPP) [[algorithm]]. Thus, if the number were large enough and proved prime using ECPP, it would be published.

==Discovery==
Specifically, Carmody applied [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]] to several prime candidates of the form 
''k''·256&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b'',  where ''k'' was the [[decimal]] representation of the original compressed file. Multiplying by a power of 256 adds as many trailing [[null character]]s to the [[gzip]] file as indicated in the [[exponentiation|exponent]] which would still result in the DeCSS C code when unzipped.

Of those prime candidates, several were identified as [[probable prime]] using the [[Open-source software|open source]] program OpenPFGW, and one of them was proved prime using the ECPP algorithm implemented by the Titanix software.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/03/19/dvd_descrambler_encoded_in_illegal/ DVD descrambler encoded in ‘illegal’ prime number] (Thomas C. Greene, ''The Register'', Mon 19 March 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=953 |title=Prime Curios - first illegal prime |publisher=Primes.utm.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even at the time of discovery in 2001, this 1401-digit number, of the form ''k''·256&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2083, was too small to be mentioned, so Carmody created a 1905-digit prime, of the form ''k''·256&lt;sup&gt;211&lt;/sup&gt; + 99, that was the tenth largest prime found using ECPP, a remarkable achievement by itself and worthy of being published on the lists of the highest prime numbers.&lt;ref name=gloss/&gt; In a way, by having this number independently published for a completely unrelated reason to the DeCSS code, he had been able to evade legal responsibility for the original software.

Following this, Carmody discovered a 1811-digit prime -- this one being non-compressed, directly [[executable]] machine language in the [[Executable_and_Linkable_Format|ELF]] format for [[Linux]] [[Intel 80386|i386]], implementing the same DeCSS functionality.

The '''Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle''' ('''IXV''') is a [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) experimental [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] [[re-entry]] vehicle. It was developed to serve as a prototype [[spaceplane]] to validate the ESA's work in the field of [[Reusable launch system|reusable launchers]].

The European Space Agency has a program called [[Future Launchers Preparatory Programme]] (FLPP), which made a call for submissions for a reusable spaceplane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New milestone in IXV development | date = 15 September 2010 | url = http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Launchers_Home/SEMOU1KOXDG_0.html | publisher  = [[European Space Agency|ESA]] | quote = The Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV), under ESA’s [[Future Launchers Preparatory Programme]] (FLPP), is the step forward from the successful [[Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator]] flight in 1998, establishing Europe’s role in this field.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Transportation/New_milestone_in_IXV_development New milestone in IXV development].

== Development ==
=== Background ===
During the 1980s and 1990s, there was significant international interest in the development of [[Reusable launch system|reusable launch platforms]] and [[Spacecraft#Spaceplanes|reusable spacecraft]], particularly in respect to [[spaceplane]]s; perhaps the most high-profile examples of these being the [[United States of America|American]] [[Space Shuttle]] and [[Soviet]] [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] programmes. The national space agencies of European nations, such as France's [[CNES|Centre National d'Études Spatiales]] (CNES) and Germany's [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR), worked on their own designs during this era, the most prominent of these to emerge being the [[Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes]] spaceplane. Development of the Hermes programme, which was backed by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) for several years, was ultimately terminated in 1992 prior to any flights being performed in favour of a partnership arrangement with the [[Roscosmos|Russian Aviation and Space Agency]] (RKA) to use the existing [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] instead.

While work on the development of the Hermes vehicle was cancelled during the early 1990s, the ESA maintained its strategic long term objective to indigenously develop and eventually deploy similar reusable space vehicles. Accordingly, in support of this goal, the ESA embarked upon a series of design studies on different experimental vehicle concepts as well as to refine and improve technologies deemed critical to future reentry vehicles.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"&gt;Tumino, Giorgio and Yves Gerard. [https://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin128/bul128h_tumino.pdf "ESA Bulletin 128 - IXV: the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle."] ''ESA'', November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to test and further develop the technologies and concepts produced by these studies, there was a clear needs to accumulate practical flight experience with reentry systems, as well as to maintain and expand upon international cooperation in the fields of space transportation, exploration and science. Out of these desires emerged the [[Future Launchers Preparatory Programme]] (FLPP), an ESA-headed initiative conceived and championed by a number of its member states, which provided a framework for addressing the challenges and development of the technology associated with reentry vehicles.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt;

It was recognised that, in order for significant progress to be made, FLPP would require the production and testing of a prototype reentry vehicle that drew on their existing research, technologies, and designs.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; By adopting a step-by-step approach using a series of test vehicles prior to the development of a wider series of production vehicles, this approach was seen to reduce the risk and to allow for the integration of progressively more sophisticated developments out of from the early relatively low-cost missions. 

In line with this determination, during early 2005, the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) project was formally initiated by the [[Italian Space Agency]] and the [[Italian Aerospace Research Centre]] under an Italian programme named PRIDE ([[Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe]])&lt;ref name='Space Rider PRIDE'/&gt;  Their main industrial contractor was Next Generation Launcher Prime SpA (NGLP) in Italy.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; The latter organisation is a [[joint venture]] entity comprising two major European aerospace companies, [[Astrium]] and [[Finmeccanica]]. The PRIDE programme had the support of various national space agencies, including the [[European Space Research and Technology Centre]], [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI), French space agency [[CNES]], and Germany's [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]]; by November 2006, the IXV was supported by 11 Member States: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], France, Germany, [[Ireland]], Italy, [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[The Netherlands]].&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; Of these, Italy emerged as the principal financial backer of the IXV programme.&lt;ref name = "clark spacenow"/&gt;

=== Selection and pre-launch testing ===
[[File:Sentinel-2 and vega.jpg|thumb|Vega rocket]]
The IXV project also benefitted from and harnessed much of the research data and operational principles from many of the previously conducted studies, especially from the successful [[Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator]] (ARD), which was test-flown during 1998. Early on, during the mission definition and design maturity stages of the project, thorough comparisons were conducted again between existing ESA and national concepts against shared criteria, aimed at evaluating the experiment requirements (technology and systems), programme requirements (technology readiness, development schedule and cost) and risk mitigation (feasibility, maturity, robustness and growth potential).&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; The selected baseline design, a slender lifting body configuration, drew primarily upon the CNES-led ''Pre-X'' the ESA's ARD vehicles. Development work quickly proceeded through the preliminary design definition phase, reaching a system requirements review by mid-2007.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt;

On 18 December 2009, the ESA announced the signing of a contract with [[Thales Alenia Space]], valued at {{currency|39.4 million|EUR}}, to cover 18 months of preliminary IXV work.&lt;ref name="Coppinger"&gt;{{cite web | title = ESA Spending Freeze Ends with Deals for Sentinel Satellites, Ariane 5 Upgrade | first = Peter B. | last = de Selding | date = 18 December 2009 | url = http://www.spacenews.com/civil/2009-12-18esa-signs-new-contracts-worth-over-500-million-euros.html | publisher  = Space News | quote = The contract is valued at 39.4 million euros to cover preliminary IXV work for 18 months, Fabrizi said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ESA and Thales Alenia Space establish agreement for development of Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) | date = 19 June 2009 | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM52E3XTVF_index_0.html | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the total estimated cost for the IXV project was reportedly {{currency|150 million|EUR}}.&lt;ref name="ixv-ebook"&gt;{{cite web | title = IXV e-book | date = 2011 | publisher = ESA | url = http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/ixv/offline.zip | format = [[PDF]] within a [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=Redalert2fan |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During late 2012, the IXV's subsonic parachute system was tested at the [[Yuma Proving Ground]] in [[Arizona]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/ESA_s_IXV_reentry_vehicle_prepares_for_soft_landing2 "ESA's IXV Reentry Vehicle Prepares for Soft Landing"]. ESA, 9 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, a series of water impact tests were conducted at [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]]'s INSEAN research tank near Rome, Italy.&lt;ref name="INSEAN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insean.cnr.it/en/content/water-impact-and-hydrodynamic-loads |title=Water impact and hydrodynamic loads |first=A. |last=Iafrati |publisher=[[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]] |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2013, an IXV test vehicle was dropped from an altitude of {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the [[Salto di Quirra]] range off [[Sardinia]], Italy. The purpose of this test-drop was to validate the vehicle's water-landing system, including the subsonic parachute, flotation balloons, and beacon deployment. A small anomaly was encountered during the inflation of the balloons, however, all of the other systems performed as expected. Following the drop-test, the vehicle was retrieved for further analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Safe_splashdown_for_Intermediate_eXperimental_Vehicle "Safe splashdown for IXV"]. ESA, 21 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June 2014, the recovery ship ''Nos Aries'' conducted a training exercise involving a single IXV test article off the coast of [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bringing back our Spaceplane | date = 24 June 2014 | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Bringing_back_our_spaceplane | publisher = ESA | quote = Yesterday, the ship and crew aiming to recover Europe’s unmanned IXV spacecraft in November had a practice run off the coast of Tuscany, Italy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 2014, the IXV test vehicle arrived at the [[ESTEC]] Technical Centre in [[Noordwijk]], the Netherlands, to undergo a test campaign to confirm its flight readiness in anticipation of a flight on a [[Vega (rocket)|Vega rocket]], which was by that point scheduled to occurring during November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Unboxing IXV | date = 2 July 2014 | url = http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/07/Unboxing_IXV | publisher = ESA | quote = The moment when ESA’s IXV Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle is removed from its protective container, safely inside the cleanroom environment of the Agency’s Technical Centre.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:IXV drop-test model front.jpg|thumb|left|300px|frontal view of the vehicle]]
The Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) is a prototype unmanned reusable [[spaceplane]] —and the precursor of the next model called [[Space Rider]]. According to the ESA, the ''Intermediate'' part of its name is due to the shape of the vehicle not necessarily being representative of the envisioned follow-on production spacecraft.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; It possesses a [[lifting body]] arrangement which lacks wings of any sort; the size and shape is balanced between the need to maximise internal volume to accommodate experimental payloads while keeping within the mass limits of the [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] launcher and favourable [[Center of mass#Center of gravity|centre of gravity]]. The vehicle purposefully includes several key technologies of interest to the ESA, including its [[thermal protection]] system and the presence of active aerodynamic control surfaces.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; Control and manoeuvrability of the IXV is provided by a combination of these aerodynamic surfaces (comprising a pair of movable [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]]) and thrusters throughout its full flight regime, which includes flying at [[hypersonic]] speeds.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt;

A key role for the IXV is the gaining of data and experience in aerodynamically-controlled reentry, which has been claimed by the ESA to represent significant advance on earlier [[Ballistics|ballistic]] and quasi-ballistic techniques previously employed.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; Throughout each mission, representative reentry performance data is recorded in order to investigate aerothermodynamic phenomena and to validate system design tools and ground verification methods, which in turn supports future design efforts.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; Reentry is accomplished in a nose-high attitude, similar to the [[NASA]]-operated [[Space Shuttle]]; during this phase of flight, manoeuvring of the spaceplane is accomplished by rolling out-of-plane and then lifting in that direction, akin to a conventional aircraft.&lt;ref name = "clark spacenow"/&gt; Landing is accomplished by an arrangement of [[parachute]]s, which are ejected during the descent through the top of the vehicle; additionally, seconds prior to landing, a series of [[airbag]]s are inflate to soften the landing.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt;

Another key ESA objective for the IXV was the verification of both its structure and its advanced thermal protection measures, specifically their performance during the challenging conditions present during reentry.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; The underside is covered by [[ceramic]] thermal protection panels composed of a blend of [[carbon fiber]] and [[silicon carbide]] directly fixed to the spaceplane's structure, while ablative materials comprising a [[Cork (material)|cork]] and [[silicon]]-based [[composite material|composite]] material coat the vehicle's upper surfaces.&lt;ref name = "clark spacenow"/&gt; The [[airframe]] was based on a traditional hot-structure/cold-structure arrangement; relying upon a combination of advanced ceramic and metallic assemblies, insulating materials, as well as the effective design of assorted attachments, junctions and seals; the role played by advanced navigation and control techniques was also deemed to be of a high importance. The IVX is supported on-orbit by a separate manoeuvring and support module, which is largely similar to the Resource Module that had been intended for use by the cancelled [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] shuttle. The [[avionics]] of the IVX are controlled by a [[LEON2-FT]] microprocessor and are interconnected by a [[MIL-STD-1553B]] serial bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = SCOE for IXV GNC | first1 = Enrique | last1 = Rodríguez | first2 = Pablo | last2 = Giménez | first3 = Ignacio | last3 = de Miguel | first4 = Vicente | last4 = Fernández | date = 25 September 2012 | conference = Simulation &amp; EGSE Facilities for Space Programmes (SESP 2012) | conferenceurl = http://congrexprojects.com/12c09/ | publisher = European Space Agency | url = http://congrexprojects.com/docs/12c09_docs/rodriguez-(2).htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an experimental vehicle primarily intended to gather data, various assorted sensors and monitoring equipment are present and operational throughout the full length of the flight in order to gather data to support the evaluation effort, including the verification of the vehicle's critical reentry technologies.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; The recorded data covers various elements of the IVX's flight, including its guidance, navigation and control systems, such as Vehicle Model Identification (VMI) measurements for post-flight reconstruction of the spacecraft's dynamic behaviour and environment, as well as the mandatory core experiments regarding its reentry technologies.&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; Additionally, the IXV will typically carry complementary passenger experiments which, while not having been directly necessary to its mission success, serve to increase the vehicle's return on investment; according to the ESA, in excess of 50 such proposals had been received from a mixture of European industries, research institutes and universities, many having benefits to future launcher programmes (such as potential additional methods for guidance, navigation, control, structural health monitoring, and thermal protection) space exploration and scientific value. Throughout each mission, [[telemetry]] is broadcast to ground controllers to monitor the vehicle's progress;&lt;ref name = "tum yves 2006"/&gt; however, phenomenon such as the build-up of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] around the spaceplane during its re-entry has been known to block radio signals.&lt;ref name = "clark spacenow"&gt;Clark, Stephen.

The IXV is the precursor of the next model named [[Space Rider]], also developed under the Italian [[Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe|PRIDE programme]] for ESA.&lt;ref name="Space Rider PRIDE" /&gt;

== Operational history ==
During 2011, it was reported that the IEV was planned to conduct its maiden flight as early as 2013;&lt;ref name="SpaceComEuropeMinishuttle"&gt;{{cite web | title = Europe Aims to Launch Robotic Mini-Shuttle By 2020 | first = Rob | last = Coppinger | date = 13 June 2011 | url = http://www.space.com/11948-robot-space-plane-europe-ixv-launching-2020.html | publisher  = Space.com | quote = In 2013, a Vega rocket will carry ESA’s Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle into space.}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the vehicle was later rescheduled to perform its first launch using the newly developed [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] launcher during late 2014.&lt;ref name="space-travel"&gt;{{cite web | title = Europe's IXV atmospheric reentry demonstrator ready for final tests | date = 24 March 2014 | publisher = space-travel.com | url = http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Europes_IXV_atmospheric_reentry_demonstrator_ready_for_final_tests_999.html | quote = The launch, using Europe's new Vega light launcher, is scheduled for October 2014.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esaIXVfly"&gt;{{cite web | title = Vega to fly ESA experimental reentry vehicle | date = 16 December 2011 | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMWQM8XZVG_index_0.html | publisher = ESA | quote = The launch of ESA’s IXV Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle on Europe’s new Vega rocket is now in detailed planning, a major step towards the craft’s flight in 2014.

Following some delays, on 11 February 2015, the IXV was successfully launched into orbit by a Vega rocket as part of the [[VV04]] mission.&lt;ref name="launch11feb" /&gt; Having launched at 08:40am local time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = European Mini-Space Shuttle Aces 1st Test Flight | date = 11 February 2015 | url = http://www.space.com/28520-europe-launches-mini-shuttle-ixv.html | publisher = Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the spaceplane separated from the Vega launch vehicle at 333&amp;nbsp;km altitude and ascended to 412&amp;nbsp;km, after which it commenced a controlled descent towards beginning its [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]] at 120&amp;nbsp;km altitude, travelling at a recorded speed of 7.5&amp;nbsp;km/s, identical as to a typical re-entry path to be flown by [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) spacecraft. Following re-entry, the IXV glided over the [[Pacific Ocean]] prior to the opening of its landing parachutes, which were deployed in order to slow down the craft's descent, having flown over 7300&amp;nbsp;km from the beginning of its reentry.&lt;ref name="ESABulletin161"/&gt;{{rp|25–26}} The vehicle descended to the surface of Pacific Ocean, where it was subsequently recovered by the ''Nos Aries'' ship; analysis of both the spacecraft itself and recorded mission data took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ESA’s IXV reentry vehicle prepares for soft landing | date = 9 November 2012 | url = http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Launchers_Home/SEMGNS62Q8H_0.html | publisher = ESA | quote = it will fly the experimental hypersonic phase over the Pacific Ocean, descend by parachute and land in the ocean to await recovery and analysis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31421200 |title=Europe's mini-space shuttle returns |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Dordain]], then-director general of the ESA, stated of the mission: "It couldn't have been better, but the mission itself is not yet over...it will move the frontiers of knowledge further back concerning aerodynamics, thermal issues, and guidance and navigation of such a vehicle — this lifting body".&lt;ref name = "clark spacenow"/&gt;

Following on from the completion of the reportedly 'flawless' test flight, ESA officials decided that an additional test flight should be performed during the 2019-2020 timeframe. During this mission, the IXV is envisioned to land in a different manner, descending directly onto a runway instead of performing a [[splashdown]] landing as before; this approach is to be achieved either via the installation of a [[parafoil]], or by the adoption of [[landing gear]]. The planning for the second spaceflight was originally to begin during March 2015, while design work on the modified vehicle was to commence during mid 2015.&lt;ref name="SpaceComNextLaunch"&gt;{{cite web | title = Europe's Newly-Tested Space Plane Aims for Next Launch in 2019 | first = Elizabeth | last = Howell | date = 23 February 2015 | url = http://www.space.com/28622-european-space-plane-ixv-2019-launch.html | website = Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ESA December 2016 Science Budget funding was approved by the Ministerial Council for the next IXV flight in the form of the commercialised Space Rider mini shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/europe-commits-to-the-space-station-and-exomars-as-part-of-11-billion-in-commitments-to-esa/|title=Europe commits to the space station and ExoMars as part of $11 billion in commitments to ESA - SpaceNews.com|date=2 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subject to design reviews in 2018 and 2019 a full size mockup will be dropped from balloon in 2019 and will have a first flight atop a Vega-C in 2020/2021 and then conduct approximately 5 science flights at 6-12 month intervals before becoming commercially available from 2025 at a cost of $40,000 per kg of payload for launch, operation and return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/esa-aims-to-privatize-space-rider-unmanned-spaceplane-by-2025/|title=ESA aims to privatize Space Rider unmanned spaceplane by 2025 - SpaceNews.com|date=22 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Space Rider mini shuttle will have a length of between 4 and 5 meters, a payload capacity of 800&amp;nbsp;kg,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} a total mass of 2,400&amp;nbsp;kg and endurance of 2-6 month missions at a 400&amp;nbsp;km orbit before returning to Earth and being reflown within 4 months. The Vega-C rockets 4th stage payload dispenser AVUM acts as the service module for the shuttle providing orbital manoeuvring and braking, power and communications before being jettisoned for re-entry.&lt;ref&gt;http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/space_transportation/Space_Rider_factsheet_HiRes_ok.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The AVUM service module replaces the integrated IXV Propulsion Module and frees 0.8 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of internal space in the vehicle for a payload bay. The Space Rider is similar in shape and operation to the US Airforce X-37B but half the X37's length and a fifth the X37's mass and payload capacity making it the smallest and lightest spaceplane to ever fly. Payload doors will be opened on achieving orbit exposing instruments and experiments to space before being closed for landing.

[[Image:Bareters 085b55 12.jpg|thumb|right|Iron–hydrogen resistor (barretter)]]
An '''iron–hydrogen resistor''' consists of a [[hydrogen]]-filled glass bulb (similar to a light bulb), in which an [[iron]] wire is located.  This resistor has a [[positive temperature coefficient]] of resistance.  This characteristic made it useful for stabilizing circuits against fluctuations in power supply voltages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vintage-radio.com/repair-restore-information/valve_power-supply-stages.html Power Supply Stages]&lt;/ref&gt; This device is often called a "barretter" because of its similarity to the [[Hot wire barretter|barretter]] used for detection of radio signals. The modern  successor to the iron–hydrogen resistor is the [[current source]]. 

==Operation==
When the current increases the temperature will increase. The higher temperature leads to a higher [[electrical resistance]], opposing the increase in current. The hydrogen gas protects the iron against [[oxidation]], and also enhances the effect since the solubility of hydrogen in iron increases as temperature increases,  resulting in higher resistance.

==Uses==
Iron–hydrogen resistors were used in the early [[vacuum tube]] systems in series with the tube heaters, to stabilize the heater circuit current against fluctuating supply voltage. In 1930s Europe it was popular to combine them in the same glass envelope with an [[negative temperature coefficient|NTC]]-type [[thermistor]] made of [[Uranium dioxide|UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] until 1936, known as ''Urdox resistor'' and acting as an [[inrush current limiter]] for the series heater strings of domestic [[AC/DC receiver design#Series tube heaters|ac/dc]] tube radios.

'''''L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat''''' (translated from French into English as '''''The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station''''', '''''Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat''''' (US) and '''''The Arrival of the Mail Train''''', and in the United Kingdom the film is known as '''''Train Pulling into a Station''''') is an [[1896 in film|1896]] [[France|French]] [[Short subject|short]] [[black-and-white]] [[silent film|silent]] [[documentary film]] directed and produced by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]]. Contrary to myth, it was not shown at the Lumières' first public film screening on 28 December 1895 in [[Paris]], [[France]]: the programme of ten films shown that day makes no mention of it. Its first public showing took place in January 1896.

==Content==
[[File:L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat.jpg|left|thumb|The train moving directly towards the camera was said to have terrified spectators at the first screening, a claim that has been called an [[urban legend]].]]

This 50-second silent film shows the entry of a train pulled by a [[steam locomotive]] into the [[gare de La Ciotat]], the train station of the French coastal town of [[La Ciotat]]. Like most of the early Lumière films, ''L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat'' consists of a single, unedited view illustrating an aspect of everyday life. There is no apparent intentional camera movement, and the film consists of one continuous real-time shot.

==Production==
This 50-second movie was filmed in [[La Ciotat]], [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], [[France]]. It was filmed by means of the [[Cinématographe]], an all-in-one camera, which also serves as a printer and film projector. As with all early Lumière movies, this film was made in a [[35 mm film|35 mm format]] with an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.33:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000012/technical |title=Technical Specifications |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=2007-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary reaction==

[[File:L'Arrivee d'un train en gare de la Ciotat, 1895.ogv|thumb|''L'Arrivee d'un train en gare de la Ciotat'', 1895]]

The film is associated with an [[urban legend]] well known in the world of cinema. The story goes that when the film was first shown, the audience was so overwhelmed by the moving image of a life-sized train coming directly at them that people screamed and ran to the back of the room. [[Hellmuth Karasek]] in the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' wrote that the film "had a particularly lasting impact; yes, it caused fear, terror, even panic."&lt;ref&gt;"Ein Kurzfilm wirkte besonders nachhaltig, ja er erzeugte Furcht, Schrecken, sogar Panik." http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13687466.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, some have doubted the veracity of this incident such as film scholar and historian {{ill|Martin Loiperdinger|de}} in his essay, "Lumiere's Arrival of the Train: Cinema's Founding Myth".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moving Image'': Volume 4, Number 1, Spring 2004, pp. 89-118)&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as theorist [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] have speculated that the alleged reaction may have been caused by the projection being mistaken for a [[camera obscura]] by the audience which at the time would have been the only other technique to produce a naturalistic moving image. Whether or not it actually happened, the film undoubtedly astonished people unaccustomed to the illusion created by moving images.

==Cinematic techniques==
This film is interesting because it contains the first example of several common [[cinematic techniques]]: [[camera angle]], [[long shot]],  [[medium shot]], [[close-up]], and [[forced perspective]].

It is evident from their films, taken as a whole, that the Lumière brothers knew what the effect of their choice of camera placement would be. They placed the camera on the platform to produce a dramatic increase in the size of the arriving train. The train arrives from a distant point and bears down on the viewer, finally crossing the lower edge of the screen.

A significant aspect of the film is that it illustrates the use of the long shot to establish the setting of the film, followed by a medium shot, and then a close-up.  As the camera is static for the entire film, the effect of these various "shots" is achieved by the movement of the subject alone. Nonetheless, it is these different types of shots are clearly illustrated here, and later film makers moved their cameras to achieve these shots.

==3D version==
What most film histories leave out is that the Lumière Brothers were trying to achieve a [[Stereoscopy|3D image]] even prior to this first-ever public exhibition of motion pictures. Louis Lumière eventually re-shot ''L'Arrivée d’un Train'' with a stereoscopic film camera and exhibited it (along with a series of other 3D shorts) at a 1935 meeting of the French Academy of Science. Given the contradictory accounts that plague early cinema and pre-cinema accounts, it's plausible that early cinema historians conflated the audience reactions at these separate screenings of ''L'Arrivée d’un Train''. The intense audience reaction fits better with the latter exhibition, when the train apparently ''was'' actually coming out of the screen at the audience. But due to the fact that the [[3D film]] never took off commercially as the conventional 2D version did, including such details would not make for a compelling myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.editorsguild.com/v2/magazine/archives/0508/columns_cutprint2.htm |title=Editors Guild Magazine - Cut/Print |publisher=Editorsguild.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021155402/http://www.editorsguild.com/v2/magazine/archives/0508/columns_cutprint2.htm |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
[[File:Les frères Lumiéres quai de la gare de la Ciotat france.jpg|thumb|The [[Gare de La Ciotat|La Ciotat train station]] (shown here in 2010) commemorates the film.]]

The short has been featured in a number of film collections including ''Landmarks of Early Film volume 1''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000012/dvd |title=DVD |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=2007-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A screening of the film was depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]''. The scene of the train pulling in was placed at #100 on [[Channel 4|Channel 4's]] two-part documentary ''[[The 100 Greatest Scary Moments]]''.

In March 2017, the film was encoded into DNA by [[Yaniv Erlich]] and Dina Zielinski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erlich|first1=Yaniv|last2=Zielinski|first2=Dina|title=DNA Fountain enables a robust and efficient storage architecture|journal=Science|date=2 March 2017|volume=355|issue=6328|pages=950–954|doi=10.1126/science.aaj2038|url=http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/12/04/074237.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yong|first1=Ed|title=This Speck of DNA Contains a Movie, a Computer Virus, and an Amazon Gift Card|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/this-speck-of-dna-contains-a-movie-a-computer-virus-and-an-amazon-gift-card/518373/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7326">'''Limitations on exclusive rights: Computer programs''' is the title of the current form of section 117 of the U.S. Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;117). In [[United States copyright law]], it provides users with certain adaptation rights for computer software that they own.

==Background==

The current form of section 117 is the result of a recommendation by [[CONTU]], the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works. The U.S. Congress established CONTU to study and make recommendations on modifying the 1976 Copyright Act to deal with new technologies, particularly computer software, that Congress had not addressed when it passed the 1976 Act. CONTU operated from 1975 to 1978, and its principal recommendation to Congress was to revise the wording of section 117. Its report stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because the placement of a work into a computer is the preparation of a copy, the law should provide that persons in rightful possession of copies of programs be able to use them freely without fear of exposure to copyright liability. Obviously, creators, lessors, licensors, and vendors of copies of programs intend that they be used by their customers, so that rightful users would but rarely need a legal shield against potential copyright problems. It is easy to imagine, however, a situation in which the copyright owner might desire, for good reason or none at all, to force a lawful owner or possessor of a copy to stop using a particular program. One who rightfully possesses a copy of a program, therefore, should be provided with a legal right to copy it to that extent which will permit its use by that possessor. This would include the right to load it into a computer and to prepare archival copies of it to guard against destruction or damage by mechanical or electrical failure. But this permission would not extend to other copies of the program. Thus, one could not, for example, make archival copies of a program and later sell some while retaining some for use. The sale of a copy of a program by a rightful possessor to another must be of all rights in the program, thus creating a new rightful possessor and destroying that status as regards the seller.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The revisions recommended by CONTU were approved with one important change. Instead of "rightful possessor" of a computer program Congress used the word "owner" of a computer program. It is not clear why this change was made.&lt;ref&gt;According to Professor Holaar, [http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise17.html Digital Law Online: History].§&amp;nbsp;I.E.1: "There is nothing in the legislative history of the bill that indicates why this change was made. Perhaps the best explanation is that Congress was concerned that people would make copies of software they had rented or borrowed from a public library, where they were rightful possessors during the time they had the software, and then not delete the copies when they return the software to the rental place or library."&lt;/ref&gt; This one change resulted in a state of affairs in which software vendors began to take the position that customers do not own their software but rather only "license" it. The courts have split on whether the assertion in software agreements that the customer does not own the software, and has only a right to use it in accordance with the license agreement, is legally enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''Krause v. Titleserv, Inc.'', 402 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 2005), the Second Circuit held that "Congress's decision to reject 'rightful possessor' in favor of  'owner'  [did]  not  indicate  an intention  to limit the protection of the statute to those possessing formal  title." ''Id''. at 123. Rather, "formal  title  in  a program copy is not an absolute prerequisite to qualifying for [shelter under §&amp;nbsp;117]. Instead, courts should inquire into whether the party exercises sufficient incidents of ownership over a copy of the program  to  be sensibly considered the  owner of  the  copy for purposes of §&amp;nbsp;117(a)." ''Id.'' at 124.

On the other hand, in ''MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.'', the Ninth Circuit held §&amp;nbsp;117 inapplicable to a customer because "MAI software licenses [did] not allow for the use or copying of MAI software by third parties such as [repair and maintenance persons]." The court also said: "Since MAI licensed its software, the [] customers [were licensees of MAI and] do not qualify as 'owners' of the software and are not eligible for protection under § 117." ''Id''. at 518 n.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Users' rights under §&amp;nbsp;117==

Section 117 is a limitation on the rights granted to holders of copyright on [[computer program]]s. The limitation allows the owner of a particular copy of a copyrighted computer program to make copies or adaptations of the program for any of several reasons:

# Utilization of the program. The user is allowed to install the software to his [[hard disk]] and run the software in random-access memory.
# Making [[backup]] and [[archive|archival]] copies. The user is allowed to make copies of the software to protect himself from loss in the event of the original distribution media being damaged.
# Making copies of software in order to repair or maintain machines, provided that the copies used in repairing the machine is destroyed after the repair or maintenance is complete.

The law allows any copies that are created for the above purposes to be transferred when the software is sold, only along with the copy made to prepare them. Adaptations made can not be transferred without permission from the copyright holder.

== Reverse engineering ==

While it is not part of section 117, it is also lawful to [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] software for compatibility purposes. Sec. 103(f) of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201- 17 U.S.C. § 1201 (f)]) says that a person who is in legal possession of a program, is permitted to reverse-engineer and circumvent its protection against copying if this is necessary in order to achieve "interoperability" - a term broadly covering other devices and programs being able to interact with it, make use of it, and to use and transfer data to and from it, in useful ways. A limited exemption exists that allows the knowledge thus gained to be shared and used for interoperability purposes.

More generally, it has been held that reverse engineering is a fair use.&lt;ref&gt;The Federal Circuit so held in ''[[Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc.]]'' (interoperability case).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Sega v. Accolade]]'', the Ninth Circuit held that making copies in the course of [[reverse engineering]] is a fair use, when it is the only way to get access to the "ideas and functional elements" in the copyrighted code, and when "there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access."&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp.]]'' (reverse engineering to make emulator).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Link Electronics Ltd'''. was a major UK industrial and [[Terrestrial television|broadcast television]] equipment manufacturer and systems integrator in the 1970s and 1980s. The company was founded by John Tanner and David Mann, who began manufacturing television cameras in 1966.&lt;ref name=“InvestorsChronicle”&gt;{{cite book|title=Investors Chronicle &amp; Financial World|page=575|year=1981|publisher=Throgmorton Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Link was mainly known for its range of broadcast television cameras, but was also a manufacturer of outside broadcast (OB) vehicles, including the famous [[BBC]] "Type 5". Link also produced a wide range of ancillary studio equipment, such as [[distribution amplifiers]], measuring sets and test signal generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amcro.co.uk/link/ |title=LINK Electronics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=amcro |publisher= |access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cameras==

Link started as an industrial camera manufacturer but soon moved into broadcast equipment when the BBC approached it to develop a successor to the commercially successful [[EMI 2001]], when EMI's own design for the 2001's successor, the 2005, failed to meet expected standards when launched around 1975. The poor performance of this camera considering its development cost led to EMI exiting the broadcast camera industry. A similar fate befell Link around 10–15 years later upon the release of the Link 130 (further down this page).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golden-agetv.co.uk/equipment.php?ProducerID=25 |vauthors = Howett D, Marshall P|title=Equipment produced by LINK|date= |website=Golden Age Television Recreations |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type 109 ===

The Type 109 was a broadcast quality black and white camera mainly used as a caption scanner or simple tele-cine.&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvcameramuseum.org/link/link_thumbnails.html |title=Link Electronics Camera Thumbnails |last=Summers |first=Brian |date= |website= |publisher=Museum of Broadcast television Camera |access-date=August 4, 2017 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type 100 ===
The Link-NEC 100 was the companion camera to the Type 130 and designed in conjunction with NEC.  It had a triax interface unit and could be used stand alone, via a radio link or with a CCU via triax cable. it shared a common architecture with the 130 by using the same 18mm tubes and both where fully automatic for set-up and used the same CCU (Camera Control Unit), OCP (operational Control Unit) and MSU (Master Setup Unit)  &lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;

=== Type 110/111 ===
The 110 was Link's first attempt at a colour broadcast camera and around 200 cameras were manufactured. Styling was based on the famous [[EMI 2001]] colour camera but at an economical price, including what some claim to be a very flimsy casing that was not of rugged design.
The camera consisted of a closed body and an internal lens from a range of manufacturers, like the [[EMI 2001]], leading to similar claims that the design was "boxy". The camera was capable of both studio and outside broadcast use and at the BBC found its way into TC6, TC8 and several presentation studios at [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]], BBC Lime Grove, BBC Bristol, the [[Open University]] studio in Milton Keynes, BBC Wood Norton Training Centre and onto several BBC outside broadcast vehicles. ITV company [[Thames Television]] also used them at their Euston road studios from around 1979, replacing their Marconi MkVIIs (with RCA TK-47s at Teddington a few years later replacing the EMI 2001s there).
The 110 was seen as a good, cheap, modern option which was lightweight and easier to carry compared to the much older and heavier [[EMI 2001]] camera.&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;

=== Type 120 ===
The Link 120 was a portable camera system that consisted of the camera head and a portable electronics box that then connected to the CCU via standard TV36 multicore cable. The Type 120 was intended to be able to 'clip' into a studio frame to allow easy conversion from either a handheld camera on location or to a large lens camera at sports events in studio. An advert in the Guild of Television Cameramen magazine ZERB notes that there are three options. the Type 121 shoulder mount (with long 3 inch viewfinder) Type 122 with 3 inch viewfinder, Type 123 in sports camera body and 5 inch viewfinder and the Type 124 with full studio lens and 7 inch viewfinder. The Link 125 camera was the next step to purpose designed studio camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gtc.org.uk/publications/zerb.aspx |title=Zerb |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=The Guild of Television Camera Professionals |publisher=GTC |access-date=|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type 125===
The Link 125 camera was purchased in quantity by the BBC and deployed to most of the studios at Television Centre, Pebble Mill in Birmingham and Belfast as well as several other BBC studios. It was also the camera of choice at Limehouse Television. In addition, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] company [[Television South]] (TVS) used the model in its [[Maidstone]] studios, which were still in use by those studios when they were sold off as an independent studio facility following the loss of TVS's franchise at the end of 1992.
The 125 was a well thought out and well-built studio and OB camera developed from the Link 120 portable camera system. It also contained a comprehensive communications system and used a camera control unit (CCU) based around the 110's but updated with auto black, white, iris and centering functions.
The BBC preferred to use a mid range Schneider-Kreuznach lens as it gave good zoom angles. Some believed it produced one of the best images for a pickup tube camera, others believed it could never match the quality of the [[EMI 2001]]. Many BBC users felt that the image was soft and not easy to focus, it also produced an unusual image effect that formed the shape of a 'teardrop'&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pebblemill.org/blog/link-125-cameras/ |title=Link 125 cameras |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Pebble Mill studios |publisher=Birmingham City University |access-date=August 4, 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;
The Link 125 was the most successful of all of Links cameras and the last studio to use them was BBC Pebble Mill which decommissioned the last four in 1994 from the news studio having upgraded to Sony BVP-375's and Ikegami HL-55's a few years before. These cameras have become collectable vintage items. &lt;ref name=“OnTheAir”&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vintageradio.co.uk/htm/TVcollection.htm |title=Cameras |last=Harris |first=Steve |date= |website=On The Air |publisher= |access-date= August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type 130===
The 130 was designed in the mid 1980s as a high tech modern camera  with aspirations of quality and high tech design through the use of microprocessors for full auto setup. Unfortunately it soon became apparent that there were several hardware and/or software errors made during the design and manufacture of this model, which seriously affected the manufacturer's reputation with its broadcast customer base, much in the same way the 2005 had done for EMI around 15 years before.
This was compounded by competition from high quality camera systems from Japanese manufacturers including Sony, Ikegami and Hitachi and by the Dutch manufacturer [[Philips]].  Also at this time [[RCA]] had started to use [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] in its cameras which produced what was considered a superior picture to the then prevailing technology of camera pickup tubes, which necessitated not so many regular adjustments in their setup procedures.

In the mid-1980s the BBC was designing the Type 6 Scanner and had chosen the Link 100 and 130 and had several camera channels for testing. Prototypes had been sent to Israel, Sweden and Australia. The BBC Link 130 cameras were initially installed in Elstree Studio A along with some NEC MNC-100 lightweight cameras. Sadly, they proved to be very unreliable.  They had been around for a few years in development and the idea was to use studio A and BBC Glasgow as test beds to try to make them work.  (John Wardle (Head of BBC Engineering) stated that 42 130s were ordered but only 11 delivered - BBC Glasgow was the studio to receive the first batch, much to the frustration of those who used them.)

Unfortunately as the camera suffered from poor design and many software bugs (that would leave the camera's automatic lineup software switched on and the cue light happening to cause picture interference), the BBC engineering department felt that these faults wouldn't be fixed quickly and opted for [[Thomson Broadcast|Thomson]] Cameras. As a result, this act allegedly caused the final collapse of Link, which was declared bankrupt. UEI Group then briefly purchased the Company, after investing many hundreds of thousands of pounds in the development of the camera only for the poor design not being rectified in the design or prototype stages giving Link a poor reputation after several technically and commercially successful models. The company then transferred to the ownership of Quantel.

There are several units in private collections and until the early 2000s several casings were to be seen at the [[National Science and Media Museum]] in Bradford as part of a public display.&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/23471228/bbc-cameras-be-supplied-by-link-electronics |title=BBC Cameras to be supplied by Link Electronics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=June 1985 |website=Ebsco Host |publisher= |access-date=August 4, 2017 |subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Broadcast Vehicles==
PYE TVT had supplied the BBC with its television OB vehicles from the mid 1960s until the early 1980s. When the Type 5 was being designed Link offered a design that provided a full facility unit with up to eight cameras (although BBC OBs chose the Philips LDK-5, not a Link camera) at least 20 were supplied to the BBC and five to ITV and foreign customers. One Type 5 (London 6) was donated to the Science Museum.&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvobhistory.co.uk/bbc-cmcrs---colour.html |title=TV Outside Broadcast History|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=TV Outside Broadcast History |access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantel-Link==
Following its bankruptcy, UK digital broadcast equipment manufacture [[Quantel]], famous for the Paintbox graphics system, acquired the company and used it to develop a facilities integration and design company known as Quantel-Link. This company continued to design and manufacture outside broadcast vehicles to many national broadcasters including YTE in Finland as well as companies in France, Germany and other European broadcasters.

'''Locks-and-keys''' is a solution to [[dangling pointer]]s in computer [[programming language]]s.

The locks-and-keys approach represents pointers as ordered pairs (key, address) where the key is an integer value. Heap-dynamic variables are represented as the storage for the variable plus a cell for an integer lock value. When a variable is allocated, a ''lock value'' is created and placed both into the variable's cell and into the pointer's key cell. Every access to the pointer compares these two values, and access is allowed only if the values match.

When a variable is deallocated, the key of its pointer is modified to hold a value different from the variable's cell. From then on, any attempt to dereference the pointer can be flagged as an error. Since copying a pointer also copies its cell value, changing the key of the ordered pair safely disables all copies of the pointer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sebesta|first1=Robert|title=Concepts of Programming Languages|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0-13-139531-9|page=298|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanochannel glass materials are [[complex glass]] structures containing large numbers of parallel hollow channels. In its simplest form, the hollow channels are arranged in geometric arrays with packing densities as great as 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; channels/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Channel dimensions are controllable from micrometers to tens of nanometers, while retaining excellent channel uniformity. Exact replicas of the channel glass can be made from a variety of materials. This is a low cost method for creating identical structures with nanoscale features in large numbers.&lt;ref name=nrl-ncm/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tonuccia/&gt;

==Characteristics==
These materials have high density of uniform channels with diameters from 15 micrometres to 15 nanometers. These are rigid structures with serviceable temperatures to at least 300&amp;nbsp;°C, with potential up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Furthermore, these are optically transparent photonic structures with high degree of reproducibility.

==Applications==
These can be used as a material for [[chromatography|chromatographic columns]], unidirectional [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s, [[Microchannel plate detector|Microchannel plate]] and [[nonlinear optical devices]]. Other uses are as masks for [[semiconductor]] development, including ion implantation, optical lithography, and [[reactive ion etching]].&lt;ref name=nrl-ncm&gt;

As a decoupled system, OU Campus works with any server-side technology (e.g., [[PHP]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], [[ColdFusion]]) and for templates uses [[XHTML]]/[[HTML5]] and [[CSS]], as well as [[XML]]/[[XSL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merker|first=Lance|title=Learning to Leverage XML for Higher Ed Web CMS | url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/learning-to-leverage-xml-for-higher-ed-web-cms-001438.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schaffhauser|first=Dian|title=9 Best Practices for Implementing a CMS | url=http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2007/09/9-Best-Practices-for-Implementing-a-CMS.aspx?Page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The templates are customizable so that developers can create sites using popular web development techniques including [[Responsive web design]] to adapt to all screen sizes and devices.  OU Campus does not store page content in a [[database]]; rather, each page is stored as an XML file on the CMS server. It is compatible with [[Internet Explorer]], [[Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]], and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]. OU Campus' push technology architecture requires a separate database for some applications that use interactive content such as forms and surveys. These applications can be handled through the Live Delivery Platform (LDP), which provides a server-side module for plug-in application architecture. LDP is accessed and managed through OU Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spick|first=Geoff|title=Digital Asset Management Takes Front Seat for Higher Education Web CMS|url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/digital-asset-management-takes-front-seat-for-higher-education-web-cms-009046.php|publisher=CMS Wire|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenStax CNX''', formerly called '''Connexions''',&lt;ref name=Woodward-new_name /&gt; is a global repository of educational content provided by volunteers. The open source platform is provided and maintained by [[OpenStax College|OpenStax]], which is based at [[Rice University]].  The collection is available free of charge, can be remixed and edited, and is available for download in various digital formats.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/01/22/EDRTUJ346.DTL |title=Bringing open resources to textbooks and teaching |date= 22 January 2008 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |first1=Jimmy |last1=Wales |first2=Rich |last2=Baraniuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded as Connexions in 1999 by [[Richard Baraniuk]], OpenStax CNX is based on the philosophy that scholarly and educational content can and should be shared, re-used and recombined, interconnected and continually enriched. As such, it was one of the first [[Open educational resources|Open Educational Resources]] (OER) initiatives along with projects such as [[MIT OpenCourseWare]] and the [[Public Library of Science]]. The materials in Connexions are available under a [[CC-BY|CC BY]] [[Creative Commons]] license, which means that content can be used, adapted, and remixed, as long as attribution is provided.&lt;ref name="Kelty2008"&gt;Kelty, C. M. (2008). Two bits. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject matter==
OpenStax CNX contains educational materials at all levels—from children to college students to professionals—organized in small modules (pages) that can be connected into larger collections (books). Material is authored by people from all walks of life. Much content is created by university professors{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, but the collection also contains very popular music content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnx.org/content/col10218/latest/ |title=The Basic Elements of Music |accessdate=30 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; created by a part-time music teacher.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news |work=CNN.com |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/11/08/connexions.learning/ |title=Throw away your school books: here comes textbook 2.0 |date= 8 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenStax CNX material is translated into many languages, aided by the open-content licensing.

==Copyright==
To ensure the legal reusability of content, OpenStax CNX requires authors to license materials they publish under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution License&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/technology/15link.html?_r=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1 |title=Don’t Buy That Textbook, Download It Free |date= 14 September 2008 |first=Noam |last=Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt; (presently, version 4.0).  Under this license, the author retains the right to be credited (attributed) wherever the content is reused.  The author grants others the right to copy, distribute, and display the work, and to derive works based on it, as long as the author is credited.

==Features of OpenStax CNX==

*OpenStax CNX has content from all over the world in a growing variety of languages, not just materials from one specific school or university. It also collects materials to support education in K-12, community college, university, continuing education, and industrial training settings.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"/&gt;
*OpenStax CNX is globally accessible to anyone to not only read and use the materials, but also take them, customize them, and contribute them back to the repository or not.
*OpenStax CNX is a grassroots organized from the bottom up rather than from the top down like many other open education projects. Everyone is free to join and take on a leadership role.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt;

==Technical details==
Three key factors enable the collaborative environment in OpenStax CNX:
*Copyright licenses that preserve attribution but permit sharing: [[Creative Commons]] "attribution" licenses&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;
*Semantic markup of documents using [[XML]] (extensible markup language) so they can be searched for and combined. The markup language used is called “CNXML”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnx.org/help/authoring/xml#cnxml |title=CNXML – Connexions Markup Language |accessdate=July 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Workspaces that facilitate collaboration by providing shared space, the ability to version materials and derive content from existing modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Rhaptos Software Homepage |url=http://rhaptos.org |title=Open-source software developed and used by Connexions |accessdate=July 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724153058/http://rhaptos.org/ |archivedate=July 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Connexions project was started in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cnx.org/about|title = OpenStax CNX: About Us|date = |accessdate = 27 November 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially supported by individuals and [[Rice University]]. That support has been substantially supplemented by grants from the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease |publisher=Rice University Press Release |url=http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=11006 |title=Connexions wins $2M from Hewlett Foundation |date=15 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820090348/http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=11006 |archivedate=20 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

466.54 kilometers of the route will be located in Gilgit-Baltistan, while 287.66 kilometers will be laid in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, 47.56 kilometers will be in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab province]], and 18.2 kilometers in [[Islamabad Capital Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan to Get $44 Million Fiber Optic Back Haul to Link with China|url=http://propakistani.pk/2015/12/03/pakistan-to-get-44-million-fiber-optic-back-haul-to-link-with-china/|accessdate=19 May 2016|agency=ProPakistani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1492">[[File:Kitchen-Dough-Blender.jpg|thumb|Pastry blender]]
A '''pastry blender''' is a cooking utensil used to mix a hard (solid) [[fat]] into [[flour]] in order to make [[pastries]].&lt;ref name="Good Housekeeping"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/cooking-tools/pie-making-tools-reviews/g270/pie-making-tools-pastry-blenders/?slide=1|title=Pastry Blenders|first=Sharon|last=Franke|work=Best-Tested Pie-Making Tools|publisher=Good Housekeeping|accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool is usually made of narrow metal strips or wires attached to a handle, and is used by pressing down on the items to be mixed (known as "cutting in"). It is also used to break these fats (shortening, butter, lard) into smaller pieces. The blending of fat into flour at this stage impacts the amount of water that will be needed to bind the pastry into a dough.

==Alternatives==
There are several alternatives to using a pastry blender. One is to work the fat into the flour with the fingertips, though this requires having a good "touch" and knowing just how lightly to work the fat into the flour without melting it.&lt;ref name="Good Housekeeping"/&gt;  Another is to use two table knives like a pair of [[scissors]], one knife in each hand.  A third is to use a [[food processor]].&lt;ref name="Good Housekeeping"/&gt;

'''Pervious concrete''' (also called porous concrete, permeable concrete, no fines concrete and porous pavement) is a special type of [[concrete]] with a high [[porosity]] used for concrete [[Concrete slab|flatwork]] applications that allows [[water]] from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and other sources to pass directly through, thereby reducing the [[surface runoff|runoff]] from a site and allowing [[groundwater recharge]].

Pervious concrete is made using large aggregates with little to no fine aggregates. The concrete paste then coats the aggregates and allows water to pass through the concrete slab. Pervious concrete is traditionally used in [[parking lot|parking areas]], areas with light traffic, residential [[street]]s, pedestrian [[sidewalk|walkways]], and [[greenhouse]]s.&lt;ref name=ACIReport&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Pervious Concrete|url=http://www.concrete.org/BookstoreNet/ProductDetail.aspx?itemid=52210|publisher=American Concrete Institute|year=2010|isbn=9780870313646}} Report No. 522R-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=srmconcrete&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervious Ready Mix Concrete|url=https://srmconcrete.com/ready-mix-concrete/pervious/|website=srmconcrete.com|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an important application for [[sustainable]] [[construction]] and is one of many [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] techniques used by builders to protect [[water quality]].

== History ==
Pervious concrete was first used in the 1800s in Europe as pavement surfacing and load bearing walls.&lt;ref name=FlDot&gt;{{cite web|last=Chopra|first=Manoj|title=Compressive Strength of Pervious Concrete Pavements|url=http://www.dot.state.fl.us/rddesign/dr/Research/SA/FinalReport-3of4-Pervious-Concrete-Strength.pdf|publisher=[[Florida Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cost efficiency was the main motive due to a decreased amount of cement.&lt;ref name=FlDot/&gt; It became popular again in the 1920s for two storey homes in Scotland and England. It became increasingly viable in Europe after WWII due to the scarcity of cement. It did not become as popular in the US until the 1970s.&lt;ref name=FlDot/&gt;
In India it became popular in 2000.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Stormwater management ==
The proper utilization of pervious concrete is a recognized [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practice]] by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for providing [[first flush]] [[water pollution|pollution]] control and [[stormwater]] management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/porouspa.pdf "Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Porous Pavement."] United States Environmental Protection Agency, EPA 832-F-99-023, September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[regulation]]s further limit stormwater runoff, it is becoming more expensive for property owners to develop [[real estate]], due to the size and expense of the necessary [[drainage]] systems. Pervious concrete lowers the sites SCS Curve Number{{technical statement|date=May 2016}} by retaining stormwater on site.  This allows the planner/designer to achieve pre-development stormwater goals for pavement intense projects. Pervious concrete reduces the runoff from paved areas, which reduces the need for separate stormwater [[retention pond]]s and allows the use of smaller capacity [[storm sewer]]s.&lt;ref name=Water&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashley|first=Erin|title=Using Pervious Concrete to Achieve LEED Points|url=http://perviouspavement.org/downloads/LEED_PointsAshley.pdf|publisher=National Ready Mixed Concrete Association|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows property owners to develop a larger area of available property at a lower cost. Pervious concrete also naturally filters storm water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Majersky|first=Gregory|title=Filtration of Polluted Waters by Pervious Concrete|url=http://www.liquidassetdevelopment.com/HygienicWater.pdf|publisher=Liquid Asset Development|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and can reduce [[water pollution|pollutant]] loads entering into [[stream]]s, [[pond]]s and [[river]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervious Concrete|url=http://www.purintonbuilders.com/pervious-concrete.aspx|publisher=Purinton Builders|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pervious concrete functions like a storm water [[infiltration basin]] and allows the storm water to infiltrate the [[soil]] over a large area, thus facilitating recharge of precious groundwater supplies locally.&lt;ref name=Water/&gt; All of these benefits lead to more effective land use. Pervious concrete can also reduce the impact of development on [[tree]]s. A pervious concrete pavement allows the transfer of both water and air to root systems allowing trees to flourish even in highly developed areas.&lt;ref name=Water/&gt;

== Construction ==
Pervious concrete consists of cement, coarse aggregate and water with little to no fine aggregates. The addition of a small amount of sand will increase the strength. The mixture has a water-to-cement ratio of 0.28 to 0.40 with a void content of 15 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=John T. Kevern |author2=Vernon R. Schaefer |author3=Kejin Wang |last-author-amp=yes |year=2011 |title=Mixture Proportion Development and Performance Evaluation of Pervious Concrete for Overlay Applications |journal=Materials Journal |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=439–448 |publisher=American Concrete Institute |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.concrete.org/PUBS/JOURNALS/AbstractDetails.asp?srchtype=ALL&amp;keywords=108-m47&amp;ID=51683117 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130707064453/http://www.concrete.org/PUBS/JOURNALS/AbstractDetails.asp?srchtype=ALL&amp;keywords=108-m47&amp;ID=51683117 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 7, 2013 |accessdate=July 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct quantity of water in the concrete is critical. A low water to cement ratio will increase the strength of the concrete, but too little water may cause surface failure. A proper water content gives the mixture a wet-metallic appearance. As this concrete is sensitive to water content, the mixture should be field checked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Desai|first=Dhawal|title=Pervious Concrete – Effect of Material Proportions on Porosity|url=http://www.engineeringcivil.com/pervious-concrete-effect-of-material-proportions-on-porosity.html|publisher=Civil Engineering Portal|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrained air may be measured by a Rapid Air system, where the concrete is stained black and sections are analyzed under a [[microscope]].&lt;ref name="Entrained Air"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kevern|first=John |author2=K. Wang |author3=V. R. Schaefer|title=A Novel Approach to Characterize Entrained Air Content in Pervious Concrete|journal=ASTM International|year=2008|volume= 5|issue= 2|url=http://k.web.umkc.edu/kevernj/Articles/JAI101434.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common flatwork form has riser strips on top such that the [[screed]] is 3/8-1/2 in. (9 to 12&amp;nbsp;mm) above final pavement elevation. Mechanical screeds are preferable to manual. The riser strips are removed to guide compaction. Immediately after screeding, the concrete is compacted to improve the bond and smooth the surface. Excessive compaction of pervious concrete results in higher compressive strength, but lower porosity (and thus lower permeability).&lt;ref name=Compaction&gt;{{cite web|last=Kevern|first=John|title=Effect of Compaction Energy on Pervious Concrete Properties|url=http://www.rmc-foundation.org/images/PCRC Files/Construction Techniques/Effect of Compaction Energy on Pervious Concrete Properties.pdf|publisher=RMC Research Foundation|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jointing varies little from other concrete slabs. Joints are tooled with a rolling jointing tool prior to curing or saw cut after curing. Curing consists of covering concrete with 6 mil. plastic sheeting within 20 minutes of concrete discharge.&lt;ref name=Operation&gt;{{cite web|last=Kevern|first=John|title=Operation and Maintenance of Pervious Concrete Pavements|url=http://k.web.umkc.edu/kevernj/Articles/TRB%202011-PCPC%20Maintenance-Kevern%20(revised).pdf|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this contributes to a substantial amount of waste sent to landfills. Alternatively, preconditioned absorptive lightweight aggregate as well as internal curing admixture (ICA) have been used to effectively cure pervious concrete without waste generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Internal Curing with HydroMax|url = https://indd.adobe.com/view/a243a57c-3fcc-4820-888c-95a5273088ce?ref=idm|publisher = ProCure|accessdate = 1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevern, J.T. and Farney, C. “[http://procureusa.com/distributors/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Reducing-Curing-for-Pervious-with-SAP.pdf Reducing Curing Requirements for Pervious Concrete Using a Superabsorbent Polymer for Internal Curing.]” Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board (TRB), Construction 2012, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing and inspection ==
Pervious concrete has a common strength of {{convert|600|-|1500|psi|MPa}} though strengths up to {{convert|4000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} can be reached. There is no standardized test for compressive strength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carolinabomanite.com/custimages/PerviousSpecificationACI522108.pdf "Specification for Pervious Concrete."] ACI 522.1-08. American Concrete Institute, Farmington Hills, MI, 7pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance is based on the [[unit weight]] of a sample of poured concrete using [[ASTM]] standard no. C1688.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM International. [http://www.astm.org/Standards/C1688.htm "Standard Test Method for Density and Void Content of Freshly Mixed Pervious Concrete."] Standard No. C1688.&lt;/ref&gt; An acceptable tolerance for the density is plus or minus {{convert|5|lbs}} of the design density.{{clarify|reason=Pound is not a unit of density|date=July 2018}} Slump and air content tests are not applicable to pervious concrete because of the unique composition. The designer of a storm water management plan should ensure that the pervious concrete is functioning properly through visual observation of its drainage characteristics prior to opening of the facility.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Cold climates ==
Concerns over the resistance to the [[freeze-thaw]] cycle have limited the use of pervious concrete in cold weather environments.&lt;ref name="Cold Weather"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Vernon R. Schaefer |author2=Keijin Wang |author3=Muhammad T. Suleiman |author4=John T.

Report No. 2006-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of freezing in most applications is dictated by the local climate. Entrained air may help protect the paste like in normal concrete.&lt;ref name="Entrained Air"/&gt; The addition of a small amount of fine aggregate to the mixture increases the durability of the pervious concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kevern |first=John |author2=K. Wang |author3=V.R. Schaefer |journal=Iowa State University|year=2008}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avoiding saturation during the freeze cycle is the key to the longevity of the concrete.&lt;ref name="Concrete Tech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervious Concrete and Freeze-Thaw|url=http://www.cement.org/tech/Pervious_print.html |work=Concrete Technology E-Newsletter |publisher=PCA |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related, having a well prepared 8 to 24&amp;nbsp;inch (200 to 600&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Grading (engineering)|sub-base]] and drainage will reduce the possibility of freeze-thaw damage.&lt;ref name="Concrete Tech"/&gt;

== Maintenance ==
To prevent reduction in permeability, pervious concrete needs to be cleaned regularly. Cleaning can be accomplished through wetting the surface of the concrete and vacuum sweeping.&lt;ref name=Operation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevention|url=http://www.perviousconcrete.com/maintenance_prevention.htm|publisher=Charger Enterprises|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:So that you dont forget.jpg|thumb|1916 Sign to Employees]]

'''Pocasset Manufacturing Company''' was a cotton textile mill located in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]]. It was located just west of Main Street across the second falls of the [[Quequechan River]]. It was organized on August 15, 1821, with $100,000 in capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uauYBOCKCS0C&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=%22Watuppa+Mill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xqPRTNuWGoiq8AbSwYmGDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Watuppa%20Mill%22&amp;f=false History of Bristol County, Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt; The mill began operation in 1822, with Samuel Rodman of [[New Bedford]] as the principal owner. [[Oliver Chace]], served as the mill's agent until 1837. [[Nathaniel B. Borden|Nathaniel Briggs Borden]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000636 BORDEN, Nathaniel Briggs - Biographical Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was named clerk and treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uauYBOCKCS0C&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=%22Watuppa+Mill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xqPRTNuWGoiq8AbSwYmGDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Watuppa%20Mill%22&amp;f=false History of Bristol County, Massachusetts pg 371]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailsinc.org/durfee/phillips2-13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pocasset Mills were the site of the origin of the [[Great Fall River Fire of 1928]]. The mills were destroyed along with a vast portion of the city's business district.

==History==
In the company's early years, it primarily constructed mills for their various tenants. The first development scheme was intended to enlarge the grist mill, but with [[Oliver Chace]], the grist mill was razed for the erection of a new mill for the production of textiles. The old [[fulling mill]] remained. Referred to as the "Bridge Mill", the new mill was constructed from stone with three stories, and measured 100 feet long by 40 feet wide, with a large ell. It was located west of Main Street, immediately north of the Fall River stream.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dsgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=pocasset%20manufacturing%20company%20bridge%20mill&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A centennial history of Fall River, Mass., Atlantic Pub. and Engraving Co., 1877]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821, the machinery firm of Harris, Hawes &amp; Company occupied two floors of a building put up for their use by the Pocasset Company. The basement was still used as a grist mill and they also built a water-wheel to raise the water to a convenient level for laundry. The "Bridge Mill" and the fulling mill were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1843. The company built the original Granite Block here a few years after the fire. It became the center of business activity in Fall River for many years.

In 1825, the stone Satinet Mill was erected. It was partly occupied by the first calico printing business in Fall River, set up by Andrew Robeson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IWIoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=%22satinet+mill%22+%22fall+river%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=trTRTMSrOoGB8gaK58TpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22satinet%20mill%22%20%22fall%20river%22&amp;f=false The Story of Textile pg 228]&lt;/ref&gt; The south half was occupied by John and Jesse Eddy for the manufacture of [[satinet]]s. It was made 3-5 story building made of [[Fall River granite]]. It was demolished in 1846 for construction of the new Pocasset Mill #1.

West of the printing mill, the Quequechan Mill was built in 1826. It was called the "New Pocasset" and was leased for a yarn mill. Considered an extremely large mill for its time, it was a five story stone building that was 319&amp;nbsp;ft long and 48 feet wide. It contained 16,392 spindles and 492 looms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dsgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Quequechan+Mill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qbvRTNLeNcP78Abz86zDDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Quequechan%20Mill%22&amp;f=false A centennial history of Fall River, Mass pg 119]&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the Quequechan Mill that Holder Borden set up the cloth printing business that would later become the [[American Print Works]]. This mill was demolished about 1880 for expansion of Pocasset Mills #2 and #3.

Also in 1825, the Watuppa Reservoir Company, was incorporated under a special statute by the Massachusetts and Rhode Island state legislature. It was authorized to make reservations of water in the ponds by erecting a dam to raise the water by two feet. [[Nathaniel Briggs Borden]] as a member of this private entity, enabled Pocasset Manufacturing to take advantage of the increase in the  river flow speed to allow them to build more mills for lease. Previously use of land and waterfalls were controlled by [[Troy Cotton &amp; Woolen Manufactory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uauYBOCKCS0C&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=%22Watuppa+Mill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xqPRTNuWGoiq8AbSwYmGDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Watuppa%20Mill%22&amp;f=false History of Bristol County, Massachusetts pg 370].&lt;/ref&gt; The Watuppa Reservoir Company built a dam below the Troy Company dam.

In 1826 the Pocasset constructed still another stone building which was known as the Massasoit Mill and later called the Watuppa Mill. This mill had 9,000 spindles, 224 looms &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XzUWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=%22Pocasset+Manufacturing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QZbRTOz9E4Sq8AbMhanwDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ# Bureau of Statistics of Labor, Massachusetts - 1895]&lt;/ref&gt; This mill was later operated as Pocasset Mill #4. It was destroyed by fire along with the main plant in February 1928.

In 1847, the Pocasset Mill #1 commenced running. Built on the site of the Satinet Mill, it was a five story stone building that was 208&amp;nbsp;ft long and 75 feet wide. It was the first of the so-called "wide" mills and contained 20,352 spindles and 422 looms. The machinery was run by three turbine wheels, which were later supplemented by a Corliss engine fed by a steam plant with eighteen condensers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XzUWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=%22Pocasset+Manufacturing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QZbRTOz9E4Sq8AbMhanwDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ# Bureau of Statistics of Labor, Massachusetts - 1895]&lt;/ref&gt; The building had its own fire apparatus including pumps and sprinklers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dsgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Quequechan+Mill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qbvRTNLeNcP78Abz86zDDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Quequechan%20Mill%22&amp;f=false  A centennial history of Fall River, Mass pg 120]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pocasset Mill made sheetings and shirtings.

By 1877, the company employed 550 and owned fifty four tenements.  The number of stockholders increased to twenty one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dsgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Quequechan+Mill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qbvRTNLeNcP78Abz86zDDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Quequechan%20Mill%22&amp;f=false  A centennial history of Fall River, Mass pg 120]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, a complete electric light plant was installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=%22Pocasset+Manufacturing%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;q=%22Pocasset+Manufacturing%22+plant&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=5b966da856c0d166 Labor and industrial chronology of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Volume 1899 - Page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 the Pocasset replaced 16,000 [[Spinning mule|mule spinners]] with 13,000 frame spindles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dBDOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA91&amp;dq=%22Pocasset+Manufacturing%22+plant&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MZjRTMXYJoT78AaDuc27DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pocasset%20Manufacturing%22%20&amp;f=false Textile world record: Volume 28 - Page 91]&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the company also acquired the mill of the [[Fall River Manufacturing Company]], operating it as Mill #5.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4xYoAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=pocasset%20manufacturing%20fall%20river%201905&amp;pg=PA506#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Annual report of the Bureau of Statistics of Labor, Wright &amp; Potter Printing Co., State Printers, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917, the Poccaset Manufacturing Company was capitalized at $1,200,000 and had a capacity of 123,000 spindles and 2,874 looms. It produced sateens, twills and plain cloths.&lt;ref&gt;1917 Textile Directory&lt;/ref&gt;

The mills operated until 1926, and were destroyed by fire in 1928 during dismantling.&lt;ref&gt;The Philips History of Fall River, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; The site was later occupied by a bus terminal and parking lot until the early 1960s, when the property was taken by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for construction of Interstate 195. A portion of the property of the Pocasset Manufacturing Company is now occupied by the Fall River Chamber of Commerce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6725">In [[semiconductor]] manufacturing, a '''process corner''' is an example of a [[Design of experiments|design-of-experiments (DoE)]] technique that refers to a variation of fabrication parameters used in applying an [[integrated circuit]] design to a semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]].  Process corners represent the extremes of these parameter variations within which a circuit that has been etched onto the wafer must function correctly.  A circuit running on devices fabricated at these process corners may run slower or faster than specified and at lower or higher temperatures and voltages, but if the circuit does not function at all at any of these process extremes the design is considered to have inadequate design margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weste, Neil H.E.  |author2=Harris, David |lastauthoramp=yes | title = CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective, 3rd Ed., | year = 2005 |publisher = Addison-Wesley, pp.231-235 | isbn = 0-321-14901-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to verify the robustness of an integrated circuit design, semiconductor manufacturers will fabricate '''corner lots''', which are groups of wafers that have had process parameters adjusted according to these extremes, and will then test the devices made from these special wafers at varying increments of environmental conditions, such as voltage, clock frequency, and temperature, applied in combination (two or sometimes all three together) in a process called '''characterization'''.  The results of these tests are plotted using a graphing technique known as a [[shmoo plot]] that indicates clearly the boundary limit beyond which a device begins to fail for a given combination of these environmental conditions.

Corner-lot analysis is most effective in digital electronics because of the direct effect of process variations on the speed of transistor switching during transitions from one logic state to another, which is not relevant for analog circuits, such as amplifiers.

==Significance to digital electronics==
In [[Very-large-scale integration|Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI)]] [[integrated circuit]] [[microprocessor]] design and [[semiconductor fabrication]], a process corner represents a three or six [[standard deviation|sigma variation]] from [[nominal (value)|nominal]] [[dopant|doping]] concentrations (and other parameters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=174301075|title=Variability upends designers' plans|last=Goering|first=Richard|date=2005-11-21|publisher=EETimes.com|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in transistors on a [[silicon wafer]]. This variation can cause significant changes in the [[duty cycle]] and [[slew rate]] of [[digital logic|digital]] signals, and can sometimes result in [[catastrophic failure]] of the entire system.

Variation may occur for many reasons, such as minor changes in the humidity or temperature changes in the [[clean-room]] when wafers are transported, or due to the position of the [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] relative to the center of the wafer.

==Types of corners==
When working in the schematic domain, we usually only work with [[front end of line]] (FEOL) process corners as these corners will affect the performance of devices. But there is an orthogonal set of process parameters that affect [[back end of line]] (BEOL) parasitics.

=== FEOL corners ===
One naming convention for process corners is to use two-letter designators, where the first letter refers to the N-channel [[MOSFET]] (NMOS) corner, and the second letter refers to the P channel (PMOS) corner. In this naming convention, three corners exist: '''typical''', '''fast''' and '''slow'''. '''Fast''' and '''slow''' corners exhibit [[carrier mobility|carrier mobilities]] that are higher and lower than normal, respectively. For example, a corner designated as '''FS''' denotes fast NFETs and slow PFETs.

There are therefore five possible corners: typical-typical (TT) (not really a corner of an n vs. p mobility graph, but called a corner, anyway), fast-fast (FF), slow-slow (SS), fast-slow (FS), and slow-fast (SF). The first three corners (TT, FF, SS) are called even corners, because both types of devices are affected evenly, and generally do not adversely affect the logical correctness of the circuit. The resulting devices can function at slower or faster clock frequencies, and are often [[product binning|binned]] as such. The last two corners (FS, SF) are called "skewed" corners, and are cause for concern. This is because one type of FET will switch much faster than the other, and this form of imbalanced switching can cause one edge of the output to have much less slew than the other edge. [[Latch (electronics)|Latching]] devices may then record incorrect values in the logic chain.

=== BEOL corners &lt;ref&gt;http://abelite-da.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/C8.png&lt;/ref&gt; ===
In addition to the [[FET]]s themselves, there are more on-chip variation (OCV) effects that manifest themselves at smaller technology nodes. These include process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variation effects on on-chip interconnect, as well as via structures.

Extraction tools often have a '''nominal''' corner to reflect the nominal cross section of the process target. Then the corners '''cbest''' and '''cworst''' were created to model the smallest and largest cross sections that are in the allowed process variation. A simple thought experiment shows that the smallest cross section with the largest vertical spacing will produce the smallest coupling capacitance. CMOS Digital circuits were more sensitive to capacitance than resistance so this variation was initially acceptable. As processes evolved and resistance of wiring became more critical, the additional '''rcbest''' and '''rcworst''' were created to model the minimum and maximum cross sectional areas for resistance. But the one change is that cross sectional resistance is not dependent on oxide thickness (vertical spacing between wires) so for '''rcbest''' the largest is used and for '''rcworst''' the smallest is used.

==Accounting for corners==
To combat these variation effects, modern [[90nm|technology processes]] often supply [[SPICE]] or [[BSIM]] [[simulation]] models for all (or, at the least, TT, FS, and SF) process corners, which enables circuit designers to detect corner [[skew lines|skew]] effects before the design is [[Integrated circuit layout|laid out]], as well as post-layout (through [[circuit extraction|parasitics extraction]]), before it is [[tapeout|taped out]].

A '''proton-exchange membrane''', or '''polymer-electrolyte membrane''' ('''PEM'''), is a [[Ion-exchange membranes|semipermeable membrane]] generally made from [[ionomer]]s and designed to [[proton conductor|conduct protons]] while acting as an electronic insulator and reactant barrier, e.g. to [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] gas.&lt;ref name="NasaTechBriefs"&gt;{{cite techreport | url=http://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/9-ntb/tech-briefs/physical-sciences/1440 | title=Alternative electrochemical systems for ozonation of water | accessdate=17 January 2015 | institution=[[NASA]] | date=20 March 2007 | work=[[NASA Tech Briefs]] | number=MSC-23045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is their essential function when incorporated into a [[membrane electrode assembly]] (MEA) of a [[proton-exchange membrane fuel cell]] or of a [[Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis|proton-exchange membrane electrolyser]]: separation of reactants and transport of protons while blocking a direct electronic pathway through the membrane.

Many use polyaromatic polymers, while others use partially fluorinated polymers.

Proton-exchange membranes are primarily characterized by proton [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] (σ), [[methanol]] permeability (''P''), and thermal stability.&lt;ref name="VTech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mii.vt.edu/SURP/research/fcm.html |title=Research Topics for Materials and Processes for PEM Fuel Cells REU for 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-18 |author=Nakhiah Goulbourne |publisher=[[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227182952/http://www.mii.vt.edu/SURP/research/fcm.html |archivedate=27 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PEM fuel cells use a solid polymer membrane (a thin plastic film) as the electrolyte. This polymer is permeable to protons when it is saturated with water, but it does not conduct electrons.

==Fuel cell==
Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are believed to be the most promising type of fuel cell to act as the vehicular power source replacement for gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines. They are being considered for automobile applications because they typically have a low [[operating temperature]] (~80&amp;nbsp;°C) and a rapid start-up time, including from frozen conditions. PEMFCs operate at 40–60% efficiency and can vary the output to match the demands. First used in the 1960s for the NASA [[Gemini program]], PEMFCs are currently being developed and demonstrated from ~100&amp;nbsp;kW cars to a 59 MW power plant.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

PEMFCs contain advantages over other types of fuel cells such as [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s (SOFC). PEMFCs operate at a lower temperature, are lighter and more compact, which makes them ideal for applications such as cars.
However, some disadvantages are: the ~80&amp;nbsp;°C operating temperature is too low for cogeneration like in SOFCs, and that the electrolyte for PEMFCs must be water-saturated. However, some fuel-cell cars, including the [[Toyota Mirai]], operate without humidifiers, relying on rapid water generation and the high rate of back-diffusion through thin membranes to maintain the hydration of the membrane, as well as the ionomer in the catalyst layers. High-temperature PEMFCs operate between 100&amp;nbsp;°C and 200&amp;nbsp;°C, potentially offering benefits to electrode kinetics and heat management, and better tolerance to fuel impurities, particularly [[carbon monoxide|CO]] in reformate. These improvements potentially could lead to higher overall system efficiencies. However, these gains have yet to be realized, as the gold-standard perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes lose function rapidly at 100&amp;nbsp;°C and above if hydration drops below ~100%, and begin to creep in this temperature range, resulting in localized thinning and overall lower system lifetimes. As a result, new anhydrous proton conductors, such as protic organic ionic plastic crystals (POIPCs) and protic ionic liquids, are actively studied for the development of suitable PEMs.&lt;ref&gt;

The fuel for the PEMFC is hydrogen, and the charge carrier is the hydrogen ion (proton). At the anode, the hydrogen molecule is split into hydrogen ions (protons) and electrons. The hydrogen ions permeate across the electrolyte to the cathode, while the electrons flow through an external circuit and produce electric power. Oxygen, usually in the form of air, is supplied to the cathode and combines with the electrons and the hydrogen ions to produce water. The reactions at the electrodes are as follows:

:Anode reaction:
::2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:Cathode reaction:
::O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:Overall cell reaction:
::2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + heat + electrical energy

The theoretical exothermic potential is +1.23 V overall.

'''Refuse-derived fuel''' ('''RDF''') is a [[Waste-to-energy|fuel produced from various types of waste]] such as [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), [[industrial waste]] or commercial waste.

The World Business Council for Sustainable Development provides a definition:

''“Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a [[cement kiln]], replacing a portion of conventional [[fossil fuels]], like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Sometimes they can only be used after pre-processing to provide ‘tailor-made’ fuels for the cement process“''

RDF consists largely of combustible components of such waste, as non recyclable [[plastic]]s (not including [[PVC]]), [[paper]] cardboard, labels, and other corrugated materials. These fractions are separated by different processing steps, such as screening, air classification, ballistic separation, separation of ferrous and non ferrous materials, glass, stones and other foreign materials and shredding into a uniform grain size, or also pelletized in order to produce a homogeneous material which can be used as substitute for fossil fuels in e.g. cement plants, lime plants, coal fired power plants or as [[reduction agent]] in steel furnaces. RDF can be also further specified into e.g. [[tyre derived fuels]] (TDF) from used tyres, or solid recovered fuels (SRF)

Others describe the properties, such as:
* Secondary fuels
* Substitute fuels
* Solid recovered fuels (SRF)
* “Climafuel®” as trade name from Cemex
* “AF“ as an abbreviation for alternative fuels
* Ultimately most of the designations are only general paraphrases for alternative fuels which are either waste-derived or biomass-derived.

There is no universal exact classification or specification which is used for such materials. Even legislative authorities have not yet established any exact guidelines on the type and composition of alternative fuels. The first approaches towards classification or specification are to be found in the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesgütegemeinschaft für Sekundärbrennstoffe) as well as at European level (European Recovered Fuel Organisation). These approaches which are initiated primarily by the producers of alternative fuels, follow a correct approach: Only through an exactly defined standardisation in the composition of such materials can both production and utilisation be uniform worldwide.

First approaches towards alternative fuel classification:

Solid recovered fuels are part of RDF in the fact that it is produced to reach a standard such as CEN/343 ANAS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cen.eu/CEN/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/Standards.aspx?param=407430&amp;title=CEN/TC+343 CEN/TC 343 - Published standards]&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive review is now available on SRF / RDF production, quality standards and thermal recovery, including statistics on European SRF quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10643380802586980 Velis C. et al. (2010) Production and quality assurance of solid recovered fuels using mechanical—biological treatment (MBT) of waste: a comprehensive assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In the fifties of the last century tyres were used for the first time as refuse derived fuel in the cement industry. Continuous use of various waste-derived alternative fuels then followed in the mid-eighties with “Brennstoff aus Müll“ (BRAM) – fuel from waste – in the Westphalian cement industry in Germany.

At that time the thought of cost reduction through replacement of fossil fuels was the priority as considerable competition pressure weighed down on the industry. Since the eighties the German Cement Works Association (Verein Deutscher Zementwerke e.V. (VDZ, Düsseldorf)) has been documenting the use of alternative fuels in the Federal German cement industry. In 1987 less than 5% of fossil fuels were replaced by refuse derived fuels, in 2015 its use increased to almost 62%.

Refuse derived Fuels are used in a wide range of specialized [[waste to energy]] facilities, which are using processed refuse derived fuels with lower calorific values of 8-14MJ/kg in grain sizes of up to 500&amp;nbsp;mm to produce electricity and thermal energy (heat/steam) for [[district heating]] systems or industrial uses.

==Processing==

Materials such as [[glass]] and metals are removed during the treatment processing since they are non-combustible. The [[metal]] is removed using a [[magnet]] and the glass using [[mechanical screening]]. After that, an [[air knife]] is used to separate the light materials from the heavy ones. The light materials have higher [[calorific value]] and they create the final RDF. The heavy materials will usually continue to a [[landfill]]. The residual material can be sold in its processed form (depending on the process treatment) as a plain mixture or it may be compressed into [[pellet fuel]], bricks or logs and used for other purposes either stand-alone or in a [[recursive recycling]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, P. (1998) Waste Treatment and Disposal. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester&lt;/ref&gt;

RDF is extracted from [[municipal solid waste]] and other waste using a mix of mechanical and/or biological treatment methods.

The production of RDF may involve the following steps:

*Bag splitting/Shredding
*Size screening
*Magnetic separation
*Air classifier (density separation)
*Coarse shredding
*Refining separation by infrared separation

==End markets==

RDF can be used in a variety of ways to produce electricity. It can be used alongside traditional sources of fuel in coal power plants. In Europe RDF can be used in the [[cement kiln]] industry, where the strict standards of the [[Waste Incineration Directive]] are met. RDF can also be fed into [[plasma arc gasification]] modules &amp; [[pyrolysis]] plants. Where the RDF is capable of being combusted cleanly or in compliance with the [[Kyoto Protocol]], RDF can provide a funding source where unused carbon credits are sold on the open market via a carbon exchange.{{clarify | reason=How are carbon credits related to RDF?|date=September 2016}} However, the use of [[municipal waste]] contracts{{clarify | reason=Contracts for/with what/who?|date=September 2016}} and the bankability{{technical statement|date=September 2016}} of these solutions is still a relatively new concept, thus RDF's financial advantage may be debatable. The European market for the production of RDF have been grown fast due to e.g. the European landfill directive, or landfill taxes e.g. in UK and Ireland. Refuse derived fuel (RDF) exports from the UK to Europe and beyond are expected to have reached 3.3 million tonnes in 2015, representing a near-500,000 tonnes increase on the previous year.

==Measurement of the biomass fraction of RDF and SRF==
The [[biomass]] fraction of RDF and SRF has a monetary value under multiple [[greenhouse gas]] protocols, such as the European Union [[Emissions Trading Scheme]] and the [[Renewable Obligation Certificate]] program in the United Kingdom. Biomass is considered to be [[carbon-neutral]] since the {{CO2}} liberated from the combustion of biomass is recycled in plants. The combusted biomass fraction of RDF/SRF is used by stationary combustion operators to reduce their overall reported {{CO2}} emissions.

Several methods have been developed by the European CEN 343 working group to determine the biomass fraction of RDF/SRF. The initial two methods developed (CEN/TS 15440) were the manual sorting method and the selective dissolution method. Since each method suffered from limitations in properly characterizing the biomass fraction, an alternative method was developed using the principles of radiocarbon dating. A technical review (CEN/TR 15591:2007) outlining the [[carbon-14]] method was published in 2007, and a technical standard of the carbon dating method (CEN/TS 15747:2008) was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cen.eu/CENORM/BusinessDomains/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Standards.asp?param=407430&amp;title=CEN/TC+343 European Committee for Standardization, list of published standards]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, there is already an equivalent carbon-14 method under the standard method ASTM D6866.

Although [[carbon-14 dating]] can determine the biomass fraction of RDF/SRF, it cannot determine directly the biomass calorific value. Determining the calorific value is important for green certificate programs such as the Renewable Obligation Certificate program. These programs award certificates based on the energy produced from biomass. Several research papers, including the one commissioned by the Renewable Energy Association in the UK, have been published that demonstrate how the carbon-14 result can be used to calculate the biomass calorific value.

==Regional use==

===Iowa===
The first full-scale [[waste-to-energy]] facility in the US was the Arnold O. Chantland Resource Recovery Plant, built in 1975 located in Ames, Iowa. This plant also produces RDF that is sent to a local power plant for supplemental fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.ames.ia.us/worksweb/resourcerecovery/default.htm Arnold O. Chantland Resource Recovery Plant], www.city.ames.ia.us, Retrieved 29.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester===
The city of [[Manchester]], in the north west of England, is in the process of awarding a contract for the use of RDF which will be produced by proposed [[mechanical biological treatment]] facilities as part of a huge [[Private Finance Initiative|PFI]] contract. The [[Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority]] has recently announced there is significant market interest in initial bids for the use of RDF which is projected to be produced in tonnages up to 900,000 tonnes per annum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsrecycle.com/info/waste_management/news.jsp?story=6274 Healthy interest for Manchester waste-derived fuel contract], [[www.letsrecycle.com]], Accessed 20.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsrecycle.com/info/waste_management/news.jsp?story=6237 Manchester seeks outlets for refuse-derived fuel], [[www.letsrecycle.com]], Accessed 20.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bollnäs===
During spring 2008 Bollnäs Ovanåkers Renhållnings AB (BORAB) in Sweden, started their new [[waste-to-energy]] plant. [[Municipal solid waste]] as well as industrial waste is turned into refuse-derived fuel. The 70,000-80,000 tonnes RDF that is produced per annum is used to power the nearby BFB-plant, which provides the citizens of [[Bollnäs]] with electricity and [[district heating]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iqr.se/en/products/none/stationary/borab.aspx BORAB - Waste-to-energy plant], Accessed 03.03.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioenergitidningen.se/index.php?section=85 Bioenergitidningen - New waste mill in Bollnäs], Accessed 03.15.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel=== 
In late March 2017, Israel launched its own RDF plant at the Hiriya Recycling Park; which daily will intake about 1,500 tonnes of household waste, which will amount to around half a million tonnes of waste each year,with an estimated production of 500 tonnes of RDF daily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Environment/From-garbage-dump-to-energy-resource-485300 Israel Turning Garbage Dump into Energy Resource] - Accessed 03.27.17&lt;/ref&gt; The plant is part of Israel's "diligent effort to improve and advance waste management in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Environment/From-garbage-dump-to-energy-resource-485300 Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Prague powder No 1.jpg|thumb|Bag of Prague powder #1, also known as "curing salt" or "pink salt." It's typically a combination of salt and sodium nitrite, with the pink color added to distinguish it from ordinary salt.]]

'''Salting''' is the [[food preservation|preservation of food]] with dry [[edible salt]].&lt;ref name="uog"&gt;[http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/nchfp/factsheets/food_pres_hist.html "Historical Origins of Food Preservation."] [http://www.uga.edu/nchfp University of Georgia, National Center for Home Food Preservation]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to [[ pickling ]] in general and more specifically to [[brining]] (preparing food with [[brine (food)|brine]], that is, salty water) and is one form of [[curing (food preservation)|curing]]. It is one of the oldest methods of preserving food,&lt;ref name="uog"/&gt; and two historically significant salt-cured foods are [[salted fish]] (usually [[dried and salted cod]] or [[kipper|salted herring]]) and [[salt-cured meat]] (such as [[bacon]]).  Vegetables such as [[runner beans]] and [[cabbage]] are also often preserved in this manner.

Salting is used because most [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] and other potentially pathogenic [[organism]]s cannot survive in a highly salty environment, due to the [[Tonicity|hypertonic]] nature of salt.  Any living cell in such an environment will become dehydrated through [[osmosis]] and die or become temporarily inactivated.

It was discovered in the 19th century that salt mixed with [[Sodium nitrate|nitrates]] ([[saltpeter]]) would color meats red, rather than grey, and consumers at that time then strongly preferred the red-colored meat. The food hence preserved stays healthy and fresh for days avoiding bacterial decay. &lt;ref name="uog"/&gt; 
==Religious customs==
[[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] [[dietary laws]] require the removal of blood from freshly slaughtered meat. Salt and brine are used for the purpose in both traditions, but salting is more common in [[Kashrut|Kosher]] [[Shechita]] (where it is all but required) than in [[Halal]] [[Dhabiha]] (as in most cases, draining alone will suffice).

{{refimprove|date=July 2017}}
'''Silage''' is [[fermentation (food)|fermented]], high-moisture stored [[fodder]] which can be fed to [[cattle]], [[sheep]] and other such [[ruminant]]s ([[cud]]-chewing animals)&lt;ref name=Wood73&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Brian J. B.|title=Microbiology of fermented foods Volume 1&amp;2|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7514-0216-2|pages=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKfpPwm5ceEC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=fodder+fermented+silage#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; or used as a [[biofuel]] feedstock for [[anaerobic digester]]s. It is fermented and stored in a process called ''ensilage'', ''ensiling'' or ''silaging'', and is usually made from [[grass]] crops, including [[maize]], [[sorghum]] or other [[cereal]]s, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type: ''oatlage'' for oats, ''haylage'' for [[alfalfa]]; but see [[#Haylage|below]] for the different British use of the term ''haylage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=George|editor-first1=J. Ronald|title=Extension publications : forage and grain crops|date=1994|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Pub. Co.|location=Dubuque, Iowa|isbn=0840393415|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Feldpausch Farms 005 (Large).jpg|thumb|Silage underneath plastic sheeting is held down by scrap tires. Concrete beneath the silage prevents fermented juice from leaching out]][[Image:Winterstettenstadt - Stallrinder bei Fütterung 02.jpg|thumb|right|Cattle eating silage]]
Silage is made by one or more of the following methods: placing cut green vegetation in a [[silo]] or pit; piling the vegetation in a large heap and compressing it down so as to purge as much oxygen as possible, then covering it with a plastic sheet; or by wrapping large round bales tightly in plastic film.

== Production ==
[[Image:MB TRAC rolling silage.jpg|thumb|[[MB Trac]] rolling a silage heap or "clamp" in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]]]]
{{multiple image | direction = vertical | image1 = Making silage at Lowsteads Farm (6) - geograph.org.uk - 1380908.jpg | alt1 = A cylindrical bale of mown grass in a field | caption1 = Partially dried mown grass is formed into cylindrical bales in the field (above) and sealed in polywrap (below).| image2 = Wrapped bales 3232.jpg | alt2 = A stack of plastic-wrapped silage bales | caption2 =}}
The crops most often used for ensilage are the ordinary grasses, [[clover]]s, [[alfalfa]], [[vetch]]es, [[oats]], [[rye]] and [[maize]]. Many crops have ensilaging potential, including [[potato]]es and various [[weed]]s, notably [[spurrey]] such as ''[[Spergula arvensis]]''. Silage must be made from plant material with a suitable moisture content: about 50% to 60% depending on the means of storage, the degree of compression, and the amount of water that will be lost in storage, but not exceeding 75%. Weather during harvest need not be as fair and dry as when harvesting for drying. For corn, harvest begins when the whole-plant moisture is at a suitable level, ideally a few days before it is ripe. For pasture-type crops, the grass is mowed and allowed to wilt for a day or so until the moisture content drops to a suitable level. Ideally the crop is mowed when in full [[flower]], and deposited in the silo on the day of its cutting.

After harvesting, crops are shredded to pieces about {{Convert|0.5|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long. The material is spread in uniform layers over the floor of the silo, and closely packed.  When the silo is filled or the stack built, a layer of [[straw]] or some other dry porous substance may be spread over the surface. In the silo the pressure of the material, when [[chaff]]ed, excludes air from all but the top layer; in the case of the stack extra [[pressure]] is applied by weights in order to prevent excessive heating.

=== Equipment ===
[[Forage harvester]]s collect and chop the plant material, and deposit it in trucks or wagons. These forage harvesters can be either [[tractor]]-drawn or self-propelled. Harvesters blow the chaff into the wagon through a chute at the rear or side of the machine. Chaff may also be emptied into a bagger, which puts the silage into a large plastic bag that is laid out on the ground.

In North America, Australia, northwestern Europe, and frequently in New Zealand, silage is placed in large heaps on the ground and rolled by tractor to push out the air, then wrapped in plastic covers held down by reused tires or tire ring walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4entech.com/tire_rings.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815060156/http://4entech.com/tire_rings.php |archivedate=2013-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand and Northern Europe, the silo or "pit" is often a bunker built into the side of a bank, usually made out of concrete or old wooden railroad ties (railway sleepers).  The chopped grass can then be dumped in at the top, to be drawn from the bottom in winter. This requires considerable effort to compress the stack in the silo to cure it properly.  Again, the pit is covered with plastic sheet and weighed down with tire weights.

In an alternative method, the cut vegetation is baled, making ''balage'' (North America) or ''silage bales'' (UK).{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;!-- What is it called in Oz and NZ? --&gt;  The grass or other forage is cut and partly dried until it contains 30–40% moisture (much drier than bulk silage, but too damp to be stored as dry hay).  It is then made into large bales which are wrapped tightly in plastic to exclude air.  The plastic may wrap the whole of each cylindrical or cuboid bale, or be wrapped around only the curved sides of a cylindrical bale, leaving the ends uncovered.  In this case, the bales are placed tightly end to end on the ground, making a long continuous "sausage" of silage, often at the side of a field.  The wrapping may be performed by a [[bale wrapper]], while the baled silage is handled using a bale handler or a [[front-loader]], either impaling the bale on a flap, or by using a special grab. The flaps do not hole the bales.

In the UK, baled silage is most often made in round bales about 4 feet by 4 feet, individually wrapped with four to six layers of "bale wrap plastic" (black, white or green 25-micrometre stretch film). The percentage of dry matter can vary from about 20% dry matter upwards. The continuous "sausage" referred to above is made with a special machine which wraps the bales as they are pushed through a rotating hoop which applies the bale wrap to the outside of the bales (round or square) in a continuous wrap. The machine places the bales on the ground after wrapping by moving forward slowly during the wrapping process.

==Haylage==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Galtür - Heuernte - Heuballen 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Haylage bales in Tyrol]]
Haylage refers to high dry matter silage of around 45% to 75%. Horse haylage is usually 55% to 75% dry matter, made in small bales or larger bales.
Handling of wrapped bales is most often with some type of gripper that squeezes the plastic-covered bale between two metal parts to avoid puncturing the plastic. Simple fixed versions are available for round bales which are made of two shaped pipes or tubes spaced apart to slide under the sides of the bale, but when lifted will not let it slip through. Often used on the tractor rear three-point linkage, they incorporate a trip tipping mechanism which can flip the bales over on to the flat side/end for storage on the thickest plastic layers.

== Fermentation ==
Silage undergoes [[anaerobic fermentation]], which starts about 48 hours after the silo is filled, and converts sugars to acids. Fermentation is essentially complete after about two weeks.

Before anaerobic fermentation starts, there is an aerobic phase in which the trapped [[oxygen]] is consumed. How closely the fodder is packed determines the nature of the resulting silage by regulating the [[chemical reaction]]s that occur in the stack. When closely packed, the supply of oxygen is limited, and the attendant acid [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] brings about decomposition of the [[carbohydrate]]s present into [[acetic acid|acetic]], [[butyric acid|butyric]] and [[lactic acid|lactic]] acids. This product is named sour silage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hay (fodder) |display=Hay |volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, on the other hand, the fodder is unchaffed and loosely packed, or the silo is built gradually, [[oxidation]] proceeds more rapidly and the temperature rises; if the mass is compressed when the temperature is {{convert|140|-|160|F|C}}, the action ceases and sweet silage results. The [[nitrogen]]ous ingredients of the fodder also change: in making sour silage as much as one-third of the [[albuminoid]]s may be converted into [[amino]] and [[ammonium]] compounds; in making sweet silage a smaller proportion is changed, but they become less [[digestion|digestible]]. If the fermentation process is poorly managed, sour silage acquires an unpleasant odour due to excess production of ammonia or butyric acid (the latter is responsible for the smell of rancid butter).

In the past, the fermentation was conducted by indigenous microorganisms, but, today, some bulk silage is inoculated with specific microorganisms to speed fermentation or improve the resulting silage. Silage inoculants contain one or more strains of [[lactic acid bacteria]], and the most common is ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]''. Other bacteria used include ''[[Lactobacillus buchneri]]'', ''[[Enterococcus faecium]]'' and ''[[Pediococcus]]'' species.

Ryegrasses have high sugars and respond to nitrogen fertiliser better than any other grass species. These two qualities have made ryegrass the most popular grass for silage making for the last sixty years. There are three ryegrasses in seed form and commonly used: Italian, Perennial and Hybrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intensive crops for high quality silage from one to five years {{!}} Cotswold Grass Seeds Direct|url=https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/seed-info/intensive-crops-high-quality-silage-one-five-years|website=www.cotswoldseeds.com|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pollution and waste ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
The fermentation process of silo or pit silage releases liquid. Silo effluent is corrosive. It can also contaminate water sources unless collected and treated. The high nutrient content can lead to [[eutrophication]] (hypertrophication), the growth of [[bacteria]]l or [[alga]]l blooms.

Plastic sheeting used for sealing pit or baled silage needs proper disposal, and some areas have recycling schemes for it. Traditionally, farms have burned silage plastics; however odor and smoke concerns have led certain communities to restrict that practice.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Storing silage ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Silage must be firmly packed to minimize the oxygen content, or it will spoil.
Silage goes through four major stages in a silo:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolsen|first=K. K.|last2=Ashbell|first2=G.|last3=Weinberg|first3=Z. G.|date=1996-10-01|title=Silage fermentation and silage additives - Review -|url=https://doi.org/10.5713/ajas.1996.483|journal=Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences|language=English|volume=9|issue=5|pages=483–494|doi=10.5713/ajas.1996.483|issn=1011-2367}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Presealing, which, after the first few days after filling a silo, enables some respiration and some dry matter (DM) loss, but stops
* Fermentation, which occurs over a few weeks; [[pH]] drops; there is more DM loss, but hemicellulose is broken down; aerobic respiration stops
* Infiltration, which enables some oxygen infiltration, allowing for limited microbial respiration; available carbohydrates (CHOs) are lost as heat and gas
* Emptying, which exposes surface, causing additional loss; rate of loss increases.

== Safety ==
Silos are potentially hazardous: deaths may occur in the process of filling and maintaining them, and several safety precautions are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Bolsen and Ruth E. Bolsen. Bunker silo, drive-over pile safety precautions can save lives. Progressive Dairyman. May 15, 2012. http://www.progressivedairy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8791:bunker-silo-drive-over-pile-safety-precautions-can-save-lives&amp;catid=49:management&amp;Itemid=75&lt;/ref&gt; There is a risk of injury by machinery or from falls. When a silo is filled, fine dust particles in the air can become explosive because of their large aggregate surface area. Also, fermentation presents respiratory hazards. The ensiling process produces "silo gas" during the early stages of the fermentation process. Silage gas contains [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which will react with oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the air to form [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is toxic.&lt;ref&gt;http://nasdonline.org/document/901/d000741/watch-out-for-silage-gas.html&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of oxygen inside the silo can cause asphyxiation. Molds that grow when air reaches cured silage can cause [[organic dust toxic syndrome]].  Collapsing silage from large bunker silos has caused deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dairyherd.com/directories.asp?pgID=724&amp;ed_id=243 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117001601/http://dairyherd.com/directories.asp?pgID=724&amp;ed_id=243 |archivedate=2011-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silage itself poses no special danger.

== Nutrition ==
Ensilage can be substituted for [[root crop]]s.  Bulk silage is commonly fed to [[dairy cattle]], while baled silage tends to be used for [[beef cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[horse]]s. The advantages of silage as animal feed are several: 
* During fermentation, the silage bacteria act on the cellulose and carbohydrates in the forage to produce [[volatile fatty acids]] (VFAs), such as [[acetic acid|acetic]], [[propionic acid|propionic]], [[lactic acid|lactic]], and [[butyric acid|butyric]] acids. By lowering [[pH]], these create a hostile environment for competing bacteria that might cause spoilage. The VFAs thus act as natural preservatives, in the same way that the lactic acid in yogurt and cheese increases the preservability of what began as milk, or vinegar (dilute acetic acid) preserves pickled vegetables. This preservative action is particularly important during winter in temperate regions, when green forage is unavailable.
* When silage is prepared under optimal conditions, the modest acidity also has the effect of improving palatability and provides a dietary contrast for the animal. (However, excessive production of acetic and butyric acids can reduce palatability: the mix of bacteria is ideally chosen so as to maximize lactic acid production.&lt;ref&gt;Heiman, Caley. [http://www.progressivedairy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4783:the-silage-puzzle-overcoming-common-challenges&amp;catid=46:feed-and-nutrition&amp;Itemid=72 The silage puzzle: Overcoming common challenges]. The Progressive Dairyman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan-Smith|first1=J. G.|title=An investigation into palatability as a factor responsible for reduced intake of silage by sheep|journal=Animal Production|date=2 September 2010|volume=50|issue=02|pages=253–260|doi=10.1017/S0003356100004700}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Several of the fermenting organisms produce vitamins: for example, lactobacillus species produce [[folic acid]] and [[vitamin B12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=F.|last2=Wegkamp|first2=A.|last3=de Vos|first3=W. M.|last4=Smid|first4=E. J.|last5=Hugenholtz|first5=J.|title=High-Level Folate Production in Fermented Foods by the B12 Producer Lactobacillus reuteri JCM1112|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=14 March 2008|volume=74|issue=10|pages=3291–3294|doi=10.1128/AEM.02719-07|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/74/10/3291.full.pdf.|pmid=18344331|pmc=2394963}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fermentation process that produces VFA also yields energy that the bacteria use: some of the energy is released as heat.  Silage is thus modestly lower in caloric content than the original forage, in the same way that yoghurt has modestly fewer calories than milk. However, this loss of energy is offset by the preservation characteristics and improved digestibility of silage.

== History ==
Using the same technique as the process for making [[sauerkraut]], green fodder was preserved for animals in parts of Germany since the start of the 19th century. This gained the attention of a French agriculturist, Auguste Goffart of [[Sologne]], near [[Orléans]], who published a book in 1877 which described the experiences of preserving green crops in silos.&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Goffart, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k370204d/f4.item.zoom ''Manuel de la culture et de l'ensilage des maïs et autres fourrages verts''] [Manual of the cultivation and siloing of maize and other green fodders] (Paris, France:  G. Masson, 1877).&lt;/ref&gt; Goffart's experience attracted considerable attention. The conditions of [[dairy farm]]ing in the USA suited the ensiling of green [[corn]] fodder, and was soon adopted by [[New England]] farmers. Francis Morris of Maryland prepared the first silage produced in America in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;

Early silos were made of stone or concrete either above or below ground, but it is recognized that air may be sufficiently excluded in a tightly pressed stack, though in this case a few inches of the fodder round the sides is generally useless owing to [[mildew]]. In the U.S. structures were typically constructed of wooden cylinders to 35 or 40&amp;nbsp;ft. in depth.

In the early days of mechanized agriculture, stalks were cut and collected manually using a knife and horsedrawn wagon, and fed into a stationary machine called a "silo filler" that chopped the stalks and blew them up a narrow tube to the top of a [[Silo#Tower silo|tower silo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1609">The '''National Union of Food Industry Workers''' ({{lang-es|Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Industria de Alimentos}}, '''SINALTRAINAL''') is a [[Colombia]]n [[food industry]] [[trade union]].

The group has repeatedly tried to form unions in Colombia for workers of [[Panamco]], a Colombian [[Coca-Cola]] bottling company, and have documentation of many members or leaders being murdered, kidnapped, and tortured by [[right-wing]] [[paramilitary]] groups such as the [[Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia|AUC]]{{Ref|amnesty2003}}{{Ref|amnesty2005}} in order to prevent unionisation. They are a central focus of the ongoing [[Coca-Cola boycott movement]] [http://killercoke.org/] prevalent across college [[campus]]es worldwide (see [[criticism of Coca-Cola]]).

'''Soak testing''' involves testing a system with a typical production load, over a continuous availability period, to validate system behavior under production use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be required to extrapolate the results, if not possible to conduct such an extended test.   For example, if the system is required to process 10,000 transactions over 100 hours, it may be possible to complete processing the same 10,000 transactions in a shorter duration (say 50 hours) as representative (and conservative estimate) of the actual production use.  A good soak test would also include the ability to simulate peak loads as opposed to just average loads. If manipulating the load over specific periods of time is not possible, alternatively (and conservatively) allow the system to run at peak production loads for the duration of the test.

For example, in [[software testing]], a system may behave exactly as expected when tested for one hour. However, when it is tested for three hours, problems such as [[memory leak]]s cause the system to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Soak tests are used primarily to check the reaction of a subject under test under a possible simulated environment for a given duration and for a given threshold.  Observations made during the soak test are used to improve the characteristics of the subject under further tests.

In electronics, soak testing may involve testing a system up to or above its maximum ratings for a long period of time. Some companies may soak test a product for a period of many months, while also applying external stresses such as elevated temperatures.

This falls under [[load testing]].

A '''software architectural style''' is characterized by a set of features that make the software architecture uniquely identifiable. Software architectural styles generally provide a high level direction for solutions unlike software patterns which are focused on solving one or more specific problems. A software architectural style usually consists of one or more [[software pattern]]s.

'''Soundbug''' is a small speaker that can turn a resonant flat surface into a flat panel speaker. The Soundbug is attached to a smooth [[resonant]] surface, this surface then acts as speaker. The tone differs depending on the surface (wood, metal, glass etc.). The Soundbug was developed by [[FeONIC]] Technology (formerly Newlands Scientific), a commercial research and development company specialising in [[magnetostrictive]] audio products as a spin-off from [[Hull University]]. FeONIC used the same technology for Whispering Windows, which is able to resonate shop windows.

Soundbug transmits the audio signal to the flat surface by way of a small piece of [[Terfenol-D]], which is a [[magnetostrictive]] alloy of rare earth metals and iron. This material, when stimulated with an electrical input, causes the Terfenol to expand slightly, resulting in sound output with a very small amplitude. Once attached to a flat surface, Soundbug will translate electric signals into mechanical energy, causing the flat surface to vibrate and broadcast the sound.

* In ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 2]]'', the final episode of the game takes place in a space station called Rhadamanthus, high above the World Tree, a landmark object on the planet on which the game is set. It is revealed through the course of events in the game that the World Tree, initially thought to be a giant tree, is actually a space elevator constructed by the advanced human civilization that came before those of the protagonists. The civilization was destroyed by Klaus' conduit experiment when it created the first Xenoblade Chronicles universe and sent Klaus' left half to that universe, leaving his right half on Earth, as the new God/Architect orbiting the Earth on board the Rhadamanthus on top of the World Tree. It is also implied/revealed that the planet the game takes place on is actually Earth. At the end of the game, the World Tree space elevator along with the Rhadamanthus station orbiting above are destroyed.

[[File:Mine-and-Box.jpg|thumb|left|A controlled mine (at left), with the distribution box that connected it and the other mines in its group to the mine casemate on shore.]][[File:Mine-and-Anchor.jpg|thumb|This WW2-era mine, with its anchor, is on display at [[Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren]] in Boston Harbor.]]
The modern era of defending American harbors with [[controlled mines]] or submarine mines (also called "[[naval mine]]s" and originally referred to as "torpedoes") began in the post-Civil War period, and was a major part of US [[Seacoast defense in the United States|harbor defenses]] from circa 1900 to 1947.

==Brief history==
In 1866, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] established the [[U.S. Army Engineer School|Engineer School of Application]] at [[Fort Totten (Queens)|Willets Point, New York]].  The first commander of this School, Major [[Henry Larcom Abbot]], was almost single-handedly responsible for designing and supervising the program of research and development that defined the strategy and tactics for the mine defense of American harbors. Abbot experimented with underwater explosives, fuzes, cabling, and electrical equipment for over a decade before publishing the first manuals on the use of mines in coast defense in 1876–77.&lt;ref name=Berhow333&gt;Berhow, pp. 333-374&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 the [[Board of Fortifications#Endicott Board|Endicott Board]] made its report on harbor defense, with sweeping recommendations for new minefield and gun defenses. This initiated a vast expansion in the building of modern forts, the installation of new guns, and the preparation of mine defenses at newly created Artillery Districts, designated [[Coast Defense Command]]s in 1913, defending major seaports.&lt;ref name=CACOrg&gt;[http://cdsg.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/FORTS/CACunits/CACorg2011.pdf Smith, Bolling W. and Gaines, William C., Coast Artillery Organization: A brief overview]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mines were planted at 28 harbors during the [[Spanish–American War]], and many lessons were learned.&lt;ref name=ComRep1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUtZAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3780&amp;lpg=PA3780&amp;dq=submarine+mine+kennebec&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4xAi23wWH6&amp;sig=dWoH11emgzCGV43fUkYyNlaVEDM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4r5Hc167JAhUUXWMKHQZJAI8Q6AEIOjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=submarine%20mine%20kennebec&amp;f=false Congressional serial set, 1900, ''Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain'', Vol. 7, pp. 3778–3780, Washington: Government Printing Office]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 the responsibility for underwater mines shifted from the Corps of Engineers to the Artillery Corps, and was a founding responsibility of the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]] in 1907.&lt;ref name=Berhow333/&gt; From about 1900 until 1946 the mine defense program grew, until upwards of 10,000 controlled mines were maintained by the Coast Artillery Corps.&lt;ref name=Berhow333/&gt; In 1904 the first US Army [[Mine planter (U.S. Army)|mine planter]]s were built, small vessels used to emplace and retrieve controlled mines. In July 1918, the [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|U.S. Army Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS) was established to maintain U.S. mine defenses, replacing civilian manning of the mine planters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1943 the buoyant mines were replaced with ground mines, which rested on the seabed. This was due to the deployment of minefields in World War II, which resulted in deep-draft ships fouling the mine cables while passing through deactivated minefields.&lt;ref&gt;Conn, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==General system description==
[[Controlled mines]] were anchored to the bottom of a harbor, either sitting on the bottom itself (ground mines) or floating (buoyant mines) at depths which could vary widely, from about 20 to 250 feet (6–75&amp;nbsp;m). These mines were fired electrically through a vast network of underwater electrical cables at each protected harbor. Mines could be set to explode on contact or be triggered by the operator, based on reports of the position of enemy ships. The networks of cables terminated on shore in massive concrete bunkers called mine [[casemate]]s (see photo, below right), that were usually buried beneath protective coverings of earth.

The mine casemate housed electrical generators, batteries, control panels, and troops that were used to test the readiness of the mines and to fire them when needed.&lt;ref&gt;A manual of the period that explains mine defense (including the details of mine-planting and the electrical systems needed for the mines) is Training Manual TM 2160-20, "Submarine Mining," U.S. War Department, Washington, D.C., October 15, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; The map of Boston Harbor's mine fields (below right) shows the harbor mine defenses consisting of 30 groups of mines, with 19 mines per group. Each mine was normally loaded with {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}} of TNT. So in Boston's case, a total of 57 tons of explosives guarded the harbor.&lt;ref&gt; As was the case with other parts of the U.S. coast defense system (e.g., its thousands of guns), there is no evidence that a mine was ever fired in anger against an attacking enemy, except in the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|Philippines in 1941-42]]. There is a report that a submarine attempted to penetrate the mine fields of Boston Harbor in June 1942, but reportedly withdrew before the mines could be fired or reset to detonate on contact. See Butler, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each protected harbor also maintained a small fleet of [[Mine planter (U.S. Army)|mine planters]] and tenders that were used to plant the mines in precise patterns, haul them back up periodically to check their condition (or to remove them back to the shore for maintenance), and then plant them again.&lt;ref&gt;See TM 2160-20, Note 2, Sections XXIV–XXVI. This manual contains a detailed description of the process of mine planting and describes in great detail how the ships and smaller craft were to be deployed to accomplish this task.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these harbors also had on-shore facilities to store the mines (called "torpedo storehouses") and the TNT used to fill them, rail systems to load and transport the mines (which often weighed over {{convert|750|lb|abbr=on}} each when loaded), and to test and repair the electrical cables. Fire control structures were also built that were used first to observe the mine-planting process and fix location of each mine and second to track attacking ships, reporting when specific mines should be detonated (known as "observed fire"). The preferred method of using the mines was to set them to detonate a set period of time after they had been touched or tipped, avoiding the need for observers to spot each target ship.

==Control==
[[File:Boston-Mines-1945.jpg|thumb|A 1945 map of the mine fields protecting Boston Harbor during World War II. About 570 mines are indicated on this map.]]
[[File:Strong-Casemate.jpg|thumb|The mine casemate at [[Fort Strong]], Long Island, Boston Harbor, once the control point for mines in the southern channels to the harbor.]]
Each mine casemate controlled about 150 to 300 mines (depending on the harbor defended), arranged in groups of 19.&lt;ref&gt;Each distribution box (see drawing at left, above) had twenty connections, allowing for 19 mines and one link to the shore.&lt;/ref&gt; The mines in a group were generally laid about {{convert|100|ft|abbr=on}} apart, in lines running across the channel being protected, with {{convert|50|ft|abbr=on}} or less on either end of the line. This meant that one group of mines could protect a total distance of about {{convert|1900|ft|abbr=on}}. About {{convert|3|mile}} of cable were required to connect one group of 19 mines to its distribution box, with the connecting cables radiating out from the box in a hub-and-spoke fashion. Actually, the distribution box was usually located well behind the line of mines, so the pattern looked more like a 19-armed [[candelabrum]] with the box at its base.&lt;ref name=Berhow333/&gt; If more groups of mines were needed, multiple mine casemates were generally built and equipped. For example, Boston had three mine casemates, with two originally at [[Fort Dawes]] on Deer Island (northern channels) and [[Fort Strong]] on Long Island (southern channels). Later in World War II, Fort Strong's mine casemate was deactivated and control of the southern mines passed to [[Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren]] on Georges Island.

[[File:Mine-Control-Panel.jpg|thumb|left|A mine casemate had a control panel like this for each 19-mine group under its command. The controls were used to test and to fire the mines.]]
[[File:Strong-Mines-S.jpg|thumb|A 1940 plan of the mine casemate at Fort Strong, Long Island, Boston Harbor (same building as photo directly above).]]
The shore cable from the underwater distribution box of each mine group ran back to a cable hut on the shore near the mine casemate, and from there to the casemate itself, where it was connected to a mine control panel (see photo at left, below). These panels were located in the casemate's operating room, pictured at left-center in the plan shown at right. (This is the plan of the Ft. Strong mine casemate, the one shown in the photo directly above it.)

In addition to these firing controls, the mine casemate contained one or more electric generators and a large bank of electric storage batteries. The generators produced direct current, which was used to signal the readiness of the mines. An [[interrupter]] was used to convert a portion of this current to AC which was used to fire the mines; the distinct current supply was a safety feature. The casemate also had a number of telephone lines, keeping it in touch with remotely located mine observation and fire-control positions, with the mine commander, and with the gun batteries and searchlights that covered the mine fields. The casemate also contained switching and diagnostic equipment used to test cable integrity and the functionality of the individual and group mine detonation switches.&lt;ref name=Berhow333/&gt;

For example, as the largest mine casemate in Boston Harbor controlled 15 mine groups (285 mines), it would have mounted 15 of these mine control panels, plus many more related rack-mount devices for controlling the casemate's generators, [[power inverter|inverters]], and battery systems.

The mines could be fired in three ways, listed here in order of tactical preference:
# '''Delayed Contact Fire''': the mine was switched into contact firing status a certain number of seconds after it signaled it had been touched or tipped.
# '''Contact Fire''': the mine was set to explode as soon as it was touched or tipped.
# '''Observation Fire''': target was tracked, its position plotted by the mine fire control tower/s, and an appropriate mine in its path was fired at a time when the observers indicated the target was within the kill zone for that mine.

Delayed contact fire was preferred because it was thought{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that the mine would first be dragged underneath the target and then fired after a few seconds' delay, once it had had the chance to contact a more lightly protected portion of the target's bottom. This type of fire required the casemate troops to hear the bell and see the accompanying signal light that indicated when a given mine was tipped, wait several seconds, and then throw the firing switch for that mine's group into "fire" position to detonate the mine.

In contact fire mode, each mine in the group was set to explode when contacted or tipped by a ship; in observed fire mode, mines were fired in a fashion similar to that used under the [[Coast Artillery fire control system|fire control system]] for the coast artillery batteries defending the harbor: distant observers took bearings on targets though spotting telescopes, and these bearings were used to plot the target's position.

It was suggested{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that contact fire or delayed contact fire was most useful in situations when more than one enemy ship was approaching the mine field, or was approaching quite rapidly, which made observed fire more difficult, or under conditions of poor visibility. On the other hand, these types of fire made it much more dangerous for any friendly shipping that might be near the mine field.

Extensive on-shore facilities, as well as a small fleet of mine-planting boats, supported each mine casemate. For Fort Strong in Boston Harbor, these facilities are illustrated in the map shown at right.

The mine wharf was where mine planters tied up to load or unload their cargo of mines and connecting cable. This wharf was equipped with a heavy lifting crane. From the wharf, returning mines were carried by the mine tramway (a rail system) to the torpedo storehouse ("torpedo" was an old alternate term for "mine"). This storehouse was the largest building in the mine complex, and was used to store the mines, on large racks, when they had been pulled from the water for testing, repair, or storage (for example, when peace had broken out). Loaded mines were also stored in the underground magazines of those gun batteries which were disarmed about 1925, at the top of the bluff on the northern end of the fort. These magazines were reached by following the tramway off the map towards the lower left, where it ran up a gradual slope past the "reservoir" (water tower).

Another branch of the tramway lead to the loading room, where the TNT charges for the mines were loaded into or unloaded from the mines. A very small TNT storehouse was immediately adjacent to the loading room. Only one box of TNT – {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}}, or half of the load for an average mine – was supposed to be taken from this storehouse at a time for loading.

Another branch of the tramway track lead to the cable tanks, large concrete tanks filled with seawater pumped from the harbor and used for insulation and conductivity testing of the many miles of electrical cable that were used for mine operations. The torpedo storehouse had its own smaller tanks that were used for submergence testing of the mine casings and their fuzes, which were inserted into the casings through watertight plugs.

The mine casemate (pictured in the photo above and in the plan drawing) is also shown on the map. Its coordinates ({{coord|42.329388|N|70.958288|W|display=inline}}) indicate the approximate center of the structure. All traces of the other mine facilities were destroyed by the City of Boston in the 1990s during the redevelopment of the northern end of the fort and its parade ground for use as a summer camp for city children.

[[File:sound-10 2.svg|thumb|300px|16.2 channel surround sound]]

'''Surround sound''' is a technique for enriching the fidelity of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound reproduction]] by using multiple [[audio channel]]s from [[speaker (electronics)|speaker]]s that surround the listener ([[surround channels]]).  Its first application was in [[movie theater]]s.  Prior to surround sound, theater sound systems commonly had three "screen channels" of sound, from loudspeakers located in front of the audience at the left, center, and right. Surround sound adds one or more channels from loudspeakers behind the listener, able to create the sensation of sound coming from any horizontal direction 360° around the listener.  Surround sound formats vary in reproduction and recording methods along with the number and positioning of additional channels.  The most common surround sound specification, the [[International Telecommunications Union|ITU]]'s [[5.1 surround sound|5.1 standard]], calls for 6 speakers: Center (C) in front of the listener, Left (L) and Right (R) at angles of 60° on either side of the center, and Left Surround (LS) and Right Surround (RS) at angles of 100–120°, plus a subwoofer whose position is not critical.

Surround sound typically has a listener location or [[Sweet spot (acoustics)|sweet spot]] where the audio effects work best, and presents a fixed or forward perspective of the sound field to the listener at this location. The technique enhances the [[psychoacoustics|perception]] of sound spatialization by exploiting [[sound localization]]; a listener's ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound in direction and distance. This is achieved by using multiple discrete [[audio channel]]s routed to an array of [[loudspeaker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiogurus.com/learn/news/glossary-home-theater-terms-terminology/245#C|title=Home Theater Glossary of Terms and Terminology|work=Audiogurus|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields of application ==
Though [[Diegetic sound|cinema]] and [[soundtrack]]s represent the major uses of surround techniques, its scope of application is broader than that as surround sound permits creation of an audio-environment for all sorts of purposes. Multichannel audio techniques may be used to reproduce contents as varied as music, speech, natural or synthetic sounds for cinema, [[Multichannel television sound|television]], broadcasting, or computers. In terms of music content for example, a live performance may use multichannel techniques in the context of an open-air [[concert]], of a [[musical theatre]] or for [[broadcasting]];&lt;ref&gt;Mick M Sawaguchi, and Akira Fukada (1999), ''Multichannel sound mixing practice for broadcasting''.

== Types of media and technologies ==

Commercial surround sound media include videocassettes, [[DVD-Video|DVDs]], and [[SDTV]] broadcasts encoded as [[Lossy audio compression|compressed]] [[Dolby Digital]] and [[Digital Theater Systems|DTS]], and [[Lossless audio#Lossless audio compression|lossless audio]] such as [[DTS HD Master Audio]] and [[Dolby TrueHD]] on [[HDTV]] [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[HD DVD]], which are identical to the studio master.  Other commercial formats include the competing [[DVD-Audio]] (DVD-A) and [[Super Audio CD]] (SACD) formats, and [[MP3 Surround]]. Cinema [[5.1]] surround formats include [[Dolby Digital]] and [[Digital Theater Systems|DTS]]. [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|Sony Dynamic Digital Sound (SDDS)]] is an 8 channel cinema configuration which features 5 independent audio channels across the front with two independent surround channels, and a [[Low-frequency effects]] channel. Traditional [[7.1 surround sound|7.1]] surround speaker configuration introduces two additional rear speakers to the conventional 5.1 arrangement, for a total of four surround channels and three front channels, to create a more 360° sound field.

Most surround sound recordings are created by film production companies or video game producers; however some consumer [[camcorder]]s have such capability either built-in or available separately. Surround sound technologies can also be used in music to enable new methods of artistic expression. After the failure of [[quadraphonic]] audio in the 1970s, multichannel music has slowly been reintroduced since 1999 with the help of SACD and DVD-Audio formats. Some [[AV receivers]], stereophonic systems, and computer [[soundcard]]s contain integral [[digital signal processor]]s and/or digital audio processors to simulate surround sound from a stereophonic source (see [[fake stereo]]).

In 1967, the rock group [[Pink Floyd]] performed the first-ever surround sound concert at "Games for May", a lavish affair at [[London]]’s [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] where the band debuted its custom-made [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] speaker system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/05/dayintech_0512/|date=May 12, 1967|title= Pink Floyd Astounds With 'Sound in the Round'|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; The control device they had made, the [[Azimuth Co-ordinator]], is now displayed at London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], as part of their Theatre Collections gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.pinkfloyd.co.uk/ |title=pink floyd |accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first documented use of surround sound was in 1940, for the Disney studio's animated film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''. [[Walt Disney]] was inspired by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s operatic piece ''[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]'' to have a [[bumblebee]] featured in his musical ''Fantasia'' and also sound as if it was flying in all parts of the theatre. The initial multichannel audio application was called '[[Fantasound]]', comprising three audio channels and speakers. The sound was diffused throughout the cinema, controlled by an engineer using some 54 loudspeakers. The surround sound was achieved using the sum and the difference of the phase of the sound. However, this experimental use of surround sound was excluded from the film in later showings. In 1952, "surround sound" successfully reappeared with the film "This is Cinerama", using discrete seven-channel sound, and the race to develop other surround sound methods took off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Surround sound: up and running |last=Tomlinson |first=Holman |authorlink=Tomlinson Holman |year=2007 |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=978-0-240-80829-1 |page= 3,4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnLAD1N_MNIC |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emil Torick (1998). "Highlights in the history of multichannel sound". Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 46:1/2, pp. 27–31, February 1998 [http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=12177 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] experimented with and produced ground-breaking electronic compositions such as ''[[Gesang der Jünglinge]]'' and ''[[Kontakte (Stockhausen)|Kontakte]]'', the latter using fully discrete and rotating [[quadraphonic sound]]s generated with industrial electronic equipment in [[Herbert Eimert]]'s studio at the ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' (WDR). [[Edgar Varese]]'s [[Poeme Electronique]], created for the [[Iannis Xenakis]]-designed [[Philips Pavilion]] at the 1958 [[Brussels World's Fair]], also utilised spatial audio with 425 loudspeakers used to move sound throughout the pavilion.

In 1957, working with artist [[Jordan Belson]], [[Henry Jacobs]] produced Vortex: Experiments in Sound and Light - a series of concerts featuring new music, including some of Jacobs' own, and that of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and many others - taking place in the Morrison Planetarium in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. Sound designers commonly regard this as the origin of the (now standard) concept of "surround sound." The program was popular, and Jacobs and Belson were invited to reproduce it at the 1958 World Expo in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Jacobs]]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also many other composers that created ground-breaking surround sound works in the same time period.

In 1978, a concept devised by Max Bell for [[Dolby Laboratories]] called "split surround" was tested with the movie ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''.  This led to the 70mm stereo surround release of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', which became one of the first formal releases in cinemas with three channels in the front and two in the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eric Dienstfrey | title=The Myth of the Speakers: A Critical Reexamination of Dolby History | publisher=[[Film HIstory: An International Journal]] |jstor=10.2979/filmhistory.28.1.06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were typically five speakers behind the screens of 70mm-capable cinemas, but only the Left, Center and Right were used full-frequency, while Center-Left and Center-Right were only used for bass-frequencies (as it is currently common). The ''Apocalypse Now'' encoder/decoder was designed by Michael Karagosian, also for [[Dolby Laboratories]].  The surround mix was produced by an Oscar-winning crew led by [[Walter Murch]] for [[American Zoetrope]].  The format was also deployed in 1982 with the stereo surround release of ''[[Blade Runner]]''.

The 5.1 version of surround sound originated in 1987 at the famous French Cabaret [[Moulin Rouge]]. A French engineer, Dominique Bertrand used a mixing board specially designed in cooperation with [[Solid State Logic]], based on 5000 series and including six channels. Respectively: A left, B right, C centre, D left rear, E right rear, F bass. The same engineer had already achieved a 3.1 system in 1974, for the International Summit of Francophone States in [[Dakar]], Senegal.

== Creating surround sound ==
Surround sound is created in several ways. The first and simplest method is using a surround sound recording technique—capturing two distinct stereo images, one for the front and one for the back or by using a dedicated setup, e.g. an augmented [[Decca tree]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesdooley.com/pdf/Surround_Sound_Decca_Tree-urtext.pdf Ron Steicher (2003): The DECCA Tree—it's not just for stereo any more] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719020728/http://www.wesdooley.com/pdf/Surround_Sound_Decca_Tree-urtext.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—and/or mixing-in surround sound for playback on an audio system using speakers encircling the listener to play audio from different directions. A second approach is processing the audio with [[psychoacoustic]] [[sound localization]] methods to simulate a two-dimensional (2-D) sound field with headphones. A third approach, based on [[Huygens' principle]], attempts reconstructing the recorded sound field wave fronts within the listening space; an "audio hologram" form. One form, [[wave field synthesis]] (WFS), produces a sound field with an even error field over the entire area. Commercial WFS systems, currently marketed by companies ''sonic emotion'' and ''[[Iosono]]'', require many loudspeakers and significant computing power.

The [[Ambisonics]] form, also based on Huygens' principle, gives an exact sound reconstruction at the central point; less accurate away from center point. There are many free and commercial software programs available for Ambisonics, which dominates most of the consumer market, especially musicians using electronic and computer music. Moreover, Ambisonics products are the standard in surround sound hardware sold by [[Meridian Audio]]. In its simplest form, Ambisonics consumes few resources, however this is not true for recent developments, such as Near Field Compensated Higher Order Ambisonics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gyronymo.free.fr/audio3D/publications/AES23%20NFC%20HOA.pdf Spatial Sound Encoding Including Near Field Effect: Introducing Distance Coding Filters and a Viable, New Ambisonic Format]&lt;/ref&gt; Some years ago it was shown that, in the limit, WFS and Ambisonics converge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iua.upf.es/dafx98/papers/ROZ31.PS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011214061039/http://www.iua.upf.es/dafx98/papers/ROZ31.PS|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 December 2001|title=Further Investigations of High Order Ambisonics and Wavefield Synthesis for Holophonic Sound Imaging|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, surround sound can also be achieved by mastering level, from stereophonic sources as with [[Penteo]], which uses [[Digital Signal Processing]] analysis of a stereo recording to parse out individual sounds to component panorama positions, then positions them, accordingly, into a five-channel field. However, there are more ways to create surround sound out of stereo, for instance with the routines based on [[Quadraphonic sound|QS]] and [[Stereo Quadraphonic|SQ]] for encoding [[Quadraphonic sound|Quad]] sound, where instruments were divided over 4 speakers in the studio. This way of creating surround with software routines is normally referred to as "upmixing,",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtsac3.com|title=DTSAC3|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227160823/http://www.dtsac3.com/|archivedate=2010-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was particularly successful on the [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]] QSD-series decoders that had a mode where it mapped the L ↔ R stereo onto an ∩ arc.

== Mapping channels to speakers ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

In most cases, surround sound systems rely on the mapping of each source channel to its own loudspeaker. Matrix systems recover the number and content of the source channels and apply them to their respective loudspeakers. With discrete surround sound, the transmission medium allows for (at least) the same number of channels of source and destination; however, one-to-one, channel-to-speaker, mapping is not the only way of transmitting surround sound signals.

The transmitted signal might encode the information (defining the original sound field) to a greater or lesser extent; the surround sound information is rendered for replay by a decoder generating the number and configuration of loudspeaker feeds for the number of speakers available for replay – one renders a sound field as produced by a set of speakers, analogously to rendering in computer graphics. This "replay device independent" encoding is analogous to encoding and decoding an Adobe PostScript file, where the file describes the page, and is rendered per the output device's resolution capacity. The Ambisonics and WFS systems use audio rendering; the Meridian Lossless Packing contains elements of this capability

== Standard configurations ==

There are many alternative setups available for a surround sound experience, with a 3-2 (3 front, 2 back speakers and a Low Frequency Effects channel) configuration (more commonly referred to as 5.1 surround) being the standard for most surround sound applications, including cinema, television and consumer applications.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumsey|first1=Francis|last2=McCormick|first2=Tim|title=Sound And Recording|date=2009|publisher=Focal Press|location=Oxford|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a compromise between the ideal image creation of a room and that of practicality and compatibility with two-channel stereo.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wöhr|editor1-first=Martin|editor2-last=Dickreiter|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Dittel|editor3-first=Volker|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Hoeg|editor4-first=Wolfgang|title=Handbuch der Tonstudiotechnik Band 1|date=2008|publisher=K.G Saur|location=Munich|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most surround sound mixes are produced for 5.1 surround (6 channels), larger setups require matrixes or processors to feed the additional speakers.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt;

The standard surround setup consists of three front speakers LCR (left, center and right), two surround speakers LS and RS (left and right surround respectively) and a subwoofer for the Low Frequency Effects (LFE) channel, that is low-pass filtered at 120&amp;nbsp;Hz. The angles between the speakers have been standardized by the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] (International Telecommunication Union) recommendation 775 and AES (Audio Engineering Society) as follows: 60 degrees between the L and R channels (allows for two-channel stereo compatibility) with the center speaker directly in front of the listener. The Surround channels are placed 100-120 degrees from the center channel, with the subwoofer’s positioning not being critical due to the low directional factor of frequencies below 120&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holman|first1=Tomlinson|title=Surround Sound: Up and Running|date=2008|publisher=Focal Press|location=Oxford|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITU standard also allows for additional surround speakers, that need to be distributed evenly between 60 and 150 degrees.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt;

Surround mixes of more or less channels are acceptable, if they are compatible, as described by the ITU-R BS. 775-1, with 5.1 surround. The 3-1 channel setup (consisting of one monophonic surround channel) is such a case, where both LS and RS are fed by the monophonic signal at an attenuated level of -3&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt;

The function of the center channel is to anchor the signal so that any central panned images do not shift when a listener is moving or is sitting away from the sweet spot.&lt;ref name="On-Location Recording Techniques"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Bruce|last2=Bartlett|first2=Jenny|title=On-Location Recording Techniques|date=1999|publisher=Focal Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center channel also prevents any timbral modifications from occurring, which is typical for 2-channel stereo, due to phase differences at the two ears of a listener.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt; The centre channel is especially used in films and television, with dialogue primarily feeding the center channel.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt; The function of the center channel can either be of a monophonic nature (as with dialogue) or it can be used in combination with the left and right channels for true three-channel stereo. Motion Pictures tend to use the center channel for monophonic purposes with stereo being reserved purely for the left and right channels. Surround microphones techniques have however been developed that fully use the potential of three-channel stereo.

In 5.1 surround, phantom images between the front speakers are quite accurate, with images towards the back and especially to the sides being unstable.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt; The localisation of a virtual source, based on level differences between two loudspeakers to the side of a listener, shows great inconsistency across the standardised 5.1 setup, also being largely affected by movement away from the reference position. 5.1 surround is therefore limited in its ability to convey 3D sound, making the surround channels more appropriate for ambience or effects.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt;)

7.1 channel surround is another setup, most commonly used in large cinemas, that is compatible with 5.1 surround, though it is not stated in the ITU-standards. 7.1 channel surround adds two additional channels, center-left (CL) and center-right (CR) to the 5.1 surround setup, with the speakers situated 15 degrees off centre from the listener.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt; This convention is used to cover an increased angle between the front loudspeakers as a product of a larger screen.

==Surround microphone techniques==

Most 2-channel stereophonic microphone techniques are compatible with a 3-channel setup (LCR), as many of these techniques already contain a center microphone or microphone pair. Microphone techniques for LCR should, however, try to obtain greater channel separation to prevent conflicting phantom images between L/C and L/R for example.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="On-Location Recording Techniques"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microphone Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eargle|first1=John|title=The Microphone Book|date=2005|publisher=Focal Press|location=Oxford|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialised techniques have therefore been developed for 3-channel stereo. Surround microphone techniques largely depend on the setup used, therefore being biased towards the 5.1 surround setup, as this is the standard.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt;

Surround recording techniques can be differentiated into those that use single arrays of microphones placed in close proximity, and those treating front and rear channels with separate arrays.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt; Close arrays present more accurate phantom images, whereas separate treatment of rear channels is usually used for ambience.&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt; For accurate depiction of an acoustic environment, such as a halls, side reflections are essential. Appropriate microphone techniques should therefore be used, if room impression is important. Although the reproduction of side images are very unstable in the 5.1 surround setup, room impressions can still be accurately presented.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt;

Some microphone techniques used for coverage of three front channels, include double-stereo techniques, INA-3 (Ideal Cardioid Arrangement), the [[Decca Tree]] setup and the OCT (Optimum Cardioid Triangle).&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microphone Book"/&gt; Surround techniques are largely based on 3-channel techniques with additional microphones used for the surround channels. A distinguishing factor for the pickup of the front channels in surround is that less reverberation should be picked up, as the surround microphones will be responsible for the pickup of reverberation.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt; Cardioid, hypercardioid, or supercardioid polar patterns will therefore often replace omnidirectional polar patterns for surround recordings. To compensate for the lost low-end of directional (pressure gradient) microphones, additional omnidirectional (pressure microphones), exhibiting an extended low-end response, can be added. The microphone’s output is usually low-pass filtered.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microphone Book"/&gt;
A simple surround microphone configuration involves the use of a front array in combination with two backward-facing omnidirectional room microphones placed about 10–15 meters away from the front array. If echoes are notable, the front array can be delayed appropriately. Alternatively, backward facing cardioid microphones can be placed closer to the front array for a similar reverberation pickup.&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt;

The INA-5 (Ideal Cardioid Arrangement) is a surround microphone array that uses five cardioid microphones resembling the angles of the standardised surround loudspeaker configuration defined by the ITU Rec. 775.&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt; Dimensions between the front three microphone as well as the polar patterns of the microphones can be changed for different pickup angles and ambient response.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt; This technique therefore allows for great flexibility.

A well established microphone array is the Fukada Tree, which is a modified variant of the Decca Tree stereo technique. The array consists of 5 spaced cardioid microphones, 3 front microphones resembling a Decca Tree and two surround microphones.  Two additional omnidirectional outriggers can be added to enlarge the perceived size of the orchestra and/or to better integrate the front and surround channels.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt; The L, R, LS and RS microphones should be placed in a square formation, with L/R and LS/RS angled at 45 degrees and 135 degrees from the center microphone respectively. Spacing between these microphones should be about 1.8 meters. This square formation is responsible for the room impressions. The center channel is placed a meter in front of the L and R channels, producing a strong center image. The surround microphones are usually placed at the critical distance (where the direct and reverberant field is equal), with the full array usually situated several meters above and behind the conductor.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt;

The NHK (Japanese broadcasting company) developed an alternative technique also involving 5 cardioid microphones. Here a baffle is used for separation between the front left and right channels, which are 30&amp;nbsp;cm apart.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt; Outrigger omnidirectional microphones,  low-pass filtered at 250&amp;nbsp;Hz, are spaced 3 meters apart in line with the L and R cardioids. These compensate for the bass roll-off of the cardioid microphones and also add expansiveness.&lt;ref name="On-Location Recording Techniques"/&gt; A 3-meter spaced microphone pair, situated 2–3 meters behind front array, is used for the surround channels.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt; The centre channel is again placed slightly forward, with the L/R and LS/RS again angled at 45 and 135 degrees respectively.

The OCT-Surround (Optimum Cardioid Triangle-Surround) microphone array is an augmented technique of the stereo OCT technique using the same front array with added surround microphones.The front array is designed for minimum crosstalk, with the front left and right microphones having supercardioid polar patterns and angled at 90 degrees relative to the center microphone.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt; It is important that high quality small diaphragm microphones are used for the L and R channels to reduce off-axis coloration.&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt; Equalization can also be used to flatten the response of the supercardioid microphones to signals coming in at up to about 30 degrees from the front of the array.&lt;ref name="Sound And Recording"/&gt; The center channel is placed slightly forward. The surround microphones are backwards facing cardioid microphones, that are placed 40&amp;nbsp;cm back from the L and R microphones. The L, R, LS and RS microphones pick up early reflections from both the sides and the back of an acoustic venue, therefore giving significant room impressions.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt; Spacing between the L and R microphones can be varied to obtain the required stereo width.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt;

Specialized microphone arrays have been developed for recording purely the ambience of a space. These arrays are used in combination with suitable front arrays, or can be added to above mentioned surround techniques.&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt; The Hamasaki square (also proposed by NHK) is a well established microphone array used for the pickup of hall ambience. Four figure-eight microphones are arranged in a square, ideally placed far away and high up in the hall. Spacing between the microphones should be between 1–3 meters.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt; The microphones nulls (zero pickup point) are set to face the main sound source with positive polarities outward facing, therefore very effectively minimizing the direct sound pickup as well as echoes from the back of the hall&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt; The back two microphones are mixed to the surround channels, with the front two channels being mixed in combination with the front array into L and R.

Another ambient technique is the IRT (Institut für Rundfunktechnik) cross. Here, four cardioid microphones, 90 degrees relative to one another, are placed in square formation, separated by 21–25&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microphone Book"/&gt; The front two microphones should be positioned 45 degrees off axis from the sound source. This technique therefore resembles back to back near-coincident stereo pairs. The microphones outputs are fed to the L, R and LS, RS channels. The disadvantage of this approach is that direct sound pickup is quite significant.

Many recordings do not require pickup of side reflections. For Live Pop music concerts a more appropriate array for the pickup of ambience is the cardioid trapezium.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt; All four cardioid microphones are backward facing and angled at 60 degrees from one another, therefore similar to a semi-circle. This is effective for the pickup of audience and ambience.

All the above-mentioned microphone arrays take up considerable space, making them quite ineffective for field recordings. In this respect, the double MS (Mid Side) technique is quite advantageous. This array uses back to back cardioid microphones, one facing forward, the other backwards, combined with either one or two figure-eight microphone. Different channels are obtained by sum and difference of the figure-eight and cardioid patterns.&lt;ref name="K.G Saur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Surround Sound: Up and Running"/&gt; When using only one figure-eight microphone, the double MS technique is extremely compact and therefore also perfectly compatible with monophonic playback. This technique also allows for postproduction changes of the pickup angle.

== Bass management ==
{{Main|Bass management}}

Surround replay systems may make use of ''bass management'', the fundamental principle of which is that bass content in the incoming signal, irrespective of channel, should be directed only to loudspeakers capable of handling it, whether the latter are the main system loudspeakers or one or more special low-frequency speakers called [[subwoofer]]s.

There is a notation difference before and after the bass management system. Before the bass management system there is a Low Frequency Effects (LFE) channel. After the bass management system there is a subwoofer signal.  A common misunderstanding is the belief that the LFE channel is the "subwoofer channel". The bass management system may direct bass to one or more subwoofers (if present) from ''any'' channel, not just from the LFE channel.  Also, if there is no subwoofer speaker present then the bass management system can direct the LFE channel to one or more of the main speakers.

== Low frequency effects (LFE) channel ==

Because the ''[[low-frequency effects]]'' channel requires only a fraction of the bandwidth of the other audio channels, it is referred to as the ".1" channel; for example "5.1" or "7.1".{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The LFE channel is a source of some confusion in surround sound. It was originally developed to carry extremely low "sub-bass" cinematic sound effects (with commercial subwoofers sometimes going down to 30 [[Hertz|Hz]], e.g., the loud rumble of thunder or explosions) on their own channel. This allowed theaters to control the volume of these effects to suit the particular cinema's acoustic environment and sound reproduction system. Independent control of the sub-bass effects also reduced the problem of [[Intermodulation|intermodulation distortion]] in analog movie sound reproduction. A "sub-woofer" capable of playing back frequencies as low as 5&amp;nbsp;Hz was developed by a small speaker manufacturer in Florida. It utilized a propellor design and required a large cabinet to move sub-sonic air mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eminent-tech.com/RWbrochure.htm |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original movie theater implementation, the LFE was a separate channel fed to one or more subwoofers. Home replay systems, however, may not have a separate subwoofer, so modern home surround decoders and systems often include a bass management system that allows bass on any channel (main or LFE) to be fed only to the loudspeakers that can handle low-frequency signals. The salient point here is that the LFE channel is not the "subwoofer channel"; there may be no subwoofer and, if there is, it may be handling a good deal more than effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dolby.com/assets/pdf/tech_library/4_Multichannel_Music_Mixing.pdf Multichannel Music Mixing by Dolby Laboratories, Inc.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226234326/http://www.dolby.com/assets/pdf/tech_library/4_Multichannel_Music_Mixing.pdf |date=2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some record labels such as [[Telarc]] and [[Chesky Records|Chesky]] have argued that LFE channels are not needed in a modern digital multichannel entertainment system.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} They argue that all available channels have a full-frequency range and, as such, there is no need for an LFE in surround music production, because all the frequencies are available in all the main channels. These labels sometimes use the LFE channel to carry a height channel, underlining its redundancy for its original purpose. The label BIS generally uses a 5.0 channel mix.

== Channel notation ==

Channel notation indicates the number of discrete channels encoded in the audio signal, not necessarily the number of channels reproduced for playback. The number of playback channels can be increased by using [[matrix decoder|matrix decoding]]. The number of playback channels may also differ from the number of speakers used to reproduce them if one or more channels drives a group of speakers. Notation represents the number of channels, not the number of speakers.

The first digit in "5.1" is the number of full range channels. The ".1" reflects the limited frequency range of the LFE channel.

For example, two [[Stereophonic sound#Common usage|stereo]] speakers with no LFE channel = 2.0
&lt;br&gt;
5 full-range channels + 1 LFE channel = 5.1

An alternative notation shows the number of full-range channels in front of the listener, separated by a slash from the number of full-range channels beside or behind the listener, with a decimal point marking the number of limited-range LFE channels.

E.g. 3 front channels + 2 side channels + an LFE channel = 3/2.1

The notation can be expanded to include [[Matrix Decoder]]s. Dolby Digital EX, for example, has a sixth full-range channel incorporated into the two rear channels with a [[matrix decoder|matrix]]. This is expressed:

3 front channels + 2 rear channels + 3 channels reproduced in the rear in total + 1 LFE channel = 3/2:3.1

The term [[stereophonic sound|stereo]], although popularised in reference to two channel audio, historically also referred to surround sound, as it strictly means "solid" (three-dimensional) sound. However this is no longer common usage and "stereo sound" almost exclusively means two channels, left and right.

=== Sonic Whole Overhead Sound ===

In 2002, Dolby premiered a master of [[We Were Soldiers]] which featured a Sonic Whole Overhead Sound soundtrack. This mix included a new ceiling-mounted [[height channel]].

=== Ambisonics ===

{{Main|Ambisonics}}

'''Ambisonics''' is a recording and playback technique using multichannel mixing that can be used live or in the studio and which recreates the soundfield as it existed in the space, in contrast to traditional surround systems, which can only create illusion of the soundfield if the listener is located in a very narrow sweetspot between speakers. Any number of speakers in any physical arrangement can be used to recreate a sound field. With 6 or more speakers arranged around a listener, a 3-dimensional ("periphonic", or full-sphere) sound field can be presented. Ambisonics was invented by [[Michael Gerzon]].

=== Binaural recording ===

{{Main|Binaural recording}}

'''Binaural recording''' is a method of recording sound that uses two microphones, arranged with the intent to create the 3-D stereo experience of being present in the room with the performers or instruments. The idea of a three dimensional or "internal" form of sound has developed into technology for stethoscopes creating "in-head" acoustics and IMAX movies creating a three dimensional acoustic experience.

=== Panor-Ambiophonic (PanAmbio) 4.0/4.1 ===
{{Main|Ambiophonics}}

'''PanAmbio''' combines a stereo dipole and crosstalk cancellation in front and a second set behind the listener (total of four speakers) for 360° 2D surround reproduction.  Four channel recordings, especially those containing binaural cues, create speaker-binaural surround sound.  5.1 channel recordings, including movie DVDs, are compatible by mixing C-channel content to the front speaker pair.  6.1 can be played by mixing SC to the back pair.

=== Standard speaker channels ===

Several speaker configurations are commonly used for consumer equipment. The order and identifiers are those specified for the channel mask in the standard uncompressed [[WAV]] file format (which contains a raw multichannel [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] stream) and are used according to the same specification for most PC connectible digital sound hardware and PC operating systems capable of handling multiple channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff537083.aspx|title=KSAUDIO_CHANNEL_CONFIG structure|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khronos.org/registry/sles/api/1.0.1/OpenSLES.h Header file for OpenSL, containing various identifier definitions]&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible to build any speaker configuration, there is little commercial movie or music content for alternative speaker configurations. However, source channels can be remixed for the speaker channels using a matrix table specifying how much of each content channel is played through each speaker channel.

! 1.0 Mono&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For historical reasons, when using (1.0) mono sound, often in technical implementations the first (left) channel is used, instead of the center speaker channel, in many other cases when playing back multichannel content on a device with a mono speaker configuration all channels are downmixed into one channel. The way standard mono and stereo plugs used for common audio devices are designed ensures this as well.&lt;/ref&gt;
! 2.0 Stereo&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Stereo (2.0) is still the most common format for music, as most computers, television sets and portable audio players only feature two speakers, and the red book Audio CD standard used for retail distribution of music only allows for two channels. A 2.1 speaker set does generally not have a separate physical channel for the low-frequency effects, as the speaker set downmixes the low-frequency components of the two stereo channels into one channel for the subwoofer.

Any channel configuration may include a [[low frequency effects]] (LFE) channel (the channel played through the [[subwoofer]].) This would make the configuration ".1" instead of ".0". Most modern multichannel mixes contain an LFE.

=== 7.1 surround sound ===
{{Main|7.1 surround sound}}

[[7.1 surround sound]] is a popular format in theaters &amp; Home cinema including Blu-rays with Dolby and DTS being major players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2999543/home-theater/the-next-big-things-in-home-theater-dolby-atmos-and-dtsx-explained.html|title=The next big things in home-theater: Dolby Atmos and DTS:X explained|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 10.2 surround sound ===
{{Main|10.2 surround sound}}

'''10.2''' is the surround sound format developed by [[THX]] creator [[Tomlinson Holman]] of TMH Labs and [[University of Southern California]] (schools of Cinema/Television and Engineering). Developed along with [[Chris Kyriakakis]] of the [[Viterbi School of Engineering|USC Viterbi School of Engineering]], ''10.2'' refers to the format's promotional slogan: "Twice as good as 5.1". Advocates of 10.2 argue that it is the audio equivalent of [[IMAX]]{{Weasel inline|date=January 2015}}.

=== 11.1 surround sound ===
{{Main|11.1 surround sound}}

'''11.1''' sound is supported by BARCO with installations in theaters worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.barco.com/en/Auro11-1/exhibitors-tab-1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118231628/http://www.barco.com/en/Auro11-1/exhibitors-tab-1 |archivedate=2015-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 22.2 surround sound ===
{{Main|22.2 surround sound}}

'''22.2''' is the surround sound component of [[Ultra High Definition Television]], developed by NHK Science &amp; Technical Research Laboratories.  As its name suggests, it uses 24 speakers. These are arranged in three layers: A middle layer of ten speakers, an upper layer of nine speakers, and a lower layer of three speakers and two sub-woofers. The system was demonstrated at [[Expo 2005]], [[Aichi]], [[Japan]], the [[NAB Show]]s 2006 and 2009, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and the [[International Broadcasting Convention|IBC]] trade shows 2006 and 2008, [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].

In [[sound recording]], a '''talkback''' system is the [[intercom]] used in [[recording studio]]s and [[production control room]]s (PCRs) in [[television studio]]s to enable personnel to [[communicate]] with people in the recording area or booth. While the control room can hear the person in the booth over the studio microphones, the person in the booth hears the control room over a [[public address system|PA]], monitor speaker, in their [[headphones]] or [[Interruptible feedback]] (IFB) [[earpiece]]. [[Take]] numbers, reference data, and sometimes count-ins or remarks are also "stamped" onto recordings through talkback, similar to a [[clapperboard]]. 

The audio quality of talkback systems is usually markedly lower than that of studio microphones and speakers, coming from a simple microphone (which may be omnidirectional or unidirectional) built or plugged into the [[audio mixer]], and with its sound often [[audio level compression|compressed]]. Since talkback is usually edited out of master recordings, high fidelity isn't essential, and studios tend to cut budget corners when possible. Compression allows comments from around the control room to be audible.

Occasionally instructions and comments from talkback systems do appear in studio recordings, notably in records by [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Beatles]], [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]], and [[Bob Dylan]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. They frequently turn up in [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] or "sessions" records.

'''UMA Today''' is an international consortium of companies joined together to lead the adoption of [[3GPP]] [[Unlicensed Mobile Access|UMA]] technology around the world.

UMA is the commercial name for the global 3GPP [[Generic Access Network]] (GAN) standard for fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). UMA enables secure, scalable access to mobile voice, data and IMS services over broadband IP access networks. By deploying UMA, mobile operators can deliver a number of compelling FMC services. The most well-known applications of UMA include dual-mode Wi-Fi/cellular phones. Leading operators around the world have embraced UMA as the foundation for their FMC strategies, including [[France Telecom]]/Orange, [[T-Mobile]] (USA), [[Rogers Wireless]], [[TeliaSonera]] and [[Cincinnati Bell]].

UMA Today publishes the UMA Today Magazine hosts Webinars, sends news alerts to a subscription list and is involved in other industry activity to promote UMA technology.  In addition, UMA Today co-sponsored the [https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS104670+10-Feb-2009+BW20090210 UMA Innovation Awards] with Orange/France Telecom in 2008 and 2009. 

As of October 2010, [[T-Mobile USA]] announced it was using [[Kineto Wireless]] Smart Wi-Fi technology as the enabling technology for its [[T-Mobile_USA#Wi-Fi_calling|Wi-Fi Calling]] service offer.

[[File:Ligne-130224-0001EC.jpg|thumb|Unbalanced ports on a [[cassette deck]]]]
In electrical engineering, an '''unbalanced circuit''' is one in which the transmission properties between the [[port (circuit theory)|ports]] of the circuit are different for the two [[pole (electrical circuits)|poles]] of each port.  It is usually taken to mean that one pole of each port is bonded to a common potential ([[single-ended signalling]]) but more complex topologies are possible.  This common point is commonly called ''ground'' or ''earth'' but it may well not actually be connected to [[Ground (electricity)|electrical ground]] at all.

==Examples==
===Passive filter===
[[File:Low-pass balanced and unbalanced.svg|thumb|Comparison of unbalanced (A) and balanced (B) simple low-pass filters]]
The figure shows two versions of a simple [[low-pass filter]], unbalanced version (A) and balanced version (B).  Both circuits have exactly the same effect as filters, they have the same [[transfer function]].  However, on the unbalanced circuit, the bottom pole of the input port is connected directly to the bottom pole of the output port.  Thus, the [[electrical impedance|impedance]] between the top poles is greater than the impedance between the bottom poles from input to output.  For a circuit to be balanced the impedance of the top leg must be the same as the impedance of the bottom leg so that the transmission paths are identical.  To achieve this, the [[inductor]] in the balanced version is split into two equal inductors, each with half the original [[inductance]].

===Tuned amplifier===
[[File:Typical tuned amplifier.svg|thumb|Typical [[common emitter]] tuned amplifier]]
The figure shows the circuit of a typical tuned amplifier.  The lower pole of the input port is connected directly to the lower pole of the output port.  This connection also forms the negative rail of the supply voltage.  This scheme is typical of many electronic circuits that are not required to have differential inputs or outputs.  An example of a circuit that does not follow this pattern is the [[differential amplifier]].

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The basic advantage of using an unbalanced circuit topology, as compared to an equivalent balanced circuit, is that far fewer components are required.   The difficulties come when a port of the circuit is to be connected to a [[transmission line]] or to an external device that requires differential input or output.  Many transmission lines are intrinsically an unbalanced format such as the widely used [[coaxial cable]].  In such cases the circuit can be directly connected to the line.  However, connecting an unbalanced circuit to, for instance, a [[twisted pair]] line, which is an intrinsically balanced format, makes the line susceptible to [[common-mode interference]]. 

For this reason, [[balanced line]]s are normally driven from [[balanced circuit]]s.  One option is to redesign the circuit so that it is in a balanced format.  If that is not possible or desirable, a [[balun]], a device for converting between balanced and unbalanced formats, may be used.

The '''Women's Engineering Society''' is a [[United Kingdom]] professional learned society and networking body for women engineers, scientists and technologists.

==History==

The society was formed in 1919, after the [[First World War]], during which many women had taken up roles in engineering to replace men who were involved in the military effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canel|first1=Annie|last2=Oldenziel|first2=Ruth|title=Crossing Boundaries, Building Bridges|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135286811|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s-aNAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 November 2017|language=en|chapter=Am I a Lady or an Engineer? The Origins of the Women's Engineering Society in Britain, 1918-1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been an attitude among employers and trades unions that denied women jobs and training in engineering. While it had been seen as necessary to bring women into engineering to fill the gap left by men joining the armed forces, government, employers and trades unions were against the continuing employment of women after the war.

This led a group of women, including Lady Katherine Parsons and her daughter [[Rachel Parsons (engineer)|Rachel Parsons]], also [[Verena Holmes]] who would become the first female member of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] to form the Women's Engineering Society, with the aim of enabling women to gain training, jobs and acceptance. There is a parallel with the difficulties faced by [[London School of Medicine for Women|women in medicine]] in the 19th century. The Society's first Secretary was [[Caroline Haslett]].

The society has an archive documenting women's status in engineering and provides an insight into women's changing role in society. The archive is hosted by the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]].

The society celebrated its 95th year in 2014 with the launch of National Women in Engineering Day on 23 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Women in Engineering Day 2017|url=http://www.nwed.org.uk|website=International Women in Engineering Day 2017|publisher=Women's Engineering Society|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work and campaigns==
The Society is a [[company limited by guarantee]] 162096 registered at [[Companies House]] and it a charity 1008913 registered at the [[Charity Commission]].

Society members have advised the UK government on evolving employment practices for women. Constituted as a professional society with membership grades based on qualification and experience, the society promotes the study and practice of engineering and allied sciences among women.

WES is represented by groups. The work of the groups focuses on:
* support to members and women engineers in general,
* encouragement of women to study engineering and take up engineering careers,
* promotion of corporate gender diversity,
* speaking as the collective voice of women engineers.

=== Journal ===
The society's journal ''The Woman Engineer'' contained technical articles in its early years. It now contains articles which give engineers a view of work in engineering disciplines and celebrates the achievements of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woman Engineer journal online exhibition|url=http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/exhibition/women/wes-journal.cfm|website=www.theiet.org|publisher=The IET|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
The Women's Engineering Society holds an annual conference, a student conference and regional workshops and networking events.

=== Outreach to schools ===
In 2014 WES set up an outreach programme called Magnificent Women (and their flying machines) which replicates the work that women did during the First World War in making aircraft wings, and this is aimed at secondary school girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnificent Women|url=http://www.wes.org.uk/content/magnificent-women|website=www.wes.org.uk|publisher=Women's Engineering Society|accessdate=27 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WES members often volunteer in schools to inspire girls to take up engineering and allied science careers. In 1969, President [[Verena Holmes]] left a legacy to fund an annual lecture to inspire school girls. Run by the Verena Holmes Trust, the first lecture tour was in 1969 during the first UK Women in Engineering Year.

Members provided the 'technical women power' for the WISE Buses that were launched following the WISE Year in 1984. They continue to undertake activities in schools, often through the UK STEM Ambassador scheme.

=== MentorSET ===
MentorSET is a [[Mentorship|mentoring]] scheme for engineers, inspired by the WES President Petra Gratton (née Godwin) in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mentor SET|url=http://www.mentorset.org.uk/|website=Mentor SET|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was a collaborative project between WES and the national network of women scientists (AWISE). The philosophy was to enable women to joining a bespoke mentoring scheme to help them progress in their career and to support them back into engineering after a career break. MentorSET has previously been funded by DTI, the UK Resource Centre for Women in SET, and BAE Systems. In 2015 the MentorSET programme was relaunched with funding from DECC, now [[Department_for_Business,_Energy_and_Industrial_Strategy|BEIS]] and Women in Nuclear and is now relevant to women working in science and technology as well as engineering. 

==Membership==
Members are drawn from women who have entered the profession through routes varying from traditional apprenticeship to higher education leading to graduate and further degrees. The participation of male engineers in the society is encouraged.

Current membership exceeds 1000 individuals and over 35 corporate and education partners.
