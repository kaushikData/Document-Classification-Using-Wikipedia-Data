The '''Aborigines Advancement League''' (also known as the '''Aboriginal Advancement League''') claims to be the oldest [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] organisation in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="nma.gov.au"&gt;[http://indigenousrights.net.au/organisation.asp?oID=14 Victorian Aborigines Advancement League&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318065217/http://indigenousrights.net.au/organisation.asp?oID=14 |date=March 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily concerned with Aboriginal welfare issues and the preservation of Aboriginal culture and heritage, and is based in [[Melbourne]].

== History ==

The League was established in 1957 as a response to an enquiry by retired magistrate, Charles McLean, into the circumstances of Aboriginal Victorians. McLean was critical of conditions in the [[Lake Tyers Mission|Lake Tyers]] and [[Framlingham, Victoria|Framlingham]] Aboriginal Reserves. McLean recommended that persons of mixed Aboriginal and European descent be removed from the reserves. The people of Lake Tyers objected to this, and the League was formed out of their campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atns.net.au/agreement.asp?EntityID=1028 Agreements, Treaties and Negotiated Settlements Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new League drew from two already existing organisations, the [[Australian Aborigines League]], established 1934&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasoninrevolt.net.au/biogs/E000259b.htm Australian Aborigines League – Institution – Reason in Revolt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Save the Aborigines Committee]], which had been established in 1955 as a response to the [[Warburton Ranges crisis]].&lt;ref name="nma.gov.au"/&gt; Founding President of the League was [[Gordon Bryant]], with [[Doris Blackburn]] as Deputy President, [[Stan Davey]] as Secretary and [[Douglas Nicholls]] as Field Officer.&lt;ref name="nma.gov.au"/&gt;

Early activities included lobbying for a referendum to change the [[Australian constitution]] to allow the [[Government of Australia|Federal government]] to legislate on Aboriginal affairs, and an establishing a legal defence fund for [[Albert Namatjira]], after he was charged with supplying liquor to an Aboriginal ward.&lt;ref name="nma.gov.au"/&gt; By 1967 it had moved to being fully controlled by Aboriginal people with [[Bill Onus]] as the first Aboriginal President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150625b.htm Onus, William Townsend (Bill) (1906–1968) Biographical Entry – Australian Dictionary of Biography Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current activities ==

The League provides a number of services to [[Koorie]] people, including family support, food assistance, home visits, advocacy, counselling and educational programs, drug and alcohol awareness and funeral services. It also has a Cultural Unit that provides information and speakers for schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcommunity.com.au/member/directory_details.do?orgId=448 ourcommunity.com.au – Directory of Organisations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903141929/http://www.ourcommunity.com.au/member/directory_details.do?orgId=448 |date=September 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''architecture of ancient Greece''' is the architecture produced by the [[Greeks|Greek-speaking people]] (''Hellenic'' people) whose [[Ancient Greece|culture]] flourished on the Greek mainland, the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Aegean Islands]], and in colonies in [[Asia Minor|Anatolia]] and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC.&lt;ref name =BDFH/&gt;

Ancient Greek architecture is best known from [[Ancient Greek temple|its temples]], many of which are found throughout the region, and the parthenon is a prime example of this, mostly as ruins but many substantially intact. The second important type of building that survives all over the Hellenic world is the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece#Characteristics of the buildings|open-air theatre]], with the earliest dating from around 525-480 BC. Other architectural forms that are still in evidence are the processional gateway (''[[propylon]]''), the public square (''[[agora]]'') surrounded by storied colonnade (''[[stoa]]''), the town council building (''[[bouleuterion]]''), the public monument, the monumental tomb (''[[mausoleum]]'') and the ''[[stadium]]''.

Ancient Greek architecture is distinguished by its highly formalised characteristics, both of structure and decoration. This is particularly so in the case of temples where each building appears to have been conceived as a sculptural entity within the landscape, most often raised on high ground so that the elegance of its proportions and the effects of light on its surfaces might be viewed from all angles.&lt;ref name = HG2&gt;Helen Gardner, pp. 126-132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] refers to "the plastic shape of the [Greek] temple ... placed before us with a physical presence more intense, more alive than that of any later building".&lt;ref name="Uncle Nick"&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the [[Doric Order]], the [[Ionic Order]] and the [[Corinthian Order]], was to have profound effect on [[History of architecture|Western architecture]] of later periods. The [[Ancient Roman architecture|architecture of ancient Rome]] grew out of that of Greece and maintained its influence in Italy unbroken until the present day. From the [[Renaissance]], revivals of [[Classicism]] have kept alive not only the precise forms and ordered details of Greek architecture, but also its concept of architectural beauty based on balance and proportion. The successive styles of [[Neoclassical architecture]] and [[Greek Revival architecture]] followed and adapted Ancient Greek styles closely.

==Influences==

===Geography===
The mainland and islands of Greece are very rocky, with deeply indented coastline, and rugged mountain ranges with few substantial forests. The most freely available building material is stone. Limestone was readily available and easily worked.&lt;ref name = Boardman1&gt;John Boardman, pp. 10-14&lt;/ref&gt; There is an abundance of high quality white [[marble]] both on the mainland and islands, particularly [[Paros]] and [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]. This finely grained material was a major contributing factor to precision of detail, both architectural and sculptural, that adorned ancient Greek architecture.&lt;ref name = BF1&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 89-91&lt;/ref&gt; Deposits of high quality potter's clay were found throughout Greece and the Islands, with major deposits near Athens. It was used not only for pottery vessels, but also roof tiles and architectural decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of Greece is maritime, with both the coldness of winter and the heat of summer tempered by sea breezes. This led to a lifestyle where many activities took place outdoors. Hence temples were placed on hilltops, their exteriors designed as a visual focus of gatherings and processions, while theatres were often an enhancement of a naturally occurring sloping site where people could sit, rather than a containing structure. Colonnades encircling buildings, or surrounding courtyards provided shelter from the sun and from sudden winter storms.&lt;ref name = BF1/&gt;

The light of Greece may be another important factor in the development of the particular character of ancient Greek architecture. The light is often extremely bright, with both the sky and the sea vividly blue. The clear light and sharp shadows give a precision to the details of landscape, pale rocky outcrops and seashore. This clarity is alternated with periods of haze that varies in colour to the light on it. In this characteristic environment, the ancient Greek architects constructed buildings that were marked by precision of detail.&lt;ref name = BF1/&gt; The gleaming marble surfaces were smooth, curved, fluted, or ornately sculpted to reflect the sun, cast graded shadows and change in colour with the ever-changing light of day.

===History===
Historians divide ancient Greek civilization into two eras, the Hellenic period (from around 900 BC to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC), and the Hellenistic period (323 BC to 30 AD).&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt; During the earlier Hellenic period, substantial works of architecture began to appear around 600 BC. During the later (Hellenistic) period, Greek culture spread widely, initially as a result of Alexander's conquest of other lands, and later as a result of the rise of the Roman Empire, which adopted much of Greek culture.&lt;ref name  = BDFH/&gt;&lt;ref name = HG1&gt;Helen Gardner, pp.  110-114&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Hellenic era, two major cultures had dominated the region: the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] (c. 2800–1100 BC), and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] (c. 1500–1100 BC). Minoan is the name given by modern historians to the culture of the people of ancient [[Crete]], known for its elaborate and richly decorated palaces, and for its pottery painted with floral and marine motifs. The Mycenaean culture, which flourished on the [[Peloponnesus]], was quite different in character. Its people built citadels, fortifications and tombs rather than palaces, and decorated their pottery with bands of marching soldiers rather than octopus and seaweed. Both these civilizations came to an end around 1100 BC, that of Crete possibly because of volcanic devastation, and that of Mycenae because of an invasion by the Dorian people who lived on the Greek mainland.&lt;ref name = HG&gt;Helen Gardner, pp. 90-109&lt;/ref&gt; Following these events, there was a period from which few signs of culture remain. This period is thus often referred to as a Dark Age.

The art history of the Hellenic era is generally subdivided into four periods: the Protogeometric (1100–900 BC), the Geometric (900–700 BC), the Archaic (700–500 BC) and the Classical (500–323 BC)&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Gardner etc.&lt;/ref&gt; with sculpture being further divided into Severe Classical, High Classical and Late Classical.&lt;ref name = BDFH&gt;Boardman, Dorig, Fuchs and Hirmer&lt;/ref&gt; The first signs of the particular artistic character that defines ancient Greek architecture are to be seen in the pottery of the Dorian Greeks from the 10th century BC. Already at this period it is created with a sense of proportion, symmetry and balance not apparent in similar pottery from Crete and Mycenae. The decoration is precisely geometric, and ordered neatly into zones on defined areas of each vessel. These qualities were to manifest themselves not only through a millennium of Greek pottery making, but also in the architecture that was to emerge in the 6th century.&lt;ref name = Strong&gt;Donald E. Strong, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The major development that occurred was in the growing use of the human figure as the major decorative motif, and the increasing surety with which humanity, its mythology, activities and passions were depicted.&lt;ref name = BDFH/&gt;

The development in the depiction of the human form in pottery was accompanied by a similar development in sculpture. The tiny stylised bronzes of the Geometric period gave way to life-sized highly formalised monolithic representation in the Archaic period. The Classical period was marked by a rapid development towards idealised but increasingly lifelike depictions of gods in human form.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp.33 - 102&lt;/ref&gt; This development had a direct effect on the sculptural decoration of temples, as many of the greatest extant works of ancient Greek sculpture once adorned temples,&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 39-40, 62-66&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the largest recorded statues of the age, such as the lost [[chryselephantine]] statues of  Zeus at the Temple of Zeus at Olympia and Athena at the Parthenon, Athens, both over 40 feet high, were once housed in them.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp. 119-121&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion of ancient Greece was a form of nature worship that grew out of the beliefs of earlier cultures. However, unlike earlier cultures, man was no longer perceived as being threatened by nature, but as its sublime product.&lt;ref name = HG1/&gt; The natural elements were personified as gods of completely human form, and very human behaviour.&lt;ref name = BF1/&gt;

The home of the gods was thought to be [[Mt Olympus|Olympus]], the highest mountain in Greece. The most important deities were: [[Zeus]], the supreme god and ruler of the sky; [[Hera]], his wife and goddess of marriage; [[Athena]], goddess of wisdom; [[Poseidon]], god of the sea; [[Demeter]], goddess of the harvest; [[Apollo]], god of the sun, law, healing, plague, reason, music and poetry; [[Artemis]], goddess of the moon, the hunt and the wilderness; [[Aphrodite]], goddess of love; [[Ares]], God of war; [[Hermes]], god of commerce and travelers, [[Hephaestus]], god of fire and metalwork, and [[Dionysus]], god of wine and fruit-bearing plants.&lt;ref name = BF1/&gt; Worship, like many other activities, was done in community, in the open. However, by 600 BC, the gods were often represented by large statues and it was necessary to provide a building in which each of these could be housed. This led to the development of temples.&lt;ref name= Strong2&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greeks perceived order in the universe, and in turn, applied order and reason to their creations. Their humanist philosophy put mankind at the centre of things, and promoted well-ordered societies and the development of democracy.&lt;ref name =HG1/&gt; At the same time, the respect for human intellect demanded reason, and promoted a passion for enquiry, logic, challenge, and problem solving. The architecture of the ancient Greeks, and in particular, temple architecture, responds to these challenges with a passion for beauty, and for order and symmetry which is the product of a continual search for perfection, rather than a simple application of a set of working rules.

==Architectural character==

===Early development ===
There is a clear division between the architecture of the preceding Mycenaean culture and Minoan cultures and that of the ancient Greeks, the techniques and an understanding of their style being lost when these civilisations fell.&lt;ref name = Boardman1/&gt;

Mycenaean art is marked by its circular structures and tapered domes with flat-bedded, cantilevered courses.&lt;ref name = HG/&gt; This architectural form did not carry over into the architecture of ancient Greece, but reappeared about 400 BC in the interior of large monumental tombs such as the Lion Tomb at Cnidos (c. 350 BC). Little is known of Mycenaean wooden or domestic architecture and any continuing traditions that may have flowed into the early buildings of the Dorian people.

The Minoan architecture of Crete, was of trabeated form like that of ancient Greece. It employed wooden columns with capitals, but the columns were of very different form to Doric columns, being narrow at the base and splaying upward.&lt;ref name = HG/&gt; The earliest forms of columns in Greece seem to have developed independently. As with Minoan architecture, ancient Greek domestic architecture centred on open spaces or courtyards surrounded by colonnades. This form was adapted to the construction of [[hypostyle]] halls within the larger temples. The evolution that occurred in architecture was towards public building, first and foremost the temple, rather than towards grand domestic architecture such as had evolved in Crete.&lt;ref name="HG2"/&gt;

===Types of buildings===
{{Main|Ancient Greek temple|Ancient Greek theatre|Acropolis|Agora|Stoa|List of Ancient Greek temples}}

====Domestic buildings====
The Greek word for the family or household, [[oikos]], is also the name for the house.  Houses followed several different types.  It is probable that many of the earliest houses were simple  structures of two rooms, with an open porch or "pronaos" above which rose a low pitched gable or pediment.&lt;ref name=BF3/&gt; This form is thought to have contributed to temple architecture.

}}

The construction of many houses employed walls of sun dried clay bricks or wooden framework filled with fibrous material such as straw or seaweed covered with clay or plaster, on a base of stone which protected the more vulnerable elements from damp.&lt;ref name = Boardman1/&gt; The roofs were probably of thatch with eaves which overhung the permeable walls.  Many larger houses, such as those at Delos,  were built of stone and plastered. The roofing material for substantial house was tile.  Houses of the wealthy had mosaic floors and demonstrated the Classical style.

Many houses centred on a wide passage or "pasta" which ran the length of the house and opened at one side onto a small courtyard which admitted light and air.  Larger houses had a fully developed peristyle courtyard at the centre, with the rooms arranged around it. Some houses had an upper floor which appears to have been reserved for the use of the women of the family.&lt;ref name=BF151&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp 151-153&lt;/ref&gt;

City houses were built with adjoining walls and were divided into small blocks by narrow streets. Shops were sometimes located in the rooms towards the street. City houses were inward-facing, with major openings looking onto the central courtyard, rather than  the street.&lt;ref name = BF3&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 93-97&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

====Public buildings====
The rectangular [[Greek temple|temple]] is the most common and best-known form of Greek public architecture. This rectilinear structure borrows from the Late Helladic, Mycenaean [[Megaron]], which contained a central throne room, vestibule, and porch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple did not serve the same function as a modern church, since the altar stood under the open sky in the [[temenos]] or sacred precinct, often directly before the temple. Temples served as the location of a [[cult image]] and as a storage place or strong room for the treasury associated with the cult of the god in question, and as a place for devotees of the god to leave their [[votive offering]]s, such as statues, helmets and weapons. Some Greek temples appear to have been  oriented astronomically.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was generally part of a religious precinct known as the ''acropolis''. According to Aristotle, '"the site should be a spot seen far and wide, which gives good elevation to virtue and towers over the neighbourhood".&lt;ref name = HG2/&gt; Small circular temples, ''[[Tholos (building)|tholos]]'' were also constructed, as well as small temple-like buildings that served as treasuries for specific groups of donors.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 5th and 4th centuries BC, town planning became an important consideration of Greek builders, with towns such as [[Paestum]] and [[Priene]] being laid out with a regular grid of paved streets and an ''agora'' or central market place surrounded by a colonnade or ''stoa''. The completely restored [[Stoa of Attalos]] can be seen in [[Athens]]. Towns were also equipped with a public fountain where water could be collected for household use. The development of regular town plans is associated with [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], a pupil of [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref name = Strong9/&gt;&lt;ref name = BF16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moffett, Fazio, Wodehouse,  pp. 62-64&lt;/ref&gt;

Public buildings became "dignified and gracious structures", and were sited so that they related to each other architecturally.&lt;ref name=BF16&gt;Banister Fletcher, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; The [[propylon]] or porch, formed the entrance to temple sanctuaries and other significant sites with the best-surviving example being the [[Propylaea]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. The  [[bouleuterion]] was a large public building with a ''hypostyle'' hall that served as a court house and as a meeting place for the town council ([[boule (ancient Greece)|boule]]). Remnants of bouleuterion survive at Athens, Olympia and Miletus, the latter having held up to 1200 people.&lt;ref name = BF12&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Greek town had an open-air [[theatre]]. These were used for both public meetings as well as dramatic performances. The theatre was usually set in a hillside outside the town, and had rows of tiered seating set in a semicircle around the central performance area, the ''orchestra''. Behind the orchestra was a low building called the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skênê]]'', which served as a store-room, a dressing-room, and also as a backdrop to the action taking place in the orchestra. A number of Greek theatres survive almost intact, the best known being at [[Epidaurus]], by the architect Polykleitos the Younger.&lt;ref name=Strong9&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek towns of substantial size also had a [[palaestra]] or a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], the social centre for male citizens which included spectator areas, baths, toilets and club rooms.&lt;ref name = BF12/&gt; Other buildings associated with sports include the ''hippodrome'' for horse racing, of which only remnants have survived, and the ''stadium'' for foot racing, 600 feet in length, of which examples exist at Olympia, Delphi, Epidarus and Ephesus, while the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] in Athens, which seats 45,000 people, was restored in the 19th century and was used in the 1896, 1906 and 2004 [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=BF12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf 2004 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819195306/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf |date=2008-08-19 }} Volume 2. pp. 237, 242, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure ===

==== Post and lintel ====

The architecture of ancient Greece is of a trabeated or "post and lintel" form, i.e. it is composed of upright beams (posts) supporting horizontal beams (lintels). Although the existent buildings of the era are constructed in stone, it is clear that the origin of the style lies in simple wooden structures, with vertical posts supporting beams which carried a ridged roof. The posts and beams divided the walls into regular compartments which could be left as openings, or filled with sun dried bricks, lathes or straw and covered with clay daub or plaster. Alternately, the spaces might be filled with rubble. It is likely that many early houses and temples were constructed with an open porch or "pronaos" above which rose a low pitched gable or pediment.&lt;ref name="BF3"/&gt;

The earliest temples, built to enshrine statues of deities, were probably of wooden construction, later replaced by the more durable stone temples many of which are still in evidence today. The signs of the original timber nature of the architecture were maintained in the stone buildings.&lt;ref name = Strong3&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of these temples are very large, with several, such as the Temple of Zeus Olympus and the Olympians at Athens being well over 300 feet in length, but most were less than half this size. It appears that some of the large temples began as wooden constructions in which the columns were replaced piecemeal as stone became available. This, at least was the interpretation of the historian [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] looking at the Temple of Hera at Olympia in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name = HG2/&gt;

The stone columns are made of a series of solid stone cylinders or "drums" that rest on each other without mortar, but were sometimes centred with a bronze pin. The columns are wider at the base than at the top, tapering with an outward curve known as "entasis". Each column has a capital of two parts, the upper, on which rests the lintels, being square and called the "abacus". The part of the capital that rises from the column itself is called the "echinus". It differs according to the order, being plain in the Doric Order, fluted in the Ionic and foliate in the Corinthian. Doric and usually Ionic capitals are cut with vertical grooves known as "fluting". This fluting or grooving of the columns is a retention of an element of the original wooden architecture.&lt;ref name = Strong3/&gt;

====Entablature and pediment====
The columns of a temple support a structure that rises in two main stages, the entablature and the pediment.

The entablature is the major horizontal structural element supporting the roof and encircling the entire building. It is composed of three parts. Resting on the columns is the [[architrave]] made of a series of stone "lintels" that spanned the space between the columns, and meet each other at a joint directly above the centre of each column.

Above the architrave is a second horizontal stage called the "frieze". The frieze is one of the major decorative elements of the building and carries a sculptured relief. In the case of Ionic and Corinthian architecture, the relief decoration runs in a continuous band, but in the Doric Order, it is divided into sections called "metopes" which fill the spaces between vertical rectangular blocks called "triglyphs". The triglyphs are vertically grooved like the Doric columns, and retain the form of the wooden beams that would once have supported the roof.

The upper band of the entablature is called the "[[cornice]]", which is generally ornately decorated on its lower edge. The cornice retains the shape of the beams that would once have supported the wooden roof at each end of the building. At the front and rear of each temple, the entablature supports a triangular structure called the "[[pediment]]". The triangular space framed by the cornices is the location of the most significant sculptural decoration on the exterior of the building.

====Masonry====
Every temple rested on a masonry base called the [[crepidoma]], generally of three steps, of which the upper one which carried the columns was the ''stylobate''. Masonry walls were employed for temples from about 600 BC onwards. Masonry of all types was used for ancient Greek buildings, including rubble, but the finest [[ashlar]] masonry was usually employed for temple walls, in regular courses and large sizes to minimise the joints.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt; The blocks were rough hewn and hauled from quarries to be cut and bedded very precisely, with mortar hardly ever being used. Blocks, particularly those of columns and parts of the building bearing loads were sometimes fixed in place or reinforced with iron clamps, dowels and rods of wood, bronze or iron fixed in lead to minimise corrosion.&lt;ref name = Boardman1/&gt;

====Openings====
Door and window openings were spanned with a lintel, which in a stone building limited the possible width of the opening. The distance between columns was similarly affected by the nature of the lintel, columns on the exterior of buildings and carrying stone lintels being closer together than those on the interior, which carried wooden lintels.&lt;ref name = BF5&gt;Banister Fletcher, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BF20&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Door and window openings narrowed towards the top.&lt;ref name = BF20/&gt; Temples were constructed without windows, the light to the naos entering through the door. It has been suggested that some temples were lit from openings in the roof.&lt;ref name = BF5/&gt; A door of the Ionic Order at the Erechtheion (17 feet high and 7.5 feet wide at the top) retains many of its features intact, including mouldings, and an entablature supported on console brackets. &lt;small&gt;(See Architectural Decoration, below)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name = BF20/&gt;&lt;ref name = BF21&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roof====
{{Further|List of Greco-Roman roofs}}
The widest span of a temple roof was across the cella, or internal space. In a large building, this space contains columns to support the roof, the architectural form being known as [[hypostyle]]. It appears that, although the architecture of ancient Greece was initially of wooden construction, the early builders did not have the concept of the diagonal truss as a stabilising member. This is evidenced by the nature of temple construction in the 6th century BC, where the rows of columns supporting the roof the cella rise higher than the outer walls, unnecessary if roof trusses are employed as an integral part of the wooden roof. The indication is that initially all the rafters were supported directly by the entablature, walls and hypostyle, rather than on a trussed wooden frame, which came into use in Greek architecture only in the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt;

Ancient Greek buildings of timber, clay and plaster construction were probably roofed with thatch. With the rise of stone architecture came the appearance of fired ceramic roof tiles. These early roof tiles showed an S-shape, with the pan and cover tile forming one piece. They were much larger than modern roof tiles, being up to {{convert|90|cm|2|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|70|cm|2|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|3|-|4|cm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} thick and weighing around {{convert|30|kg|0|abbr=on}} apiece.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rostoker; Elizabeth Gebhard, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Only stone walls, which were replacing the earlier [[mudbrick]] and wood walls, were strong enough to support the weight of a tiled roof.&lt;ref name =MG&gt;Marilyn Y. Goldberg, p305-309&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest finds of [[roof tiles]] of the [[Archaic period in Greece]] are documented from a very restricted area around [[Corinth]], where fired tiles began to replace [[Thatching|thatched]] roofs at the temples of [[Apollo]] and [[Temple of Isthmia|Poseidon]] between 700 and 650 BC.&lt;ref name = OW&gt;Örjan Wikander, p.285-289&lt;/ref&gt; Spreading rapidly, roof tiles were within fifty years in evidence for a large number of sites around the Eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], including Mainland [[Greece]], Western [[Asia Minor]], Southern and Central [[Italy]].&lt;ref name = OW/&gt; Being more expensive and labour-intensive to produce than thatch, their introduction has been explained by the fact that their fireproof quality would have given desired protection to the costly temples.&lt;ref name =OW/&gt; As a side-effect, it has been assumed that the new stone and tile construction also ushered in the end of overhanging eaves in Greek architecture, as they made the need for an extended roof as rain protection for the mudbrick walls obsolete.&lt;ref name =MG/&gt;

Vaults and arches were not generally used, but begin to appear in tombs (in a "beehive" or cantilevered form such as used in Mycenaea) and occasionally, as an external feature, exedrae of [[voussoir]]ed construction from the 5th century BC. The dome and vault never became significant structural features, as they were to become in [[ancient Roman architecture]].&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt;

====Temple plans====
{{Further|List of Ancient Greek temples}}
[[File:Greek temples.svg|thumb|600px|&lt;center&gt;Plans of Ancient Greek Temples&lt;br/&gt; Top: 1. ''[[distyle in antis]]'', 2. ''amphidistyle in antis'', 3. ''tholos'', 4.

''pseudodipteral octastyle'' &lt;/center&gt;]]
Most ancient Greek temples were rectangular, and were approximately twice as long as they were wide, with some notable exceptions such as the enormous [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens]] with a length of nearly 2½ times its width. A number of surviving temple-like structures are circular, and are referred to as ''tholos''.&lt;ref name = BF6&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 107-109&lt;/ref&gt;  The smallest temples are less than 25 metres (approx. 75 feet) in length, or in the case of the circular ''tholos'', in diameter. The great majority of temples are between 30–60 metres (approx. 100–200 feet) in length. A small group of Doric temples, including the [[Parthenon]], are between 60–80 metres (approx. 200–260 feet) in length.  The largest temples, mainly Ionic and Corinthian, but including the Doric [[Temple of the Olympian Zeus, Agrigento]], were between 90–120 metres (approx. 300–390 feet) in length.

The temple rises from a stepped base or "[[stylobate]]", which elevates the structure above the ground on which it stands. Early examples, such as the Temple of Zeus at Olympus, have two steps, but the majority, like the Parthenon, have three, with the exceptional example of the Temple of Apollo at Didyma having six.&lt;ref name = BF&gt;Banister Fletcher&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the building is a masonry-built "naos" within which is a cella, a windowless room originally housing the statue of the god. The cella generally has a porch or "pronaos" before it, and perhaps a second chamber or "antenaos" serving as a treasury or repository for trophies and gifts. The chambers were lit by a single large doorway, fitted with a wrought iron grill. Some rooms appear to have been illuminated by skylights.&lt;ref name = BF/&gt;

On the stylobate, often completely surrounding the naos, stand rows of columns. Each temple is defined as being of a particular type, with two terms: one describing the number of columns across the entrance front, and the other defining their distribution.&lt;ref name = BF/&gt;

Examples:
*''[[Distyle in antis]]'' describes a small temple with two columns at the front, which are set between the projecting walls of the ''pronaos'' or porch, like the Temple of Nemesis at Rhamnus. &lt;small&gt;(see left, figure 1.)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;
*''Amphiprostyle tetrastyle'' describes a small temple that has columns at both ends which stand clear of the ''naos''. ''Tetrastyle'' indicates that the columns are four in number, like those of the Temple on the Ilissus in Athens. &lt;small&gt;(figure 4.)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;
*''Peripteral hexastyle'' describes a temple with a single row of peripheral columns around the ''naos'', with six columns across the front, like the Theseion in Athens. &lt;small&gt;(figure 7.)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;
*''Peripteral octastyle'' describes a temple with a single row of columns around the ''naos'', &lt;small&gt;(figure 7.)&lt;/small&gt; with eight columns across the front, like the Parthenon, Athens. &lt;small&gt;(figs. 6 and 9.)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;
*''Dipteral decastyle'' describes the huge temple of Apollo at Didyma, with the ''naos'' surrounded by a double row of columns, &lt;small&gt;(figure 6.)&lt;/small&gt; with ten columns across the entrance front.&lt;ref name =BF6/&gt;
* The Temple of Zeus Olympius at Agrigentum, is termed ''Pseudo-periteral heptastyle'', because its encircling colonnade has ''pseudo'' columns that are attached to the walls of the ''naos''. &lt;small&gt;(figure 8.)&lt;/small&gt; ''Heptastyle'' means that it has seven columns across the entrance front.&lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;

====Proportion and optical illusion====
The ideal of proportion that was used by ancient Greek architects in designing temples was not a simple mathematical progression using a square module. The math involved a more complex geometrical progression, the so-called [[Golden ratio|''Golden mean'']]. The ratio is similar to that of the growth patterns of many spiral forms that occur in nature such as rams' horns, [[nautilus]] shells, fern fronds, and vine tendrils and which were a source of decorative motifs employed by ancient Greek architects as particularly in evidence in the volutes of capitals of the Ionic and Corinthian Orders.&lt;ref name = BF15&gt;Banister Fletcher p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac 1 \varphi = \varphi - 1;\; \varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618 &lt;/math&gt;

The ancient Greek architects took a philosophic approach to the rules and proportions. The determining factor in the mathematics of any notable work of architecture was its ultimate appearance. The architects calculated for perspective, for the optical illusions that make edges of objects appear concave and for the fact that columns that are viewed against the sky look different from those adjacent that are viewed against a shadowed wall. Because of these factors, the architects adjusted the plans so that the major lines of any significant building are rarely straight.&lt;ref name = BF15/&gt;
The most obvious adjustment is to the profile of columns, which narrow from base to top. However, the narrowing is not regular, but gently curved so that each columns appears to have a slight swelling, called ''entasis'' below the middle. The ''entasis'' is never sufficiently pronounced as to make the swelling wider than the base; it is controlled by a slight reduction in the rate of decrease of diameter.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt;

The [[Parthenon]], the Temple to the Goddess [[Athena]] on the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, is referred to by many as the pinnacle of ancient Greek architecture. [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] refers to its "unsurpassable excellence", to be surveyed, studied and emulated by architects of later ages. Yet, as Gardner points out, there is hardly a straight line in the building.&lt;ref name = HG4/&gt; [[Banister Fletcher]] calculated that the ''stylobate'' curves upward so that its centres at either end rise about 2.6&amp;nbsp;inches above the outer corners, and 4.3&amp;nbsp;inches on the longer sides. A slightly greater adjustment has been made to the entablature. The columns at the ends of the building are not vertical but are inclined towards the centre, with those at the corners being out of plumb by about 2.6&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt; These outer columns are both slightly wider than their neighbours and are slightly closer than any of the others.&lt;ref name = MFW2&gt;Moffett, Fazio, Wodehouse, pp. 50-53&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Orders===
Ancient Greek architecture of the most formal type, for temples and other public buildings, is divided stylistically into three "[[classical order|orders]]", first described by the Roman architectural writer [[Vitruvius]].  These are: the [[Doric Order]], the [[Ionic Order]] and the [[Corinthian Order]], the names reflecting their regional origins within the Greek world. While the three orders are most easily recognizable by their capitals, the orders also governed the form, proportions, details and relationships of the columns, [[entablature]], [[pediment]] and the [[stylobate]].&lt;ref name = HG2/&gt; The different orders were applied to the whole range of buildings and monuments.

The Doric Order developed on mainland Greece and spread to [[Magna Graecia]] (Italy). It was firmly established and well-defined in its characteristics by the time of the building of the [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], c.&amp;nbsp;600 BC. The Ionic order co-existed with the Doric, being favoured by the Greek cities of [[Ionia]], in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Aegean Islands]]. It did not reach a clearly defined form until the mid 5th&amp;nbsp;century BC.&lt;ref name="Strong3"/&gt; The early Ionic temples of Asia Minor were particularly ambitious in scale, such as the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref name = Strong/&gt; The Corinthian Order was a highly decorative variant not developed until the [[Hellenistic]] period and retaining many characteristics of the Ionic. It was popularised by the Romans.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt;

====Doric Order====
The Doric order is recognised by its capital, of which the ''echinus'' is like a circular cushion rising from the top of the column to the square ''abacus'' on which rest the lintels. The echinus appears flat and splayed in early examples, deeper and with greater curve in later, more refined examples, and smaller and straight-sided in Hellenistc examples.&lt;ref name = BF7/&gt; A refinement of the Doric column is the [[entasis]], a gentle convex swelling to the profile of the column, which prevents an optical illusion of concavity.&lt;ref name = BF7/&gt;  This is more pronounced in earlier examples.

Doric columns are almost always cut with grooves, known as "fluting", which run the length of the column and are usually 20 in number, although sometimes fewer. The flutes meet at sharp edges called ''[[arris]]es''. At the top of the columns, slightly below the narrowest point, and crossing the terminating arrises, are three horizontal grooves known as the ''[[hypotrachelion]]''. Doric columns have no bases, until a few examples in the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref name = BF7/&gt;

The columns of an early Doric temple such as the [[Temple of Apollo (Syracuse)|Temple of Apollo]] at Syracuse, Sicily, may have a height to base diameter ratio of only 4:1 and a column height to entablature ratio of 2:1, with relatively crude details. A column height to diameter of 6:1 became more usual, while the column height to entablature ratio at the Parthenon is about 3:1. During the Hellenistic period, Doric conventions of solidity and masculinity dropped away, with the slender and unfluted columns reaching a height to diameter ratio of 7.5:1.&lt;ref name = BF7&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doric [[entablature]] is in three parts, the [[architrave]], the [[frieze (architecture)|frieze]] and the [[cornice]]. The architrave is composed of the stone lintels which span the space between the columns, with a joint occurring above the centre of each abacus. On this rests the frieze, one of the major areas of sculptural decoration. The frieze is divided into ''triglyphs'' and ''metopes'', the triglyphs, as stated elsewhere in this article, are a reminder of the timber history of the architectural style. Each triglyph has three vertical grooves, similar to the columnar fluting, and below them, seemingly connected, are [[guttae]], small strips that appear to connect the triglyphs to the architrave below.&lt;ref name="  BF7"/&gt; A triglyph is located above the centre of each capital, and above the centre of each lintel. However, at the corners of the building, the triglyphs do not fall over the centre the column. The ancient architects took a pragmatic approach to the apparent "rules", simply extending the width of the last two metopes at each end of the building.

The cornice is a narrow jutting band of complex moulding which overhangs and protects the ornamented frieze, like the edge of an overhanging wooden-framed roof. It is decorated on the underside with projecting blocks, ''mutules'', further suggesting the wooden nature of the prototype. At either end of the building the pediment rises from the cornice, framed by moulding of  similar form.&lt;ref name = BF7/&gt;

The pediment is decorated with figures that are in [[relief]] in the earlier examples, though almost freestanding by the time of the [[Elgin Marbles|sculpture on the Parthenon]]. Early architectural sculptors found difficulty in creating satisfactory sculptural compositions in the tapering triangular space.&lt;ref name = Strong4/&gt; By the Early Classical period, with the decoration of the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at Olympia, (486-460 BC) the sculptors had solved the problem by having a standing central figure framed by rearing [[centaur]]s and fighting men who are falling, kneeling and lying in attitudes that fit the size and angle of each part of the space.&lt;ref name = HG4&gt;Helen Gardner, pp. 138-148&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous sculptor [[Phidias]] fills the space at the Parthenon (448-432 BC) with a complex array of draped and undraped figures of deities who appear in attitudes of sublime relaxation and elegance.

====Ionic Order====
The [[Ionic Order]] is recognized by its [[volute]]d capital, in which a curved ''echinus'' of similar shape to that of the Doric Order, but decorated with stylised ornament, is surmounted by a horizontal band that scrolls under to either side, forming spirals or ''volutes'' similar to those of the [[nautilus]] shell or ram's horn. In plan, the capital is rectangular. It is designed to be viewed frontally but the capitals at the corners of buildings are modified with an additional scroll so as to appear regular on two adjoining faces. In the Hellenistic period, four-fronted Ionic capitals became common.&lt;ref name =BF8&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 125-129&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Doric Order, the Ionic Order retains signs of having its origins in wooden architecture. The horizontal spread of a flat timber plate across the top of a column is a common device in wooden construction, giving a thin upright a wider area on which to bear the lintel, while at the same time reinforcing the load-bearing strength of the lintel itself. Likewise, the columns always have bases, a necessity in wooden architecture to spread the load and protect the base of a comparatively thin upright.&lt;ref name = BF8/&gt; The columns are fluted with narrow, shallow flutes that do not meet at a sharp edge but have a flat band or ''fillet'' between them. The usual number of flutes is twenty-four but there may be as many as forty-four. The base has two convex mouldings called ''torus'', and from the late Hellenic period stood on a square plinth similar to the ''abacus''.&lt;ref name = BF8/&gt;

The architrave of the Ionic Order is sometimes undecorated, but more often rises in three outwardly-stepped bands like overlapping timber planks. The frieze, which runs in a continuous band, is separated from the other members by rows of small projecting blocks. They are referred to as ''dentils'', meaning "teeth", but their origin is clearly in narrow wooden slats which supported the roof of a timber structure.&lt;ref name = BF8/&gt;
The Ionic Order is altogether lighter in appearance than the Doric, with the columns, including base and capital, having a 9:1 ratio with the diameter, while the whole entablature was also much narrower and less heavy than the Doric entablature. There was some variation in the distribution of decoration. Formalised bands of motifs such as alternating forms known as "egg and dart" were a feature of the Ionic entablatures, along with the bands of ''dentils''. The external frieze often contained a continuous band of figurative sculpture or ornament,  but this was not always the case. Sometimes a decorative frieze occurred around the upper part of the ''naos'' rather than on the exterior of the building. These Ionic-style friezes around the ''naos'' are sometimes found on Doric buildings, notably the Parthenon. Some temples, like the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, had friezes of figures around the lower drum of each column, separated from  the fluted section by a bold moulding.&lt;ref name = BF8/&gt;

[[Caryatid]]s, draped female figures used as supporting members to carry the entablature, were a feature of the Ionic order, occurring at several buildings including the [[Siphnian Treasury]] at Delphi in 525 BC and at the [[Erechtheion]], about 410 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman p.45, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corinthian Order====
The Corinthian Order does not have its origin in wooden architecture. It grew directly out of the Ionic in the mid 5th century BC, and was initially of much the same style and proportion, but distinguished by its more ornate capitals.&lt;ref name = BF9&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 137-139&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was very much deeper than either the Doric or the Ionic capital, being shaped like a large ''krater'', a bell-shaped mixing bowl, and being ornamented with a double row of [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves above which rose voluted tendrils, supporting the corners of the abacus, which, no longer perfectly square, splayed above them. According to [[Vitruvius]], the capital was invented by a bronze founder, [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]] of Corinth, who took his inspiration from a basket of offerings that had been placed on a grave, with a flat tile on top to protect the goods. The basket had been placed on the root of an acanthus plant which had grown up around it.&lt;ref name = BF9/&gt; The ratio of the column height to diameter is generally 10:1, with the capital taking up more than 1/10 of the height. The ratio of capital height to diameter is generally about 1.16:1.&lt;ref name = BF9/&gt;

The Corinthian Order was initially used internally, as at the [[Bassae|Temple of Apollo Epicurius]] at Bassae (c. 450–425 BC). In 334 BC it appeared as an external feature on the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] in Athens, and then on a huge scale at the Temple of Zeus Olympia in Athens, (174 BC – AD 132).&lt;ref name = BF9/&gt; It was popularised by the Romans, who added a number of refinements and decorative details. During the Hellenistic period, Corinthian columns were sometimes built without fluting.&lt;ref name = BF9/&gt;

Early wooden structures, particularly temples, were ornamented and in part protected by fired and painted clay revetments in the form of rectangular panels, and ornamental discs. Many fragments of these have outlived the buildings that they decorated and demonstrate a wealth of formal border designs of geometric scrolls, overlapping patterns and foliate motifs.&lt;ref name = Boardman2/&gt; With the introduction of stone-built temples, the revetments no longer served a protective purpose and sculptured decoration became more common.

The clay ornaments were limited to the roof of buildings, decorating the cornice, the corners and surmounting the pediment. At the corners of pediments they were called ''acroteria'' and along the sides of the building, ''antefixes''. Early decorative elements were generally semi-circular, but later of roughly triangular shape with moulded ornament, often palmate.&lt;ref name = Boardman2&gt;Boardman, pp. 22-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BF19&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Ionic cornices were often set with a row of lion's masks, with open mouths that ejected rainwater.&lt;ref name = BF5/&gt;&lt;ref name = BF19/&gt; From the Late Classical period, acroteria were sometimes sculptured figures.&lt;small&gt;See "Architectural sculpture"&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name = Dorig/&gt;

In the three orders of ancient Greek architecture, the sculptural decoration, be it a simple half round ''[[astragal]]'', a frieze of stylised foliage or the ornate sculpture of the pediment, is all essential to the architecture of which it is a part. In the Doric order, there is no variation in its placement. Reliefs never decorate walls in an arbitrary way. The sculpture is always located in several predetermined areas, the metopes and the pediment.&lt;ref name = Boardman2/&gt; In later Ionic architecture, there is greater diversity in the types and numbers of mouldings and decorations, particularly around doorways, where voluted brackets sometimes occur supporting an ornamental cornice over a door, such as that at the Erechtheion.&lt;ref name = BF5/&gt;&lt;ref name = BF21/&gt;&lt;ref name = Boardman2/&gt; A much applied narrow moulding is called "bead and reel" and is symmetrical, stemming from turned wooden prototypes. Wider mouldings include one with tongue-like or pointed leaf shapes, which are grooved and sometimes turned upward at the tip, and "egg and dart" moulding which alternates ovoid shapes with narrow pointy ones.&lt;ref name = BF5/&gt;&lt;ref name = Boardman2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural sculpture showed a development from early Archaic examples through Severe Classical, High Classical, Late Classical and Hellenistic.&lt;ref name =BDFH/&gt; Remnants of Archaic architectural sculpture (700–500 BC) exist from the early 6th century BC with the earliest surviving pedimental sculpture being fragments of a Gorgon flanked by heraldic panthers from the centre of the pediment of the [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|Artemis Temple of Corfu]].&lt;ref name = Strong13&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; A metope from a temple known as "Temple C" at Selinus, Sicily, shows, in a better preserved state, [[Perseus]] slaying the Gorgon [[Medusa]].&lt;ref name =Strong4&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; Both images parallel the stylised depiction of the Gorgons on the black figure name vase decorated by the Nessos painter (c. 600 BC), with the face and shoulders turned frontally, and the legs in a running or kneeling position. At this date images of terrifying monsters have predominance over the emphasis on the human figure that developed with Humanist philosophy.&lt;ref name = Strong13/&gt;

The Severe Classical style (500–450 BC) is represented by the pedimental sculptures of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, (470–456 BC). The eastern pediment shows a moment of stillness and "impending drama" before the beginning of a chariot race, the figures of Zeus and the competitors being severe and idealised representations of the human form.&lt;ref name = Strong5/&gt; The western pediment has Apollo as the central figure, "majestic" and "remote", presiding over a battle of [[Lapith]]s and [[Centaur]]s, in strong contrast to that of the eastern pediment  for its depiction of violent action, and described by D. E. Strong as the "most powerful piece of illustration" for a hundred years.&lt;ref name =Strong5&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The shallow reliefs and three-dimensional sculpture which adorned the frieze and pediments, respectively, of the Parthenon, are the lifelike products of the High Classical style (450–400 BC) and were created under the direction of the sculptor [[Phidias]].&lt;ref name = HG10&gt;Helen Gardner, pp. 143–148&lt;/ref&gt; The pedimental sculpture represents the Gods of Olympus, while the frieze shows the Panathenaic procession and ceremonial events that took place every four years to honour the titular Goddess of Athens.&lt;ref name = HG10/&gt; The frieze and remaining figures of the eastern pediment show a profound understanding of the human body, and how it varies depending upon its position and the stresses that action and emotion place upon it. Benjamin Robert Haydon described the reclining figure of [[Dionysus]] as "... the most heroic style of art, combined with all the essential detail of actual life".&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of many famous sculptors are known from the Late Classical period (400–323 BC), including [[Timotheus (sculptor)|Timotheos]], [[Praxiteles]], [[Leochares]] and [[Skopas]], but their works are known mainly from Roman copies.&lt;ref name = BDFH/&gt;  Little architectural sculpture of the period remains intact. The [[Temple of Asclepius at Epidauros]] had sculpture by Timotheos working with the architect Theodotos. Fragments of the eastern pediment survive, showing the [[Sack of Troy]]. The scene appears to have filled the space with figures carefully arranged to fit the slope and shape available, as with earlier east pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympus. But the figures are more violent in action, the central space taken up, not with a commanding God, but with the dynamic figure of [[Neoptolemos]] as he seizes the aged king [[Priam]] and stabs him. The remaining fragments give the impression of a whole range of human emotions, fear, horror, cruelty and lust for conquest.&lt;ref name = Dorig&gt;Jose Dorig in Boardman, Dorig, Fuchs and Hirmer, pp. 435&lt;/ref&gt; The ''acroteria'' were sculptured by Timotheus, except for that at the centre of the east pediment which is the work of the architect. The palmate acroteria have been replaced here with small figures, the eastern pediment being surmounted by a winged [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], poised against the wind.&lt;ref name = Dorig/&gt;

Hellenistic architectural sculpture (323–31 BC) was to become more flamboyant, both in the rendering of expression and motion, which is often emphasised by flowing draperies, the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace|Nike Samothrace]] which decorated a monument in the shape of a ship being a well-known example. The [[Pergamon Altar]] (c. 180–160 BC) has a frieze (120 metres long by 2.3 metres high) of figures in very high relief. The frieze represents the battle for supremacy of Gods and Titans, and employs many dramatic devices: frenzy, pathos and triumph, to convey the sense of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Fuchs in Boardman, Dorig, Fuchs and Hirmer, pp.509–510&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideological===
{{main|Indian nationalism|Hindu nationalism|Akhand Bharat|Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts}}
The Indian state officially rejects the validity of the [[Two Nation Theory]], the notion that Indian Muslims are a distinct 'nation' and needed an independent homeland in South Asia. Nationalists led by [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] wanted to make what was then British India, as well as the 562 princely states under British paramountcy, into a single secular, democratic state.&lt;ref name="Hardgrave, Robert. -India: The Dilemmas of Diversity"&gt;Hardgrave, Robert.

===Sikhism===
The slogan "Death to Pakistan" (''Pakistan Murdabad'') was raised by Sikh leader [[Master Tara Singh]] in March 1947, soon after the [[Unionist Party (Punjab)|Unionist Party]] cabinet of [[Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana]] resigned in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], and immediately after it was announced that the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] would take over the reins of provincial government.&lt;ref name="Vohra2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolpert2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moon1962"&gt;{{citation|last=Moon|first=Penderel|title=Divide and Quit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WpViCTc-YAgC&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=23 July 2012|year=1962|publisher=University of California Press|page=77|id=GGKEY:4N8AYYFTYFJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resignation of the Khizar Tiwana government, composed of Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs, followed the unrest caused by the call for the [[Direct Action Day]] by the Muslim League the previous year.&lt;ref name="Vohra2001"&gt;{{citation|last=Vohra|first=Ranbir|title=The Making of India: A Historical Survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDKoyGjFo44C&amp;pg=PA177|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=2001|publisher=M.E.

But it was explicable because the League's attitude during its agitation against the Khizar coalition was one of arrogance towards the minorities and it had never given them any indication of what Pakistan meant or what it might offer them in return for support.  The League, as Jenkins pointed out, had also set a foreboding precedent by overthrowing a popular ministry by force, and, after the announcement of 20 February, had made every suggestion that it would capture the Punjab by any means.  On 4 March Hindu and Sikh students took out a procession through the main part of Lahore shouting "''Pakistan Murdabad''", "''Jinnah Murdabad''" and according to ''Dawn'' "''Allaho-Akbar Murdabad''".  Rioting broke out in Lahore and Multan, and Khizar resigned as caretaker Prime Minister, chiefly because his ministry could not control the situation.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to historian [[Stanley Wolpert]] in ''A New History of India'',&lt;ref name="Wolpert2004"&gt;{{citation|last=Wolpert|first=Stanley A.|authorlink=Stanley Wolpert|title=A new history of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTwwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=21 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-516677-4|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the administration of Punjab was taken over by Muslim League, "Master Tara Singh, prominent Sikh political and religious leader in the first half of the 20th century, called for direct action by his ''khalsa'' against the League at this time, igniting the powder keg of repressed violence that set the Punjab ablaze with his cry of "''Pakistan Murdabad''" ("Death to Pakistan"). Tara Singh and his followers were demanding a Sikh nation of their own, [[Khalistan]], and by demonstrating their willingness to die in defence of their homeland, they sought to prove the validity of their claim."&lt;ref name="Wolpert2004"/&gt; This slogan often was followed by religious fights and conflicts.&lt;ref name=Kumar&gt;{{cite book|last=Rajendra Kumar Mishra|title=Babri Mosque: A Clash of Civilizations|year=2012|publisher=Dorrance Publishing,|isbn=1434967425|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramu&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagappan|first=Ramu|title=Speaking havoc social suffering and South Asian narratives|year=2005|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=0295801719|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Literature &amp; nation : Britain and India : 1800–1990|last=Allen|first=Richard|publisher=Routledge [u.a.]|year=2000|isbn=0415212073|edition=1. publ.|location=London|page=355|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
{{main|India–Pakistan cricket rivalry}}
In February 2011, the [[Shiv Sena]] stated that it would not allow Pakistan to play any [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] matches in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1464606.ece |title=Sena leader announces veiled threat on World Cup final involving Pakistan |work=The Hindu |date= 17 February 2011|accessdate=17 February 2011 |location=Mumbai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan Hockey Federation]] also feared of sending the national hockey of Pakistan because of anti-Pakistani sentiment in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Anti-Pakistan' sentiment in India, a cause for concern: PHF|url=http://www.ummid.com/news/2010/February/19.02.2010/anti_palistan_sentiments_in_india.htm|publisher=UMMID|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Maharashtra]], where Shiv Sena is prominent, has been deemed an unsafe venue for hosting visiting Pakistani teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/935483/shiv-sena-scare-bcci-to-keep-pakistan-out-of-maharashtra-in-2016-world-t20/|title=Shiv Sena scare: BCCI to keep Pakistan out of Maharashtra in 2016 World T20|work=The Express Tribune|date=10 August 2015|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiv Sena has periodically disrupted cricketing occasions involving the two countries. In 1999, it tampered the pitch at [[Feroz Shah Kotla Ground]] to stop a match between the two sides, while during the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 Champions Trophy]] it made threats against hosting Pakistan's matches in Jaipur and Mohali.&lt;ref name="Cricinfo"/&gt; Post-2008, it has frequently threatened against the resumption of a bilateral Indo-Pakistani cricket series. In October 2015, Shiv Sena activists barged into the headquarters of the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI) in Mumbai, chanting anti-Pakistan slogans and stopping a scheduled meeting between BCCI president [[Shashank Manohar]] and the Pakistan Cricket Board's [[Shahryar Khan]] and [[Najam Sethi]].&lt;ref name="Cricinfo"/&gt;

Although Bollywood films were banned for 40 years prior to 2008 because Indian culture was officially viewed as being "vulgar", there had been an active black market during the period and little was done to disrupt it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/03/15/how_pakistan_fell_in_love_with_bollywood How Pakistan Fell in Love With Bollywood].

In 2012, [[Raj Thackeray]] and his party [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]] (MNS) told Indian singer [[Asha Bhosle]] not to co-judge in ''[[Sur Kshetra]]'', a musical reality show aired on a local television channel that featured Pakistani artists alongside Indians. The MNS threatened to disrupt the shoot among other consequences if the channel went on to air the show. However, amid tight security in a hotel conference, Bhosle played down the threat, saying she only understood the language of music and did not understand politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/428853/asha-bhosle-downplays-mns-threat-against-co-judging-show-with-pakistanis/|title=Asha Bhosle downplays MNS threat against co-judging show with Pakistanis|work=The Express Tribune|date=31 August 2012|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Shiv Sena has disrupted concerts by Pakistani artists in India.&lt;ref name="Cricinfo"/&gt; In October 2015, Shiv Sena activists assaulted Indian journalist [[Sudheendra Kulkarni]] and blackened his face with ink; Kulkarni was due to host a launch event for former Pakistani foreign affairs minister [[Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri]]'s book in Mumbai.&lt;ref name="Cricinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/930447.html|title=BCCI-PCB talks hit by anti-Pakistan protest|date=19 October 2015|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shiv Sena have also blocked the screening or promotion of Pakistani films in Indian cinemas, or Indian films starring Pakistani actors, as well as threatening Pakistani artists in Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2015/10/21/shiv-sena-turns_n_8344056.html|title=Shiv Sena Threatens Pakistani Actors Fawad Khan, Mahira Khan Against Promoting Films in Maharashtra|work=Huffington Post|date=21 October 2015|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/lifestyle/shiv-sena-threatens-against-bin-roye-screening-204/|title=Shiv Sena threatens against 'Bin Roye' screening|work=Daily Pakistan|date=15 July 2015|accessdate=30 August 2017|first=Sarfraz|last=Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1307897/shiv-sena-warns-distributors-against-screening-of-raees|title=Shiv Sena warns distributors against screening of Raees|work=Dawn|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one Indian minister, [[Kiren Rijiju]], much of the obsession with Pakistan is limited to [[North India]] due to historical and cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Kiren-Rijiju-Pakistan-obsession-is-a-north-Indian-thing/articleshow/45947416.cms|title=Kiren Rijiju: Pakistan obsession is a north Indian thing|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently following the [[Uri attack]] in 2016, due to which tensions escalated between India and Pakistan, anti-Pakistan sentiments became more pronounced; the Indian Motion Picture Producers’ Association voted to ban Pakistani artists from working  in Bollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Bollywood Becomes India and Pakistan’s Latest Battleground https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/world/asia/bollywood-becomes-india-and-pakistans-latest-battleground.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Bangladesh–Pakistan relations}}
The relationship between Bangladesh and Pakistan is affected by past history. Due to political, economic, linguistic and ethnic discrimination by the [[West Pakistan|Pakistani state]] before independence in 1971, and the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|atrocities against the Bengalis]] committed by the [[Pakistan Army]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], some people in Bangladesh abhor everything from Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130719131431/http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=12509 ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Bangladesh demands a formal apology for those atrocities from the Pakistani head of state, as well as putting on trial former military and political leaders who had played a role in the army action in then [[East Pakistan]].

[[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations]] have been negatively affected by issues related to the [[Durand Line]], the 1978–present [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|war]] (i.e. [[Mujahideen]], [[Afghans in Pakistan|Afghan refugees]], [[War in North-West Pakistan|Taliban insurgency]] and [[Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes|border skirmishes]]), including [[List of rivers of Afghanistan|water]] and the growing [[Afghanistan–India relations|influence of India in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/312794/what-does-pakistan-want-in-afghanistan-3/|title=What does Pakistan want in Afghanistan?|work=The Express Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://world.time.com/2012/12/02/what-iran-and-pakistan-want-from-the-afghans-water/?xid=rss-topstories | title=What Iran and Pakistan Want from the Afghans: Water | work=Time | date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most major attacks in Afghanistan are blamed on neighboring Pakistan and Iran.

In the 1990s, Pakistan's support for the [[Taliban]] movement led to strong anti-Pakistan sentiments in Afghanistan. According to Pakistan and Afghanistan expert [[Ahmed Rashid]], "between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan" keeping the Taliban regime in power.&lt;ref name=Maley&gt;{{cite book|last=Maley|first=William|title=The Afghanistan wars|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-21313-5|page=288|author2=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the Pakistani military during that time has been described by international observers as a "creeping invasion" of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Maley"/&gt; UN documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in Taliban massacre campaigns.&lt;ref name="Newsday 2001"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-10-12/news/0110120312_1_taliban-fighters-massacres-in-recent-years-mullah-mohammed-omar|title=Taliban massacres outlined for UN |series= Newsday|date=October 2001|work= Chicago Tribune|first=Edward A|last=Gargan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the Taliban insurgency anti-Pakistan sentiment was again fuelled after a spate of [[suicide bombings]] by the Taliban, which in 2011 and 2012 caused 80% of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and which the Afghan government and many international officials claim is supported by Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Gall&gt;{{cite news|last=Gall|first=Carlotta|title=Afghan Suicide Bombings, Tied to Taliban, Point to Pakistan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/15/international/asia/15afghan.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="longwarjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas |last=Joscelyn |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/09/admiral_mullen_pakis.php |title=Admiral Mullen: Pakistani ISI sponsoring Haqqani attacks |work=The Long War Journal| quote = During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing today, Admiral Michael Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, highlighted the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence Agency's role in sponsoring the Haqqani Network – including attacks on American forces in Afghanistan.

==Middle East==
In certain Middle Eastern countries, some Middle Easterns have behaved in a somewhat discriminatory and violent manner toward South Asians like [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Pakistanis]], [[Bangladeshis]], [[Sri Lankans]]. In the case of Pakistanis, these attacks are usually carried on darker-skinned individuals versus their lighter-skinned, [[Iranic]] counterparts. Middle Easterns youth have also occasionally engaged in violent attacks on South Asian workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Is There So Much Hate Inside Us? |author=Abdullah Al-Mutairi |url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=13&amp;section=0&amp;article=79830&amp;d=27&amp;m=3&amp;y=2006 |newspaper=Al-Watan |accessdate=September 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616055822/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=13&amp;section=0&amp;article=79830&amp;d=27&amp;m=3&amp;y=2006 |archivedate=16 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the July 2005 bombings in London, there were waves of "Pakistanophobia" in France.

There has been some anti-Pakistani sentiment in Israel.

In 1999, Israeli military personnel helped India develop better planned operations against Pakistan. In an interview with a Russian daily, [[Foreign Minister of Israel|Israel's Foreign Minister]] [[Avigdor Lieberman]] described Pakistan as an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]", repeating [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s choice reference for the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/world/pakistan,+afghanistan+threat+to+israel+israeli+fm-rs Pakistan is an evil empire and threat to Israel: Israeli FM, Dawn newspaper, 22 Apr, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli journalists have also criticized Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.657319|title=Pakistan Is the Only Muslim Nuclear-armed State.

Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Pakistani-Americans have been targeted more often in [[hate crime]] attacks.

==Pakistani reactions==
Pakistani cable operators have accused foreign news organisations of airing "anti-Pakistan" material, according to the [[BBC]]. In November 2011 that organisation was itself blocked from view in Pakistan after it broadcast a documentary called ''[[Secret Pakistan]]'' in which Pakistan's connections to the [[Taliban]] were explored. The BBC noted that while it was officially the action of broadcast operators in the country, "the Pakistani government is likely to have put pressure on [them] to impose the ban". The government denied this, saying that it was committed to "freedom of press and media".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-15936881 BBC News – Pakistan blocks BBC World News TV channel].

'''The Baku International Jazz Festival''' is an annual [[jazz]] event organized by saxophonist and [[Baku]] resident [[Rain Sultanov]]. The festival aims to showcase [[Azerbaijan]]'s long-running attachment to jazz, a connection established in the country during the 1950s and 1960s when jazz was outlawed by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities. The festival has welcomed musicians from  [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Portugal]], Italy, Israel, United States, Germany, Canada, and Russia.

Acts appearing at the inaugural event in April 2005 included the [[Joe Zawinul]] Syndicate, [[Christoph Busse]] Trio from Germany, and [[Yakov Okun]] Quartet from Russia. The fourteen day event included a tribute Azerbaijani jazz musicians [[Rafig Babayev]] and his Gaya quartet and pianist [[Vagif Mustafa Zadeh]]. At the end of the first festival it was announced that the festival would become an annual event. In 2006 the festival took place from 19 to 27 June and was headlined by [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Al Jarreau]].

{{about|the dress code|other uses|Black tie (disambiguation)}}
{{Western dress codes}}
'''Black tie''', occasionally known in the English-speaking world by its French name '''''cravate noire''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashionbeans.com/2016/complete-guide-mens-dress-codes/ |title=The Complete Guide to Men's Dress Codes |last=Millar |first=Jamie |date=1 February 2016 |website=fashionbeans.com |access-date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[dress code (Western)|dress code]] for evening events and social functions derived from British and American [[costume]] conventions of the 19th century. For men, the principal elements of black tie are a white dress shirt with a black [[bow tie]], an evening [[waistcoat]] or [[cummerbund]], and a [[dinner jacket]] (called a tuxedo in the United States). For women, an [[evening gown]] or other fashionable evening attire may be worn.

Traditionally worn only for events after 6 p.m., black tie is less formal than [[white tie]] but more formal than [[Informal attire|informal or business dress]].&lt;ref name="DebrettWeb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/british-etiquette/british-behaviour/h/dress-codes/black-tie|title=Black Tie, Dress Codes, A to H, British Behaviour, Etiquette and Style {{!}} Debrett's|website=www.debretts.com|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be worn to private and public dinners, balls, and parties.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Men's standard ==
[[File:Museo del Bicentenario - Traje de gala de Carlos Menem.jpg|thumb|The elements of gentleman's black tie.]]
For men, the elements of black tie are:
*A white [[dress shirt]]
*A black [[bow tie]]
*An [[Waistcoat|evening waistcoat]] or [[cummerbund]]
*A [[dinner jacket]] (called a tuxedo in the United States), of black or midnight blue wool, in which the jacket lapels and trouser braid are of silk or other contrasting material
*Black [[Oxford shoe|Oxford]] (without brogueing) [[dress shoes]] or [[Court shoe|patent leather pumps]].

== Women's standard ==
[[File:Maria Grazia Cucinotta - nicogenin - 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) 2.jpg|thumb|An example of a black evening gown.]]
Women's dress for black tie occasions has varied greatly through the years; traditionally it was:
*evening shoes
*dinner (ankle) or tea (below mid-calf) length sleeveless [[evening gown]], often accompanied by:
**a wrap or [[Stole (shawl)|stole]] and
**gloves

Today ladies dress for black tie occasions covers a much wider level of formality ranging from just below the white tie standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=John |date=1 April 2007 |title=Debrett's New Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners: The Indispensable Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pog2O7cUIc0C&amp;pg=PA338|publisher=Macmillan |page=338 |isbn=9781429978286}}&lt;/ref&gt; to something more informal such as a [[little black dress]].  Specifically it can also include:
*Evening shoes and
*A ballgown, evening gown or cocktail dress. Cocktail dresses may be long or moderately short and needn't be black.&lt;ref name="DebrettWeb" /&gt;
*In England, evening trousers with a [[Palazzo pants|palazzo]] cut are another acceptable option.&lt;ref name="DebrettWeb" /&gt;

Unlike the men's standard, the specifics of black tie for women are linked to whatever evening wear is currently in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Marjabelle Young |date=15 April 1997  |title=The New Etiquette: Real Manners for Real People in Real Situations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mVC5EtaIJQC&amp;pg=PA463 |publisher=Macmillan |page=463 |isbn=9780312156022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Coctail party - 1936.tif|thumb|Cocktail party – 1936]]
The first record of a dinner jacket is an 1865 record in the [https://henrypoole.com/hp/history-of-henry-poole-tailor-of-savile-row/the-tuxedo/ ledger of Henry Poole &amp; Co], of an order placed by the Prince of Wales and future King [[Edward VII]] for a short midnight blue jacket. In the following decades of the [[Victorian era]], the dinner jacket (''[[tuxedo]]'' in American English) came into fashion as a less formal alternative for the [[tailcoat]] which men of the [[upper class]]es wore every evening. Thus it was worn with the standard accompaniments for the evening tailcoat at the time: matching trousers, white or black waistcoat, white bow tie, white detachable wing-collar formal shirt and black formal shoes. Lapels were often faced or edged in silk or satin in varying widths. Dinner jackets were considered from the first less formal than full dress (cutaway tailcoat) and etiquette guides declared it inappropriate for wear in mixed company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/04-Victorian_Late_Etiquette_&amp;_DJ.htm |title=History: Late Victorian Era |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Edwardian era]], the practice of wearing a black waistcoat and black bow tie with a dinner jacket became the convention, establishing the basis of the current black tie and [[white tie]] dress codes. The dinner jacket was also increasingly accepted at less formal evening occasions such as warm-weather gatherings or intimate dinners with friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/06-Edwardian.htm |title=History: Edwardian Era |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I, the dinner jacket became de facto evening wear, while the evening tailcoat was limited to extremely formal or ceremonial occasions. During this interwar period, double-breasted jackets, turndown-collar shirts and cummerbunds became popular for black-tie evenings as did white and colored jackets in warm weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/07-Jazz_Age.htm |title=History: Jazz Age |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/08-Depression_Era.htm |title=History: Depression Era |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades following World War II, black tie became special occasion attire rather than standard evening wear.  In the 1950s, colored and patterned jackets, cummerbunds and bow ties and narrow lapels became very popular; the 1960s and 1970s saw the color palette move from muted to bright day-glow and pastel, as well as ruffled-placket shirts as lapels got wider and piping was revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/09-Post_War.htm |title=History: Postwar Period |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/10-Jet_Age.htm |title=History: Jet Age |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/11-Counterculture.htm |title=History: Counterculture Era |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s and 1990s saw a return to nostalgic styles, with black jackets and trousers again becoming nearly universal.  The 21st century has seen increased variation and a relaxation of previous strict standards; midnight blue once again became popular and lapel facings were sometimes reduced to wide edging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/14-Millennium.htm |title=Millennial Era: Black Tie Optional |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, black tie (in contrast to formal white tie) was considered informal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Safire |first=William |date=5 May 1985 |title=On Language; Come as You Are |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/05/magazine/on-language-come-as-you-are.html |magazine=The New York Times Magazine |publisher=New York Times |access-date=1 March 2017 |page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century black tie is often referred to as being semi-formal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright USAF (Ret.) |first=Col. Stephen E. |date=15 July 2014 |title=Air Force Officer's Guide: 36th Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpHyAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202 |location= |publisher=Stackpole Books |page=202 |isbn=9780811713771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The elements of black tie ==
Unlike [[white tie]], which is very strictly regulated, black-tie ensembles can display more variation. In brief, the traditional components for men are:

* A jacket with [[silk]] facings (usually [[grosgrain]] or [[satin]]) on a [[shawl lapel]], [[peaked lapel]] or [[notched lapel]].   Many current fashion stylists and writers see notched lapels as less formal&lt;ref name="BTG_tuxedo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Classic/Classic_Tuxedos.htm |title=Classic Black Tie: Tuxedos (Dinner Suits)|publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they (like peaked and shawl) were used (though somewhat rarely) in some of the early forms of the garment.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[Trousers]] with a single silk or satin braid covering the outer seams, uncuffed and worn with braces.
* A black low-cut [[waistcoat]] or a [[cummerbund]].
* A white [[dress shirt]] (a [[Piqué (weaving)|marcella]] or pleated bib is traditional) with double (or "french") [[cuff]]s and a turndown [[Collar (clothing)|collar]]. While the turndown is most appropriately [[semi-formal]], the attached wing collar has been popular with American men since the 1980s. However, many style authorities argue that the attached version now typically offered is insubstantial with minuscule wings and inappropriately paired with soft pleated fronts.&lt;ref name="BTG_shirts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Classic/Classic_Shirts.htm |title=Classic Black Tie: Shirts |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A black silk [[bowtie|bow tie]] matching the lapel facings.
* [[Shirt stud]]s and [[cufflink]]s. Some classic etiquette authorities limit studs to stiff-front [[Piqué (weaving)|marcella]] shirts only and prescribe pearl buttons for soft-front models instead.
* Black dress [[socks|stockings]], usually of silk or fine wool
* Black shoes—traditionally patent leather [[court shoe]]s (pumps); now often highly polished or [[patent leather]] [[Oxford shoe|Oxfords]] instead.

=== Jacket ===
[[File:Dinner Jacket cuff button detail.jpg|thumb|Covered cuff buttons on a dinner jacket.]]
[[File:Dinner Jacket Lapel Boutonnière.jpg|alt=Dinner jacket peak lapel|left|thumb|253x253px|The [[Lapel|peak lapel]] of a dinner jacket featuring a working [[Boutonnière|buttonhole]] and [[Grosgrain|silk grosgrain]] facings.]]
The original and most formal model of dinner jacket is the [[single-breasted]] model. The typical black-tie jacket is single-breasted with one button only, with [[wikt:besom pocket|jetted (besom) pockets]] and is of black or midnight blue; usually of wool or a wool–[[mohair]], or wool-[[polyester]] blend, although other materials, especially silk, are seen. Although other materials are used, the most appropriate and traditional for the dinner jacket are wool [[barathea]] or superfine [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]].&lt;ref name="DebrettWeb" /&gt; [[Double-breasted|Double breasted]] models are less common, but considered equally appropriate. Dinner jackets were commonly [[Vent (tailoring)|ventless]] before World War I, but today come ventless, with [[Vent (tailoring)|side vents]], or with [[Vent (tailoring)|center vents]]. The [[Vent (tailoring)|ventless]] style is considered more formal, whilst the [[Vent (tailoring)|centre vent]] is the least formal. The [[lapel]]s (traditionally [[Lapel|pointed]] and [[Lapel|shawl]]) are usually faced with silk in either a [[grosgrain]] or a [[satin]] weave, but can also be silk [[barathea]]. According to the Black Tie Guide, the [[Lapel|peaked lapel]] and [[Lapel|shawl collar]] are equally authentic and correct.&lt;ref name="BTG_tuxedo" /&gt; The [[Button (clothing)|button]]s should be covered in similarly coloured material to the main part of the jacket, which would ideally be either self-faced or covered with the same material as the [[lapel]]s. Some higher-end single-breasted jackets, both new and vintage, tend to be fastened with a link front closure which is visually similar to a [[cufflink]]; this method of closure is still common in the United Kingdom.

The [[Pocket|double-besomed jetted]] (slit) hip pocket is the only style understated enough to complement the dinner jacket.  [[Pocket|Flap pockets]] are not considered appropriate for formal attire's refined minimalism due to their busier and bulkier design and are simply an attempt by tuxedo manufacturers to save money by using standard suit patterns (although sometimes they will trim the edges of a flap pocket so that the flap can be tucked in or removed if desired).  [[Pocket|Besom welts]] can be of self fabric or trimmed with the [[lapel]]'s silk facing, though classic menswear scholar Nicholas Antongiavanni suggests that for the English this latter touch "is a sure sign of hired clothes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Suit: A Machiavellian Approach to Men's Style|last=Antongiavanni|first=Nicholas|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2006|isbn=9780060891862|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dinner jacket should also have a [[Pocket|welt breast pocket]] to hold a [[Handkerchief|pocket handkerchief]], which should generally be self-faced rather than covered with silk. 
[[File:Dinner Jacket Link Front Closure.jpg|alt=Dinner jacket link front|thumb|152x152px|An example of a link front style closure of a dinner jacket, featuring [[Grosgrain|silk grosgrain]].]]
[[Emily Post]], a resident of Tuxedo Park, New York, stated in 1909 that "[Tuxedos] can have lapels or be shawl-shaped, in either case they are to have facings of silk, satin or grosgrain." She later republished this statement in her 1922 book ''Etiquette'', adding that only single-breasted jackets are appropriately called ''tuxedos''.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/attire-guide-dress-codes-from-casual-to-white-tie/|title=Attire Guide: Dress Codes from Casual to White Tie|date=|publisher=The Emily Post Institute|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a fashion movement suggesting that a man's appearance when wearing the wider and higher [[Lapel|peak lapel]] is superior to the narrower [[Lapel|notch lapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.indiana.edu/students/activities/barrister/doc/black_tie_101_20110120.pdf|title=Black Tie 101|publisher=Indiana University Bloomington|date= |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ken White dinner jacket.jpg|thumb|right|A white dinner jacket.]]
White dinner jackets are often worn in warm climates. They are [[Ivory (color)|ivory]] in color rather than pure white, and have self-faced lapels (i.e., made of the same fabric as the jacket) rather than silk-faced [[lapel]]s. They are generally worn with the same types of shirts and accessories as black dinner jackets, though the [[Collar (clothing)|turndown collar]] and [[cummerbund]] preferred to the [[Collar (clothing)|wing collar]] or [[waistcoat]]. Similarly, the [[Lapel|shawl lapel]] is more common in white dinner jackets. In the United Kingdom, the 20th-century etiquette was that white dinner jackets are never worn, even on the hottest day of summer, but are reserved for wear abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Classic/Warm_Weather.htm |title=Classic Black Tie: Warm-Weather Black Tie |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, white dinner jackets are frequently seen at [[wedding]]s, formal beach events, and high-school [[prom]]s, in the United States and at some concerts (famously for instance the [[Last night of the proms]]) in the United Kingdom.  In tropical climates, such as in Imperial Burma, desert fawn was historically used as the less formal color. At one time, the (civilian) [[Mess jacket (civil)|mess jacket]] was also an option in warmer climates.

It is generally considered inappropriate for a man to remove his jacket during a formal social event, but when hot weather and humidity dictate, the [[Social rank|ranking]] man (of the [[royal family]], the guest of honor) may give men permission by noticeably taking off his jacket. In anticipated hot weather, [[Red Sea rig]] is specified in the invitation, although this dress is esoteric in civilian circles, and is particular to certain [[expatriate]] communities.

=== Black bow tie ===
Traditionally, the only neck wear appropriate is the black [[bow tie]] that is a self-tie and should always match the [[lapel]] facing of the dinner jacket and braiding of the [[Trousers|trouser]] seams. The [[bow tie]] is tied using a common [[shoelace knot]], which is also called the bow knot for that reason.
Often, members of wedding parties wear pastel bow ties with their dinner suits; this is inappropriate in a black tie context because it dilutes the formal integrity of the outfit, thereby reducing it to a party costume.

=== Trousers ===
[[File:Galon.JPG|alt=Black tie trousers with a side stripe.|thumb|229x229px|Black tie trousers with a side stripe.]]
Black tie [[trousers]] traditionally have no [[Cuff#Trouser cuffs|cuffs]] (turn-ups in British English) or belt loops. The outer seams are usually decorated with a single braid of silk or a material that matches or complements the [[lapel]] facing. Traditionally, [[suspenders|braces (suspenders)]], hidden by the [[waistcoat]], are used to support the trousers. [[Belt (clothing)|Belts]] should not ever be worn with black tie [[trousers]]. Evening [[trousers]] can be flat-fronted or pleated today; pleats first coming into fashion in the 1930s. Whilst flat-fronted trousers are more fashionable at present, pleated trousers may be considered more comfortable by men who have wider hips and a narrow waist.

=== Waist coverings ===
A waist covering should generally be worn as part of a black tie ensemble. Either a low cut [[waistcoat]] or [[cummerbund]] may be worn, but never both at the same time. Although the English authority [[Debrett's]] consider that wearing a [[waistcoat]] is smart, they no longer consider either waist covering to be essential.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Debrett's Handbook|last=Wyse|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Debrett's Limited|year=2015|isbn=978-0-9929348-1-1|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American authority, [[The Emily Post Institute]], considers them to be an essential component of proper black tie attire.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Waist coverings shouldn't be matched to wedding theme colours.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Supplemental/Weddings.htm|title=Black Tie Guide {{!}} Supplemental: Formal Weddings|website=www.blacktieguide.com|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A low cut [[waistcoat]] should be worn when wearing a [[single-breasted]] coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.co.uk/etiquette/special-occasions/dress-codes/black-tie.aspx |title=Special occasions – dress codes – black tie |publisher=Debretts |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[waistcoat]] plays an important part in black tie's refined minimalism by helping to conceal its working parts by discreetly covering the [[Trousers|trouser]]'s exposed waistband and the [[shirt]] bosom's bottom edge. [[Waistcoat|Waistcoasts]] come in the 'V' or rarer 'U' shape, in backless or fully backed versions, [[Double-breasted|double]] or [[Single-breasted|single breasted]], with or without [[lapel]]s. [[Single-breasted|Single breasted]] styles typically have three buttons, and [[Double-breasted|double breasted]] ones three or four rows. Before World War II, while black tie was still gaining acceptance, men would wear a white [[waistcoat]], along with other details now associated primarily with [[white tie]], such as stiff fronted shirts. However, this style, though increasingly viewed as an affectation, is still acceptable in the United States.The [[waistcoat]] should be made from either the same fabric as the dinner jacket (traditional) or the same silk as the jacket's [[lapel]]s (popular). When a [[waistcoat]] has [[lapel]]s, they should be faced in the same silk as those of the jacket; in this case it is considered more refined if the body is made from the same fabric as the jacket. The buttons may be self-faced or covered in the same silk as the [[lapel]]s. Vintage [[waistcoat]]s were sometimes closed with studs made from [[onyx]] or [[Nacre|mother of pearl]], which were often surrounded by a setting of silver or gold.

A [[waistcoat]] is never worn with a [[Double-breasted|double breasted jacket]]. Since this style of jacket is never unbuttoned, the waist of the [[trousers]] is never exposed, and therefore does not need to be covered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Classic/Classic_Waist.htm |title=Classic Black Tie: Waist Coverings |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; though before World War II an edge of [[waistcoat]] was often shown between the jacket and [[shirt]].

==== Cummerbund ====
[[Image:Cummerbund1950.JPG|thumb|Black [[Ottoman (textile)|ottoman]] silk cummerbund.]]
A [[cummerbund]] may be worn with a dinner jacket in lieu of a [[waistcoat]] and, although it is considered slightly less formal, it is equally correct. It looks especially well with a [[Lapel|shawl collar]] dinner jacket but may be worn in conjunction with [[Lapel|peak lapels]]. The material of the [[cummerbund]] should be silk [[satin]], [[grosgrain]] (or faille), or [[barathea]] to match that of the bow tie.  It features upward facing folds, which were originally used to store theatre or opera tickets, and are now considered to be more decorative than functional. Just like the [[waistcoat]], [[cummerbund]]s are not worn with a [[Double-breasted|double breasted jacket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clayton |first=Nicholas |date=21 July 2016 |title=A Butler's Guide to Gentlemen's Grooming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OocDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT117 |publisher=Pavilion Books |isbn=9781849944144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[cummerbund]] is seen as an extension of the trousers, traditionally it should the same colour, i.e. be black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Adlerstein |first=Marion |date=2 April 2007 |title=The Penguin Book Of Etiquette |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwnGDuQIad8C&amp;pg=PT204 |publisher=Penguin UK |isbn=9780857967800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Black Tie Guide'' endorses deep and rich colours as a tasteful way to introduce some colour into an outfit that is otherwise [[Monochrome|monochromatic]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Classic/Classic_Alternatives.htm|title=Black Tie Guide {{!}} Classic Alternatives|website=www.blacktieguide.com|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bright colours, such as those often worn by members of wedding parties, should be avoided&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and the [[bow tie]] must remain black in any case. Some higher quality models feature a hidden pocket and an elastic loop to fasten to the trousers.

=== Shirt ===
[[File:PajaEsmoquinII.JPG|thumb|A modern attached wing collar (of the half-collar shape, with longer wings than a typical attached wing collar) and pre-tied bow tie]]
[[Shirt]]s designed to be worn with black tie are called "formal shirts," or "tuxedo shirts" in American English and "dress shirts" in British English.&lt;ref&gt;Gavernas, Mary Lisa, ''The Fairchild Encyclopedia of Menswear'', Fairchild Publications, New York, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, the shirt is white, has a bibbed front that is either [[Piqué (weaving)|marcella]] or pleated, a turndown collar, and double (or "french") [[cuff]]s.  In the early-20th century, a [[piqué (weaving)|piqué]] shirt with a [[detachable collar|detachable]] wing collar and single cuffs such as is worn with [[white tie]] was used, and in the 1960s and 1970s ruffled bibs were popular, but neither styles are often seen today. The wing collar originally disappeared in black tie after the 1920s when the appropriately [[semi-formal]] attached turndown collar shirt became preferred, but it has been popular with American men in a less substantial, attached form since the 1980s. However, many style authorities argue that the wing collar should remain the domain of white tie for aesthetic reasons. Etiquette maven Miss Manners is one of those who feel that while the bow tie's uncovered band is fine in a white-on-white scheme, “gentlemen with their black ties exposed all around their necks look silly."&lt;ref name="BTG_shirts" /&gt;[[File:Cufflinks and Studs.jpg|alt=Gold and cuff links and shirt studs|left|thumb|255x255px|A vintage set of [[shirt stud]]s and double-sided [[cufflink]]s with a smoke [[Nacre|mother of pearl]] inlay in a [[gold]] setting.]]Although some style authorities consider the [[Collar (clothing)|wing collar]] to be an acceptable option for black tie shirts, they should not be worn with [[Cuff|double cuffs]] or a pleated bib,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dressing the Man|last=Flusser|first=Alan|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-0060191443|location=United States|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are better suited to the more formal single-breasted [[Lapel|peak lapel]] jacket.&lt;ref name="BTG_shirts" /&gt; They should feature a bib that is either [[Piqué (weaving)|marcella]] or [[starch]]ed and include stiff single [[cuff]]s (secured with [[cufflink]]s), made of the same fabric as the bib; this type of shirt is exactly the same as one worn with [[white tie]] attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/White_Tie/White_Tie_Shirt.htm|title=Black Tie Guide {{!}} White Tie: Shirt|website=www.blacktieguide.com|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collar in this case should be tall and stiff, which may be attached or [[Detachable collar|detachable]]. When a full dress shirt is worn in this fashion, it should be accompanied by the white [[Piqué (weaving)|marcella]] [[waistcoat]] ordinarily associated with [[white tie]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Wearing [[white tie]] accessories in this manner is considered by many to be an affectation. [[Debrett's]] do not endorse the [[Collar (clothing)|wing collar]] as being compatible with the black tie dress code.&lt;ref name="DebrettWeb" /&gt;
The more formal [[Piqué (weaving)|marcella]] version of the shirt fastens with matching [[shirt stud]]s. These are most commonly in silver or gold settings, featuring [[onyx]] or [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]]; various geometrical shapes are worn, e.g., circles (most common for [[Shirt stud|studs]]), octagons, or rectangles (most common for [[cufflink]]s).  There has been no consistent fashion preference for gold or silver, but studs with [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] are more formal and therefore often associated with [[white tie]]. The soft-front pleated version of the shirt should be fastened with [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] buttons, typically supplied with the shirt on a separate strip of fabric. Alternatively, a fly-front shirt, appropriate with both the marcella and pleated bibs, conceals the [[placket]] for a more minimalistic look.

There are several types of [[cufflink]]s that may be worn with black tie. The most formal and decorative are the double-panel type, which dress both sides of the cuff and are connected by a chain or link of metal; this model conceals the mechanism by which the cuff is secured. The most common, and least decorative, are the swivel bar type; whilst these are acceptable, they leave the inner side of the cuffs and mechanism exposed which is incongruous with formal dress.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Classic/Classic_Accessories.htm|title=Black Tie Guide {{!}} Classic Accessories|website=www.blacktieguide.com|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Herrenschuh078.jpg|alt=Patent Leather Oxford|thumb|An [[oxford shoe]] in [[patent leather]] worn with [[White tie|evening dress]] or dinner dress.]]

=== Footwear ===
The most formal and traditional shoes are [[patent leather]] opera pumps ([[court shoe]]s) decorated with [[grosgrain]] bows. The more popular alternative currently is the black lace-up [[Oxford shoe]], in [[patent leather]] or [[calfskin]], with a rounded plain toe. [[Brogue shoe|Brogueing]] or any other decorative patterns should never be seen on Black Tie footwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Classic/Classic_Footwear.htm |title=Classic Black Tie: Footwear |publisher=Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matte finish [[Court shoe|pumps]] are also seen.  Shoes are almost invariably black and [[patent leather]] is considered more formal than matte finishes while [[Court shoe|pumps]] are considered more formal than [[Oxford shoe|lace-ups]]. Generally considered too informal for black tie are shoes with open lacing, such as the [[Derby shoe]] (''bluchers'' in American English). Notable alternatives include the black button boot (primarily of historical interest only) and the monogrammed [[Slipper|Albert slipper]] which was originally worn only at home. The black Gucci loafer in leather is also considered as an alternative, especially in urban British settings.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Hosiery is black socks made from fine wool or silk.

=== Accessories ===
[[File:Tuxedo details 2.jpg|right|thumb|Button hole flower with white pocket square.]]
Most etiquette and fashion guides of the current decade recommend keeping color touches and favoring a single color, usually dark; muted reds, such as maroon, are a traditional choice.

'''[[Pocket square|Handkerchief]]:''' A handkerchief in linen (traditional), silk, or cotton is usually worn in the breast pocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Debrett's Handbook|last=Wyse|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Debrett's Limited|year=2015|isbn=978-0-9929348-1-1|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although precedents for tasteful exceptions exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Contemporary/Contemp_Other.htm|title=Black Tie Guide {{!}} Contemporary: Other|website=www.blacktieguide.com|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Handkerchief|pocket squares]] are normally white,&lt;ref name="DebrettWeb" /&gt; and should not match the waist covering or bow tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=A Gentleman Gets Dressed Up|last=Bridges|first=John|last2=Curtis|first2=Bryan|publisher=Rutledge Hill Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1401604714|location=Nashville, Tennessee, United States|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Boutonnière]]:''' A flower may be worn.  Red and white [[Dianthus caryophyllus|carnation]], blue [[cornflower]], and [[rose]]bud have all been popular at times. In [[France]], the boutonnière is usually a [[gardenia]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

'''Outerwear:'''  Black-tie events do not involve outerwear and coats and gloves are no longer considered part of the dress code.  However, etiquette for what to wear in public in transit to and from black tie occasions was stiffer in earlier eras and remain an option:  Matching overcoats are usually black, [[charcoal (color)|charcoal]], or dark [[blue]], and traditionally of the [[Chesterfield coat|Chesterfield]] style. A [[guards coat]] was also once popular, and a lighter topcoat can be worn in summer. Historically, an [[Inverness coat]] was also worn. Until the mid-20th century, gloves and scarves were always worn, and are still occasionally seen in gray leather and white silk, respectively.  White kid gloves have never been standard with black tie, remaining exclusive to white tie dress.

'''Hat:'''  The 20th-century standard hat for black tie was a black (or midnight blue) [[Homburg (hat)|Homburg]] in winter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Classic/Classic_Outerwear.htm|title=Black Tie Guide {{!}} Classic Outerwear|website=www.blacktieguide.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Vintage/Vintage_Outerwear.htm|title=Black Tie Guide {{!}} Vintage: Outerwear|website=www.blacktieguide.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or straw [[Boater (hat)|boater]] in spring and summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Vintage/Vintage_WarmWeather.htm|title=Black Tie Guide {{!}} Vintage: Warm Weather|website=www.blacktieguide.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fedoras were originally regarded as too informal but have become more common recently. Top hats were originally worn with black-tie, but had been reserved to [[white tie]] and [[morning dress]] from World War&amp;nbsp;I.  Black-tie dress does not require a hat today.

[[File:Miniature medals with black tie.png|thumb|Miniature medals with black tie.]]
'''Decorations and orders:''' Military, civil, and organizational [[Order (honour)|decorations]] are usually worn only to [[full dress]] events, generally of formal governmental or diplomatic significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Debrett's Handbook|last=Wyse|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Debrett's Limited|year=2015|isbn=978-0-9929348-1-1|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miniature [[order (decoration)|orders]] and awards are typically worn on the left lapel of the jacket, and neck badges, breast stars, and sashes are worn according to country-specific or organizational regulations. Unlike in [[white tie]], where decorations are always permitted, the dress code will usually give some indication when decorations are to be worn with black tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/Supplemental/Orders,Decorations.htm|title=Black Tie Guide {{!}} Supplemental: Decorations|website=www.blacktieguide.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timepiece:'''  Traditionally visible timepieces are not worn with formal evening dress, because timekeeping is not supposed to be considered a priority. [[Pocket watch]]es are acceptable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Black-tie social occasions ==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 106448 Celebrations at the Belle Vue Hotel, Brisbane, January 1940.jpg|thumb|right|Black tie worn at a dinner party in the 1940s.]]
Black tie is worn to private and public dinners, [[Ball (dance party)|balls]], and parties. At the more formal end of the social spectrum, it has to a large extent replaced the more formal [[white tie]]. The black tie code is sometimes classified as "semi-formal" in contrast to the "formal" white tie, or as "formal" in contrast to the "most formal" of white tie.  Once more common, [[white tie]] dress code is now fairly rare, being reserved for only extremely formal occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cateringonthemove.com.au/guide-to-dress-codes|title=The Ultimate Guide to Choosing a Party Dress Code|work=cateringonthemove.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black tie is traditionally worn only after six o'clock in the evening, or after sundown during winter months.  Black tie's rough daytime equivalent is the [[stroller (style)|stroller]], which is less formal than [[morning dress]] because (as with black tie) it replaces the tailcoat with a [[Suit (clothing)|lounge coat]]. Curiously, in opposition to the trend seen in evening dress, the less formal [[Stroller (style)|stroller]] is now extraordinarily rare, whereas [[morning dress]] is still relatively common.

When the dress code for an event starting at or after 6 o'clock in the evening is described as 'formal' with no further qualification, the invitee may choose to wear either black tie or a dark [[Suit (clothing)|lounge suit]] with a tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emily Post's Etiquette|last=Post|first=Peggy|last2=Post|first2=Lizzie|last3=Post Senning|first3=Daniel|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2011|isbn=978-0-06-174023-7|location=New York|pages=667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, black tie should be worn to the [[opera]] although a dark [[Suit (clothing)|lounge suit]] is also now acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protocolprofessionals.com/tips_opera.htm|title=Protocol Professionals, Inc. - Opera Protocol Tips|work=protocolprofessionals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/etiquette/special-occasions/event-etiquette/opera.aspx|title=Opera Etiquette|work=debretts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century, many opera houses in the English-speaking world do not stipulate black tie.  For example, neither the [[Royal Opera House]] nor the [[Sydney Opera House]] have a black tie [[Western dress codes|dress code]]. Black tie is customary at English country house opera, such as during the summer Festival at [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]].&lt;ref name="DebrettWeb" /&gt;

=== Black tie at weddings ===
[[File:Mixed-couple.jpg|thumb|right|Black tie worn at a wedding]]
In the last few decades, in place of the traditional [[white tie]] or [[morning dress]], black tie has been increasingly seen in the United States at formal day [[wedding]]. However, etiquette and clothing experts continue to discourage or condemn the wearing of black tie as too informal for weddings, or any event before 7 p.m.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ford |first1=Charlotte |last2=DeMontravel |first2=Jacqueline |date=2001 |title=21st century etiquette: a guide to manners for the modern age |location= |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |page=210 |isbn=978-1-56731-629-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as by [[Emily Post]] (1872-1960) and [[Amy Vanderbilt]] (1908-1974), the latter arguing that "no man should ever be caught in a church in a tuxedo."

In the [[United Kingdom]] and the rest of [[Europe]], although a minority accepts black tie at evening [[Wedding reception|receptions]], including some [[Jewish wedding]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/weddings/bridal-and-dress-codes/dress-codes/male-dress-codes|title=Male Dress Codes|work=debretts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is seldom worn at church weddings or civil ceremonies where instead [[white tie]], [[morning dress]] or a [[Suit (clothing)|lounge suit]] is normally favoured. In some places, local variations of white tie etiquette may traditionally be worn, such as [[highland dress]] in [[Scotland]].

== Corresponding forms of dress ==

=== Mess dress ===
{{Main|Mess dress}}
For formal dining, [[uniformed services]] [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s often wear [[mess dress]] equivalents to the civilian black tie and evening dress. Mess uniforms may vary according to the wearers' respective branches of the armed services, regiments, or corps, but usually include a short Eton-style coat reaching to the waist. Some include white shirts, black bow ties, and low-cut waistcoats, while others feature high collars that fasten around the neck and corresponding high-gorge waistcoats.  Some nations' armed services have black tie and white tie equivalent variants in their mess dress.

=== Red Sea Rig ===
{{Main|Red Sea rig}}
In tropical areas, primarily in Western diplomatic and expatriate communities, [[Red Sea rig]] is sometimes worn, in which the jacket and waistcoat are omitted and a red [[cummerbund]] and trousers with red piping are worn instead.

=== Scottish Highland dress ===
{{Main|Highland dress}}
[[File:David McLeod.JPG|upright|thumb|Formal black tie Highland regalia, [[kilt]] and [[Prince Charlie jacket]]]]
Scottish Highland dress is often worn to black- and white-tie occasions, especially at Scottish reels and [[céilidh|ceilidhs]]; the black-tie version is more common, even at white-tie occasions. Traditionally, black-tie Scots Highland dress comprises:

* Black, or other solid colour, barathea jacket with silver buttons — Regulation [[Doublet (clothing)|Doublet]], Prince Charlie (coatee), Brian Boru, Braemar, and black mess jackets are suitable. There is some contention about whether the Duke of Montrose and Sheriffmuir doublets are too formal for black-tie occasions. The Argyll jacket is a popular alternative choice; however, it should be worn with a three button waistcoat rather than the five button vest. 
* Miniature medals (if authorized)
* Matching or tartan waistcoat
* [[Kilt]]
* White shirt with shirt studs, French or barrel cuffs, and a turn-down collar (wing collars are generally reserved for [[white tie]] in the United Kingdom)
* Black bow tie or white lace [[jabot (neckwear)|jabot]]
* Evening dress [[brogues]]
* Full-dress kilt hose (diced, tartan or off-white)
* Silk flashes or garter ties
* [[Sporran|Dress sporran]] with silver chain
* Black, silver-mounted [[sgian dubh]]
* [[Dirk]] (optional)
* Highland bonnet with crest badge (only suitable out of doors)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Traditional black-tie Lowland dress is a variant of the normal black tie that includes tartan [[trews]] rather than the usual trousers and may include a suitable kilt jacket instead of the dinner jacket. Trews are often worn in summer and warm climes.

'''''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons''''', often referred to as '''''Captain Scarlet''''', is a 1960s British science-fiction television series produced by the [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Productions]] company of [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]], [[John Read (producer)|John Read]] and [[Reg Hill]]. First broadcast on [[ATV Midlands]] from September 1967&lt;ref name="Bentley, 118" /&gt; to May 1968,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 90"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; it has since been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 119" /&gt; Characters are presented as [[marionette]] puppets alongside [[scale model]] sets and [[special effects]] in a filming technique that the Andersons termed "[[Supermarionation]]". This technology incorporated [[solenoid]] motors as a means of [[Lip sync|synchronising]] the puppet's lip movements with pre-recorded dialogue.

Set in 2068,&lt;ref group="e" name="The Mysterons" /&gt; ''Captain Scarlet'' presents the hostilities between [[Earth]] and a race of [[Martian]]s known as the [[Mysteron]]s. After human astronauts attack their city on [[Mars]] due to a misunderstanding, the vengeful Mysterons declare war on Earth,&lt;ref group="e" name="The Mysterons" /&gt; initiating a series of reprisals that are countered by Spectrum, a worldwide security organisation. Spectrum boasts the extraordinary abilities of its primary agent, [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]]. In the [[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|first episode]], Scarlet acquires the Mysteron healing factor of "retro-[[metabolism]]" and is thereafter considered to be virtually "indestructible", being able to recover fully from injuries that would normally be fatal.&lt;ref group="e" name="Winged Assassin" /&gt;

''Captain Scarlet'', the eighth of ten puppet series that the Andersons produced during the 1950s and 1960s, was preceded by ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and followed by ''[[Joe 90]]'' and ''[[The Secret Service]]''. In terms of visual aesthetic, the series represented a departure from ''Thunderbirds'' on account of its use of non-[[caricature]]d puppets sculpted in [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] proportions.&lt;ref name="HowsWhys" /&gt; Re-run a number of times in the UK&lt;ref name="Bentley, 119" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 122" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 125" /&gt; and purchased by the BBC in 1993,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 122" /&gt; the 32-episode series has entailed tie-in merchandise since its first appearance, from dolls&lt;ref name="Marketing" /&gt; to original novels&lt;ref name="Titles" /&gt; and [[comic strip]]s in the [[Century 21 Publications]] children's magazine, ''[[TV Century 21]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 102" /&gt;

In comparison to ''Thunderbirds'' and other earlier series, ''Captain Scarlet'' is generally considered "darker"&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; in tone and less suited to child audiences due to stronger on-screen violence and themes of extraterrestrial aggression and [[interplanetary war]].&lt;ref name="Lesterdemon" /&gt; The transition in the puppets' design has polarised critical opinion and drawn a mixed response from former production staff,&lt;ref name="CrimeTV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peel, 244" /&gt; while the concept of an indestructible protagonist has also been called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Sangster and Condon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peel, 246"/&gt;  However, the series has been praised for its inclusion of a multinational, multiethnic puppet cast and its depiction of a [[utopia]]n future Earth.&lt;ref name="Bould, 219" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bould, 220" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WomenInSpace" /&gt; Having decided to revive the series in the late 1990s,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 123" /&gt; Gerry Anderson supervised the production of a computer-animated [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], ''[[Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet]]'', which was broadcast in the UK in 2005.

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episodes}}

In the [[The Mysterons|first episode]], a team of ''[[Zero-X]]''&lt;ref group="n" name="Zero-X"&gt;The ''[[Zero-X]]'' and its lander craft, the Martian Exploration Vehicle (MEV), appear in the first ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' film, ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]''. Production documentation from ''Captain Scarlet'' confirms that the MEV that appears in "[[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|The Mysterons]]" is the same vehicle, which places this series in the same [[fictional universe]] as ''Thunderbirds'' (Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;59), set in 2065. Spectrum personnel biographies in Bentley's ''The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet'' also place the events of ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' (set in 2064) and ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' (set in 2063) in this universe (Bentley 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;46–47, 50).&lt;/ref&gt; astronauts investigate the surface of [[Mars]] in 2068 after unidentified radio signals emanating from the planet are detected on Earth.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Mysterons"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Mysterons|episodelink=The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]]. Directed by [[Desmond Saunders]]|airdate=29 September 1967}} Episode 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The source is discovered to be an extraterrestrial base, which is attacked and destroyed when the explorers mistake a harmless sensor device for a weapon.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Mysterons" /&gt; The inhabitants of the settlement, the [[Mysteron]]s, are [[sentient]] computers that form a [[Group mind (science fiction)|collective consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 43" /&gt; They are the remnants of the original Mysteron race, extraterrestrial life forms that originated in a galaxy other than the Milky Way and maintained their colony on Mars for 3,500 years before abandoning the planet at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 43" /&gt; Possessing partial control over matter, the Mysteron computers draw on their power of "reversing matter" to rebuild the complex before vowing revenge for the unwarranted aggression.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Mysterons" /&gt;

Reversing matter, also described as "retro-metabolism",&lt;ref group="e" name="Winged Assassin"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Winged Assassin|episodelink=Winged Assassin|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by [[Tony Barwick]]. Directed by [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]]|airdate=6 October 1967}} Episode 2.&lt;/ref&gt; allows the Mysterons to re-create the likeness of a person or object in the form of a facsimile that is under their control. This ability is used to conduct a "war of nerves" against Earth, in which the Mysterons issue threats against specific targets (from world leaders and [[military installation]]s to whole cities and continents) and then destroy and reconstruct whatever instruments are required (whether human or object) to execute their plans. The presence of the Mysterons is indicated by two circles of green light (the "Mysteron rings") that trail across scenes of destruction and reconstruction. Although the Mysterons are able to manipulate events from Mars, their actions on Earth are usually performed by their replicated intermediaries.

''Zero-X'' mission leader [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]], who ordered the attack on the base, becomes the Mysterons' primary agent when they seize control of his mind during the encounter on Mars.&lt;ref group="n" name="CBMysteronisation"&gt;The transformation of [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] from human to Mysteron is indicated by a paling of the character's face and a deepening of his voice to match that of the Mysterons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 43"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 47"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the events of the series, Captain Black held a senior officer rank in Spectrum, an international security organisation inaugurated in 2067&lt;ref group="e" name="Flight to Atlantica"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Flight to Atlantica|episodelink=Flight to Atlantica|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by Tony Barwick. Directed by Leo Eaton|airdate=30 April 1968}} Episode 30.&lt;/ref&gt; that mobilises all its personnel, vehicles,&lt;ref group="n" name="Vehicles"&gt;[[Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle]]s (SPV) and [[Fictional military aircraft#Angel Interceptor|Angel Interceptor]] fighter aircraft are two of a number of vehicles that Spectrum has at its disposal. The [[Spectrum Patrol Car]] (or Saloon Car, acronym either SPC of SSC) is used for unarmed land travel, while the Maximum Security Vehicle (MSV) and Yellow Fox, an unmarked security transport disguised as a fuel tanker, are used to protect [[Mysteron]] targets. Additional aircraft include the Spectrum Passenger Jet, the two-seater Spectrum Helicopter and the Magnacopter for transporting larger numbers of passengers.&lt;/ref&gt; and other resources in response to the threat posed by the Mysterons. The Spectrum Organisation is directed from [[Cloudbase]], an airborne headquarters stationed at a height of 40,000&amp;nbsp;feet above the Earth's surface,&lt;ref group="e" name="Dangerous Rendezvous"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Dangerous Rendezvous|episodelink=Dangerous Rendezvous|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by Tony Barwick. Directed by Brian Burgess|airdate=9 February 1968}} Episode 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and has a presence in all major cities. The organisation employs operatives of many nationalities, of whom the most senior hold military ranks and colour-based codenames, are posted to Cloudbase, and answer directly to the [[commander-in-chief]] of Spectrum, [[Colonel White]].&lt;ref group="n" name="CallSigns"&gt;In communications, Spectrum personnel use the call signal "SIG" ("'''S'''pectrum '''I'''s '''G'''reen") as their affirmative code. The negative, "SIR" ("'''S'''pectrum '''I'''s '''R'''ed"), is used less often.&lt;/ref&gt; Cloudbase is defended by the Angels, a squadron of five female pilots code-named Destiny (squadron leader), Harmony, Melody, Rhapsody, and Symphony, who fly the [[Fictional military aircraft#Angel Interceptor|Angel Interceptor]] fighter aircraft. In addition, the organisation incorporates a fleet of [[Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle]]s (SPV) hidden in secret locations around the world as well as Spectrum Patrol Saloon Cars, hovercraft, transport jets and machine-gun equipped helicopters.

[[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] becomes Spectrum's foremost weapon in its fight against the Mysterons after the events of the first episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the [[World government in science fiction|World President]]&lt;ref group="n" name="Politics"&gt;In the fictional universe of ''Captain Scarlet,'' power from many individual nations has been vested in a [[World government in science fiction|World Government]], which is headed by an elected World President and operates its own military and security forces. Spectrum is a unified operation established to provide a more efficient service than these separate bodies, since it is not hindered by interdepartmental red-tape (Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;43).&lt;/ref&gt; as their first act of retaliation.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Mysterons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 44"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Captain Scarlet is killed in a car accident engineered by the Mysterons&lt;ref group="n" name="MysteronPresence"&gt;For the first episode exclusively, different techniques are used to indicate the Mysteron influence: in place of the Mysteron rings, the destroyed complex on Mars is reconstructed by a beam of blue light, while the deaths of the original [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] and [[Captain Brown (Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons)|Captain Brown]] are preceded by a transition from a full-colour picture to a blue [[monochrome]]. The rings make their first appearance in the second episode, "[[Winged Assassin]]."&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Mysterons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 44" /&gt; However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]] and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the conscience and personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control.&lt;ref group="n" name="CSBiography"&gt;When killed, Mysteron reconstructions are normally permanently destroyed. The one exception to this is Captain Scarlet, who can die and subsequently revive. The character's biography in ''The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet'' states that the Mysterons intended their duplicate of Captain Scarlet to be "indestructible," in contrast with their other reconstructions of deceased humans (Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;44).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="Survival"&gt;In the original pilot script for "The Mysterons", Captain Scarlet's revival, as well as the restoration of his original conscience, is due to the aid of an advanced computer (Bentley, p. 15). In the finished episode, he returns to life naturally, and no explanation is provided as to how he regains the conscience and personality of his pre-Mysteronised form. However, the tie-in EP ''Introducing Captain Scarlet'' indicates that after his revival, Scarlet's memories and loyalty to Spectrum are restored using Doctor Fawn's advanced computer, as in the original episode script (Bentley 2001, p. 94).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="e" name="The Mysterons" /&gt; Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity,&lt;ref group="n" name="CSPowers"&gt;Scarlet demonstrates this ability in the episodes "Winged Assassin" (production number: 2), "[[Point 783]]" (production number: 5) and "[[Seek and Destroy (Captain Scarlet)|Seek and Destroy]]" (production number: 9), but no others. From the episode "[[Spectrum Strikes Back]]" (production number: 10), Captain Scarlet is apparently unaware of the presence of Mysteron agents when near to them. He demonstrates an ability to sense the presence of Mysteron agents in the five [[Extended play|EP]] records, and in the novel ''Captain Scarlet and the Silent Saboteur''.&lt;/ref&gt; and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he will recover to face the Mysterons again.&lt;ref group="n" name="BrownIndigo"&gt;During the course of the series, two other Spectrum officers are killed and reconstructed by the Mysterons in addition to Captain Scarlet and Captain Black, but their likenesses do not appear to possess the power of retro-metabolism: Captain Brown in "The Mysterons" (who explodes in proximity to, and almost assassinates, the World President in that episode) and [[Captain Indigo]] in "Spectrum Strikes Back" (who is permanently destroyed by the Mysteron Gun).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Captain Scarlet and Spectrum defend Earth against the threat from Mars, it is found that Mysteron reconstructions are particularly vulnerable to electricity&lt;ref group="e" name="Operation Time"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Operation Time|episodelink=Operation Time|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by Richard Conway and Stephen J. Mattick. Directed by [[Ken Turner (director)|Ken Turner]]|airdate=17 November 1967}} Episode 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they are detectable on X-rays, to which their biology is impervious.&lt;ref group="e" name="Operation Time" /&gt; Consequently, two anti-Mysteron devices, the "Mysteron Gun"&lt;ref group="n" name="Killing"&gt;In "Spectrum Strikes Back," a line of dialogue from Captain Scarlet states that the Mysteron Gun "is the only gun that kills a Mysteron." The gun, which fires lethal beams of electrons, does not appear in any other episodes, although a similar weapon, the Electro-Ray Rifle, appears in the tie-in EP ''Captain Scarlet versus Captain Black''. Episodes both preceding and following "Spectrum Strikes Back" portray Mysteron agents as being vulnerable to conventional means of destruction, such as explosions (an example of which is in the 11th-produced episode, "[[Avalanche (Captain Scarlet)|Avalanche]]") or bullets (of which there are many examples, including the 12th-produced episode, "[[Shadow of Fear]]").&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Mysteron Detector," are developed to aid Spectrum.&lt;ref group="e" name="Spectrum Strikes Back"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Spectrum Strikes Back|episodelink=Spectrum Strikes Back|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by Tony Barwick.

==Production==
[[File:Gerry Anderson.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gerry Anderson]], creator and executive producer|alt=The photograph depicts an elderly man, whose gaze is directed to the right of the camera.]]

When talks to find an American broadcaster for ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' fell through in July 1966, production for the series' second season ended with the completion of just six episodes at the behest of [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] financier [[Lew Grade]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 13"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; Having overseen [[Gerry Anderson]]'s work since the creation of ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'' in 1960 – and going on to buy his production company, [[AP Films]], during the making of ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' – Grade was enthusiastic for Anderson's programmes to be transmitted abroad, in the lucrative American market, and decided that a new concept would do more to attract potential bidders than a second season of ''Thunderbirds''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 13" /&gt;

As a result of the cancellation, Anderson was required to come up with an idea for another [[Supermarionation]] series. He had once been inspired by the thought of creating a live-action police drama in which the hero would have unexpectedly been murdered halfway through the series and replaced by a new lead character.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 14"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; Now giving fresh consideration to this idea, Anderson resolved that a selling point for his new series could be a character that can be killed at the end of each episode and resurrected by the beginning of the next. This, coupled with contemporary theories about the possibility of [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]],&lt;ref name="Bentley, 5"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; led to the idea of an [[interplanetary war]] raging between Earth and its neighbour and a worldwide security organisation being called on to defend human civilisation. After further thought, Anderson decided that "[[Captain Scarlet (character)|Scarlet]]" would make an unusual codename for this organisation's "indestructible" agent who can come back to life, while "[[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Blue]]" could be his partner's designation. From this, Anderson reasoned that all the personnel should have colours for names so as to form the whole "Spectrum" of colours, and decided that someone called "[[Colonel White|White]]" should be the leader of the Spectrum Organisation, much in the same way that [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation .28light.29|white light]] is composed of, and can be [[Dispersive prism|broken down into]], the colours of the [[spectrum]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Gerry Anderson|Anderson, Gerry]]|date=2001|title=''"[[Attack on Cloudbase]]": Audio commentary''|medium=DVD|publisher=Carlton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=I thought we should make a show about the [[Martian]]s, but then there were doubts being expressed by scientists as to whether the so-called [[Martian canal|"canals" on Mars]] were really man-made. Since we were well into pre-production, I came up with the idea of making the Martians invisible, so if they did come up with conclusive evidence that there was no [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]], I could say, "Ha-ha, yes there is – but you can't see it."|salign=right|source=–&amp;nbsp;[[Gerry Anderson]] (2002)&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A&amp;E's ''Captain Scarlet'' Re-Releases will be Red-Hot|first=Jim|last=Bessman|date=6 July 2002|journal=Billboard|volume=114|issue=27|page=56|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]]|issn=0006-2510|oclc=421998067}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=22.5%|align=left}}

Intrigued by the often-heard phrase "[[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|life as we know it]]", Anderson wanted to set the aliens of his new series apart from the conventional extraterrestrials of 1960s television and cinema. He therefore worked from a basis of "life as we ''don't'' know it",&lt;ref name="Bentley, 5" /&gt; and made the [[Mysteron]]s that were to feature in the series a race of [[sentient]] computers as opposed to organic lifeforms,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 43" /&gt; although this is not explicitly stated in the television episodes. The initial intention was that the original Mysteron civilisation came from another galaxy.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 43" /&gt; Having established a settlement on [[Mars]] in the distant past, they fled the planet centuries later, abandoning their computer complex.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 43" /&gt;

Contemporary recollections of the Second World War proved to be an inspiration for a number of design aspects. For instance, Anderson recalled that [[RAF]] pilots had found it difficult to counter German attacks during the [[Battle of Britain]], since taking off from the ground meant that it took considerable time to intercept the enemy.&lt;ref name="Teletronic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcus|first=Laurence|title=Gerry Anderson: The Puppet Master – Part 3|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson3.htm|work=teletronic.co.uk|date=October 2005|accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221150836/http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson3.htm|archivedate=21 February 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore made Spectrum's headquarters an [[airborne aircraft carrier]] called "[[Cloudbase]]".&lt;ref name="Teletronic" /&gt; The Mysteron rings were inspired by an advertisement for the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] line of food products, which included an image of the brand name sliding over a frying pan and the outline of a woman's body.&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic" /&gt;

===Writing===
With a provisional series title of ''The Mysterons'',&lt;ref name="Bentley, 15"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson and his wife, [[Sylvia Anderson|Sylvia]], wrote a pilot script in August 1966.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 7"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; This differed significantly from the final draft of the [[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|first episode]]. Initially, it was decided that the [[Mysteron]] duplicate of [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] would be artificially resurrected by an advanced Spectrum computer rather than reviving naturally, and that thereafter he would no longer be truly human but a "mechanical man" akin to an [[Android (robot)|android]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 15" /&gt; Another early ambition was for each episode to feature a guest star voiced by a well-known actor of the day. To this end, the role of the [[World government in science fiction|World President]] in the first episode was originally intended to be voiced by the American-born actor [[Patrick McGoohan]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 17"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer, 38"&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Anderson serving chiefly as [[executive producer]], the majority of the writing input for ''Captain Scarlet'' was provided by [[Tony Barwick]], who had previously written for the short-lived second season of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 31"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally given the role of [[script editor]], Barwick went on to pen 18 of the 32 episodes himself, and was also often required to make substantial changes to other writers' work.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 31" /&gt; While discussing his approach to writing episodes in a 1986 interview, he drew parallels between the premise and characters of ''Captain Scarlet'' and those of ''Thunderbirds'', suggesting, for example, that Spectrum was similar to International Rescue and that the character of [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] was like the earlier recurring villain from ''Thunderbirds'', [[The Hood (Thunderbirds)|The Hood]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 31" /&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Dinky Toys 104 Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle-Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.jpg|thumb|[[Dinky Toys]] version of the [[Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle]] (SPV), the primary [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armoured assault vehicle]] of Spectrum. The [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21]] special effects unit had refined its standard driving mechanism so that [[scale-model]] vehicles appearing in ''Captain Scarlet'' could produce authentic [[inertia]]l dips.&lt;ref name="HowsWhys"/&gt;|alt=The photograph depicts a scale toy replica of an armoured tank-like vehicle that is metallic-blue in colour, with five wheels on each side.]]

After a two-month [[pre-production]] period lasting from November to December 1966, filming on the first episode, "[[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|The Mysterons]]", began on 2 January 1967,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 22"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt; with a budget of £1.5&amp;nbsp;million for the 32-episode series.&lt;ref name="Teletronic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TVHeaven"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marcus|first1=Laurence|last2=Hulse|first2=Stephen|title=''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'': A Television Heaven Review|url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/scarlet.htm|work=televisionheaven.co.uk|year=2000|accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629052514/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/scarlet.htm|archivedate=29 June 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an average cost of £46,000 per episode, or £2,000 per minute, it was the most expensive Anderson production to date.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 119"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; A month before, Anderson and his team had dropped the name "AP Films," since Arthur Provis was no longer working alongside Anderson on a full-time basis, and renamed their company "[[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Productions]]".&lt;ref name="Bentley, 22" /&gt; Many of the directors for earlier Anderson series, such as Alan Pattillo, [[David Elliott (director)|David Elliott]] and [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]], had either left AP Films or were involved in the production of ''[[Thunderbird 6]],'' the second ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' feature film, at the time that ''Captain Scarlet'' was being produced. Although [[Desmond Saunders]] and Lane were available to direct the first and second episodes, while veteran AP Films director Brian Burgess also contributed, the Andersons needed to transfer some of the more junior production personnel to replace the outgoing staff. To this effect, Alan Perry and [[Ken Turner (director)|Ken Turner]] were promoted from the camera operator and [[art department]]s.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 32"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt; Directors drafted in from outside AP Films were Peter Anderson, Leo Eaton and finally [[Robert Lynn (director)|Robert Lynn]], who had worked as an [[assistant director]] on the 1958 [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] films ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' and ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]].''&lt;ref name="Bentley, 32" /&gt;

The [[Slough Trading Estate]]&lt;ref group="l" name="Slough"&gt;[[Slough Trading Estate]]: {{Coord|51.5244|-0.6250|type:landmark_region:GB-NWP|name=Slough Trading Estate, Slough, Berkshire|format=dms}} (principal photography and editing)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Buckinghamshire]] had served as Anderson's production base since the filming of ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' in 1964.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 12"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; To accelerate production on earlier [[Supermarionation]] series, pairs of episodes had been filmed simultaneously on separate [[sound stage]]s, a practice that continued for ''Captain Scarlet''. Some filming coincided with the production of ''Thunderbird 6'',&lt;ref name="Bentley, 31" /&gt; which was recorded on a separate puppet stage and released in July 1968. Editing rooms, [[post-production]] offices and a preview theatre were housed in a separate building on the Slough Trading Estate; the crew collaborated with the [[Standard Telecommunication Laboratories]] at [[Harlow]] in [[Essex]]&lt;ref group="l" name="Harlow"&gt;[[Standard Telecommunication Laboratories]]: {{Coord|51.779|0.128|type:landmark_region:GB-NWP|name=Standard Telecommunication Laboratories, Harlow, Essex|format=dms}} ("electronic collaboration")&lt;/ref&gt; on the technical and electronic side of the production.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 57"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third unit, headed by [[Derek Meddings]] and his assistant [[Mike Trim]], handled [[special effect]]s and [[Scale model|miniatures]] and was tasked with creating all the permanent sets and models to be used from the first episode, such as the [[Cloudbase]] interiors and scaled-down [[Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle]]s. A design innovation for this series meant that the noses of the miniature vehicles would "dip" when stopped, to imitate the sudden application of brakes and deceleration on a real-life vehicle.&lt;ref name="HowsWhys"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wickes |first=Simon |title=The Hows and Whys of Supermarionation – Part 4 |url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81 |work=tvcentury21.com |date=29 December 2003 |accessdate=26 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717115311/http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81 |archivedate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The miniature of the Cloudbase exterior, which ran to six&amp;nbsp;feet (1.8&amp;nbsp;m) in length, proved to be too heavy to be held up with strings and was instead supported by a metal pole.&lt;ref name="Archer, 23"&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 21"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; To transfer the [[Mysteron]] rings from script to screen, the production team acted on the advice of producer [[Reg Hill]], who suggested that a [[Reversal film|transparency]] be made that could be panned across the puppet sets using a slide projector.&lt;ref name="DVDCommentary" /&gt;

By the time the series started broadcasting on [[Associated Television|ATV]] in September 1967, [[principal photography]] had been completed for the first 20 episodes.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 41"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, turnaround for completing all the puppet shots for each episode was two weeks&lt;ref name="TVHeaven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 34"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; or 11 working days.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 119" /&gt; It was originally predicted that shooting would be wrapped within eight months,&lt;ref name="TVHeaven" /&gt; but filming overran until late October due to the demands of the ''Thunderbird 6'' shoot.&lt;ref name="TVHeaven" /&gt; While production on the next Supermarionation series, {{Nowrap|''[[Joe 90]]''}}, began in November&lt;ref name="Bentley, 114"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until early 1968 that the last episodes of ''Captain Scarlet'' were edited and completed for broadcast.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 41" /&gt;

===Music===

Music for ''Captain Scarlet'' was composed by [[Barry Gray]], an innovator in [[electronic music]], who had scored all the [[Supermarionation]] series preceding it. The opening [[title sequence]] theme, "The Mysterons", was rendered electronically and accompanied by a [[staccato]] drum beat to introduce the lead character of [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 40"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt; This seven-note beat was also used to link scenes within episodes,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 40" /&gt; and to cut to [[Television advertisement|advertisement breaks]],&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 156"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;156.&lt;/ref&gt; for which it was accompanied by a zooming image of the Spectrum logo as designed by Tony Dunsterville of the [[art department]].&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 156" /&gt; On the subject of the beat, Anderson recalls, "When I went to the recording session, I heard the drum beat he had come up with and I thought, 'Christ, is this all he could produce?' Looking back on it, however, I can see that what he came up with worked very well."&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 156" /&gt;

The [[closing credits]] theme, "Captain Scarlet", underwent significant change after the completion of the first 14 episodes. The first version had been mainly instrumental, with the words "Captain Scarlet!" sung in time to the aforementioned staccato drum beat after which a [[vocoded]] repetition of the words "Captain Scarlet!" provided by Gray himself would be heard.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 40" /&gt; This was then revised as a song performed by a London-based pop group The Spectrum, assembled by [[RCA Victor]]&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 157"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt; as an imitation of the American band [[The Monkees]],&lt;ref name="Bentley, 40" /&gt; who happened to share their name with the organisation that appears in ''Captain Scarlet''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 40" /&gt;

In addition to the main theme, Gray scored [[incidental music]] for 18 episodes of ''Captain Scarlet'' between March and December 1967.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TVCentury21"&gt;{{cite web |last=de Klerk |first=Theo |title=Complete Studio-Recording List of Barry Gray |url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67:complete-studio-recording-list-of-barry-gray&amp;catid=116:barry-grey&amp;Itemid=182 |work=tvcentury21.com |date=25 December 2003 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m00eATOK?url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67:complete-studio-recording-list-of-barry-gray&amp;catid=116:barry-gray&amp;Itemid=182 |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical accompaniment for the remaining 14 episodes was achieved by re-using these completed tracks as well as music from previous Anderson productions such as ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 41" /&gt; In composing his incidental music, Gray made extensive use of two contrasting, yet similar, themes to illustrate Spectrum and the [[Mysteron]]s.&lt;ref name="Soundtrack"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Captain Scarlet: Original Television Soundtrack|others=[[Barry Gray]]|year=2003|author1=Titterton, Ralph |author2=Mallett, Tim |page= 3|publisher=Silva Screen Records|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their notes to the soundtrack release, Ralph Titterton and Tim Mallett suggest that the music is dominated by a "[[Military band|military]] feel", with an emphasis placed on percussion, [[Brass instrument|brass]] and wind instruments, by contrast to the full [[orchestra]]l sound of the ''Thunderbirds'' score.&lt;ref name="Soundtrack" /&gt; With the exception of the four-note Mysteron [[Motif (music)|motif]], Gray generally restricted his use of electronic synthesisers, including an [[Ondes Martenot]], to space sequences, preferring traditional instruments for [[Earth]]-bound action.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 40" /&gt; Captain Scarlet's motif, heard in both versions of the end credits theme and the incidental music, is a [[Variation (music)|melodic variation]] on the Mysteron theme, emphasising Scarlet's history as an ex-Mysteron.&lt;ref name="ImageDissectors"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weedon |first=Robert |title=Spectrum is Green |url=http://www.imagedissectors.com/article/69 |work=imagedissectors.com |date=20 February 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qO9TFvZH?url=http://www.imagedissectors.com/article/69 |archivedate=10 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awarding the soundtrack CD release a rating of four stars out of five,&lt;ref name="Allmusic" /&gt; Bruce Eder of the website [[AllMusic]] describes the collection of theme and incidental music as "a strange mix of otherworldly '[[music of the spheres]]', late-50s/early-60s '[[Space age pop|space-age pop]]', '[[British Invasion]]' beat, Scottish [[Folk music|folk]]-inspired tunes, kids-style '[[Mickey Mouse]]' scoring, martial music, light [[jazz]], and light [[Classical music|classical]]",&lt;ref name="Allmusic" /&gt; and singles out both "Cocktail Music", from "[[Model Spy]]", and the piano track, performed by Gray, from "[[The Inquisition (Captain Scarlet)|The Inquisition]]", for particular praise.&lt;ref name="Allmusic" /&gt; In his [[BBC Online]] review, Peter Marsh opines that the darker tone of the music is reflective of ''Captain Scarlet'' as a programme featuring realistic puppets and death,&lt;ref name="BBCReview" /&gt; frightening alien villains&lt;ref name="BBCReview" /&gt; and "no laughs",&lt;ref name="BBCReview" /&gt; stating that "dissonant [[vibraphone]] chords shimmer under hovering, tremulous strings contrasted with urgent, [[militaristic]] drums and pulsing brass – driving the action ever onto its climax (and, no doubt, a big explosion)."&lt;ref name="BBCReview" /&gt;

In October 2015, [[Fanderson]] released a 3-disc set exclusively for club members. It contains music either written for, or used in, all but three episodes ("[[The Heart of New York (Captain Scarlet)|The Heart of New York]]" and "[[Treble Cross]]" contain no original music and the cue recordings for "[[Traitor (Captain Scarlet)|Traitor]]" are lost).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fanderson.org.uk/gerryandersonnews/2015/09/captain-scarlet-soundtrack-cd-now-on-sale/|title=''Captain Scarlet'' Soundtrack CD Now On Sale!|date=27 September 2015|work=fanderson.org.uk|publisher=[[Fanderson]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112175719/http://fanderson.org.uk/gerryandersonnews/2015/09/captain-scarlet-soundtrack-cd-now-on-sale/|archivedate=12 November 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CaptainScarletPuppets.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=30|250px|Changes made to the original [[Supermarionation]] design made puppet motion more stilted than before.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 203" /&gt; To portray a walk, an operator would need to hold the puppet's legs, while the camera maintained a [[close-up]] shot to conceal the hand from view.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16" /&gt; This clip from the episode "[[Attack on Cloudbase]]" has an interruption in the shot when the characters of Captains [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Scarlet]] and [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Blue]] are required to step through a door into the [[Cloudbase]] Radar Room to talk to Captain Magenta, since the strings supporting the puppet heads made it impossible to film such entrances in a continuous shot.&lt;ref name="HowsWhys" /&gt; Through the characters of Scarlet and [[Colonel White]], whose English accents are demonstrated, Marcus Hearn and Simon Archer argue that the impression that ''Captain Scarlet'' leaves on viewers differs from that of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169" /&gt;|alt=Video clip from "Attack on Cloudbase" demonstrating the difficulties of inducing realistic motion in the puppet characters of "Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons". Whenever a character is required to move, the camera shifts to a close-up angle to conceal the hand of a puppeteer pushing the puppet forward. The shot is interrupted when Captains Scarlet and Blue walk into a room through an automatic door as it was impossible to film the action in a single motion.]]

Supermarionation, a technique in which the movement of the [[marionette]] puppet's mouth is electronically [[Lip sync|synchronised]] with character dialogue, had been formulated by [[Gerry Anderson]] for ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'' in 1960. Until production for ''Captain Scarlet'', the head of the puppet had been disproportionately large in comparison to its body, as the head contained a [[solenoid]] that formed the key component of the lip-synch mechanism. The production team was not able to scale up the body to match the head, as this would have made the puppets hard to operate&lt;ref name="ToonhoundEntry"&gt;{{cite web|title= Captain Scarlet |url= http://www.toonhound.com/captainscarlet.htm|work=toonhound.com|accessdate=26 November 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080503021338/http://www.toonhound.com/captainscarlet.htm|archivedate=3 May 2008| deadurl =no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have necessitated a proportionate scaling-up in the size of the puppet sets.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;151.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Gerry Anderson had expressed frustration with this [[caricature]]d design during the production of earlier Supermarionation series, and wished that the puppets would more accurately reflect human biology,&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151" /&gt; before production commenced on ''Captain Scarlet'' the producer, [[Reg Hill]], and his associate, [[John Read (producer)|John Read]],&lt;ref name = "Drake and Bassett, 203"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;203.&lt;/ref&gt; designed a new type of puppet in which the solenoid was instead placed inside the chest, to permit a head of realistic proportion.&lt;ref name="HowsWhys" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "TVHeaven" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ToonhoundEntry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Puppets"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wickes |first=Simon |title=FAQ – Puppets |url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=112:the-puppets-look-different-between-thunderbirds-and-captain-scarlet-what-happened&amp;catid=122:faqs&amp;Itemid=179 |work=tvcentury21.com |date=2 January 2004 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m00k9kSq?url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=112:the-puppets-look-different-between-thunderbirds-and-captain-scarlet-what-happened&amp;catid=122:faqs&amp;Itemid=179 |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[costume designer]] for ''Captain Scarlet'' was [[Sylvia Anderson]], who was influenced by the work of French fashion designer [[Pierre Cardin]], in particular his 1966 "Cosmonaut" collection, in designing the Spectrum uniforms.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 19"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

After test-sculpting in [[Plasticine]], the puppet heads were moulded on a [[silicone rubber]] base and made using [[fibreglass]]. At heights ranging from 20 to 24&amp;nbsp;inches (approximately one-third life-size) the next-generation puppets were no shorter than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt; For previous series, puppet eyes had been sized out of proportion to the heads, but as part of the realistic look introduced in ''Captain Scarlet'', the eyes of production personnel were photographed and the images scaled down for attachment to the eye sockets.&lt;ref name = "HowsWhys" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Teletronic" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Archer, 55"&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt; As had been the case for earlier series, a number of alternative heads displaying a range of expressions were created for main character puppets, including "smilers", "frowners" and "blinkers".&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18" /&gt; Since episodes of ''Captain Scarlet'' were filmed in pairs, one on each of the puppet stages available at the [[AP Films#Century21|Century 21]] Studios, duplicates were made of the "expressionless" template of each main character.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 266"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;266.&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|first episode]], an "agony" head was specially sculpted for the [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] puppet for a brief [[reaction shot]] of Scarlet's [[Mysteron]] double being shot by [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]].

The increased [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of the puppets meant that their mobility was significantly reduced,&lt;ref name = "HowsWhys" /&gt; ironically leaving the new design less lifelike than Anderson had hoped,&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 203" /&gt; as he recalls: "Suddenly, all the movements had to be as realistic as the puppets and that made it difficult for the puppeteers to animate them."&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 203" /&gt; To minimise the amount of movement required, the puppets were made to stand on moving walkways or sit at moving desks: for example, [[Colonel White]]'s desk on [[Cloudbase]] is seen to rotate, while [[Lieutenant Green]] is seen to operate the Cloudbase main computer from a sliding chair. Puppeteer Jan King recalls:

{{Quote|The ''Captain Scarlet'' puppets were not built to walk. They were too heavy and not weighted properly anyway&amp;nbsp;... It is virtually impossible to get a string puppet to walk convincingly on film unless it is a very caricatured puppet. In ''Captain Scarlet'', if a puppet had to move off-screen, it was done in a [[Medium shot|head-and-shoulders shot]] – the floor puppeteer would hold the legs of the puppet and then move the puppet physically out of shot at the right time, trying to make the body and shoulders move as if the puppet were walking.&lt;ref name = "Bentley, 16"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "under control" puppets described by King were stringless and controlled from the waist. One resulting advantage was that a puppet could be moved through a doorway without necessitating a break in the shot. For shots displaying characters such as the Angels seated in aircraft cockpits, variations of the "under control" design, comprising just a head and torso, were manipulated by levers and wires positioned underneath the set.&lt;ref name="HowsWhys" /&gt; This development of Supermarionation would be named "[[Supermarionation#Supermacromation|Supermacromation]]" when Anderson returned to puppetry in the 1980s with his later production, ''[[Terrahawks]]''.

===Revamp puppets and likenesses===
{{Quote box|quote=I still wonder about the wisdom of our decision to change the puppets. The heads were reduced in size to make them in proportion with the rest of their bodies, but the problem was that exact and precise movements became more vital than ever and that caused us terrible difficulties. After creating [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] in perfect human form, [[Walt Disney]] said he'd never repeat that mistake, and I still have doubts about whether or not we did the right thing.|salign=right|source=–&amp;nbsp;[[Gerry Anderson]] (2001)&lt;ref name="Bentley, 14" /&gt;|width=20%}}

Before ''Captain Scarlet'', supporting character puppets had been specially sculpted in [[clay]] as and when episodes required them. The guest parts in ''Captain Scarlet'', however, were filled by a permanent "repertory company" of over 50 puppets made to the same standards of workmanship as the main characters.&lt;ref name="ToonhoundEntry" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bentley, 18" /&gt; Known as "revamp puppets" or "revamps", these puppets appeared on an episode-by-episode basis, cosmetically altered for each role in aspects such as hairstyle and hair colour.&lt;ref name="HowsWhys" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToonhoundEntry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18" /&gt; An initial intention was for each episode to include a "guest star" puppet to be sculpted on, and voiced by, a known public figure but this idea was abandoned due to budgetary constraints.&lt;ref name="HowsWhys" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 203" /&gt; Both main character and revamp puppets from ''Captain Scarlet'' appeared in Anderson's final two [[Supermarionation]] series, ''[[Joe 90]]'' and ''[[The Secret Service]]''.&lt;ref name="ToonhoundEntry" /&gt;

The regular puppet cast of ''Captain Scarlet'' was the largest of all the Anderson [[Supermarionation]] series.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 232"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;232.&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier productions had emphasised the benefits of futuristic technology,&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 232" /&gt; for ''Captain Scarlet'' it was decided to develop and deepen the cast of characters.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 232" /&gt; Further to the enhanced [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of the puppet design, voice roles for ''Captain Scarlet'' were, as opposed to ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and other predecessors, also intended to be less [[caricature]]d.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 240"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;240.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn note that, between ''Thunderbirds'' and ''Captain Scarlet,'' a proliferation of English-accented voices altered the sound of the Supermarionation production and its impression on the viewer.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;169.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]], voicing [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]], had previously turned down offers for voice-acting on ''Thunderbirds''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 23"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews claims that [[Gerry Anderson]] went to great lengths to get him to sign on to ''Captain Scarlet'' because of the skilled [[Cary Grant]] impression that he had once used for a radio programme,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmark"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newmark |first=Russell |title=Outside Edge: Mysterons Beware |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/outside-edge-mysterons-beware-1507965.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=1 October 1993 |accessdate=22 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m0240aBP?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/outside-edge-mysterons-beware-1507965.html |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed the English actor based the tones of Scarlet on Grant's [[Mid-Atlantic English|Mid-Atlantic]] accent.&lt;ref name="Archer, 43"&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Anderson claims in his biography&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 153"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt; that the impression was Matthews's choice at audition, and that whilst it was not what had been intended for Captain Scarlet, the production team nevertheless elected to use it.&lt;ref name="TVHeaven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 153" /&gt; Matthews's filmography prior to ''Captain Scarlet'' included the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] films ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]'' (1958), ''[[Rasputin, the Mad Monk]]'' (1966) and ''[[Dracula: Prince of Darkness]]'' (1966).

Matthews's co-star in ''Dracula: Prince of Darkness'' had been [[Charles Tingwell]], who was chosen to voice Doctor Fawn, the [[Cloudbase]] chief medical officer. Tingwell, who had provided voices for the second season of ''Thunderbirds'' and its first feature film, ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', had initially been recommended to the Andersons by [[Ray Barrett]],&lt;ref name="Bentley, 29"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; a fellow Australian actor who had worked on ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' and ''Thunderbirds''. However, due to commitments to a touring theatre production, Tingwell could only contribute to the first twelve produced episodes of ''Captain Scarlet'', ending with "[[Shadow of Fear]]".&lt;ref name="Bentley, 29" /&gt; Also departing after the completion of "Shadow of Fear" was the voice of Captain Grey, [[Paul Maxwell]],&lt;ref name="Bentley, 29" /&gt; a Canadian actor who had voiced the characters of Steve Zodiac and Captain Paul Travers in ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' and ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' respectively, who dropped out of production due to being cast as [[List of Coronation Street characters (1967)#Steve Tanner|Steve Tanner]] in ''[[Coronation Street]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 29" /&gt; As a result, Doctor Fawn and Captain Grey appeared in the remainder of the series in a non-speaking capacity only, although other characters voiced by Tingwell and Maxwell occasionally appeared in flashback sequences of specific episodes.

[[Cy Grant]], a Guyanese actor selected for the role of [[Lieutenant Green]]&lt;ref group="n" name="Leftenant"&gt;"Lieutenant" is generally pronounced in the British manner, {{IPAc-en|l|ɛ|f|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|ə|n|t}} {{respell|lef|TEN|ənt}}, by all but the American characters in the series.&lt;/ref&gt; (Colonel White's assistant and Cloudbase's main [[computer operator]] and [[Public address|public announcer]]), had been known to the Andersons for singing topical [[Calypso music|calypsos]] on the current affairs programme ''[[Tonight (1957 TV series)|Tonight]]''.&lt;ref name="CGWeb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Cy|authorlink=Cy Grant|title=Lieutenant Green and De Anderson CODE – Spectrums, Subconscious Connections &amp; Synchronicities|url=http://nestene1.users.btopenworld.com/cygrant/green.html|work=cygrant.com|year=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123195856/http://nestene1.users.btopenworld.com/cygrant/green.html|archivedate=23 January 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His casting influenced the decision to accept [[Ed Bishop|Edward Bishop]] as [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]] (Captain Scarlet's friend and mission partner),&lt;ref name="Starlog"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirsh|first=David|date=February 1982|title=''Starlog'' Exclusive: Commander Straker Speaks!

She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and [[Sylvia Anderson|Sylvia]] wanted to use him&amp;nbsp;... And the girl said, 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – shows you how long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.&amp;nbsp;And we know how much you like American voices. Would you like to meet him as well?' He said, 'Okay, send him out.' So I went out and auditioned and got the job."&lt;ref name="MJSimpson" /&gt;

[[Donald Gray]], who had found himself [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] after appearing in the lead role in ''[[Saber of London]]'', a [[Detective fiction|detective series]], was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 25"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt; The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: [[Colonel White]], [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] and the [[Mysteron]]s. After his mind is hijacked in the [[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|first episode]], Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to [[Earth]]. For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.

The voice of Captain Ochre was provided by English-born Canadian, [[Jeremy Wilkin]]. Having served in the role of [[Virgil Tracy]] during the second series of ''Thunderbirds,'' Wilkin remained to voice Ochre for the subsequent production. The character of Captain Magenta, meanwhile, was voiced by [[Gary Files]]. Another Australian actor, Files was a fresh addition to [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Productions]], and was cast for a number of roles in the second ''Thunderbirds'' film, ''[[Thunderbird 6]],'' before progressing to the role of Magenta for ''Captain Scarlet.''&lt;ref name="GFInterview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gary Files Interview |url=http://www.thevervoid.com/media/scarlet_interview.htm |work=thevervoid.com |accessdate=3 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072515/http://www.thevervoid.com/media/scarlet_interview.htm |archivedate=26 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Files, Welsh actress [[Elizabeth Morgan (actor)|Liz Morgan]] was new to the Anderson productions and voiced the regular characters of Destiny Angel, the lead pilot of the Spectrum Angel fighter squadron, and one of her subordinates, Rhapsody Angel.

[[Sylvia Anderson]], the voice of [[Lady Penelope]] from ''Thunderbirds,'' voiced Melody Angel, while Canadian actress Janna Hill was given the part of Symphony. The character of Harmony Angel was voiced by Morgan for five episodes before being replaced by Chinese actress Lian-Shin&lt;ref name="Bentley, 27"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LMInterview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Liz Morgan: Interviews |url=http://www.amb-cotedazur.com/Interviews/liz-morgan.html |work=amb-cotedazur.com |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m01uRyxG?url=http://www.amb-cotedazur.com/Interviews/liz-morgan.html |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; about one-third of the way through the recording sessions.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 159"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;159.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lian provided the voice of Harmony for only one episode, "[[The Launching]],"&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 159" /&gt; she received billing for 20 episodes.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 159" /&gt;

Supporting character voices were performed by Anderson, Files, Hill, Maxwell, Morgan, Tingwell and Wilkin. Completing the supporting cast were American actor [[David Healy (actor)|David Healy]] and British actor [[Martin King (actor)|Martin King]]. Canadian [[Shane Rimmer]], who had performed the voice of [[Scott Tracy]] in ''Thunderbirds'' and its films, made a number of uncredited contributions in addition to writing for the series. Fellow Canadian [[Neil McCallum (actor)|Neil McCallum]], who had provided the voice of the character of Dr Ray Pierce in ''Thunderbirds Are Go'', can be heard in four episodes, though he was not credited. Gerry Anderson himself lent his voice to the episode "[[Lunarville 7]]"; he too went uncredited.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 59"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt; Six members of the voice cast would continue their association with the Andersons after ''Captain Scarlet''. Healy would voice the character of Shane Weston in the penultimate Supermarionation series, ''[[Joe 90]]'', while Files would voice Matthew Harding on ''[[The Secret Service]]''. Wilkin, Morgan and King were all given small roles for these final two Supermarionation series, while Bishop appeared as SHADO Commander Edward Straker in Anderson's live-action series, ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'', which was transmitted in the United Kingdom from 1970.

===Voice recording===
Character dialogue was recorded on a fortnightly basis,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 41" /&gt; with lines for up to four episodes taped at each session,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 30"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Denham Film Studios|Anvil Films Recording Studio]]&lt;ref group="l" name="Denham"&gt;[[Denham Film Studios|Anvil Films Recording Studio]]: {{Coord|51.5632|-0.4987|type:landmark_region:GB-NWP|name=Anvil Films Recording Studio, Denham, Buckinghamshire|format=dms}} (voice recording)&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 30" /&gt; Each actor, regardless of the size of their contribution, was paid 15 guineas (£15 15 shillings) per episode&lt;ref name="Bentley, 24"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; with repeat fees.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 24" /&gt; The cast were not given the opportunity to tour the [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21]] studios in [[Slough]] until all their work was finished&lt;ref name="Bentley, 23" /&gt; and therefore had no visualisation of their characters during the recording itself. This was to the regret of [[Elizabeth Morgan (actress)|Liz Morgan]]: "We all said that we wished we had seen the puppets before doing the dialogue, as it would have been helpful to have something physical to base the voices on. I knew that Destiny was French and that Rhapsody had to be frightfully '[[Sloane Ranger|Sloaney]],' but that was about it."&lt;ref name="Bentley, 27" /&gt;

==Titles and credits==
[[File:Spectrum Organisation (Captain Scarlett) logo.png|thumb|The Spectrum logo, designed by Tony Dunsterville, appears at both the start and the end of an episode's midpoint [[Television advertisement|advertisement break]].]]

All ''Captain Scarlet'' episodes, except the first, incorporate two sets of [[opening titles]]. The first of these sequences displays the [[title card]] and the primary production credits. The camera moves forward through the scale-model set of a run-down, night-time alleyway, forming the [[Point of view shot|point-of-view shot]] of an unseen assassin, who turns a corner only to meet his death at the gun barrel of [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]]. The two seven-letter words "Captain Scarlet" gradually appear in time with the seven strikes of the ''Captain Scarlet'' staccato drum beat composed by [[Barry Gray]]. This opening sequence is accompanied by a [[voice-over]] from [[Ed Bishop]], which states:

{{quote|"The Mysterons. Sworn enemies of Earth. Possessing the ability to recreate an exact likeness of an object or person. But first, they must destroy. Leading the fight: one man fate has made indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet."}}

The sequence is intended to demonstrate Captain Scarlet's indestructibility, with the assassin's machine-gun bullets having no apparent effect on their target.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 244"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of variations of the voice-over have been used. Bishop's introduction to the pilot, which is unique to that episode, runs:&lt;ref group="e" name="The Mysterons" /&gt;

{{quote|"The finger is on the trigger. About to unleash a force with terrible powers, beyond the comprehension of man. This force we shall know as: the Mysterons. This man will be our hero, for fate will make him indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet."}}

A little-used alternative version runs:&lt;ref name="Lesterdemon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pixley |first1=Andrew |author2=Michael Richardson, Alice Hendry |year=1985 |title=Supermarionation – the UK Broadcasts |journal=Supermarionation is Go! |issue=14–5 |publisher=Super M Productions |url=http://lester.demon.nl/superm/broadcastsUK.html |accessdate=6 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m02NT3pI?url=http://lester.demon.nl/superm/broadcastsUK.html |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"One man. A man who is different. Chosen by fate. Caught up in Earth's unwanted conflict with the Mysterons. Determined. Courageous. Indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet."}}

Later [[Release print|prints]] feature an additional voice-over by [[Donald Gray]], warning:&lt;ref name="Lesterdemon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 163"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;163.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Captain Scarlet is indestructible. You are not. Remember this. Do not try to imitate him."}}

This served both to establish the background to the series and to warn child viewers not to risk their safety by copying Scarlet's actions.&lt;ref name="Lesterdemon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull: Media History, 200"&gt;Cull 2006 (August), p.&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;/ref&gt; It was either placed after the alternative "One man&amp;nbsp;..." voice-over&lt;ref name="Lesterdemon" /&gt; or used in isolation, such that no voice-over by Bishop was heard.&lt;ref name="Lesterdemon" /&gt;

From the [[Winged Assassin|second episode]] onwards, a secondary opening sequence runs immediately after an initial [[Cold open|teaser]]: as the Mysterons announce their latest threat against Earth, the "Mysteron rings" pass over the primary puppet cast in a number of environments to demonstrate the aliens' omnipresence.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 244" /&gt; Meanwhile, the characters's Spectrum code names are flashed up on-screen. The Mysterons invariably begin their threat with the words, "This is the voice of the Mysterons. We know that you can hear us, [[Earthling|Earthmen]]."

{{Quote box|quote=The [[Opening titles|titles]] on the series were always devised by me. When it came to ''Scarlet'' I was frightened people would say, 'Oh, it's the same old "crash, bang, wallop" stuff again.' So I made a conscious effort to do something totally different. I don't think I necessarily did the right thing.|salign=right|source=–&amp;nbsp;[[Gerry Anderson]] (2001)&lt;ref name="Teletronic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TVHeaven" /&gt;|width=21%|align=left}}

The [[end credits]] sequence was originally intended to feature images of [[printed circuit board]]s and other electronic components, to reflect the Andersons's early conception of the resurrected Captain Scarlet as being a "[[Android (robot)|mechanical man]]."&lt;ref name="Bentley, 15" /&gt; In the completed sequence, the end production credits are superimposed on a series of ten paintings, which depict Scarlet in moments of extreme danger. In earlier episodes, these images are accompanied by the instrumental version of Barry Gray's ''Captain Scarlet'' theme music; in later ones, this is replaced by the lyrical version sung by The Spectrum. The paintings were produced by comic artist [[Ron Embleton]], who would later illustrate the adult comic strips ''[[Wicked Wanda|Oh, Wicked Wanda!]]'' and ''Sweet Chastity'' for ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' Magazine.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 102"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prints"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wickes |first=Simon |title=Prints of ''Scarlet'' End Titles Available |url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=317:prints-of-scarlet-end-titles-available&amp;catid=71:miscellaneous&amp;Itemid=178 |work=tvcentury21.com |date=6 June 2005 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m02CWUql?url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=317:prints-of-scarlet-end-titles-available&amp;catid=71:miscellaneous&amp;Itemid=178 |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Animation Art Gallery in London released licensed limited editions of the paintings signed by [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]], who had provided the voice of Captain Scarlet.&lt;ref name="Prints" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCArt"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Scarlet'' Art |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2005/02/11/16980.shtml |work=[[BBC Online]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=11 February 2005 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m02GyRcC?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2005/02/11/16980.shtml |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the original opening credit sequences were replaced with a montage of action clips from various episodes, accompanied by a unique [[theme song]] performed by children.

==Broadcasts==
''Captain Scarlet'' officially opened on British television on 29 September 1967, in the late-afternoon slot of 5.25&amp;nbsp;pm, in the [[ATV Midlands]] region. [[Audience measurement|Viewing figures]] for the first episode, "[[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|The Mysterons]]", were promising at 0.45&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 118"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt; Five months earlier, on 29 April, the series opener had been given a late-night test transmission in the London area.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 118" /&gt; After the start of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] broadcasts, London and Scotland followed on 1 October,&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 207"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;207.&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Granada Television|Granada]], [[Anglia Television|Anglia]], [[Southern Television|Southern]], [[Westward Television|Westward]] and [[Channel Television|Channel]] areas all televising the series by the end of the month.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 118" /&gt; However, it was not until the start of 1968 that the series was being broadcast all across the nation.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 118" /&gt; In the Midlands region, the ratings averaged 1.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 118" /&gt; In 1968, ''Captain Scarlet'' was also screened in more than 40 other countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 119"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the series was transmitted on [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]].&lt;ref name="CrimeTV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scifiontv"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sci-Fi on TV: Archive List |url=http://www.scifiontv.com/archive_list.php |work=scifiontv.com |accessdate=1 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m02nqQFP?url=http://www.scifiontv.com/archive_list.php |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, only six episodes of the series were transmitted in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 282"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;282.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rerun|Repeat runs]] have varied greatly according to region. While Granada, [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]] and [[ITV Tyne Tees|Tyne Tees]] continued to broadcast the series into 1972,&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 283"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;283.&lt;/ref&gt; the Midlands received four [[Color television|colour]] re-runs from 1969 to 1974,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 119" /&gt; while in other areas, such as [[Yorkshire]], it was not repeated at all.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 119" /&gt; All 32 episodes were purchased by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] for broadcast on Saturday mornings between 1985 and 1986,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 119" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 286"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;286.&lt;/ref&gt; with broadcasting in segmented form on the ITV [[Night Network]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 286" /&gt; A BBC commission led to the series' first simultaneous [[Television network|network]] broadcast on [[BBC2]] starting on 1 October 1993.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 122"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion, the first episode attracted an audience of four million,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 122" /&gt; high enough to award it third position in the BBC2 ratings chart for the week of transmission.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 122" /&gt;

[[Remaster|Digitally remastered]], the series resurfaced on BBC Two in the autumn of 2001.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 125"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;125.&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion, the episode schedule needed to be re-arranged at short notice to avoid offence in the immediate [[aftermath of the September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="ToonhoundEntry" /&gt; The second episode, "[[Winged Assassin]]", in which the [[Mysteron]]s destroy and reconstruct a plane to assassinate a world leader, and the third, "[[Big Ben Strikes Again]]", in which London comes under threat from an atomic device, were held back and replaced with the fourth episode, "[[Manhunt (Captain Scarlet)|Manhunt]]", due to parallels between the plotlines and events in the real world.&lt;ref name="THound01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonhound.com/oct2001.htm|title=The Hound – October 2001: ''Scarlet'' Faces&amp;nbsp;... |work=toonhound.com|date=October 2001|accessdate=26 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409102053/http://www.toonhound.com/oct2001.htm|archivedate=9 April 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the week after the attacks, the ''Captain Scarlet'' section on the [[Carlton Communications|Carlton]] website was also temporarily removed.&lt;ref name="THound01" /&gt;

While ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' had run for two series, [[Lew Grade]]'s unexpected cancellation of the production led Anderson to assume that there was no possibility of ''Captain Scarlet'' lasting for more than one.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 280"&gt;Drake and Bassett, p.&amp;nbsp;280.&lt;/ref&gt; In Anderson's words, "I didn't expect it to continue.

Since its first appearance, ''Captain Scarlet'' has been criticised for its filming, which has been considered too static due to the problem of moving the [[Supermarionation]] puppets convincingly.&lt;ref name="HowsWhys" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Anthony|title=BFI Entry|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/455572/index.html|work=[[British Film Institute|BFI]] [[screenonline]]|accessdate=3 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516090835/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/455572/index.html|archivedate=16 May 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The return to a 25-minute episode format, as had been the case with series preceding ''Thunderbirds'', has been blamed for a perceived drop in quality of storytelling and a lack of [[subplot]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peel, 246"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;246.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have also been raised about the development of the characters: in a 1986 interview, script editor [[Tony Barwick]] described ''Captain Scarlet'' as "hard-nosed stuff"&lt;ref name="Bentley, 31" /&gt; that lacked humour, stating, "It was all for the American market and to that extent there was no deep [[characterisation]]. [The characters] all balanced one against the other."&lt;ref name="Bentley, 31" /&gt; To Jeff Evans, writer of ''The Penguin TV Companion'', it is "more detailed"; he explains: "The agents were given private lives and real identities, and were furnished with other biographical data."&lt;ref name="PenTVCom"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Jeff|title=The Penguin TV Companion|year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=978-0-14-101221-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=While it would become a huge success, ''Captain Scarlet'' received a less than enthusiastic reception from critics.

Science-fiction author [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] considers ''Captain Scarlet'' inferior to ''Thunderbirds'', arguing that although the [[special effects]] had improved, it was to the detriment of the scriptwriting. He compares this schism to the disappointing reception to [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984) following the success of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981):&lt;ref name="Peel, 245"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;245.&lt;/ref&gt; "Anderson made the same mistake that [[George Lucas]] made, assuming that if the effects were praised in ''Thunderbirds'', the public wanted a show with more effects."&lt;ref name="Peel, 245" /&gt; Peel also finds fault with the nature of Scarlet himself, suggesting that the use of an "indestructible" hero made the conclusions to the episodes too predictable.&lt;ref name="Peel, 246" /&gt; Furthermore, he expresses a concern that Scarlet, who is often seen to risk his life in a bid to thwart Mysteron plots, served as a poor role model to a target audience of impressionable children.&lt;ref name="Peel, 246" /&gt;

===Puppets===
Turning his attention to [[Sylvia Anderson]]'s costume design, Bould praises the "commitment to fashion" evident throughout the Anderson series, singling out the design of the Spectrum Angel uniforms.&lt;ref name="Bould, 220"&gt;Bould, p.&amp;nbsp;220.&lt;/ref&gt; The realistic design of the new puppets has been praised by Vincent Terrace&lt;ref name="CrimeTV"&gt;{{cite book|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|title=Crime Fighting Heroes of Television: Over 10,000 Facts from 151 Shows, 1949–2001|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|location=North Carolina|year=2002|page=43|isbn=978-0-7864-1395-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticised by others. Certain members of the production staff had the impression that they lacked the charm of the earlier generation of puppets due to the authentic proportions that were now being used.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 14" /&gt; Director [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]]'s initial thoughts on a prototype, sculpted by head puppet-maker John Brown,&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151" /&gt; were, "it was as if there was a little dead person in [the box]&amp;nbsp;... because it was perfect in all its proportions it just looked odd."&lt;ref name="Bentley, 14" /&gt; Brown remembers placing the prototype next to the [[Lady Penelope]] puppet from ''Thunderbirds'' and gauging the response from colleagues:&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151" /&gt; "When they saw it, some people were horrified by the difference. Some didn't like it, some did."&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic" /&gt; Commentators have noted that facial expression was sacrificed in favour of a realistic design,&lt;ref name="h2g2"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'' – Background to the TV Series|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A786486|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=12 August 2002|accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806034845/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A786486|archivedate=6 August 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; a result on which Terry Curtis remembers:

{{Quote|The changes of expression on those puppets had to be perfect and in no way exaggerated like the old ones were. I remember when [fellow puppet designer] Tim Cooksey did Colonel White, he had a lot of trouble doing different expressions as the face was just so realistic. I had a similar problem with [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]]. I remember I did a Blue "smiler" head and people could hardly tell the difference between that and the normal one.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16" /&gt;}}

Sculptor John Blundall has called the new puppet design "ridiculous",&lt;ref name="Teletronic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt; criticising Anderson's attempts to make the puppets appear more lifelike on the basis that "We always try to do with puppets what you can't do with humans."&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152" /&gt; Expressing a preference for the design ''Thunderbirds'' era,&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152" /&gt; Blundall agrees that the transition from [[caricature]] to realism was at the expense of "character and personality",&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152" /&gt; asserting that "If the puppet appears completely natural, the audience no longer has to use its imagination."&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152" /&gt; Anderson states that he pushed for the reshaping of the puppets to please viewers,&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152" /&gt; deeming it not "a case of moving to a new technique, but more a case of incorporating new ideas with existing methods."&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152" /&gt; Evans praises the new puppets, describing them as "perfect in proportion" and commending the fact the electronic circitry was now in the puppets' bodies.&lt;ref name="PenTVCom" /&gt;

Summing up ''Captain Scarlet'' as "better puppets, bigger [[Action (fiction)|action]] and a huge step backwards in stories" compared to ''Thunderbirds'',&lt;ref name="Peel, 244"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt; Peel disputes the claim that the next generation of puppets mark a failure on the part of the series,&lt;ref name="Peel, 245" /&gt; arguing that the increased realism could not have deterred an audience familiar with the previous design.&lt;ref name="Peel, 245" /&gt; Although to his mind the characterisation was less endearing,&lt;ref name="Peel, 245" /&gt; Peel suggests that it is an over-emphasis on the visual, at the expense of characterisation, that truly accounts for the reduced credibility of ''Captain Scarlet''.&lt;ref name="Peel, 245" /&gt;

===Race, gender and symbolism===
{{Quote box|quote=When I made ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'' for [[Associated Television|ATV]], we put a number of black characters in an episode because the story demanded it.

During its 1993 UK repeat run, ''Captain Scarlet'' attracted attention with regard to the [[black-and-white dualism]] debate for its use of the codenames "White" to designate the head of Spectrum, [[Colonel White]], and "Black" for the villainous Captain Black.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 122" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 160"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending the series against the accusations of racism and [[political incorrectness]], Anderson pointed out that [[Lieutenant Green]], Melody Angel and Harmony Angel are among the heroes of the series in spite of their African and Asian backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 122" /&gt; Green is the only male black character to be given a substantial role in any series produced by Anderson.&lt;ref name="Archer, 32iii"&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;32iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic works, the diversity of the Spectrum personnel in terms of both race and gender has been viewed highly.&lt;ref name="WomenInSpace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shayler|first1=David|authorlink1=David Shayler|last2=Moule|first2=Ian A.|title=Women in Space: Following Valentina|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2005|page=xvii|isbn=978-1-85233-744-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bould praises the series for its "beautiful, [[multiethnic]], female Angel fighter pilots"&lt;ref name="Bould, 220" /&gt; and "secondary roles played by capable women."&lt;ref name="Bould, 220" /&gt; In an interview conducted in 2003, Anderson confirmed that a conscious effort was made to feature ethnic minorities: "...&amp;nbsp;I think people who make television programmes have a responsibility, particularly when children are watching avidly and you know their minds can be affected almost irreversibly as they grow up.&amp;nbsp;We were very conscious of introducing different ethnic backgrounds."&lt;ref name="Cull: British Science Fiction Television: a Hitchhiker's Guide, 127"&gt;Cull 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guyanese actor [[Cy Grant]], who voiced the character of Lieutenant Green and believed that ''Captain Scarlet'' had positive multicultural value,&lt;ref name="CGWeb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 160" /&gt; discussed the [[allegorical]] nature of the series.&lt;ref name="CGWeb" /&gt; According to him, Christian symbolism was heavily implied, with Colonel White assuming the role of [[God in Christianity|God]], opposed by the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|Devil]] in the form of Captain Black and descended by Captain Scarlet, who serves as a [[Christ]] allegory; moreover, [[Cloudbase]] represented [[Heaven#In Christianity|Heaven]] and was guarded by its own fleet of [[Angel#Christianity|Angels]].&lt;ref name="CGWeb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 160" /&gt; Grant has also lionised Green as an African trickster hero.&lt;ref name="CGWeb" /&gt; On dualism, he argued, "the '[[darkness]]' of the Mysterons is most easily seen as the psychological rift – the struggle of [[Good and evil|'good' and 'evil']] – of the [[Western world]] as personified by Colonel White and his team. Dark and [[Light (theology)|light]] are but aspects of each other. Incidentally, green is the colour of nature that can heal that rift."&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 160" /&gt;

Allan with artwork by [[Ron Embleton]], and were titled ''We Will Destroy Unity City'', ''We Will Destroy the Observatory Network'' and ''We Shall Make Earth a Planet of Silence''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 102" /&gt; Following the end of the TV series, the comic continued the story of the ''Captain Scarlet'' universe, with later strips revealing that the [[Mysteron]]s deactivate their Martian complex and relinquish their control over [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]], while Scarlet himself leaves Spectrum to make use of his powers in the fight against Earth-bound criminals and threats.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 280" /&gt; The Mysterons ultimately re-awaken, prompting Scarlet and Spectrum to resume their struggle.&lt;ref name="Drake and Bassett, 280" /&gt;

===Compilation films===
{{Main|Captain Scarlet vs. the Mysterons|Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars}}

In 1980, the New York offices of ITC, under the supervision of [[Robert Mandell]],&lt;ref name="Bentley, 121"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt; combined episodes from the original series to make two [[compilation film]]s for American audiences, with the aim of reviving transatlantic [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] sales.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 121" /&gt; This became common practice for Anderson productions during the 1980s, with [[made-for-television]] films comprising episodes of ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' and ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' airing to US [[Cable television in the United States|cable]] audiences under the generic promotional banner of "Super Space Theater".&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 361"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;361.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 1988, the second ''Captain Scarlet'' film, ''[[Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars]]'', was broadcast as the second episode of the American television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', from [[Minneapolis]], on station [[KTMA]].

===CGI test film and series===
{{Main|Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet}}

In 1999, [[Gerry Anderson]] supervised the production of a short [[computer-animated]] test film, ''Captain Scarlet and the Return of the Mysterons'', to explore the possibility of updating a number of his 1960s [[Supermarionation]] series for a 21st-century audience.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 123"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcus|first=Laurence|title=Gerry Anderson: The Puppet Master – Part 5|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson5.htm|work=teletronic.co.uk|date=June 2006|accessdate=22 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030130851/http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson5.htm|archivedate=30 October 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[working title]] was ''Captain Scarlet – The New Millennium''.&lt;ref name="Teletronic5" /&gt; Produced in London by the [[Moving Picture Company]],&lt;ref name="Bentley, 123" /&gt; the film features [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]] and [[Ed Bishop]] reprising the roles of Captains [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Scarlet]] and [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Blue]].&lt;ref name="ToonhoundEntry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic5" /&gt; Made using a combination of [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] 3D computer graphics software and [[motion-capture]] technology,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 124"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic5" /&gt; the plot commences a few years after the [[Mysteron]]s end their hostilities against [[Earth]], but the reappearance of [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] sets the stage for a revival of the war with [[Mars]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 124" /&gt; Although the film has yet to receive a [[home video]] release, it was publicly screened at a [[Fanderson]] convention in 2000&lt;ref name="Bentley, 125" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SHADO-USECC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic5" /&gt; and at a science lecture in 2001.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 125" /&gt;

Plans for a full CGI ''Captain Scarlet'' television series to follow the test film finally resulted in ''Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet''. A [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the original series, this was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on the Saturday-morning [[CITV]] programme, ''[[Ministry of Mayhem]]'', from 12 February 2005.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 282"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;282.&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by "Anderson Entertainment" and the "Indestructible Production Company",&lt;ref name="Teletronic5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 281"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;281.&lt;/ref&gt; the animation used to create the series is billed in the credits as "[[Hypermarionation]]"&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 281" /&gt; to acknowledge the 1960s puppet technique, Supermarionation.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 281" /&gt;

'''Christianity'''{{refn|group=note|name=name|The term "Christian" ({{Lang-el|Χριστιανός}}) was first used in reference to Jesus's [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] in the city of [[Antioch]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|11:26}} about 44&amp;nbsp;AD, meaning "followers of Christ". The name was given by the non-Jewish inhabitants of Antioch to the disciples of Jesus. In the New Testament, the names by which the disciples were known among themselves were "brethren", "the faithful", "elect", "saints" and "believers". The earliest recorded use of the term "Christianity" ({{Lang-el|Χριστιανισμός|links=no}}) was by [[Ignatius of Antioch]], around 100&amp;nbsp;AD.{{Sfn|Elwell|Comfort|2001|pp=266, 828}}}}&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; is a monotheistic [[Abrahamic religion]] based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus]]. Its adherents, known as ''[[Christians]]'', believe that [[Jesus Christ]] is the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]], [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], and [[Salvation in Christianity|savior of humanity]], whose coming as the [[Messiah]] ([[Christ]]) was prophesied in the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]], and chronicled in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Christianity: A Very Short Introduction|edition= |last= Woodhead|first= Linda |year= 2004|publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford|isbn= |pages= n.p}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=November 2018}}

Christianity began as a [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Judaic]] sect, in the 1st&amp;nbsp;century, in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]]. Jesus' [[apostles]] and their successors, the [[Apostolic fathers|Apostolic Fathers]], [[Early centers of Christianity|spread]] it across large parts of the Middle East, Europe, Ethiopia, Transcaucasia and some other parts of Asia, despite initial [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution]]. Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] converted to Christianity and decriminalized it in the [[Edict of Milan]] (313), later convening the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) where [[Early Christianity]] was consolidated into what would become the [[state religion of the Roman Empire]] (380).&lt;ref&gt;Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B. Rives, page 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07218b.htm Catholic encyclopedia] New Advent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', pp. 301–03.&lt;/ref&gt; The council formulated the [[Nicene Creed]] (325), and the [[Church fathers|Church Fathers]] supervised the [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|compilation]] of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian Bible]] (5th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbermann|first1=Charles George|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1908|publisher=Robert Appleton Company,|location=New York|isbn=978-1174601828|pages=272, 273|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IEsfAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early statements of essential beliefs were the [[Apostles Creed]] and Nicene Creed. The period of the [[first seven ecumenical councils]] is sometimes referred to as the [[Great Church]], the united [[full communion|communion]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] before their [[schism]]s. Oriental Orthodoxy split after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) over [[Chalcedonian Definition|differences in Christology]], while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the [[East–West Schism]] (1054), especially over the [[Papal primacy|authority of the Pope]]. Similarly, [[Protestantism]] [[Anti-Catholicism|split]] in [[List of the largest Protestant denominations|numerous denominations]] from the Catholic Church in the [[Protestant Reformation]] (16th century) over [[Protestant theology|theological]] and [[Protestant ecclesiology|ecclesiological]] disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-vhwjamOioC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=anagignoskomena#v=onepage&amp;q=anagignoskomena |title=Orthodox and Wesleyan Scriptural understanding and practice | editor=S.

According to the [[New Testament]], Christians were from the beginning subject to [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] by some Jewish and Roman religious authorities. This involved punishments, including death, for Christians such as [[Stephen]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|7:59}} and [[James, son of Zebedee]].{{bibleref2c|Acts|12:2}} Further widespread [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|persecutions]] of the Church occurred under nine subsequent Roman emperors, most intensely under [[Decius]] and [[Diocletian]].

From the year 150, Christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith. These authors are known as the [[Church Fathers]], and study of them is called [[patristics]]. Notable early Fathers include [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Origen]].

State persecution ceased in the 4th&amp;nbsp;century, when [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] issued an [[Edict of Milan|edict of toleration]] in 313. At that point, Christianity was still a minority belief comprising perhaps only five percent of the Roman population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christianity: A Global History|last=Chidester|first=David|publisher=HarperOne|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by his adviser [[Mardonius (philosopher)|Mardonius]], Constantine's nephew [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] unsuccessfully tried to suppress Christianity.&lt;ref name="Ricciotti"&gt;{{harvnb|Ricciotti|1999|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 380, [[Theodosius I]], [[Gratian]], and [[Valentinian II]] established [[Nicene Christianity]] as the [[state church of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html Theodosian Code XVI.i.2], in: Bettenson.

Constantine was also instrumental in the convocation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, which sought to address [[Arianism]] and formulated the [[Nicene Creed]], which is still used by the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglican Communion]] and many [[Protestant]] churches.&lt;ref name="UMC—Our Common Heritage as Christians"/&gt; Nicaea was the first of a series of [[ecumenical council]]s which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the Church, notably concerning [[Christology]].&lt;ref name="McManners37"&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 37f.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] did not accept the third and following Ecumenical Councils, and are still separate today.

The presence of Christianity in Africa began in the middle of the 1st&amp;nbsp;century in [[Egypt]], and by the end of the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century in the region around [[Carthage]]. [[Mark the Evangelist]] is claimed to have started the [[Church of Alexandria]] in about AD 43; various later churches and denominations claim this as their own legacy including the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th&amp;nbsp;century, states that St. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43&amp;nbsp;AD.

In terms of prosperity and cultural life, the [[Byzantine Empire]] was one of the peaks in [[Christian history]] and [[Christian civilization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|2006|pp=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Constantinople]] remained the leading city of the [[Christian world]] in size, wealth and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|2006|pp=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy]], as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek.&lt;ref name="Browning-1992-190-218"&gt;{{harvnb|Browning|1992|pp=198–208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of [[Byzantine art]] on the west during this period was enormous and of long lasting significance.&lt;ref name="Browning-1992-218"&gt;{{harvnb|Browning|1992|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Middle Ages===
With the decline and [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire in the west]], the [[papacy]] became a political player, first visible in [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]]'s diplomatic dealings with [[Attila the Hun|Huns]] and [[Vandals]].&lt;ref name = "Gonzalez-p238"/&gt; The church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes. While [[Arianism|Arianists]] instituted the death penalty for practicing pagans (see [[Massacre of Verden]] as example), what would later become [[Catholicism]] also spread among the [[Hungarians]], the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]],&lt;ref name = "Gonzalez-p238"&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 238–42.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Celts|Celtic]], the [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] and some [[Slavic peoples]]. Christianity has been an important part of the shaping of [[Western civilization]], at least since the 4th century.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Historical Series"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caltron J.H Hayas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlandis"/&gt;

Around 500, [[St. Benedict]] set out his [[Monastic Rule]], establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of [[monasteries]].&lt;ref name = "Gonzalez-p238"/&gt; [[Monasticism]] became a powerful force throughout Europe,&lt;ref name = "Gonzalez-p238"/&gt; and gave rise to many early centers of learning, most famously in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Gaul]], contributing to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century.

In the 7th century [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Muslims conquered Syria]] (including [[Jerusalem]]), [[North Africa]] and Spain, converting some of the Christian population to [[Islam]], and placing the rest under a separate [[Dhimmi|legal status]]. Part of the Muslims' success was due to the exhaustion of the Byzantine Empire in its decades long conflict with [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, 2008, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 8th century, with the rise of [[Carolingian]] leaders, the papacy began to find greater political support in the [[Frankish Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, 2008, p. 93–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle Ages brought about major changes within the church. [[Pope Gregory the Great]] dramatically reformed [[Ecclesiastical polity|ecclesiastical structure]] and administration.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 244–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 8th century, [[iconoclasm]] became a divisive issue, when it was sponsored by the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] emperors. The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Second Ecumenical Council of Nicaea]] (787) finally pronounced in favor of icons.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 10th century, Western Christian monasticism was further rejuvenated through the leadership of the great Benedictine monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 278–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the Christian era.&lt;ref name="Caltron J.H Hayas" /&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
[[File:Passages d'outremer Fr5594, fol. 19r, Concile de Clermont.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Clermont]], where he preached the [[First Crusade]]]]
In the west, from the 11th&amp;nbsp;century onward, older cathedral schools developed into universities (see [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Paris]] and [[University of Bologna]].) The traditional [[medieval universities]]—evolved from Catholic and Protestant church schools—then established specialized academic structures for properly educating greater numbers of students as [[profession]]als. Prof. Walter Rüegg, editor of ''[[A History of the University in Europe]]'', reports that universities then only trained students to become clerics, lawyers, civil servants and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Rudy, ''The Universities of Europe, 1100–1914'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally teaching only [[theology]], [[universities]] steadily added subjects including [[medicine]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]], becoming the direct ancestors of modern institutions of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 305, 312, 314f..&lt;/ref&gt;
The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Christian]] setting.&lt;ref name="Rüegg, Walter 1992, pp. XIX"&gt;Rüegg, Walter: "Foreword. The University as a European Institution", in: ''A History of the University in Europe.

Accompanying the rise of the "new towns" throughout Europe, [[mendicant order]]s were founded, bringing the [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|consecrated religious life]] out of the monastery and into the new urban setting. The two principal mendicant movements were the [[Franciscans]]&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 303–07, 310f., 384–86.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 305, 310f., 316f.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] and [[St. Dominic]] respectively. Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe. Another new order were the [[Cistercians]], whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas. In this period church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights, culminating in the orders of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]] and the building of the great European cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 321–23, 365f.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1095 under the pontificate of [[Urban II]], the [[Crusades]] were launched.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 292–300.&lt;/ref&gt; These were a series of military campaigns in the [[Holy Land]] and elsewhere, initiated in response to pleas from the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I]] for aid against [[Turkish people|Turkish]] expansion. The Crusades ultimately failed to stifle Islamic aggression and even contributed to Christian enmity with the sacking of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;Riley-Smith. ''The Oxford History of the Crusades''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a period stretching from the 7th to the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, the Christian Church underwent gradual alienation, resulting in a [[East-West Schism|schism]] dividing it into a so-called Latin or [[Western Christian]] branch, the Catholic Church,&lt;ref&gt;The Western Church was called Latin at the time by the Eastern Christians and non Christians due to its conducting of its rituals and affairs in the Latin language&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]], largely Greek, branch, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. These two churches disagree on a number of administrative, liturgical and doctrinal issues, most notably [[papal primacy|papal primacy of jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Orthodox Information Centre-Great Schism"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/greatschism.aspx| title = The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom|publisher = Orthodox Information Centre|accessdate = 26 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SandSp91"&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274) and the [[Council of Florence]]  (1439) attempted to reunite the churches, but in both cases the Eastern Orthodox refused to implement the decisions and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day. However, the Catholic Church has achieved union with various [[Eastern Catholic Churches|smaller eastern churches]].

In the thirteenth century a new emphasis on Jesus' suffering, exemplified by the Franciscans' preaching, had the consequence of turning worshippers' attention towards Jews, on whom [[Jewish deicide|Christians had placed the blame for Jesus' death]]. Christianity's limited tolerance of Jews was not new—Augustine of Hippo had said that Jews should not be allowed to enjoy the citizenship that Christians took for granted—but the growing antipathy towards Jews was a factor that led to [[Edict of Expulsion|the expulsion of Jews from England in 1290]], the first of many such expulsions in Europe.&lt;ref name="diarmaid"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacCulloch |first=Diarmaid |title=Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years |publisher=Penguin |date=2011 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7x4m20TRYzQC|isbn=9781101189993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telushkin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Telushkin |first=Joseph |title=Jewish Literacy |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=192–193 |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-688-08506-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 1184, following the crusade against the [[Cathars|Cathar]] heresy,&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 300, 304–05.&lt;/ref&gt; various institutions, broadly referred to as the [[Inquisition]], were established with the aim of suppressing [[heresy]] and securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through [[religious conversion|conversion]] and prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 310, 383, 385, 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation===
[[File:95Thesen.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Martin Luther]] started the Protestant Reformation in 1517 with the [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]], going against the Catholic interpretation of the Bible.]]
{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}
{{See also|European wars of religion}}
The 15th-century [[Renaissance]] brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. Another major schism, the [[Reformation]], resulted in the splintering of the [[Western Christianity|Western Christendom]] into several branches.&lt;ref name="Simon-120-121"&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] in 1517 [[95 Theses|protested]] against the sale of [[indulgences]] and soon moved on to deny several key points of Catholic [[doctrine]].&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 39, 55–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reformers like [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Johannes Oecolampadius|Oecolampadius]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], [[John Knox|Knox]] and [[Jacobus Arminius|Arminius]] further criticized Catholic teaching and worship. These challenges developed into the movement called [[Protestantism]], which repudiated the [[papal primacy|primacy of the pope]], the role of tradition, the [[Catholic sacraments|seven sacraments]] and other doctrines and practices.&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt; The [[English Reformation|Reformation in England]] began in 1534, when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] had himself [[Act of Supremacy|declared head]] of the [[Church of England]]. Beginning in 1536, the monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolved]].&lt;ref name="Schama"&gt;Schama. ''A History of Britain''. pp. 306–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Müntzer]], [[Andreas Karlstadt]] and other theologians perceived both the Catholic Church and the confessions of the [[Magisterial Reformation]] as corrupted. Their activity brought about the [[Radical Reformation]], which gave birth to various [[Anabaptist]] denominations.

Partly in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the [[Counter-Reformation]] or Catholic Reform.&lt;ref name="Bokenkotter242"&gt;Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'', pp. 242–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Trent]] clarified and reasserted Catholic doctrine. During the following centuries, competition between Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states.&lt;ref name="Simon3"&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 109–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the discovery of America by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 brought about a new wave of missionary activity. Partly from missionary zeal, but under the impetus of [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, [[East Asia]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

Throughout Europe, the divides caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of [[religious violence]] and the establishment of separate state churches in Europe. [[Lutheranism]] spread into northern, central and eastern parts of present-day Germany, [[Livonia]] and Scandinavia. [[Anglicanism]] was established in England in 1534. [[Calvinism]] and its varieties (such as [[Presbyterianism]]) were introduced in [[Scotland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]]. [[Arminianism]] gained followers in the Netherlands and [[Frisia]]. Ultimately, these differences led to the outbreak of [[religious war|conflicts]] in which religion played a key factor. The [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[English Civil War]] and the [[French Wars of Religion]] are prominent examples. These events intensified the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;A general overview about the English discussion is given in Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558–1689''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Enlightenment===

In the era known as the [[Great Divergence]], when in the West the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[scientific revolution]] brought about great societal changes, Christianity was confronted with various forms of [[skepticism]] and with certain modern [[Ideology|political ideologies]] such as versions of [[socialism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=Michael|title=Catholic social thought and liberal institutions: Freedom with justice|year=1988|publisher=Transaction|isbn=978-0-88738-763-0|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pb1GDmxA1UC&amp;pg=PA63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events ranged from mere [[anti-clericalism]] to violent outbursts against Christianity such as the [[dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Chambers, ''The Western Experience'' (vol. 2) chapter 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Spanish Civil War]] and certain [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements, especially [[Russian Revolution (1917)|the Russian Revolution]] and the [[persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union]] under [[state atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival, by Christopher Marsh, page 47.

Especially pressing in Europe was the formation of [[nation states]] after the [[Napoleonic era]]. In all European countries, different Christian denominations found themselves in competition, to greater or lesser extents, with each other and with the state. Variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious, political and ideological orientation of the state. Urs Altermatt of the [[University of Fribourg]], looking specifically at Catholicisms in Europe, identifies four models for the European nations. In traditionally Catholic-majority countries such as Belgium, Spain and to some extent Austria, religious and national communities are more or less identical. Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in Poland, the Republic of Ireland and Switzerland, all countries with competing denominations. Competition is found in Germany, the Netherlands and again Switzerland, all countries with minority Catholic populations who to a greater or lesser extent did identify with the nation. Finally, separation between religion (again, specifically Catholicism) and the state is found to a great degree in France and Italy, countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altermatt|first=Urs|title=Religion und Nation: Katholizismen im Europa des 19. und 20.

The combined factors of the formation of nation states and [[ultramontanism]], especially in Germany and the Netherlands but also in England (to a much lesser extent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heimann|first=Mary|title=Catholic Devotion in Victorian England|year=1995|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-820597-5|pages=165–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;), often forced Catholic churches, organizations and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the Church, specifically the papacy. This conflict came to a head in the [[First Vatican Council]], and in Germany would lead directly to the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', where liberals and Protestants under the leadership of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] managed to severely restrict Catholic expression and organization.

Christian commitment in Europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197 | work=BBC News | title=Religion may become extinct in nine nations, study says | date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the Czech Republic and Estonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html |title=図録▽世界各国の宗教 |publisher=.ttcn.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Europe. The late 20th&amp;nbsp;century has shown the shift of Christian adherence to the [[Third World]] and southern hemisphere in general, with the West no longer the chief standard bearer of Christianity. Approximately 7.1 to 10% of [[Arabs]] are [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Christians]],&lt;ref name=Pacini&gt;{{cite book |last=Fargues|first=Philippe  |authorlink= |title=Christian Communities in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |doi= |isbn=978-0-19-829388-0 |chapter=A Demographic Perspective |editor1-last=Pacini|editor1-first=Andrea}}&lt;/ref&gt; most prevalent in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.

==Beliefs==
There are many important differences of interpretation and opinion of the [[Bible]] and [[sacred tradition]] on which Christianity is based.&lt;ref name="Olsen"&gt;Olson, ''The Mosaic of Christian Belief''.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these irreconcilable differences in theology and a lack of consensus on the core tenets of Christianity, [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] often deny that members of certain other branches are Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehrman|first1=Bart|title=Lost Christianities: the battles for scripture and the faiths we never knew|url=https://books.google.com/?id=URdACxKubDIC|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=978-0-19-518249-1|page=1|chapter=Introduction: Recouping Our Losses|quote=Many of these Christian groups, of course, refuse to consider other such groups Christian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creeds===
{{Main|Creed#Christian creeds|List of Christian creeds}}
{{Wikisource|Apostles' Creed}}
{{Wikisource|Nicene Creed}}
Concise doctrinal statements or confessions of religious beliefs are known as creeds (from Latin ''credo'', meaning "I believe"). They began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the [[Christology|Christological]] controversies of the 4th and 5th&amp;nbsp;centuries to become statements of faith.

Many [[evangelical Protestants]] reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some or all of the substance of the creeds. [[Baptists|The Baptists]] have been non-creedal "in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another."&lt;ref name=Avis&gt;Avis, Paul (2002) ''The Christian Church: An Introduction to the Major Traditions'', SPCK, London, {{ISBN|0-281-05246-8}} paperback&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.111}} Also rejecting creeds are groups with roots in the [[Restoration Movement]], such as the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], the [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]] and the [[Churches of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Howard A.

The [[Apostles' Creed]] is the most widely accepted statement of the articles of Christian faith. It is used by a number of [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechesis|catechetical]] purposes, most visibly by liturgical churches of [[Western Christian]] tradition, including the [[Latin Church]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]] and [[Western Rite Orthodoxy]]. It is also used by [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. This particular creed was developed between the 2nd and 9th&amp;nbsp;centuries. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic period]]. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pelikan/Hotchkiss, ''Creeds and Confessions of Faith in the Christian Tradition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main points include:{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
* Belief in [[God the Father]], [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[Son of God]], and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]
* The [[crucifixion of Jesus|death]], [[Harrowing of Hell|descent into hell]], [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] of Christ
* The holiness of the [[Ecclesia (church)|Church]] and the [[communion of saints]]
* Christ's [[second coming]], the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]] and [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] of the faithful.

The Nicene Creed was formulated, largely in response to [[Arianism]], at the Councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 325 and 381 respectively &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cuf.org/2005/02/we-believe-in-one-god-the-nicene-creed-at-mass/ |title="We Believe in One God….": The Nicene Creed and Mass |date=February 2005 |website= |publisher=Catholics United for the Fath |registration=yes |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Religion'', "Arianism".&lt;/ref&gt; and ratified as the universal creed of [[Christendom]] by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.&lt;ref name="ephesus"&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05491a.htm "Council of Ephesus"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Athanasian Creed]], received in the Western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian, says: "We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the [[Consubstantiality|Substance]]."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02033b.htm Athanasian Creed]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christians ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] alike) accept the use of creeds, and subscribe to at least one of the creeds mentioned above.&lt;ref name="UMC—Our Common Heritage as Christians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1806 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114032325/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1806 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 January 2006 |title=Our Common Heritage as Christians |publisher=The United Methodist Church |accessdate=31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jesus===
[[File:CompositeJesus.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Various [[Depiction of Jesus|depictions of Jesus]]]]
{{Main|Jesus|Jesus in Christianity|Christ (title)}}
{{See also|Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus in comparative mythology}}
The central tenet of Christianity is the belief in [[Jesus]] as the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]] and the [[Messiah]] (Christ). Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah, was [[anointing|anointed]] by God as savior of humanity and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecies]] of the [[Old Testament]]. The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from [[Jewish Messiah|the contemporary Jewish concept]]. The core Christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|the death and resurrection of Jesus]], [[original sin|sinful]] humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Immortality|eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', pp. 513, 649.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been many [[Christian theology|theological]] disputes over the [[Christology|nature of Jesus]] over the earliest centuries of Christian history, generally Christians believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] and "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become [[Incarnation (Christianity)|fully human]], suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, but did not [[Christian views on sin|sin]]. As fully God, he rose to life again. According to the [[New Testament]], he [[Resurrection of Jesus|rose]] from the dead,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Acts|2:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|2:31–32}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40–41}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30–31}}, {{Bibleref2|Romans|10:9}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|15:15 || 1 Cor. 15:15}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Cor|6:14}}, {{bibleref2|2Cor|4:14 || 2 Cor. 4:14}}, {{Bibleref2|Gal|1:1}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{Bibleref2|Col|2:12}}, {{bibleref2|1Thess|1:10 || 1 Thess. 11:10}}, {{Bibleref2|Heb.|13:20}}, {{bibleref2|1Pet|1:3 || 1 Pet. 1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended]] to heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Nicene Creed]]&lt;/ref&gt; and will ultimately [[Second Coming|return]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|1:9–11}} to fulfill the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]], including the [[resurrection of the dead]], the [[Last Judgment]] and final establishment of the [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Kingdom of God]].

According to the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[gospel]]s of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|conceived]] by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] and [[Nativity of Jesus|born]] from [[Mary, mother of Jesus|the Virgin Mary]]. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the canonical gospels, although [[New Testament apocrypha|infancy gospels]] were popular in antiquity. In comparison, his adulthood, especially the week before his death, is well documented in the gospels contained within the [[New Testament]], because that part of his life is believed to be most important. The biblical accounts of [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus' ministry]] include: [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]], [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]], preaching, teaching and deeds.

====Death and resurrection====
{{Main|Crucifixion of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus}}
[[File:Cristo crucificado.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''[[Christ Crucified (Velázquez)|Crucifixion]]'', representing the death of [[Jesus]] on the [[Christian Cross|Cross]], painting by [[Diego Velázquez]], 17th&amp;nbsp;century]]
Christians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith (see [[1 Corinthians 15]]) and the most important event in history.&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff. ''Resurrection: The Capstone in the Arch of Christianity''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events on which much of Christian doctrine and theology is based.&lt;ref name="ACU-Death &amp; Resurrection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/research/theology/Walsh.htm |title=The Significance of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus for the Christian |publisher=Australian Catholic University National |accessdate=16 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901153606/http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/research/theology/Walsh.htm |archivedate=1 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New Testament, Jesus was [[Crucifixion|crucified]], died a physical death, was buried within a tomb and rose from the dead three days later.{{bibleref2c|Jn.|19:30–31}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|16:1}} {{bibleref2c-nb|Mark|16:6}}

The New Testament mentions several [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]] on different occasions to his [[twelve apostles]] and [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], including "more than five hundred brethren at once",{{bibleref2c|1Cor|15:6}} before Jesus' [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] to heaven. Jesus' death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during [[Holy Week]] which includes [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter]] Sunday.

The death and resurrection of Jesus are usually considered the most important events in [[Christian theology]], partly because they demonstrate that Jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2 || John|3:16}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|5:24}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:39–40}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:47}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|10:10}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|11:25–26}}, and {{bibleref2-nb|John|17:3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian churches accept and teach the [[New Testament]] account of the resurrection of Jesus with very few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early Creeds, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', works contained in the ''Book of Concord''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the [[historical Jesus]] and the proclamation of the [[early church]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''The Foundations of New Testament Christology'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]] do not accept a literal bodily resurrection,&lt;ref&gt;A [[Jesus Seminar]] conclusion: "in the view of the Seminar, he did not rise bodily from the dead; the resurrection is based instead on [[vision hypothesis|visionary experiences]] of [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and [[Mary Magdalene|Mary]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Funk. ''The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?''.&lt;/ref&gt; seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing [[mythology|myth]]. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious [[debate]]s and [[interfaith|interfaith dialogues]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzen. ''Resurrection, Discipleship, Justice: Affirming the Resurrection Jesus Christ Today'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]], an early Christian convert and missionary, wrote, "If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless."{{bibleref2c|1Cor|15:14}} &lt;ref&gt;Ball/Johnsson (ed.). ''The Essential Jesus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salvation===
{{Main|Salvation (Christianity)}}
[[Paul the Apostle]], like Jews and Roman [[pagan]]s of his time, believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties, purity and eternal life.&lt;ref name="remedy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenbaum |first=Pamela |date=Winter 2004 |title=A Remedy for Having Been Born of Woman: Jesus, Gentiles, and Genealogy in Romans |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=671–702 |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/JBL1234.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=3 April 2009 |doi=10.2307/3268465 |jstor=3268465 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Paul, the necessary sacrifice was the death of Jesus: Gentiles who are "Christ's" are, like Israel, descendants of Abraham and "heirs according to the promise".{{bibleref2c|Gal.|3:29}} &lt;ref&gt;Wright, N.T. ''What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?'' (Oxford, 1997), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The God who raised Jesus from the dead would also give new life to the "mortal bodies" of Gentile Christians, who had become with Israel the "children of God" and were therefore no longer "in the flesh".{{bibleref2c|Rom.|8:9,11,16}} &lt;ref name="remedy" /&gt;

Modern Christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be [[eternal salvation|saved]] from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both Jews and Gentiles can be in God's family. According to both Catholic and Protestant doctrine, salvation comes by Jesus' [[substitutionary atonement|substitutionary death and resurrection]]. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians; converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be baptized.&lt;ref&gt;CCC 846; Vatican II, Lumen Gentium 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See quotations from Council of Trent on Justification at [http://www.justforcatholics.org/a14.htm Justforcatholics.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] taught that baptism was necessary for salvation, but modern Lutherans and other Protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by [[Divine grace|God's grace]], sometimes defined as "unmerited favor", even apart from baptism.

Christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals' salvation is pre-ordained by God. Reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are [[total depravity|completely incapable of self-redemption]], but that [[irresistible grace|sanctifying grace is irresistible]].&lt;ref&gt;Westminster Confession, [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/wcf.htm#chap10 Chapter X] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528062341/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/wcf.htm#chap10 |date=28 May 2014 }};&lt;br /&gt;Spurgeon, ''[http://www.spurgeon.org/calvinis.htm A Defense of Calvinism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410133140/http://www.spurgeon.org/calvinis.htm |date=10 April 2008 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast Catholics, Orthodox Christians and [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Protestants believe that the exercise of [[free will]] is necessary to have faith in Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]|title=Grace and Justification|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815001751/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm|archivedate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinity===
{{Main|Trinity}}
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Trinity]] is the belief that [[God in Christianity|God]] is one God in three persons: the [[God the Father|Father]], the [[God the Son|Son]] ([[Jesus]]), and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="def-lateran"&gt;Definition of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] quoted in ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#1FT §253].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

But still, God still existed as three persons in each of these times.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, "Encyclopedia Of Christianity, pg1207&lt;/ref&gt; However, traditionally there is a belief that it was the Son who appeared in the Old Testament because, for example, when the [[Trinity#Art|Trinity is depicted in art]], the Son typically has the distinctive appearance, a [[cruciform halo]] identifying Christ, and in depictions of the [[Garden of Eden]] this looks forward to an Incarnation yet to occur.

The [[Trinity]] is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity. From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed, 325, Christianity advocated&lt;ref&gt;''Examples of ante-Nicene statements'':{{quote|Hence all the power of magic became dissolved; and every bond of wickedness was destroyed, men's ignorance was taken away, and the old kingdom abolished God Himself appearing in the form of a man, for the renewal of eternal life.|St. Ignatius of Antioch in ''Letter to the Ephesians'', ch.4, shorter version, Roberts-Donaldson translation}}{{quote|We have also as a Physician the Lord our God Jesus the Christ the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began, but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin.

According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see [[Perichoresis]]). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and (in [[Western Christian]] theology) [[Filioque|from the Son]]. Regardless of this apparent difference, the three "persons" are each [[eternity|eternal]] and [[omnipotent]]. Other Christian religions including [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormonism]] and others do not share those views on the Trinity.

====Trinitarians====
{{Main|Trinitarianism}}
''Trinitarianism'' denotes those Christians who believe in the concept of the [[Trinity]]. Almost all Christian denominations and churches hold Trinitarian beliefs. Although the words "Trinity" and "Triune" do not appear in the Bible, theologians beginning in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the New Testament teachings of God as being Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Since that time, Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply that there are three gods (the antitrinitarian heresy of [[Tritheism]]), nor that each hypostasis of the Trinity is one-third of an infinite God (partialism), nor that the Son and the Holy Spirit are beings created by and subordinate to the Father ([[Arianism]]). Rather, the Trinity is defined as one God in three Persons.&lt;ref&gt;Moltman, Jurgen. ''The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God.'' Tr. from German. Fortress Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8006-2825-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nontrinitarianism====
{{Main|Nontrinitarianism}}
''Nontrinitarianism'' (or ''antitrinitarianism'') refers to theology that rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. Various nontrinitarian views, such as [[adoptionism]] or [[modalism]], existed in early Christianity, leading to the disputes about [[Christology]].&lt;ref&gt;Harnack, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html History of Dogma]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Cathars]] in the 11th through 13th&amp;nbsp;centuries, among groups with [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theology in the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th&amp;nbsp;century,&lt;ref&gt;Pocket Dictionary of Church History Nathan P. Feldmeth p.135 "Unitarianism. Unitarians emerged from Protestant Christian beginnings in the sixteenth century with a central focus on the unity of God and subsequent denial of the doctrine of the Trinity"&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and in some groups arising during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.

===Scriptures===
{{Main|Bible|Biblical canon|Development of the Christian biblical canon}}
[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|The [[Bible]] is the sacred book in Christianity.]]
Christianity, like other religions, has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary. Christianity regards the [[biblical canon]], the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]], as the [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] word of God. The traditional view of inspiration is that God worked through human authors so that what they produced was what God wished to communicate. The Greek word referring to inspiration in {{bibleref2|2Timothy|3:16||2 Timothy 3:16}} is ''theopneustos'', which literally means "God-breathed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation |edition=2nd |last=Virkler |first=Henry A. |editor-last=Ayayo |editor-first=Karelynne Gerber |year=2007 |publisher=Baker Academic |location=Grand Rapids, USA |isbn=978-0-8010-3138-0 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that divine inspiration makes our present Bibles [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]]. Others claim inerrancy for the Bible in its original manuscripts, although none of those are extant. Still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant, such as the [[King James Version]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]|title=Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909213651/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm|archivedate=9 September 2010}}(§105–108)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Second Helvetic Confession, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071203120450/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm ''Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html ''online text'']&lt;/ref&gt; Another closely related view is [[biblical infallibility]] or limited inerrancy, which affirms that the Bible is free of error as a guide to salvation, but may include errors on matters such as history, geography or science.

The [[books of the Bible]] accepted by the Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches vary somewhat, with Jews accepting only the Hebrew Bible as canonical; there is however substantial overlap. These variations are a reflection of the range of [[tradition]]s, and of the [[Ecumenical council|councils]] that have convened on the subject. Every version of the Old Testament always includes the books of the [[Tanakh]], the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The Catholic and Orthodox canons, in addition to the Tanakh, also include the [[deuterocanonical books]] as part of the Old Testament. These books appear in the [[Septuagint]], but are regarded by Protestants to be [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]]. However, they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words, grammar and syntax used in the historical period of their conception. Some versions of the Bible include a separate Apocrypha section between the Old Testament and the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament, originally written in [[Koine Greek]], contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all churches.

Modern scholarship has raised many issues with the Bible. While the [[Authorized King James Version]] is held to by many because of its striking English prose, in fact it was translated from the Erasmus Greek Bible which in turn "was based on a single 12th&amp;nbsp;Century manuscript that is one of the worst manuscripts we have available to us".&lt;ref name="Ehrman209-183"&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (2005). Misquoting Jesus: the story behind who changed the Bible and why. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco {{ISBN|978-0060738174}} pages 209, 183&lt;/ref&gt; Much scholarship in the past several hundred years has gone into comparing different manuscripts in order to reconstruct the original text. Another issue is that several books are considered to be forgeries. The injunction that women "be silent and submissive" in 1 Timothy 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:11-12&amp;version=NIV |title=1 Timothy 2:11–12 NIV – A woman should learn in quietness and |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is thought by many to be a forgery by a follower of Paul, a similar phrase in 1 Corinthians 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2014:34-35&amp;version=NIV |title=1 corinthians 14:34–35 NIV – Women should remain silent in the |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is thought to be by Paul, appears in different places in different manuscripts and is thought to originally be a margin note by a copyist.&lt;ref name="Ehrman209-183" /&gt; Other verses in 1 Corinthians, such as 1 Corinthians 11:2–16 where women are instructed to wear a covering over their hair "when they pray or prophesies",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2011:2-16&amp;version=NIV |title=1 corinthians 11:2–16 NIV – On Covering the Head in Worship – I |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; contradict this verse.

A final issue with the Bible is the way in which books were selected for inclusion in the New Testament. [[Gnostic Gospels|Other Gospels]] have now been recovered, such as those found near [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945, and while some of these texts are quite different from what Christians have been used to, it should be understood that some of this newly recovered Gospel material is quite possibly contemporaneous with, or even earlier than, the New Testament Gospels. The core of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], in particular, may date from as early as AD 50 (although some major scholars contest this early dating),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=N.T.|title=The New Testament and the People of God|date=1992|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8006-2681-5|pages=435–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if so would provide an insight into the earliest gospel texts that underlie the canonical Gospels, texts that are mentioned in Luke 1:1–2. The Gospel of Thomas contains much that is familiar from the canonical Gospels—verse 113, for example ("The Father's Kingdom is spread out upon the earth, but people do not see it"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html |title=The Gospel of Thomas Collection – Translations and Resources |publisher=Gnosis.org |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is reminiscent of Luke 17:20–21&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+17%3A20-21&amp;version=NIV |title=Luke 17:20–21 NIV – The Coming of the Kingdom of God |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmnet.com.au/australian_landscape_photos/writer/Reflections.html |title=Reflections on religions |publisher=Mmnet.com.au |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the [[Gospel of John]], with a terminology and approach that is suggestive of what was later termed ''Gnosticism'', has recently been seen as a possible response to the Gospel of Thomas, a text that is commonly labelled ''proto-Gnostic''. Scholarship, then, is currently exploring the relationship in the [[Early Christianity|Early Church]] between mystical speculation and experience on the one hand and the search for church order on the other, by analyzing new-found texts, by subjecting canonical texts to further scrutiny, and by an examination of the passage of New Testament texts to canonical status.

====Catholic interpretation====
[[File:View of saint Peter basilica from a roof.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]], the largest church in the world and a symbol of the [[Catholic Church]]]]{{Main|Catholic theology of Scripture}}
In antiquity, two schools of exegesis developed in [[Alexandria]] and [[School of Antioch|Antioch]]. Alexandrian interpretation, exemplified by [[Origen]], tended to read Scripture [[allegory|allegorically]], while Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called ''[[theoria]]'') could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''Early Christian Doctrines''. pp. 69–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, ''The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture'' § 115–118]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325191945/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III |date=25 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''literal'' sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture. The ''spiritual'' sense is further subdivided into:
* The ''allegorical'' sense, which includes [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. An example would be the [[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]] being understood as a "type" (sign) of baptism.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|10:2}}
* The ''[[moral]]'' sense, which understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.
* The ''[[anagoge|anagogical]]'' sense, which applies to [[eschatology]], eternity and the [[Apocalypse|consummation of the world]]

Regarding [[exegesis]], following the rules of sound interpretation, Catholic theology holds:
* The injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the ''literal''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm "Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906114843/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm |date=6 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325191945/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III |date=25 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly held&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Vatican Council]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html ''Dei Verbum'' (V.19)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531175312/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html |date=31 May 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That scripture must be read within the "living Tradition of the whole Church"&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III "The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture" § 113]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325191945/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III |date=25 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* That "the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III "The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith" § 85]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403212113/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III |date=3 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestant interpretation====
[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Protestants]] believe [[Martin Luther]]'s basic beliefs against the Catholic Church: [[Sola scriptura]] (by Scripture alone), [[Sola fide]] (by faith alone), [[Sola gratia]] (by grace alone), [[Solus Christus]] (through Christ alone) and [[Soli Deo gloria]] (glory to God alone).]]

=====Clarity of Scripture=====
Protestant Christians believe that the Bible is a self-sufficient revelation, the final authority on all Christian doctrine, and [[Revelation|revealed all truth]] necessary for salvation. This concept is known as ''[[sola scriptura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC&amp;pg=PA15|title=The Shape of Sola Scriptura |author=[[Keith A.

Martin Luther believed that without God's help Scripture would be "enveloped in darkness".&lt;ref name="Foutz" /&gt; He advocated "one definite and simple understanding of Scripture".&lt;ref name="Foutz"&gt;{{cite web |last=Foutz |first=Scott David |url=http://www.quodlibet.net/luther.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000414063800/http://www.quodlibet.net/luther.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 April 2000 |title=Martin Luther and Scripture |publisher=Quodlibet Journal |accessdate=16 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]] wrote, "all who refuse not to follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light".&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom45.vii.iv.iv.html '' Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles'' 2 Peter 3:14–18]&lt;/ref&gt; The Second [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] Confession, composed by the pastor of the Reformed church in Zürich (successor to Protestant reformer [[Zwingli]]) was adopted as a declaration of doctrine by most European Reformed churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c02.htm |title=The Second Helvetic Confession, Chapter 2 –  Of Interpreting the Holy Scriptures; and of Fathers, Councils, and Traditions |date=11 December 2007 |publisher=Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211005549/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c02.htm |archivedate=11 December 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Original intended meaning of Scripture=====
Protestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture, the [[historical-grammatical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Sproul. ''Knowing Scripture'', pp. 45–61; Bahnsen, ''[http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pt173.htm A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics'' (article 6)''].''&lt;/ref&gt; The historical-grammatical method or grammatico-historical method is an effort in [[Biblical hermeneutics]] to find the intended original meaning in the text.&lt;ref name="Elwell565"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Baker Book House |isbn=978-0-8010-3413-8 |last=Elwell |first=Walter A. |title=Evangelical Dictionary of Theology |location=Grand Rapids, Mich. |year=1984 |page=565|title-link=Evangelical Dictionary of Theology }}&lt;/ref&gt; This original intended meaning of the text is drawn out through examination of the passage in light of the grammatical and syntactical aspects, the historical background, the literary genre as well as theological (canonical) considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Academie Books |isbn=978-0-310-34160-4 |last=Johnson |first=Elliott |title=Expository hermeneutics : an introduction |location=Grand Rapids Mich. |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical-grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning and the significance of the text. The significance of the text includes the ensuing use of the text or application. The original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense. As Milton S. Terry said: "A fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection.

===Eschatology===
{{Main|Christian eschatology}}
[[File:Kohrvirab.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The 7th-century [[Khor Virap]] monastery in the shadow of [[Mount Ararat]]. [[Armenia]] was the first state to adopt Christianity as the state religion, in AD 301.&lt;ref name="Armenia"/&gt;]]
The end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, or the end of the world, broadly speaking is Christian eschatology; the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the Bible. The major issues in Christian eschatology are the [[Great Tribulation|Tribulation]], death and the afterlife, the [[Rapture]], the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, [[Resurrection of the Dead]], Heaven and Hell, [[Millennialism]], the [[Last Judgment]], the end of the world and the [[New Heavens and New Earth]].

Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the [[eschatology|end of time]] after a period of severe persecution (the Great Tribulation). All who have died will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected bodily from the dead]] for the Last Judgment. Jesus will fully establish the [[Kingdom of God]] in fulfillment of [[Bible prophecy|scriptural prophecies]].&lt;ref name="res"&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm ''Summa Theologicum, Supplementum Tertiae Partis''] questions 69 through 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Calvin | first =John | title =Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Three, Ch. 25 | website = | publisher =www.reformed.org | date = | url =http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book3/bk3ch25.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death and afterlife====
Most Christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or [[hell|eternal damnation]]. This includes the [[Last Judgment|general judgement]] at the [[resurrection of the dead]] as well as the belief (held by Catholics,&lt;ref name="CEParticularJudgement"&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm Particular Judgment]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ott"&gt;Ott, ''Grundriß der Dogmatik'', p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox&lt;ref&gt;David Moser, ''[http://www.orthodox.net/articles/about-prayer-for-the-dead.html What the Orthodox believe concerning prayer for the dead]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ken Collins, ''[http://www.kencollins.com/question-45.htm What Happens to Me When I Die?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928055816/http://www.kencollins.com/question-45.htm |date=28 September 2008 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt; and most Protestants) in a [[particular judgment|judgment particular to the individual soul]] upon physical death.

In Catholicism, those who die in a state of grace, i.e., without any mortal sin separating them from God, but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin, undergo purification through the intermediate state of [[purgatory]] to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into God's presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_04081999_en.html |title=Audience of 4 August 1999 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=4 August 1999 |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have attained this goal are called ''saints'' (Latin ''sanctus'', "holy").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm The Communion of Saints]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold to [[Christian mortalism|mortalism]], the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal, and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection. These Christians also hold to [[Annihilationism]], the belief that subsequent to the final judgement, the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer everlasting torment. Jehovah's Witnesses hold to a similar view.&lt;ref&gt;"The death that Adam brought into the world is spiritual as well as physical, and only those who gain entrance into the Kingdom of God will exist eternally. However, this division will not occur until Armageddon, when all people will be resurrected and given a chance to gain eternal life. In the meantime, "the dead are conscious of nothing."

==Worship==
{{Main|Christian worship|Church service}}
{{See also|Mass (liturgy)|Reformed worship|Contemporary worship}}
[[File:Thebible33.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|Samples of [[Catholic]] religious objects—the [[Bible]], a [[crucifix]] and a [[rosary]]]]
[[Justin Martyr]] described 2nd-century Christian [[liturgy]] in his ''[[First Apology]]'' (c. 150) to Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the [[Presbyter|president]] verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying [[Amen]]; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need.&lt;ref name="justin"&gt;Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html ''First Apology''] §LXVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the gospel accounts. Often these are arranged on an [[annual cycle]], using a book called a [[lectionary]]. Instruction is given based on these readings, called a [[sermon]], or homily. There are a variety of congregational [[prayer]]s, including thanksgiving, confession and intercession, which occur throughout the [[Church service|service]] and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung. The [[Lord's Prayer]], or Our Father, is regularly prayed.

[[File:Worship-team.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A modern Protestant worship band leading a contemporary worship session]]
Some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between "[[High church|High]]" church services, characterized by greater solemnity and ritual, and "[[Low church|Low]]" services, but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of [[Christian worship|worship]]. [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] meet on Saturday, while others do not meet on a weekly basis. [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] or [[Pentecostal]] congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service, including spontaneous prayer. [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak.

Some [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] services resemble concerts with [[Christian rock|rock and pop music]], dancing and use of multimedia. For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally led by a [[minister of religion|minister]], [[preacher]], or [[pastor]]. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only [[a cappella]] music, either on principle (for example, many [[Churches of Christ]] object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).

Nearly all forms of [[churchmanship]] celebrate the [[Eucharist]] (Holy Communion), which consists of a consecrated meal. It is reenacted in accordance with Jesus' instruction at the Last Supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples [[Sacramental bread|bread]], saying, "This is my body", and gave them [[sacramental wine|wine]] saying, "This is my blood".&lt;ref&gt;Ignazio Silone, ''Bread and Wine'' (1937).&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Christian denominations]] practice [[closed communion]]. They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church. Catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of [[mortal sin]]. Most other churches practice [[open communion]] since they view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all believing Christians to participate.

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Savior, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.

In Christian belief and practice, a ''sacrament'' is a [[rite]], instituted by Christ, that confers [[divine grace|grace]], constituting a [[Sacred Mysteries|sacred mystery]]. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''. Views concerning both which rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament, vary among Christian denominations and traditions.&lt;ref name="ODCC1435"&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 1435f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the Orthodox tradition), [[Holy orders]] ([[ordination]]), [[Penance]] (or [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), [[Anointing of the Sick]] and [[Matrimony]] (see [[Christian views on marriage]]).&lt;ref name="ODCC1435" /&gt;

Taken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognized by churches in the [[High Church]] tradition—notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], many [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]] and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.&lt;ref name="ODCC1435" /&gt; [[Christian denominations]], such as [[Baptists]], which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]'' rather than sacraments.

In addition to this, the [[Church of the East]] has two additional sacraments in place of the traditional sacraments of Matrimony and the Anointing of the Sick. These include [[Holy Leaven]] (Melka) and the [[sign of the cross]].&lt;ref name="Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand and Lebanon"&gt;''Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand and Lebanon.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical calendar===
{{Main|Liturgical year}}
{{See also|Calendar of saints}}
[[File:Nativity tree2011.jpg|thumb|left|A [[nativity scene|depiction of the Nativity]] with a [[Christmas tree]] backdrop]]
Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around the [[liturgical year]]. The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of [[season]]s, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of [[parament]]s and [[vestment]]s for clergy,&lt;ref name="calendar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fortescue|first1=Adrian|title=Christian Calendar|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03158a.htm|website=The Catholic Encyclopedia.|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=18 July 2014|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.

Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name="calendar" /&gt; and Eastern Christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective [[Rite#Christian|rites]]. Calendars set aside holy days, such as [[Solemnity|solemnities]] which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus, Mary or the [[saint]]s, and periods of [[fasting]], such as [[Lent]] and other pious events such as [[memoria]] or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]]: these are the celebrations of Christ's birth, resurrection and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively. A few denominations make no use of a liturgical calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman. ''Handbook of the Christian Year''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
{{Main|Christian symbolism}}
[[File:Nideggen-St.Johannes Baptist249.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[Christian cross|cross]] and the fish are two common symbols of [[Jesus Christ]]. The letters of the Greek word ΙΧΘΥΣ [[Ichthys]] (fish) form an acronym for "Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ", which translates into English as "Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior".]]
Christianity has not generally practiced [[Aniconism in Christianity|aniconism]], the avoidance or prohibition of devotional images, even if early [[Jewish Christian]]s and some modern [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of [[idolatry]], avoided figures in their symbols.

The [[Christian cross|cross]], today one of the most widely recognized symbols, was used by Christians from the earliest times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm |title=ANF04. Fathers of the Third Century: Tertullian, Part Fourth; Minucius Felix; Commodian; Origen, Parts First and Second &amp;#124; Christian Classics Ethereal Library |publisher=Ccel.org |date=1 June 2005 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minucius Felix speaks of the cross of Jesus in its familiar form, likening it to objects with a crossbeam or to a man with arms outstretched in prayer ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm#P5713_906729 Octavius of Minucius Felix], chapter XXIX).&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian, in his book ''De Corona'', tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace the sign of the cross on their foreheads.&lt;ref&gt;"At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign." (Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html ''De Corona'', chapter 3])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cross was known to the early Christians, the [[crucifix]] did not appear in use until the 5th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="soc"&gt;Dilasser. ''The Symbols of the Church''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest Christian symbols, that of the fish or [[Ichthys]] seems to have ranked first in importance, as seen on monumental sources such as tombs from the first decades of the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="cefish"&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083a.htm Symbolism of the Fish]".&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity seemingly arose from the Greek word ''ichthys'' (fish) forming an [[acronym]] for the Greek phrase ''Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter'' (Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ),{{refn|group=note|''Iesous Christos Theou '''H'''yios Soter'' would be a more complete transliteration; in Greek though, the daseia or [[spiritus asper]] was not—commonly—marked in the [[majuscule]] script of the time.}} (Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior), a concise summary of Christian faith.&lt;ref name="cefish" /&gt;

Other major Christian symbols include the [[Chi-Rho|chi-rho monogram]], the [[dove]] (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (representing Christ's sacrifice), the [[vine]] (symbolizing the connection of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from passages of the New Testament.&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt;

===Baptism===
{{Main|Baptism}}
[[File:Almeida Júnior - Batismo de Jesus, 1895.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The baptism of Jesus depicted by [[José Ferraz de Almeida Júnior|Almeida Júnior]]]]
Baptism is the ritual act, with the use of water, by which a person is admitted to membership of the [[Christian Church|Church]]. Beliefs on baptism vary among denominations. Differences occur firstly on whether the act has any spiritual significance. Some, such as the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, as well as Lutherans and Anglicans, hold to the doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]], which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person's faith, and is intimately linked to salvation. Others view baptism as a purely symbolic act, an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person, but not as spiritually efficacious. Secondly, there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act. These methods are: by [[Immersion baptism|''immersion'']]; if immersion is total, by ''submersion''; by [[affusion]] (pouring); and by [[aspersion]] (sprinkling). Those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of [[infant baptism]];&lt;ref&gt;"Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1213] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722003736/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM |date=22 July 2016 }}); "Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ's Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God" ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#Holy Book of Common Prayer, 1979, Episcopal );] "Baptism is the sacrament of initiation and incorporation into the body of Christ" ([http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/by_water_and_the_spirit.pdf By Water and The Spirit – The Official United Methodist Understanding of Baptism (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313053601/http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/by_water_and_the_spirit.pdf |date=13 March 2016 }};&lt;br /&gt;"As an initiatory rite into membership of the Family of God, baptismal candidates are symbolically purified or washed as their sins have been forgiven and washed away" ([[William H. Brackney]], [http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/baptism.htm Doing Baptism Baptist Style{{snd}} Believer's Baptism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107183031/http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/baptism.htm |date=7 January 2010 }})&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Orthodox Church]]es all practice infant baptism and always baptize by total immersion repeated three times in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;"After the proclamation of faith, the baptismal water is prayed over and blessed as the sign of the goodness of God's creation. The person to be baptized is also prayed over and blessed with sanctified oil as the sign that his creation by God is holy and good. And then, after the solemn proclamation of "Alleluia" (God be praised), the person is immersed three times in the water in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit" ([http://www.oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID=2&amp;ID=51 Orthodox Church in America: Baptism).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the Orthodox Church we totally immerse, because such total immersion symbolizes death. What death? The death of the "old, sinful man". After Baptism we are freed from the dominion of sin, even though after Baptism we retain an inclination and tendency toward evil.", Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, article "[http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/faq/faqbaptism Baptism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930002357/http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/faq/faqbaptism |date=30 September 2014 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church also practices infant baptism,&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm#403 403], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm 1231, 1233, 1250, 1252].&lt;/ref&gt; usually by affusion, and utilizing the [[Trinitarian formula]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm#1240 1240].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prayer===
{{Main|Prayer in Christianity}}
Jesus' teaching on prayer in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer. A concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as 'pagan', and instead a simple trust in God's fatherly goodness is encouraged.{{bibleref2c|Mat.|6:5–15}} Elsewhere in the New Testament this same freedom of access to God is also emphasized.{{bibleref2c|Phil.|4:6}}{{bibleref2c|Jam.|5:13–19}} This confident position should be understood in light of Christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and Christ through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name="NBDprayer"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Alexander, T. D. |editor2=Rosner, B. S |year=2001 |title =Prayer |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Biblical Theology|publisher= Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent Christian traditions, certain physical gestures are emphasized, including medieval gestures such as [[genuflection]] or making the [[sign of the cross]]. [[Kneeling]], bowing and [[prostration]]s (see also [[poklon]]) are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity. Frequently in Western Christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal [[commendation ceremony]]. At other times the older [[orans]] posture may be used, with palms up and elbows in.

''Intercessory prayer'' is prayer offered for the benefit of other people. There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible, including prayers of the [[Apostle Peter]] on behalf of sick persons{{bibleref2c|Acts|9:40}} and by [[prophet]]s of the Old Testament in favor of other people.{{bibleref2c|1Ki|17:19–22}} In the [[Epistle of James]], no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet [[Elijah]].{{bibleref2c|Jam|5:16–18}} The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying.&lt;ref name="NBDprayer"/&gt;

The ancient church, in both [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Western Christianity]], developed a tradition of asking for the [[intercession of saints|intercession of (deceased) saints]], and this remains the practice of most [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and some [[Anglican]] churches. Churches of the Protestant Reformation, however, rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1=Ferguson, S. B. |author2=Packer, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1988 |title =Saints |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Theology|publisher= Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was [[idolatry in Christianity|idolatrous]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Gray, ''The Protestant Reformation'', (Sussex Academic Press, 2003), page 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]: "Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/catechism/p4s1.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: Part Four – Christian Prayer |publisher=Va |date= |accessdate=19 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Common Prayer]] in the Anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services, containing set prayers, scripture readings, and hymns or sung Psalms.

By reason of [[Protestant ecclesiology]], ever since its emergence in the 16th century Protestantism comprises the widest diversity of groupings and practices. In addition to the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] (or Calvinist) branches of the Reformation, there is [[Anglicanism]] after the [[English Reformation]]. The [[Anabaptist]] tradition was largely ostracized by the other Protestant parties at the time, but has achieved a measure of affirmation in more recent history.

{{Main|Assyrian Church of the East}}
The [[Assyrian Church of the East]], with an unbroken patriarchate established in the 17th century, is an independent [[Eastern Christian]] denomination which claims continuity from the [[Church of the East]] – in parallel to the Catholic patriarchate established in the 16th century that evolved into the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], an [[Eastern Catholic]] church in [[full communion]] with the [[Pope]]. It is an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] [[Christian denomination|Church]] that follows the traditional [[christology]] and [[ecclesiology]] of the historical Church of the East. Largely [[Aniconism in Christianity|aniconic]] and not in [[communion (Christianity)|communion]] with any other church, it belongs to the eastern branch of [[Syriac Christianity]], and uses the [[East Syriac Rite]] in its [[liturgy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Baumer|first=Christoph|title=The Church of the East: An Illustrated History of Assyrian Christianity|year=2006|location=London-New York|publisher=Tauris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ7ZAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main spoken language is [[Syriac language|Syriac]], a dialect of [[Eastern Aramaic]], and the majority of its adherents are ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. It is officially headquartered in the city of [[Erbil]] in northern [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], and its original area also spreads into south-eastern [[Turkey]] and north-western [[Iran]], corresponding to ancient [[Assyria]].  Its hierarchy is composed of [[metropolitan bishop]]s and [[diocesan bishop]]s, while lower clergy consists of [[priest]]s and [[deacon]]s, who serve in dioceses (eparchies) and parishes throughout the [[Middle East]], [[India]], [[North America]], [[Oceania]], and [[Europe]] (including the [[Caucasus]] and [[Russia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Hunter|first=Erica C.

It is one of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] churches that claim continuity with the historical [[Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] – the Church of the East, one of the oldest Christian churches in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnewa.us/default.aspx?ID=1&amp;pagetypeID=9&amp;sitecode=HQ&amp;pageno=1 |title=CNEWA: Ronald G.

===Protestantism===
{{Main|Protestantism}}
{{Protestantism}}
In the 16th century, [[Martin Luther]], and subsequently [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], inaugurated what has come to be called [[Protestantism]]. Luther's primary theological heirs are known as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. Zwingli and Calvin's heirs are far broader denominationally, and are broadly referred to as the [[Reformed|Reformed tradition]].&lt;ref name="McManners251"&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. pp. 251–59.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Protestant groups separated from the Catholic Church in the [[Protestant Reformation]], often followed by further divisions.&lt;ref name="McManners251"/&gt;

In the 18th century, for example, [[Methodism]] grew out of [[Anglican]] minister [[John Wesley]]'s evangelical and [[Holiness Movement|revival movement]].&lt;ref name="Methodist Central Hall Westminster—Methodism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.methodist-central-hall.org.uk/history/WhatisMethodism.htm |title=About The Methodist Church |publisher=Methodist Central Hall Westminster |accessdate=31 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121041402/http://www.methodist-central-hall.org.uk/history/WhatisMethodism.htm |archivedate=21 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Pentecostal]] and [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational churches]], which emphasize the cleansing power of the [[Holy Spirit]], in turn grew out of Methodism.&lt;ref name="FYW—Pentecostalism"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.godpreach.com/christianity-pentecostal-churches/|title = Christianity: Pentecostal Churches|publisher = GodPreach, Inc.|accessdate = 31 December 2007|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150211234057/http://www.godpreach.com/christianity-pentecostal-churches/|archivedate = 11 February 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Methodists, Pentecostals and other evangelicals stress "accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior",&lt;ref name="CUMC Accepting Christ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgechristumc.com/statementofbelief.htm |title=Statement of Belief |publisher=Cambridge Christ United Methodist Church |accessdate=31 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101604/http://www.cambridgechristumc.com/statementofbelief.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from Wesley's emphasis of the [[Born again (Christianity)|New Birth]],&lt;ref name="UMC GBGM-The New Birth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.gbgm-umc.org/umhistory/wesley/sermons/45/ |title=The New Birth by John Wesley (Sermon 45) |publisher=The United Methodist Church GBGM |accessdate=31 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913232442/http://new.gbgm-umc.org/umhistory/wesley/sermons/45/ |archivedate=13 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; they often refer to themselves as being [[Born again Christianity|born-again]].&lt;ref name="UMC GBGM-Grace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/wesley/walk.stm |title=God's Preparing, Accepting, and Sustaining Grace |publisher=The United Methodist Church GBGM |accessdate=31 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109013416/http://gbgm-umc.org/UMW/Wesley/walk.stm |archivedate=9 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren Wilson College—Total Experience of the Spirit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/newifo/religions/christianity/index/pentecostal/essay.shtml |title=Total Experience of the Spirit |publisher=Warren Wilson College |accessdate=31 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903030820/http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/newifo/religions/christianity/index/pentecostal/essay.shtml |archivedate=3 September 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain, but it seems clear that Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Catholicism in number of followers (although the Eastern Orthodox Church is larger than any single Protestant denomination).&lt;ref name="Adherents" /&gt; Often that number is put at more than 800 million, corresponding to nearly 40% of world's Christians.&lt;ref name="pewforum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2011/12/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf |title=Pewforum: Christianity (2010) |format=PDF |accessdate=14 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805020311/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2011/12/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf# |archive-date=5 August 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Protestants are members of just a handful of denominational families, i.e. [[Adventism|Adventists]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism|Reformed (Calvinists)]],&lt;ref&gt;This branch was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word ''Reformed''. It includes [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]].&lt;ref name="pewforum1"/&gt; [[Nondenominational Christianity|Nondenominational]], [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]], [[Neo-charismatic churches|neo-charismatic]], independent and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/evangelical-churches World Council of Churches: Evangelical churches]: "Evangelical churches have grown exponentially in the second half of the 20th century and continue to show great vitality, especially in the global South. This resurgence may in part be explained by the phenomenal growth of Pentecostalism and the emergence of the charismatic movement, which are closely associated with evangelicalism. However, there can be no doubt that the evangelical tradition "per se" has become one of the major components of world Christianity. Evangelicals also constitute sizable minorities in the traditional Protestant and Anglican churches. In regions like Africa and Latin America, the boundaries between "evangelical" and "mainline" are rapidly changing and giving way to new ecclesial realities."&lt;/ref&gt;

A special grouping are the Anglican churches descended from the [[Church of England]] and organized in the [[Anglican Communion]]. Some Anglican churches consider themselves both Protestant and Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes/Booty/Knight. ''The Study of Anglicanism'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Anglicans consider their church a [[Branch theory|branch of the "One Holy Catholic Church"]] alongside of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, a concept rejected by the Catholic Church, some Eastern Orthodox, and many [[evangelical Anglican]]s themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hallam, ''[http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/ecumenical/hallam_orthodoxy_ecumenism.htm Orthodoxy and Ecumenism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Mathewes-Green, "[http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html Whither the Branch Theory?]", ''Anglican Orthodox Pilgrim'' Vol. 2, No. 4. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519104645/http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html |date=19 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Anglican, Lutheran and the Reformed branches of Protestantism originated in the [[Magisterial Reformation]], other groups such as the [[Anabaptists]], who often do not consider themselves to be Protestant, originated in the [[Radical Reformation]], and are distinguished by their rejection of infant baptism; they believe in baptism only of adult believers — [[credobaptism]] (Anabaptists include the [[Amish]], [[Apostolic Christian Church|Apostolic]], [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], [[Mennonites]], [[Hutterites]] and [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]/[[German Baptist]] groups.)&lt;ref name="BenedettoDuke2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benedetto|first1=Robert|last2=Duke|first2=James O.|title=The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History|year=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664224165|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Littell2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Littell|first=Franklin H.|title=The Anabaptist View of the Church|year=2000|publisher=The Baptist Standard Bearer, Inc.|language=English|isbn=9781579788360|page=79|quote=In reviewing the records, the reader is struck with the Anabaptists' acute consciousness of separation from the "fallen" church — in which they included the Reformers as well as the Roman institution. Some writers have therefore concluded that Anabaptism is not merely a variant form of Protestantism, but rather an ideology and practice quite different in kind from those of both Rome and the Reformers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mennoniteusa.org/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are: A Quick Visual Guide|year=2018|publisher=Mennonite Church USA|language=English|accessdate=26 April 2018|quote=Anabaptists: We are neither Catholic nor Protestant, but we share ties to those streams of Christianity. We cooperate as a sign of our unity in Christ and in ways that extend the reign of God's Kingdom on earth.  We are known as "Anabaptists" (not anti-Baptist) — meaning "rebaptizers."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as "Christians" or "[[born-again]] Christians". They typically distance themselves from the [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]] and [[creed]]alism of other Christian communities&lt;ref&gt;Confessionalism is a term employed by historians to refer to "the creation of fixed identities and systems of beliefs for separate churches which had previously been more fluid in their self-understanding, and which had not begun by seeking separate identities for themselves—they had wanted to be truly Catholic and reformed." (MacCulloch, ''The Reformation: A History'', p. xxiv.)&lt;/ref&gt; by calling themselves "[[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]]" or "[[evangelical]]". Often founded by individual pastors, they have little affiliation with historic denominations.&lt;ref name="Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life / U.S. Religious Landscape Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-appendix3.pdf |title = Classification of Protestant Denominations|publisher = Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life / U.S. Religious Landscape Survey|accessdate = 27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Great Awakening]], a period of religious revival that occurred in the United States during the early 1800s, saw the development of a number of unrelated churches. They generally saw themselves as [[Restorationism|restoring]] the original church of Jesus Christ rather than reforming one of the existing churches.&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 91f.&lt;/ref&gt; A common belief held by Restorationists was that the other divisions of Christianity had introduced doctrinal defects into Christianity, which was known as the [[Great Apostasy]].&lt;ref name="Religious Tolerance—Restorationism"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/chrrest.htm| title = The Restorationist Movements|publisher = Religious Tolerance|accessdate = 31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia, [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] is a known restorationist religion that was established during the early 1900s.

Some of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early 19th-century camp meetings in the Midwest and Upstate New York. One of the largest churches produced from the movement is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts {{!}} Total Church Membership|work=www.mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Millennialism]] and [[Adventism]], which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, influenced the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] movement and, as a reaction specifically to [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. Others, including the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton's Encyclopedia of American Religions (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Churches of Christ]], and the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]], have their roots in the contemporaneous Stone-Campbell [[Restoration Movement]], which was centered in Kentucky and Tennessee. Other groups originating in this time period include the [[Christadelphians]] and the previously mentioned [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. While the churches originating in the Second Great Awakening have some superficial similarities, their doctrine and practices vary significantly.

Various smaller [[Independent Catholic]] communities, such as the [[Old Catholic Church]], include the word ''[[Catholic (term)|Catholic]]'' in their title, and arguably have more or less liturgical practices in common with the [[Catholic Church]], but are no longer in [[full communion]] with the [[Holy See]].

[[Spiritual Christians]], such as the [[Doukhobor]] and [[Molokan]], broke from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and maintain close association with Mennonites and [[Quakers]] due to similar religious practices; all of these groups are furthermore collectively considered to be [[peace churches]] due to their belief in [[Christian pacifism|pacifism]].&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin|title=The Encyclodedia of Christianity|date=14 February 2008|publisher=Wm.

[[Messianic Judaism]] (or Messianic Movement) is the name of a Christian movement comprising a number of streams, whose members may consider themselves Jewish. The movement originated in the 1960s and 1970s, and it blends elements of religious Jewish practice with evangelical Christianity. Messianic Judaism affirms Christian creeds such as the messiahship and divinity of "Yeshua" (the Hebrew name of Jesus) and the Triune Nature of God, while also adhering to some Jewish dietary laws and customs.&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p208&gt;{{Cite book

[[Cultural Christian]]s are secular people with a Christian heritage who may not believe in the religious claims of Christianity, but who retain an affinity for the [[Christian pop culture|popular culture]], art, [[Christian music|music]] and so on related to it.

==Ecumenism==
{{Main|Ecumenism}}
[[File:Taizé prayer.JPG|thumb|left|Ecumenical worship service at the [[monastery]] of [[Taizé]] in France]]
Christian groups and denominations have long expressed ideals of being reconciled, and in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Christian [[ecumenism]] advanced in two ways.&lt;ref name="McManners581"&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', pp. 581–84.&lt;/ref&gt; One way was greater cooperation between groups, such as the [[World Evangelical Alliance]] founded in 1846 in London or the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] of Protestants in 1910, the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the [[World Council of Churches]] founded in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils like the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]] which includes Catholics.&lt;ref name="McManners581"/&gt;

The other way was institutional union with [[United and uniting churches]], a practice that can be traced back to unions between Lutherans and Calvinists in early 19th-century Germany. Congregationalist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches united in 1925 to form the [[United Church of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. p. 413f.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 to form the [[Uniting Church in Australia]]. The [[Church of South India]] was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches.&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical, [[monasticism|monastic]] [[Taizé Community]] is notable for being composed of more than one hundred [[monk|brothers]] from Protestant and Catholic traditions.&lt;ref name="taize"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford companion to Christian thought|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-860024-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ognCKztR8a4C&amp;pg=PA694|page=694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community emphasizes the reconciliation of all denominations and its main church, located in [[Taizé, Saône-et-Loire]], France, is named the "Church of Reconciliation".&lt;ref name="taize" /&gt; The community is internationally known, attracting over 100,000 young pilgrims annually.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, "Encyclopedia Of Christianity, pg. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Steps towards reconciliation on a global level were taken in 1965 by the Catholic and Orthodox churches mutually revoking the excommunications that marked their [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054;&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Anglican Catholic International Commission]] (ARCIC) working towards full communion between those churches since 1970;&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran]] and Catholic churches signing the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] in 1999 to address conflicts at the root of the Protestant Reformation.

[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|A copy of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', a famous Christian apologetic work]]
Criticism of Christianity and Christians goes back to the [[Apostolic Age]], with the New Testament recording friction between the followers of Jesus and the [[Pharisees]] and [[scribes]] (e.g. {{Bibleref||Matthew|15:1–20|NIV}} and {{Bibleref||Mark|7:1–23|NIV}}).&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 {{ISBN|0-8028-3782-4}} page 175&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century, Christianity was criticized by the Jews on various grounds, e.g. that the prophecies of the Hebrew Bible could not have been fulfilled by Jesus, given that he did not have a successful life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135'' by James D. G. Dunn 1999 {{ISBN|0-8028-4498-7}} pages&amp;nbsp;112–113&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally a sacrifice to remove sins in advance, for everyone or as a human being, did not fit to the Jewish sacrifice ritual, furthermore [[God in Judaism|God]] is said to judge people on their deeds instead of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Asher Norman ''Twenty-six Reasons why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus'' Feldheim Publishers 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-977-19370-7}} page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Akers The Lost Religion of Jesus: Simple Living and Nonviolence in Early Christianity'' Lantern Books 2000 {{ISBN|978-1-930-05126-3}} page 103&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first comprehensive attacks on Christianity came from the Greek philosopher [[Celsus]], who wrote ''[[The True Word]]'', a polemic criticizing Christians as being unprofitable members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Everett|title=Backgrounds of Early Christianity|date=1993|publisher=William B.

By the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century, criticism of Christianity had mounted, partly as a defense against it. Wild rumors about Christians were widely circulated, claiming that they were [[atheism|atheists]] and that, as part of their rituals, they devoured human infants and engaged in incestuous orgies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Everett|title=Backgrounds of Early Christianity|date=1993|publisher=William B.

By the 12th century, the [[Mishneh Torah]] (i.e., [[Rabbi]] [[Moses Maimonides]]) was criticizing Christianity on the grounds of idol worship, in that Christians attributed divinity to Jesus who had a physical body.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary Of Jewish-Christian Relations'' by Edward Kessler, Neil Wenborn 2005 {{ISBN|0-521-82692-6}} page 168&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Nietzsche]] began to write a series of polemics on the "unnatural" teachings of Christianity (e.g. sexual abstinence), and continued his criticism of Christianity to the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche'' by Bernd Magnus, Kathleen Marie Higgins 1996 {{ISBN|0-521-36767-0}} pages&amp;nbsp;90–93&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] expressed his criticism of Christianity in ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'', formulating his rejection of Christianity in the setting of logical arguments.&lt;ref&gt;''Russell on Religion: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell'' by Bertrand Russell, Stefan Andersson and Louis Greenspan 1999 {{ISBN|0-415-18091-0}} pages&amp;nbsp;77–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of Christianity continues to date, e.g. [[Jewish]] and [[Muslim]] theologians criticize the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] held by most Christians, stating that this doctrine in effect assumes that there are three Gods, running against the basic tenet of [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christianity: An Introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath 2006 {{ISBN|1-4051-0899-1}} pp.&amp;nbsp;125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament scholar [[Robert M. Price]] has outlined the possibility that some Bible stories are based partly on myth in "The Christ Myth Theory and its problems".&lt;ref&gt;" The Christ Myth Theory and its Problems ", published 2011 by American Atheist press, Cranford, New Jersey, {{ISBN|1-57884-017-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian apologetics aims to present a [[reason|rational]] basis for Christianity. The word "apologetic" (Greek: ἀπολογητικός ''apologētikos'') comes from the Greek verb ἀπολογέομαι ''apologeomai'', meaning "(I) speak in defense of".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)pologhtiko/s|ἀπολογητικός}}, {{LSJ|a)pologe/omai|ἀπολογέομαι|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with Paul the Apostle. The philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] presented five arguments for God's existence in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', while his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' was a major apologetic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|title=A History of Apologetics|year=2005|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-89870-933-9|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Readings in Christian Apologetics|year=1983|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=978-0-310-45641-4|editor=L Russ Bush|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous apologist, [[G. K. Chesterton]], wrote in the early twentieth century about the benefits of religion and, specifically, Christianity. Famous for his use of paradox, Chesterton explained that while Christianity had the most mysteries, it was the most practical religion.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.chesterton.org/why-i-believe-in-christianity/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hauser, Chris (History major, Dartmouth College class of 2014)|date=Fall 2011|title=Faith and Paradox: G.K.

John Lennox, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, tells us that 'even if the non-believers don't like it, the Big Bang fits in exactly with the Christian narrative of creation'. ... William Lane Craig is another who claims that the Biblical account is corroborated by Big Bang cosmology. Lane Craig also claims that there is a prior ''proof'' that there is a God who created this universe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dinkan''' ([[Malayalam]]: ഡിങ്കൻ)  is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[anthropomorphic]] [[superhero]] [[mouse]] who appear in an eponymous [[Malayalam]] [[Comics|comic story series]] in children's magazine ''[[Balamangalam]]''. Modern day secular and rationalist [[Kerala|Keralites]] use Dinkan to mock organized religion and religious intolerance.

==History==
Dinkan (ഡിങ്കൻ) was created by story-writer N. Somashekharan and artist Baby in 1983. Dinkan was one of the earliest superhero characters created in [[Indian comics|India]] and it quickly became popular among children. Like [[Terrytoons]] created [[Mighty Mouse]] and several other superhero characters, Dinkan borrowed a few traits from the iconic [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]].

==Character biography==
Dinkan was born in Pankila forest, somewhere in [[Kerala]], India. He was a naughty mouse, who wasn't disciplined. During one of his escapades, Dinkan was abducted by aliens from an unknown planet. They conducted experiments on him which ended up giving him superior strength, enhanced senses and the ability to fly. Somehow Dinkan found himself back in Pankila forest and he decided to use his powers for the well-being of animals in the forest.

==Dinkoism==

{{main article|Dinkoism}}
Dinkoism has emerged as a [[parody religion]] on social networks organized by some atheists in [[Kerala]], India. This religion celebrates [[Hyena]] as their God in an attempt to bring awareness of the fallacies and practices of traditional religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-36001999|title=The mouse messiah bringing salvation to India's atheists|publisher=BBC News|date=11 April 2016|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Broadcasting Corporation covered the Dinkoist religion in its ''BBCTrending'' Programme. 
BBC reported Dinkoism as an atheist movement with significant growth in the social media. The report was presented by BBC video journalist Alvaro A Ricciardelli.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-36001999&lt;/ref&gt;

The national '''emblem of Eritrea''' was adopted on 24 May 1993 on the occasion of [[Eritrea]]'s [[Independence Day (Eritrea)|declaration of independence]] from [[Ethiopia]]. The emblem mainly depicts a [[camel]] surrounded by a wreath of laurel.

==Present emblem==
The modern emblem of Eritrea was adopted 24 May 1993, the date of the [[Independence Day (Eritrea)|declaration of independence]] from [[Ethiopia]]. It shows a scene of a [[dromedary]] [[camel]] in the desert, which is surrounded by an [[olive]] [[wreath]]. The camel was the beast of burden used during the war of independence from Ethiopia to transport supplies and goods, and was seen as being instrumental to the movement's success by Eritrean nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eritrean-embassy.se/State_Structure.htm |title=Eritrean Government |publisher=Embassy of The State of Eritrea, Stockholm |accessdate=7 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306102547/http://www.eritrean-embassy.se/State_Structure.htm |archivedate=6 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of the country appears on a scroll towards the bottom of the emblem threefold, in [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[English language|English]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], three widely spoken [[Languages of Eritrea|languages]] in the country.&lt;ref name="Heraldry of the World"/&gt;

==History==
[[Eritrea]] was first assigned a [[coat of arms]] in 1919, when it was a colony of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].  The shield was parted in half horizontally, with the top portion displaying a red lion charged on his breast with a white star and the bottom half divided into six wavy bars alternating blue and white.  The red lion represents the Italian Kingdom, lions alluding to the Italian King who used the beasts as supporters and red being a common colour associated with Italy and also used by the ruling House of Savoy.  The star has long been a symbol of the Italian people, known as the [[Italia Turrita|''Stellone d'Italia'']], which protects and guards the nation.  The bottom portion displaying blue and white wavy bars is a common heraldic depiction representing water, and alludes to the origins of the colony's name.  Eritrea is derived from the Latin ''Erythræa'', the name applied to the Red Sea in antiquity; the colony was named so for its coastline along that body of water.&lt;ref name="Heraldry of the World"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/afr/er-nat.htm|title=National Arms of Eritrea|publisher=Heraldry of the World|accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] regime of Italy, which began in 1924, the arms were augmented with symbols of the new government: a red chief was added in 1936, which was charged with fasces and laurel wreath. Eritrea was then absorbed into the colony of [[Italian East Africa]] in 1936, reducing it to a province of the new and larger colony. The arms of Eritrea made up one field in the arms of Italian East Africa, but without the chief added in 1936. In 1941, when the province was conquered and placed under British administration, the fascist chief was removed and the original arms were again employed.  In 1951, the process of annexation by Ethiopia began, and the arms continued in use until the following year.&lt;ref name="Heraldry of the World"/&gt;

During the annexation period, from 1952 to 1962, an emblem was adopted that consisted of a vertical olive branch encircled by an olive wreath. This emblem is used still on the [[Flag of Eritrea|nation's flag]].&lt;ref name="Heraldry of the World"/&gt;

Shortcuts in engineering design can lead to '''engineering disasters'''.  Engineering is the science and technology used to meet the needs and demands of society.&lt;ref&gt;"Engineering." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These demands include [[buildings]], [[aircraft]], [[Marine vessel|vessel]]s, and computer software. In order to meet society’s demands, the creation of newer technology and infrastructure must be met efficiently and cost-effectively.  To accomplish this, managers and engineers have to have a mutual approach to the specified demand at hand. This can lead to shortcuts in engineering design to reduce costs of construction and fabrication. Occasionally, these shortcuts can lead to unexpected design failures.

==Importance of safety==
In the field of engineering, the importance of safety is emphasized. Learning from past engineering failures and infamous disasters such as the Challenger explosion brings the sense of reality to what can happen when appropriate safety precautions are not taken. Safety tests such as [[tensile testing]], [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), and failure theories help provide information to design engineers about what maximum forces and stresses can be applied to a certain region of a design. These precautionary measures help prevent failures due to overloading and deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dax|first=Mark|title=Failure Analysis Prevents Disaster Reoccurance|journal=R&amp;D Magazine|date=Dec 1997|pages=30–31|publisher=EBSOhost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of failure==
Failure occurs when a structure or device has been used past the limits of design that inhibits proper function.&lt;ref&gt;"Failure." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; If a structure is designed to only support a certain amount of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]], or loading and the user applies greater amounts, the structure will begin to deform and eventually fail. Several factors contribute to failure including a flawed design, improper use, financial costs, and miscommunication.

==Failure due to static loading==
[[File:Metal yield.svg|thumbnail|Stress–strain curve showing typical yield behavior for ductile metals. Stress (σ) is shown as a function of strain (ϵ). Stress and strain are correlated through Young's Modulus: σ=Eϵ where E is the slope of the linear section of the plot.]]
Static loading is when a force is applied slowly to an object or structure. Static load tests such as tensile testing, bending tests, and torsion tests help determine the maximum loads that a design can withstand without permanent deformation or failure. Tensile testing is common when calculating a stress-strain curve which can determine the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate strength]] of a specific test specimen.

[[File:Tensile testing on a coir composite.jpg|thumbnail|Tensile testing on a composite specimen]]

The specimen is stretched slowly in tension until it breaks, while the load and the distance across the gage length are continuously monitored. A sample subjected to a tensile test can typically withstand stresses higher than its yield stress without breaking. At a certain point, however, the sample will break into two pieces. This happens because the microscopic cracks that resulted from yielding will spread to large scales. The stress at the point of complete breakage is called a material’s ultimate tensile strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doehring|first=James|first2=Lauren|last2=Fritsky|title=What Is a Static Load?|publisher=WiseGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a [[stress-strain curve]] of the material's behavior under static loading. Through this tensile testing, the yield strength is found at the point where the material begins to yield more readily to the applied stress, and its rate of deformation increases.&lt;ref name="Machine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Robert L.|title=Machine Design: An Integrated Approach|location=Boston|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure due to fatigue==
When a material undergoes permanent deformation from exposure to radical temperatures or constant loading, the functionality of the material can become impaired.&lt;ref&gt;"CreepAbout Our Definitions: All Forms of a Word (noun, Verb, Etc.) Are Now Displayed on One Page." Merriam-Webster. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Materials" /&gt; This time–dependent plastic distortion of material is known as [[creep (deformation)|creep]]. Stress and temperature are both major factors of the rate of creep. In order for a design to be considered safe, the deformation due to creep must be much less than the strain at which failure occurs. Once the static loading causes the specimen to surpass this point the specimen will begin permanent, or plastic, deformation.&lt;ref name="Materials"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbeler|first=R.

In mechanical design, most failures are due to time-varying, or dynamic, loads that are applied to a system. This phenomenon is known as fatigue failure. [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]] is known as the weakness in a material due to variations of stress that are repeatedly applied to said material.&lt;ref&gt;"Fatigue." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when stretching a rubber band to a certain length without breaking it (i.e. not surpassing the yield stress of the rubber band) the rubber band will return to its original form after release; however, repeatedly stretching the rubber band with the same amount of force thousands of times would create micro-cracks in the band which would lead to the rubber band being snapped. The same principle is applied to mechanical materials such as metals.&lt;ref name="Machine" /&gt;

Fatigue failure always begins at a crack that may form over time or due to the manufacturing process used. The three stages of fatigue failure are: 
* 1.) Crack initiation- when repeated stress creates a fracture in the material being used
* 2.) Crack propagation- when the initiated crack develops in the material to a larger scale due to tensile stress.
* 3.) Sudden fracture failure- caused by unstable crack growth to the point where the material will fail

Note that fatigue does not imply that the strength of the material is lessened after failure. This notion was originally referred to a material becoming "tired" after cyclic loading.&lt;ref name="Machine"/&gt;

==Failure due to miscommunication==

Engineering is a precise discipline and in order to be precise, communication among project developers is pertinent for a successful product. There are several forms of miscommunication that can lead to a flawed design in a system. There are various fields of engineering that have to intercommunicate when working toward a mutual goal. These fields include civil, electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, biological, and environmental engineering. When creating a modern automobile, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, and environmental engineers are required to work together to produce a fuel-efficient, durable product for consumers. If engineers do not adequately communicate among one another, a potential design could have flaws and be unsafe for consumer purchase. '''Engineering disasters''' can be a result of such miscommunication. Such disasters include the [[2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] during [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]], and the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]].&lt;ref name="Hyatt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Richard D.|title=Investigation of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Walkways Collapse|location=Washington, D.C.|journal=U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2070 |publisher=United States Department of Defense |title=Defense.gov News Transcript: Defense Department Special Briefing on Efforts to Mitigate Infrastructure Damage from Hurricane Katrina |author1=Carl Strock |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=22 Feb 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231001622/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2070 |archivedate=2012-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

==Failure due to software==

Software has played a role in many high-profile disasters.

*[[Ariane 5 Flight 501]]
*[[Mars Climate Orbiter|Mars probe]]
*[[Denver International Airport#Automated baggage system|Denver International Airport - Automated baggage system]]
*[[TAURUS (share trading)|TAURUS]] — UK share [[settlement (finance)|settlement]] system and [[dematerialised]] [[central share depository]].
*[[Therac-25]] — A radiation therapy machine responsible for six overdoses due to faulty software.
*[[Patriot missile|Failure at Dharan]] — Patriot Missile clock issue.

==Infamous disasters in engineering==
Engineering products and inventions are utilized everyday including computers, microwaves, and elevators. A broken microwave can have limited consequences; however, when larger projects such as infrastructures and airplanes fail, multiple people can be affected which leads to an '''engineering disaster'''. A disaster is defined as a calamity that results in significant damage which may include the loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Disaster." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale engineering disasters are recorded in the history books. Just like any other mistake, these disasters become reminders and guidelines of how to improve and not repeat the same mistakes. In-depth observations and post-disaster analysis have been documented to a large extent to help prevent similar disasters from occurring.

{{Main article|Hyatt Regency walkway collapse}}

[[File:HRWalkway.svg|thumbnail|left|Depiction of the modified design made by the fabricator]]

On the night of July 17, 1981, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[United States]], two suspended walkways of the [[Hyatt Regency Hotel]] collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring 200 more. During this calamity, the hotel was hosting a dance competition. There were numerous competition attendants and observers standing and dancing on the suspended walkways when connections supporting the ceiling rods that hoisted both the second and fourth floor walkways across the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] failed and collapsed onto the crowded first floor atrium below.&lt;ref name="Hyatt2"&gt;"Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse." ENGINEERING.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During investigation after the walkway collapse, architectural engineer Wayne G. Lischka noticed a substantial alteration of the original design. The fabricator constructed a double-rod support system rather than the originally designed single-rod system without approval of the engineering design team. In doing so, the created support beams doubled the loading on the connector which resulted in the failure of the walkway. It was documented that even the single-rod system would have barely supported the expected load and would not have met Kansas City Building Code standards.&lt;ref name="Hyatt2" /&gt;

The final analysis of the damage had several conclusions reported including:
* The maximum load capacity of the fourth floor walkway was only 53% the maximum load capacity of Kansas City Building Code standards
* The fabrication alterations from the original design doubled the load that was received by the fourth floor walkway
* The deformation and distortion of the fourth floor hanger rods support the notion that the collapse began at that point
* No evidence that the quality of construction or material selection played a role in the walkway collapse.&lt;ref name="Hyatt" /&gt;

====Challenger explosion (1986)====
{{Main article|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster}}
The '''Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster''' occurred on January 28, 1986, when the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'' (OV-099)]] (mission [[STS-51-L]]) broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, leading to the deaths of its seven crew members. Disintegration of the vehicle began after an [[O-ring]] seal in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) failed at liftoff.

====Columbia disaster (2003)====
{{Main article|Space Shuttle Columbia disaster}}

[[File:Crew of STS-107, official photo.jpg|thumbnail|left|The crew of the STS-107 mission.]]

The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred on February 1, 2003, while reentering Earth's atmosphere over [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]]. The shuttle unexpectedly disintegrated, resulting in the death of all seven astronauts on board. The cause was later discovered to be damage to thermal shielding tiles from impact with a falling piece of foam insulation of an external tank during launch. It was the seventh known instance of this particular piece breaking free during launch.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Accident Investigation Board, Report Volume 1, August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As the shuttle re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of Mach 23 (28,400km/h ; 17,647mph), the wing experienced temperatures of {{convert|2800|°F}}. The damage from the insulation strike experienced during launch proved fatal as the shuttle disintegrated during the mission return.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R. L.

USA Today. Associated Press. March 4, 2003. Retrieved February 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger L.M. Dunbar of [[New York University]] and Raghu Garud of [[Pennsylvania State University]] procured a case description of what missteps [[NASA]] had taken that led to the Columbia spacecraft catastrophe. Mission control deemed that foam shedding was a not a safety factor prior to launch, believed damage of the shuttle panels were not a significant issue which in-turn delayed analysis on damages as of January 17, 2003, and denied mission action request between January 18 and 19. It was not until January 24, 2003, that mission control had classified the damage as a problematic issue. These missteps in communication between mission control and the debris assessment team inhibited a proper examination of the damages to the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

====Liberty ships in WWII====
{{Main article|Liberty ship}}
Early Liberty ships suffered [[Liberty ship#Hull cracks|hull and deck cracks]], and a few were lost to such structural defects. During World War II, there were nearly 1,500 instances of significant [[brittle fracture]]s. Three of the 2,710 Liberties built broke in half without warning. In cold temperatures the steel hulls cracked, resulting in later ships being constructed using more suitable steel.

====Steamboat Sultana (1865)====
{{Main article|Sultana (steamboat)}}

[[File:Sultana Disaster.jpg|thumbnail|Depiction of the steamboat Sultana disaster]]
On the night of April 26, 1865, the passenger steamboat Sultana exploded on the [[Mississippi River]] seven miles north of [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. This maritime disaster is categorized as the worst in [[United States]] history. The explosion resulted in the loss of 1,547 lives, surpassing the total number of deaths caused by the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]''. The Sultana was overcrowded due to a soldier prisoner exchange towards the end of the [[United States Civil War]]. The overcrowding contributed significantly to the high death toll. Another reason for the high number of deaths is that the steamer was made mostly of wood, which was documented to have been completely engulfed in flames approximately seven minutes after the explosion. The explosion happened around midnight which was when the Mississippi River was at flood stage. It was documented that the single metal lifeboat on board the Sultana was thrown from the upperdeck landing on several people swimming from the steamer resulting in further deaths.&lt;ref name="Sultana"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berryman |first=J.O. |last2=Potter |last3=Oliver |first3=S. |title=The Ill-Fated Passenger Steamer Sultana: An Inland Maritime Mass Disaster of Unparalleled Magnitude |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |publisher=JFSCA |volume=33 |issue=3 |date=May 1988 |pages=842–850 |url=http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au/JFS/PDF/vol_33/iss_3/JFS333880842.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disaster was believed to be the result of a repaired boiler explosion that led to the explosion of two of the three other boilers. The boiler had been previously found to have had a leak and was improperly repaired by boilermaker R.G. Taylor due to orders from Captain J. Cass Mason because of time constraints in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. While chief engineer Nathan Wintringer approved the repaired boiler, Taylor stated that the boiler could not be considered safe since the boiler appeared to be burned from being worked on with too little water.&lt;ref name="Sultana" /&gt; Traveling along the Mississippi River, the boiler exploded causing fire to spread throughout the steamer. The fire on board led to the collapse of both of the Sultana's smokestacks, killing many passengers. The sultanas captain died with the ship.

'''Euhemerism''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|h|iː|m|ər|ɪ|z|əm|,_|-|h|ɛ|m|-}}) is an approach to the interpretation of [[mythology]] in which mythological accounts are presumed to have originated from real historical events or personages. Euhemerism supposes that historical accounts become myths as they are exaggerated in the retelling, accumulating elaborations and alterations that reflect cultural [[mores]]. It was named for the Greek mythographer [[Euhemerus]], who lived in the late 4th century BC. In the more recent literature of myth, such as ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology]]'', euhemerism is termed the "historical theory" of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Bulfinch, Thomas. ''Bulfinch's Mythology''. Whitefish: Kessinger, 2004, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology in historical terms, as euhemeristic views are found in earlier writings including those of [[Xenophanes]], [[Herodotus]], [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] and [[Ephorus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis: "Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete" The Classical Journal 63.8 (May 1968, pp. 337–340) p.338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] presented rationalized accounts of the myth of [[Io (mythology)|Io]] (''Histories'' I.1ff) and events of the Trojan War (''Histories'' 2.118ff).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the enduring influence of Euhemerus upon later thinkers such as [[Ennius]] and [[Antoine Banier]] identified him as the traditional founder of this school of thought.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to mythology'', [[Lewis Spence]], 1921, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==

In a scene described in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', [[Socrates]] offers a euhemeristic interpretation of a myth concerning [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] and [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]:

{{quote|"{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Tell me, Socrates, isn't it from somewhere near this stretch of the Ilisus that people say Boreas carried Orithyia away?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: So they say.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Couldn't this be the very spot? The stream is lovely, pure and clear: just right for girls to be playing nearby.&lt;br&gt; {{smallcaps|Socrates}}: No, it is two or three hundred yards farther downstream, where one crosses to get to the district of Arga. I think there is even an altar to Boreas there.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: I hadn't noticed it. But tell me, Socrates, in the name of Zeus, do you really believe that legend is true?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: Actually, it would not be out of place for me to reject it, as our intellectuals do. I could then tell a clever story: I could claim that a gust of the North Wind blew her over the rocks where she was playing with Pharmaceia; and once she was killed that way people said she had been carried off by Boreas..."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Phaedr. 229b–d, translation taken from:

Socrates illustrates a euhemeristic approach to the myth of [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] abducting [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]. He shows how the story of Boreas, the northern wind, can be rationalised: Orithyia is pushed off the rock cliffs through the equation of Boreas with a natural gust of wind, which accepts Orithyia as a historical personage. But here he also implies that this is equivalent to rejecting the myth. Socrates, despite holding some euhemeristic views, mocked the concept that all myths could be rationalized, noting that the mythical creatures of "absurd forms" such as [[Centaurs]] and the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] could not easily be explained.&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedrus'', 229d&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient [[skeptic]] philosophical tradition of [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]] and the [[Cyrenaics]], Euhemerus forged a new method of interpretation for the contemporary religious beliefs. Though his work is lost, the reputation of Euhemerus was that he believed that much of [[Greek mythology]] could be interpreted as natural or historical events subsequently given supernatural characteristics through retelling. Subsequently Euhemerus was considered to be an [[atheism|atheist]] by his opponents, most notably [[Callimachus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;338–339.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deification===

Euhemerus' views were rooted in the deification of men, usually kings, into gods through [[apotheosis]]. In numerous cultures, kings were exalted or venerated into the status of divine beings and worshipped after their death, or sometimes even while they ruled. [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]], the tyrant ruler of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was deified while he was alive and modern scholars consider his apotheosis to have influenced Euhemerus' views on the origin of all gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerus in Context, Franco De Angelis De Angelis and Benjamin Garstad, Classical Antiquity,Vol. 25, No. 2, October 2006, pp. 211–242.&lt;/ref&gt; Euhemerus was also living during the contemporaneous deification of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] and "[[pharaoh|pharaoization]]" of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] in a fusion of Hellenic and Egyptian traditions.

===Tomb of Zeus===

Euhemerus argued that [[Zeus]] was a mortal king who died on [[Crete]], and that his tomb could still be found there with the inscription bearing his name.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete'', S. Spyridakis, The Classical Journal, Vol. 63, No. 8, May, 1968, pp. 337–340.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim however did not originate with Euhemerus, as the general sentiment of Crete during the time of [[Epimenides]] of [[Knossos]] (c.&amp;nbsp;600 BC) was that Zeus was buried somewhere in Crete. For this reason, the Cretans were often considered [[Atheism|atheists]], and Epimenides called them all liars (see [[Epimenides paradox]]). [[Callimachus]], an opponent of Euhemerus' views on [[mythology]], argued that Zeus' Cretan tomb was fabricated, and that he was eternal:

{{cquote|''Cretans always lie.'' For the Cretans even built a tomb,&lt;br&gt; 
Lord, for you. But you did not die, for you are eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Zeus''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A later Latin [[scholia|scholium]] on the ''Hymns'' of Callimachus attempted to account for the tomb of Zeus. According to the scholium, the original tomb inscription read: "The tomb of [[Minos]], the son of [[jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]" but over time the words "Minos, the son" wore away leaving only "the tomb of Jupiter".  This had misled the Cretans into thinking that Zeus had died and was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;The hymns of Callimachus, tr. into Engl. verse, with notes. To which are added, Select epigrams, and the ''Coma Berenices'' of the same author, six hymns of Orpheus, and the ''Encomium of Ptolemy'' by Theocritus, by W. Dodd, 1755, p. 3, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Euhemerus, [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the 3rd century AD claimed that [[Pythagoras]] had discovered the tomb of Zeus on Crete and written on the tomb's surface an inscription reading: "Here died and was buried Zan, whom they call Zeus".&lt;ref&gt;Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religions and Themis a Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion, Jane Ellen Harrison, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] also wrote about the tomb of Zeus.

==Christians==

Hostile to paganism, the early Christians, such as the [[Church Fathers]], embraced euhemerism in attempt to undermine the validity of pagan gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; The usefulness of euhemerist views to early Christian apologists may be summed up in [[Clement of Alexandria]]'s triumphant cry in ''Cohortatio ad gentes'': "Those to whom you bow were once men like yourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Seznec (1995) ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'' Princeton University Press pg 12, who observes (p. 13) of the numerous Christian examples he mentions, "Thus Euhemerism became a favorite weapon of the Christian polemicists, a weapon they made use of at every turn".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Book of Wisdom===
The ''[[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]]'', a [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]], has a passage, {{bibleref|Wisdom|14:12–21}}, giving a euhemerist explanation of the origin of idols.{{wikisource|Wisdom (Bible)}}

===Early Christian apologists===

The [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Christian apologetics|apologists]] deployed the euhemerist argument to support their position that pagan mythology was merely an aggregate of [[fable]]s of human invention. [[Cyprian]], a North African convert to Christianity, wrote a short essay ''De idolorum vanitate'' ("On the Vanity of Idols") in AD 247 that assumes the euhemeristic rationale as though it needed no demonstration. Cyprian begins:

{{quote|That those are no gods whom the common people worship, is known from this: they were formerly kings, who on account of their royal memory subsequently began to be adored by their people even in death. Thence temples were founded to them; thence images were sculptured to retain the countenances of the deceased by the likeness; and men sacrificed victims, and celebrated festal days, by way of giving them honour. Thence to posterity those rites became sacred, which at first had been adopted as a consolation.}}

Cyprian proceeds directly to examples, the [[apotheosis]] of [[Melicertes]] and [[Leucothea]]; "The Castors [i.e. [[Castor and Pollux]]] die by turns, that they may live," a reference to the daily sharing back and forth of their immortality by the Heavenly Twins. "The cave of Jupiter is to be seen in Crete, and his sepulchre is shown," Cyprian says, confounding Zeus and [[Dionysus]] but showing that the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] cave cult was still alive in Crete in the third century AD. In his exposition, it is to Cyprian's argument to marginalize the [[syncretism]] of pagan belief, in order to emphasize the individual variety of local deities:

{{quote|From this the religion of the gods is variously changed among individual nations and provinces, inasmuch as no one god is worshipped by all, but by each one the worship of its own ancestors is kept peculiar.}}

Eusebius in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' employed euhemerism to argue the Babylonian God [[Baʿal]] was a deified ruler and that the god [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] was the first Assyrian king.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicon, Pat. Graeca XIX, cols. 132, 133, i. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euhemeristic views are found expressed also in [[Tertullian]] (''De idololatria''), the ''Octavius'' of [[Marcus Minucius Felix]] and in [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism and Christology in Origen: "Contra Celsum" III 22–43, Harry Y. Gamble, Vigiliae Christianae, Vol. 33, No. 1, Mar., 1979, pp. 12–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnobius]]' dismissal of paganism in the fifth century, on rationalizing grounds, may have depended on a reading of Cyprian, with the details enormously expanded. [[Isidore of Seville]], compiler of the most influential early medieval encyclopedia, devoted a chapter ''De diis gentium''&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''[[Etymologiae]]'', book viii, ch. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; to elucidating, with numerous examples and elaborated genealogies of gods, the principle drawn from [[Lactantius]], ''Quos pagani deos asserunt, homines olim fuisse produntur.'' ("Those whom pagans claim to be gods were once mere men.") Elaborating logically, he attempted to place these deified men in the six great periods of history as he divided it, and created mythological dynasties. Isidore's euhemeristic bent was codified in a rigid parallel with sacred history in [[Petrus Comestor]]'s appendix to his much translated ''Historia scholastica'' (written ca. 1160), further condensing Isidore to provide strict parallels of figures from the pagan [[legend]], as it was now viewed in historicised narrative, and the mighty human spirits of the patriarchs of the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Seznec 1995:16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin of Braga]] in his ''De correctione rusticorum'' wrote idolatry stemmed from post-deluge survivors of Noah's family who began to worship the [[Sun]] and stars instead of [[deity|God]]. In his view the Greek gods were deified descendants of [[Noah]] who were once real personages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/pagan4.htm#N_64_|title=Chapter 4: Pagan Survivals in Galicia in the Sixth Century|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

Christian writers during the [[Middle Ages]] continued to embrace euhemerism, such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Petrus Comestor]], [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Godfrey of Viterbo]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, pp. 396–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Franciscan friar [[Roger Bacon]] in the 13th century argued that ancient Gods such as [[Minerva]], [[Prometheus]], Atlas, [[Apollo]], [[Io (mythology)|Io]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] were all deified humans. – ''Opus Maius'', ed. J. H. Bridges, Oxford, 1897, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
“After all, it was during this time that Christian apologists had adopted the views of the rationalist Greek philosophers. And had captured the purpose for Euhemerism, which was to explain the mundane origins of the Hellenistic divinities. Euhemerism explained simply in two ways: first in the strictest sense as a movement which reflected the known views of Euhemerus' Hiera Anagraphe regarding Panchaia and the historicity of the family of Saturn and Uranus. The principal sources of these views are the handed-down accounts of Lactantius and Diodorus; or second, in the widest sense, as a rationalist movement which sought to explain the mundane origins of all the Hellenistic gods and heroes as mortals.” Other modern theorists labeled Euhemerism as a “subject of classical paganism that was fostered in the minds of the people of the Middle Ages through the realization that while in most respects the ancient Greeks and Roman had  been superior to themselves, they had been in error regarding their religious beliefs. An examination of the principal writings in Middle English with considerable reading of literature other than English, discloses the fact that the people of the Middle Ages rarely regarded the so-called gods as mere figments of the imagination but rather believed that they were or had been real beings, sometimes possessing actual power.” (John Daniel Cook)

===Christ myth theory===

In his 2011 book, ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', [[Robert M. Price]] supported the [[Christ myth theory]] and suggested that the process of searching for a historical Jesus was like euhemerism.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert M, ( 2011) ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', American Atheist Press. {{ISBN|1-57884-017-1}} p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snorri Sturluson's "euhemerism"==
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', composed around 1220, the Christian Icelandic bard and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] proposes that the Norse gods were originally historical leaders and kings. [[Odin]], the father of the gods, is introduced as a historical person originally from [[Asia Minor]], tracing his ancestry back to [[Priam]], the king of [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]]. 
As Odin travels north to settle in the [[Nordic countries]], he establishes the royal families ruling in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] at the time:

{{quote|And whatever countries they passed through, great glory was spoken of them, so that they seemed more like gods than men.&lt;ref&gt;Snorri Sturluson, trans. Anthony Faulkes, ''Edda''. Everyman. 1987. (Prologue, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, while Snorri's euhemerism follows the early Christian tradition, the effect is not simply to discredit the divinity of the gods of a religion on the wane, but also (on the model of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'') to hint that the 'divinisation' was done in order to legitimize more recent Scandinavian rulers.

==In the modern world==

Euhemeristic interpretations of mythology continued throughout the [[early modern period]] from the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;For example in the preface to [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' into English, Golding offers a rationale for contemporary Christian readers to interpret Ovid's pagan stories. He argues: 'The true and everliving God the [[Paynim]]s did not know: Which caused them the name of Gods on creatures to bestow'.&lt;/ref&gt; to modern times. In 1711, the French historian [[Antoine Banier]] in his ''Mythologie et la fable expliqués par l'histoire'' ("The mythology and fables of the ancients, explained") presented strong arguments for a euhemerist interpretation of Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;''The rise of modern mythology, 1680–1860'', Burton Feldman, Robert D. Richardson'', Indiana University Press, 2000, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Bryant]]'s ''A New System or Analysis of Ancient Mythology'' (1744) was also another key work on euhemerism of the period, but argued so from a Biblical basis. Of the early 19th century, [[George Stanley Faber]] was another Biblical euhemerist. His work ''The Origin of Pagan Idolatry'' (1816) proposed that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were all deified men. Outside of Biblical influenced literature, some archaeologists embraced euhemerist views since they discovered myths could verify archaeological findings. [[Heinrich Schliemann]] was a prominent archaeologist of the 19th century who argued myths had embedded historical truths. Schliemann was an advocate of the historical reality of places and characters mentioned in the works of [[Homer]]. He excavated [[Troy]] and claimed to have discovered artifacts associated with various figures from Greek mythology, including the [[Mask of Agamemnon]] and [[Priam's Treasure]].

[[Herbert Spencer]] embraced some euhemeristic arguments in attempt to explain the anthropocentric origin of religion, through [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]]. Rationalizing methods of interpretation that treat some myths as traditional accounts based upon historical events are a continuous feature of some modern readings of mythology.

The twentieth century poet and mythographer [[Robert Graves]] offered many such "euhemerist" interpretations in his telling of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955). His suggestions that such myths record and justify the political and religious overthrow of earlier cult systems have been widely criticized and are rejected by most scholars.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Juliette|title=The Concept of the Goddess|editor=Sandra Billington, Miranda Green|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|page=12|chapter=Chapter 1, The Concept of the Goddess|isbn= 9780415197892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=320|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paganism_reader"&gt;''The Paganism Reader''. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=145|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONROLESOF&gt;Davidson, Hilda Ellis (1998).

The '''European Association for Digital Humanities''' ('''EADH'''), formerly known as the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC), is a [[digital humanities]] organisation founded in [[London]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;History of Humanities Computing, in: A Companion to Digital Humanities (2004), ed. Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth. Oxford: Blackwell|work= http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to promote the advancement of education in the digital humanities through the development and use of computational methods in research and teaching in the Humanities and related disciplines, especially literary and linguistic computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Constitution |work=EADH.org |url=http://www.allc.org/constitution | date=15 July 2013| accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Association joined the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO).&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalhumanities.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A precursor for the later following annual conferences of the association was a meeting on literary and linguistic computing organized by Roy Wisbey and Michael Farringdon at the [[University of Cambridge]] in March, 1970. The year after the second conference in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], in 1972, the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing was founded at a meeting at [[King's College, London]] (1973).&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Together with the [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]] (ACH) and the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (ACL), the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing sponsored and organized the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tei-c.org/About/history.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 the Association's name was changed to the European Association for Digital Humanities, while keeping the allc.org domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ALLC: Proposed Name Change |date= 20 December 2011 |url= http://www.allc.org/news-events/allc-proposed-name-change |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120211210537/http://www.allc.org/news-events/allc-proposed-name-change |archivedate= 11 February 2012 |accessdate= 20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change to 'EADH' was made in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Conference ==
The first conferences of the association were held annually until 1988, when a protocol was agreed with the Association for Computing in the Humanities for co-sponsorship of joint international conferences. The venue for these joint conferences alternated between Europe and North America. The first one took place in 1989 at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada. After the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] had been formed in 2005, the first joint conference with the new name “Digital Humanities” was held at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Conferences, www.allc.org/conferences; for the 2006 conference, see http://www.allc-ach2006.colloques.paris-sorbonne.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals ==
Initially, EADH published its own ''Bulletin'' three times a year; its journal twice yearly from 1980 to 1985.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Afterwards, bulletin and journal were merged in order to become ''[[Literary and Linguistic Computing]]'' (LLC) in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Terras, Melissa (2005). “Disciplined: Using Curriculum Studies to Define 'Humanities Computing’”, http://pear.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/xhtml.xq?id=43.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary and Linguistic Computing is a peer-reviewed, international journal that publishes texts "on all aspects of computing and information technology applied to literature and language research and teaching."&lt;ref&gt;http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership of the association is by subscription to LLC.&lt;ref&gt;ALLC Membership,http://www.allc.org/about/membership&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010 there were 314 individual subscribers to Literary and Linguistic Computing.&lt;ref&gt;ALLC Membership Report December 2010, http://www.allc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/ALLC_Membership_report_December_2010.pdf.

The '''Five-Percent Nation''', sometimes referred to as '''NGE'''  or '''NOGE''', the '''Nation of Gods and Earths''', or the '''Five Percenters''', is a movement founded in 1964 in the [[Harlem]] section of the borough of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], by a former member of the [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI), [[Clarence 13X]], who was named Clarence Edward Smith at birth, and who ultimately came to be known as Allah the Father.

Allah the Father, a former student of [[Malcolm X]], left the NOI after a dispute with [[Elijah Muhammad]] over Elijah's teaching that the white man was the devil, yet not teaching that the black man was God.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5614846 |title=God, the Black Man and the Five Percenters |publisher=NPR |date= |access-date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allah the Father also rejected the assertion that Nation's light-skinned founder, [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], was [[Allah]] and instead taught that the black man was himself God personified.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Members of the group call themselves Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those [[elite]]s and [[espionage|agents]] opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the eighty-five percent.&lt;ref name="HipHopWired"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2012/06/28/the-meaning-of-the-5-a-look-at-the-nation-of-gods-and-earths/|title=The Meaning Of The 5%: A Look At The Nation Of Gods And Earths|last=Chandler|first=D.L.|date=June 28, 2012|website=Hip-Hop Wired|access-date=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nation of Gods and Earths teaches that black people are the original people of the planet Earth, and therefore they are the fathers ("Gods") and mothers ("Earths") of civilization.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; The Nation teaches that Supreme Mathematics and [[Supreme Alphabet]], a set of principles created by Allah the Father, is the key to understanding humankind's relationship to the universe. The Nation does not believe in a mystery God but instead teaches that the [[Apotheosis|Asiatic Blackman is God]] and his proper name is ''Allah'', the Arabic word for "God".&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

== History ==

===Founding===
{{Nation of Islam|Offshoots}}
The Nation of Gods and Earths was founded by Allah the Father after he left the [[Nation of Islam]]'s Temple Number Seven in Harlem, New York (the same temple where [[Malcolm X]] was a minister from 1960 to 1963). Multiple stories exist as to why the father and the NOI parted ways: some have him refusing to give up gambling; others have him questioning the unique [[divinity]] of [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], whom the NOI deified as the True and Living God in person; or his questioning of Fard's Godhood due to the fact that Fard was born of a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Name of Allah: A History of Clarence 13X and the Five Percenters|last=Allah|first=Wakeel|publisher=A Team|year=2007|isbn=978-0982161814|location=|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story states that Allah the Father was then disciplined by the NOI and [[excommunicated]] in 1963, but another version of events says that he left on his own free will along with Abu Shahid,&lt;ref name="ITNA"&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Name of Allah: a History of Clarence 13X and the Five Percenters |year=2007 |author=Allah, Wakeel |publisher =Atlanta: A-Team Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; who agreed with Allah's questioning of Wallace Fard Muhammad. That same year Allah met James Howell, a sea merchant, who would later become known as Justice, and Allah's closest associate until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Beloved Allah |url=http://www.thetalkingdrum.com/nge.html |title=The Founding Of The Nation Of Gods And Earths |publisher=Thetalkingdrum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allah the Father proselytized the streets of Harlem to teach others his views based on his interpretation of NOI teachings. After failing to reach elder adults whom he saw as already set in their ways, he found success with street youth.&lt;ref name="The5"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Five Percenters: Islam, Hip Hop, and the Gods of New York |year=2007 |author=Knight, Michael Muhammad  |publisher=Oxford, England, UK: Oneworld Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IslamIn"&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam in America |author=Jane I.

''The Five Percenters: Islam, Hip Hop, and the Gods of New York''. Oxford, England, UK: Oneworld Publications, 2007. Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 10, 1964, this young group formed the First Nine Born of what became known as the Five Percent Nation, or later the Nation of Gods and Earths.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

He taught 120 Lessons to his young students (who came to refer to him as the Father), but instead of teaching the young men to be Muslims, he taught them that they were God the same as he was. The women who came into Allah's growing movement to study along with the males were taught they were symbolic of the planet Earth, because women produce and sustain human existence as does the Earth. The NGE does not consider itself a religion—its position is that it makes no sense to be religious or to worship or deify anyone or anything outside of oneself because adherents, themselves, are the highest power in the known universe, both collectively and individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Name of Allah|last=Allah|first=Wakeel|publisher=A Team|year=2007|isbn=9780982161814|location=|pages=137–138, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily, Allah the Father taught a system he developed called Supreme Mathematics. In this system, the numbers from one to nine, as well as zero, all represent principles and concepts. Coming together to discuss the Supreme Mathematics is the most fundamental regimen of the NGE. When Gods and Earths meet, they discuss the Supreme Mathematics and 120 Lessons and relate them to life.

===Conflicts===
The schism between Allah the Father and the NOI led to numerous confrontations. The assassination of Allah in a Harlem housing complex in 1969 remains a mystery. The murder was a blow to the movement, but according to the direct orders of Allah before his death, some of his earliest disciples, a group of nine men who were called the First Nine Born carried on the teachings, and his friend Justice assumed an acting leadership role.  In the years to follow, the Gods and Earths gained a reputation and even at one time quelled a potential rebellion when [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]] was assassinated.

The gang identification has caused much trouble for adherents to the teachings of the NGE in the United States. As the Nation has either gained students within the prison system or seen those who at least allege adherence to NGE teachings become incarcerated, the preceding gang reputation brought those with even remote NGE affiliation to be designated as security threats in states such as [[Michigan]], [[New Jersey]], New York, and [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scalc.net/decisions.aspx?q=4&amp;id=3297|title=Ra'heen M. Shabazz, #170474 vs. SCDOC|date=2001-11-29|publisher=SC Administrative Law Court|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature has been banned from institutions in these and other states, and inmates have been denied privileges enjoyed by those of other persuasions. Such rules were relaxed in 2004 in New York to allow registered sincere adherents to study teachings personally but not share with unregistered inmates during their incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g64rgJl1bmeWNY58-UiRaEgWv1CQD9AJC7CO2|title=Judge: No sign that Nation of Gods is prison risk|author=Ed White|date=2009-09-08|accessdate=2009-09-09|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nation has tried to answer these accusations by denying them.  Its newspaper ''The Five Percenter'' condemns the states who impose restrictions on their practice as those who "attempt to define us in ways that seeks to criminalize us".&lt;ref&gt;''Five Percenter Newspaper'', Vol 16.8, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In Michigan, the Nation challenged a ban on the group's literature among prison inmates after an inmate was designated a security threat until he renounced his membership. Judge Steven Whalen found no evidence that group advocated violence and recommended that it be recognized as a legitimate belief system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/general/general1178.html Ed White, The Associated Press, September 09, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, a man in [[Staten Island, New York]] already known in the Nation as Black Cream Allah was denied a legal adoption of the name because a judge felt it was sacrilegious and sounded like the name of a hip hop record. He has since filed a second petition for the amended name Original Kreeam Shabazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/staten_island_man_goes_to_cour.html|title=Staten Island man goes to court to seek name change|author=Phil Helsel|date=2009-04-05|accessdate=2009-09-09|publisher=Staten Island Advance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

===Basis===
The men of the Five Percent Nation view themselves as Gods (both individually and collectively as the Original Man).&lt;ref name="IslamIn" /&gt; Gods and Earths sometimes refer to themselves as [[scientist]]s, implying their search for knowledge and proof.&lt;ref name="Understand"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding African American Rhetoric: Classical Origins to Contemporary Innovations |author1=Ronald L. Jackson |author2=Elaine B. Richardson |publisher=Routledge Publishing |year=2003 |pages=174, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Five Percenter Newspaper'', "God first means that it is no longer a judicial argument; centered means everything we do is about God.

The teachings of the Nation of Gods and Earths are passed on through a modern oral tradition. The advancement of a God or Earth is based on his or her memorization, recitation, comprehension, and practical application of the Supreme Mathematics and the Supreme Alphabet and also the 120 Lessons, sometimes referred to as degrees, a revised version of the Supreme Wisdom lessons of the NOI, originally written by [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]] and [[Elijah Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="The5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ThisFar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CantStop"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation]] |first=Jeff | last=Chang | authorlink= Jeff Chang (journalist) |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2005 |pages=258, 259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthology ''Knowledge of Self: A Collection of Wisdom on the Science of Everything in Life''  by [[Supreme Understanding]] details the teachings of the Nation of Gods and Earths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ankh |first=Nur

===Five-Percent title===
The term Five Percent comes from NOI doctrine that sees the world's population divided into three groups: 85% of the people are blind to the knowledge of themselves and God, while 10% of the people know the truth, but teach a lie for their personal gain; seen as part of this 10% are religious leaders that teach that God is an [[Incorporeality|incorporeal]] being (hence the term mystery God). The 10% can also include the governments of the world that deceive and mislead the majority of the world through most of the available media outlets. The remaining 5% are the Poor Righteous Teachers—those who do not subscribe to the teachings of the 10%, as they know and teach that God is the Asiatic Black man.

===The Universal Language===&lt;!--Do not add a list of the Supreme Mathematics other than what has already been written. Any further details can be accessed via the references below.--&gt;

The '''Supreme Mathematics''' and Supreme Alphabet are key concepts in the Five Percent Nation. The Supreme mathematics is a system of understanding [[numerical digit|numerals]] alongside concepts and qualitative representations that are used along with the Supreme Alphabet.&lt;ref name="ThisFar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CantStop" /&gt; The Supreme Mathematics is thought to be the highest system of [[numerology]] in the NGE, used to give qualitative value to numbers in addition to quantity.  How the values associated with each number were derived are currently unknown. The numerals are as follows:

* 1. Knowledge
* 2. Wisdom
* 3. Understanding
* 4. Culture
* 5. Power
* 6. Equality
* 7. God
* 8. Build or Destroy
* 9. Born (Birth)
* 0. Cipher&lt;!--Do not add a list of the Supreme Alphabet other than what has already been written. Any further details can be accessed via the references below.--&gt;

The [[Supreme Alphabet]] is a system of interpreting text and finding deeper meaning from the NOI Lessons by assigning actual meanings to the letters of the [[Latin script]]. For example, the first letter, A, stands for Allah; the 12th letter, L, stands for Love, Hell, or Right; and the 13th letter, M, stands for Master. This Supreme Alphabet was developed with assistance from Justice Cee by Allah the Father. The method by which letters were associated with certain values is unknown.

The Five-Percent Nation holds events known as Universal Parliaments in various cities—usually once a month—to build on their interpretation of the Supreme Mathematics, lessons, and to discuss business concerning the NGE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Name of Allah|last=Allah|first=Wakeel|publisher=A Team|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; These meetings usually take place in public areas and can be held anywhere.

The Show and Prove is an annual event that takes place in the Harlem section of Manhattan every second weekend in June. Gods and Earths converge from all over the world at [[Harriet Tubman]] Elementary School for this gathering, which includes a marketplace, performances, and speeches in the school's auditorium and a [[science fair]] in which children participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2014/jun/19/five-percenters-hold-44th-annual-show-and-prove/|title=Five Percenters hold 44th annual Show and Prove|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nation generally does not recognize traditional [[holidays]], most notably those associated with religion such as [[Christmas]] or [[Easter]]. Instead, they change the meaning and celebrate how they want to. However, some regions where the Nation is active may hold events close to dates in honor of Allah the Father's birthday (February 22) or the official founding of the Nation (October 10).

Dietary laws of the Five Percent dictate that adherents are forbidden to eat [[pork]] or any pork-based by-products as well as all other scavengers (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Many take further steps and eschew meat altogether, often opting for [[veganism]] or a [[raw food]] diet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Myths and realities==
{{neutrality section|date=July 2018}}

The Five Percent is not a monolithic entity with a rigid ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakawa, Felicia M.  ''Five Percenter Rap'', 32. See also the analyses in Michael M. Knight The ''Five Percenters'' 187-207 and 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is not possible to posit that Five Percenters all believe or espouse a particular thing. Each member is considered divine in his or her own right and, thus, establishes a way of life, philosophy, ontology, epistemology to fit one's existence based on one's study and personal and community analysis of particular laws, lessons, and sciences.&lt;ref name="wash123"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Manifestations_of_Masculine_Magnificence.html?id=gEHXAgAAQBAJ|title=Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence: Divinity in Africana Life, Lyrics, and Literature|last=Washington|first=Teresa N.|publisher=Oya's Tornado|year=2014|isbn=978-0991073009|location=|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gods' personal and communal intellectual development occurs through personal study of lessons, "builds" in local ciphers, and "Educational Show and Prove" sessions at Universal Parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Name of Allah |last=Allah |first=Wakeel |publisher=A Team|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=304–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence: Divinity in Africana Life, Lyrics, and Literature'', Teresa Washington writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is easy to assume that there is one single Five Percent doctrine. But the secret of the Nation's longevity and vitality is that it revolves around the acknowledged and respected autonomous power of the Divine and the ability of the Divinities to reason and exchange information to facilitate intellectual growth and philosophical and scientific enlightenment. The cipher is central to the Gods because it where knowledge is continually and holistically born. The resilience and relevance of the Gods is a direct result of the fact that they are not a monolithic group with a corpus of edicts and beliefs.&lt;ref name="wash123" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allah the Father worked closely with [[John Lindsay|John V.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We need to know that there is a feminine and masculine principal or consciousness that is considered the God or the Creator. It's not a male, like religion will tell you. It's a mother/father principle, a masculine/feminine principle.&lt;p&gt;The feminine principle is what gives birth to the universe. It's what brings creation forth, so there has to be an acknowledgement and respect for her in order to bring back the balance. In religion, in Christianity and in Islam, in all religions ... it's a perverted piece of the truth, when it doesn't hold the woman on a pedestal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Manifestations_of_Masculine_Magnificence.html?id=gEHXAgAAQBAJ|title=Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence: Divinity in Africana Life, Lyrics, and Literature|last=Quoted in Washington|first=Teresa N.|publisher=Oya's Tornado|year=2014|isbn=978-0991073009|location=|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a similar vein, Just I C Equality Allah asserts that gender equality is an inherent aspect of ALLAH: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We all have the components that make the physical. Allah is the all in all.

==Hip hop==

In its article on Five Percenter [[Jay Electronica]], ''[[Vice Magazine]]'' stated in regard to the Five Percent Nation: "It's a movement that's been affiliated with hip-hop from the very beginning, coining terms like 'ciphers' and 'dropping science' and influencing everyone, [[World's Famous Supreme Team]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Rakim]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Brand Nubian]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Poor Righteous Teachers]], [[Nas]], and [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]]. With these artists, and any others associated with the Five Percenters, music was more than just a message."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/the-prestige-the-five-percenters-and-why-jay-electronica-hasnt-released-his-debut-album|title=The Prestige, The Five Percenters, and Why Jay Electronica Hasn't Released His Debut Album &amp;#124; NOISEY|last=Bassil|first=Ryan|date=2013-10-23|publisher=Noisey.vice.com|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nation of Gods and Earth has propagated its teachings throughout the [[United States]] and abroad. In the early 1980s, this spread was in part due to early adherents teaching when away at college or in the military and, more famously, because of the rise of [[hip hop music]]. The main theme of the NGE doctrine spoken on hip hop records were the teachings that black people were the original or first human life to walk the planet, that the Blackman is God, the Blackwoman is Earth, and through the inner [[esoteric]] powers of the Gods and Earths, the youth can transform and possess its true [[potential]], which aspires to overthrow the overbearing [[oligarchy]] by becoming just rulers of themselves. This especially meshed well with conscious themes found in other golden-age hip hop recordings.

Early hip-hop acts affiliated with the Five Percenters, and who spread its teachings through hip hop, include two MCs of the late 1980s–early '90s conscious-rap era—[[Rakim]] of [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwhU7vQ5ancC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=SPIN - Google Books|date=|publisher=Books.google.com.au|accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Big Daddy Kane]]. These two acts, as well as some of their other contemporaries, infused Five-Percent teachings and symbolism throughout their music and videos. This reputation brought fans of Rakim in particular to refer to him as the God MC. Not soon after Rakim and Kane's heyday rose acts that were even more explicit with allegiance to the NGE, most notably [[Brand Nubian]], [[Poor Righteous Teachers]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Killarmy]], [[Sunz of Man]], [[Gravediggaz]] and [[Busta Rhymes]]. The popularity of these acts sparked a boom of new NGE students. Even the Caucasian hip hop group [[3rd Bass]] cited NGE lessons in the song "Triple Stage Darkness" and other songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/3rd-bass-triple-stage-darkness-lyrics|title=3rd Bass – Triple Stage Darkness|website=Genius|publisher=[[Genius.com]]|language=en|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Percenters were the innovators behind early hip-hop slang, including "Word is bond", "Break it down", "peace", "droppin' science", and "represent".&lt;ref name="HipHopWired" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shobak.org/text/hiphop-full.html|title=FEAR OF A MUSLIM PLANET:THE ISLAMIC ROOTS OF HIP-HOP|last=Mohaiemen|first=Naeem|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002100445/http://www.shobak.org/text/hiphop-full.html|archive-date=2013-10-02|dead-url=yes|access-date=2013-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many MCs employ the technique and terminology of the Supreme Alphabet to create [[acrostics]], [[acronyms]] and [[backronyms]] in their rhymes. For example, in the song "Wildflower," [[Ghostface Killah]] rhymes, "I'm God Cipher Divine," spelling G-O-D in the Supreme Alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackapologetics.com/supremealpha.html|title=Supreme Alphabet|date=|publisher=Blackapologetics.com|accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/Ghostface-killah-wildflower-lyrics|title=Ghostface Killah – Wildflower Lyrics|date=|publisher=Rap Genius|accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, The [[RZA]] directly rhymes the Twelve Jewels of life's objectives on his later work with [[Gravediggaz]], rhyming in succession: Knowledge, Wisdom, Understanding, Freedom, Justice, Equality, Food, Clothing, Shelter, Love, Peace, Happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Gravediggaz-twelve-jewelz-lyrics|title=Gravediggaz – Twelve Jewelz|website=Genius|publisher=[[Genius.com]]|language=en|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regularly wears an eight-pointed star pendant with a number seven and a crescent, which can be seen on the cover of his album ''[[The World According to RZA]]''.

Five Percenters in New York City were even known as a visible presence at parties during hip hop's formative years of the 1970s. Scene pioneer [[DJ Kool Herc]] recalled that while there was a heavy gang presence in attendance, the Five Percenters were also there as a ''de facto'' peace-keeping element.&lt;ref name="GodHop"&gt;{{cite book|title=Five Percenter Rap: God-Hop's Music, Message, and Black Muslim Mission|author=Felicia M. Miyakawa|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of hip hop and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] acts who are (or have been) associated with Five Percent teachings include [[Killah Priest]], [[Digable Planets]], [[J-Live]], [[Nas]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/bookshl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RYDz9CzQtAQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=nas+percenter&amp;ots=VeSjFuIdnO&amp;sig=uf3kln06BfJQ7VwOL1KJZEodnO8#v=onepage&amp;q=nas%20percenter&amp;f=false ''Five Percenter rap: God hop's music, message, and black Muslim mission''] Miyakawa, Felicia M., p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erykah Badu]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Planet Asia]], [[Guru (rapper)|the Guru]], and [[Petey Pablo]].

The '''national flag of [[Latvia]]''' ({{lang-lv|Latvijas karogs}}) was used by independent Latvia from 1918 until the country was [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|occupied]] by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940. Its use was suppressed during Soviet rule. Shortly before [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|regaining]] its independence, Latvia re-adopted on 27 February 1990 the same red-white-red flag.

Though officially adopted in 1923, the Latvian flag was in use as early as the 13th century.  The red colour is sometimes described as symbolizing the readiness of the Latvians to give the blood from their hearts for freedom and their willingness to defend their liberty. An alternative interpretation, according to one legend, is that a Latvian leader was wounded in battle, and the edges of the white sheet in which he was wrapped were stained by his blood. The white stripe may stand for the sheet that wrapped him. This story is similar to the legend of the origins of the [[flag of Austria]].

== History ==
[[File:Stamps of Latvia, 2010-18.jpg|thumb|Stamp commemorating the centenary of the Latvian flag, with [[Ansis Cīrulis]] holding his design.]]
The red-white-red Latvian flag ({{lang-de|die Banier der Letten}}) is first mentioned in the medieval ''[[Livonian Rhymed Chronicle|Rhymed Chronicle of Livonia]]'' (''Livländische Reimchronik''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.old.historia.lv/alfabets/A/AT/atskanu_hronika/hronikas_teksts/09038_10040.vacu.htm Livlädische Reimchronik] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215035451/http://www.old.historia.lv/alfabets/A/AT/atskanu_hronika/hronikas_teksts/09038_10040.vacu.htm |date=2014-12-15 }}: ''die quâmen hovelîchen dar / mit einer banier rôtgevar,/ daß was mit wîße durch gesniten/ hûte nâch wendischen siten./ Wenden ist ein burc genant,/ von den die banier wart bekant,/ und ist in Letten lant gelegen,/ dâ die vrowen rîtens pflegen/ nâch den siten, als die man./ vor wâr ich ûch daß sagen kan,/ die banier der Letten ist.'' (09223-09233)&lt;/ref&gt; which covers the period from 1180 to 1343, and is thus among the oldest flags in the world. The chronicle tells of a battle that took place around 1279, in which ancient Latvian tribes from [[Cēsis]], a city in the northern part of modern-day Latvia, went to war, bearing a red flag with a white stripe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flaggenlexikon.de/flett.htm |title=National Flagge des Lettland|accessdate=2003-04-27 |author=Volker Preuß|coauthors= |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend recounts the story of the mortally wounded chief of a [[Latgalians|Latvian tribe]] who was wrapped in a white sheet. The part of the sheet on which he was lying remained white, but the two edges were stained in his blood. During the next battle the bloodstained sheet was used as a flag. According to the legend this time the Latvian warriors were successful and drove the enemy away. Ever since then Latvian tribes have used these colours.

Based on the aforementioned historical record, the present day flag design was adapted by artist [[Ansis Cīrulis]] in May 1917. The Latvian national flag, together with the national coat of arms was affirmed in this format by a special parliamentary decree of the Republic of Latvia passed on 15 June 1921.

===Occupation===
{{main|Flag of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic}}
During the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|period of occupation]] by the [[Soviet Union]] (and briefly by [[Nazi Germany]]), the red-white-red Latvian flag was rendered useless from 1940-1941 and 1944-1991. Any production and public display of the nationalist Latvian flag was considered anti-state crime and punishable by law. The first flag of Soviet Latvia was a red flag with the gold [[hammer and sickle]] in the top-left corner, with the Latin characters LPSR (''Latvijas Padomju Sociālistiskā Republika'') above them in gold in a serif font. In 1953, the final version of the flag was adopted. It depicts the Soviet flag with six 1/3 blue wavy bands representing the sea on the bottom.

===Restoration===
Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'' initiatives, the flag of independent Latvia was restored on 15 February 1990,&lt;ref name=Stelpe263&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dzintra Stelpe |title=Lielā Latvijas Enciklopēdija. |language=Latvian |publisher=Zvaigzne ABC |location=Riga |page=263 |year=2009 |isbn=9789984408095 |oclc=644036298}}&lt;/ref&gt; one and a half years before the formal recognition of Latvian independence.

== Colours and proportions ==
Per Latvian law ''The Latvian national flag is [[Carmine (color)|carmine red]] with white horizontal stripe.'' ({{Lang-lv|tumši sarkana (karmin)}})&lt;ref&gt;''Latvijas valsts karogs ir karmīnsarkans ar baltu horizontālu svītru.'' (The Latvian national flag is carmine red with white horizontal stripes.){{Cite web|title = Latvijas valsts karoga likums (The Latvian flag law)|date = 17 November 2009|language = Latvian|publisher = The Saeima (legislature) of Latvia|url = http://www.saeima.lv/lv/par-saeimu/simbolika/latvijas-valsts-karoga-likums/|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101127103108/http://saeima.lv/lv/par-saeimu/simbolika/latvijas-valsts-karoga-likums|archivedate = 27 November 2010|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colour on the flag is sometimes referred to as ''Latvian red''. The red colour of the Latvian flag is a particularly dark shade, which is composed of [[brown]] and [[purple]]. The flag's colour proportions are 2:1:2 (the upper and lower red bands each being twice as wide as the central white band), and the ratio of the height of the flag to its width is fixed at 1:2.

== Display of the flag ==
[[File:Flag of Latvia photo.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|Flagpole]]
Latvian law states that the flag and [[national colours]] can be displayed and used as an ornament if proper respect to the flag is guaranteed.  Destruction, disrespectful treatment or incorrect display of the flag is punishable by law.

The flag shall be placed at least {{convert|2.5|m}} above the ground and properly secured to the flagstaff.  The flagstaff shall be longer than the longest side of the flag, straight, painted white, and preferably made of wood.  The [[finial]] at the tip of the flagstaff shall be wider than the flagstaff.  Where the flag is not displayed continuously, it shall be raised at sunrise and lowered at sunset.  If flown for a festival or funeral, it shall be raised before and lowered after the end of the occasion.

If the flag is flown from a flagpole in mourning, it shall be raised to half-staff.  If fixed to a flagstaff, a black ribbon whose width is {{frac|20}} the width of the flag shall be secured to the flagstaff above the flag; the ribbon shall be of sufficient length to span the width of the flag.

== History ==

=== 1940s origins ===
{{See also|Hipster (1940s subculture)|Hip (slang)}}
[[File:Wiliam P. Gottlieb, Portrait of Harry Gibson, New York, ca. July 1948 (LOC gottlieb.11851).jpg|thumb|[[Dixieland|Hot jazz]] artist [[Harry Gibson]] (at the piano), coiner of the word ''hipster'' in the 1940s]]

The term was coined during the [[Jazz Age]], when "hip" emerged as an adjective to describe aficionados of the growing scene.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; Although the adjective's exact origins are disputed, some say it was a derivative of "hop", a slang term for [[opium]], while others believe it comes from the West African word ''hipi'', meaning "to open one's eyes".&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; Another argument suggests the term derives from the practice of lying on one's hip while smoking opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826388,00.html |title=JAZZ: Drugs &amp; Drums |publisher=TIME |date=1960-05-02 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate meaning of "hip", attested as early as 1902, is "aware" or "in the know". Conversely, the antonym ''unhip'' connotes those who are unaware of their surroundings, also including those who are opposed to hipness.

Nevertheless, "hip" eventually acquired the common English suffix ''-ster'' (as in ''[[spinster]]'' and ''[[gangster]]''), and "hipster" entered the language.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; The first dictionary to list the word is the short glossary "For Characters Who Don't Dig Jive Talk", which was included with [[Harry Gibson]]'s 1944 album, ''Boogie Woogie In Blue''. The entry for "hipsters" defined them as "characters who like hot jazz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyzercreek.com/boogie_in_blue.htm|title=Boogie In Blue|work=hyzercreek.com|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not a complete glossary of jive, however, as it included only jive expressions that were found in the lyrics to his songs.
[[File:Zootsuit2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zoot suit|Zoot-suited]] hipsters in the 1940s]]
The same year, [[Cab Calloway]] published ''The New Cab Calloway's Hepster's Dictionary of Jive'', which had no listing for "hipster", and because there was also a 1939 edition of Calloway's Hepster's (an obvious play on "[[Webster's]]") Dictionary, it appears that "[[hepster]]" pre-dates "hipster". The term used in African-American culture was originally spelled "hep," as in [[Cab Calloway]]'s famous song ''(Hep Hep) The Jumpin' Jive'' recorded on July 17, 1939. 'Hep' is also used in ''Mezz Mezzrow'' essential account of underground jazz culture ''Really the Blues'' (published in 1946).

Initially, hipsters were usually middle-class white youths seeking to emulate the lifestyle of the largely black jazz musicians they followed.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; In ''The Jazz Scene'' (1959), author [[Eric Hobsbawm]] (originally writing under the pen name Francis Newton) described hipster language—i.e., "jive-talk or hipster-talk"—as "an [[argot]] or [[Cant (language)|cant]] designed to set the group apart from outsiders". This group crucially includes white jazz musicians such as [[Benny Goodman]], [[Al Cohn]], [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Mezz Mezzrow]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Joey Bishop]], [[Chet Baker]], and [[Gene Krupa]] who ought to be counted as some of the true original hipsters as they were instrumental in turning the white world onto jazz and its underground culture in the 1930s and 1940s.

The subculture rapidly expanded, and after [[World War II]], a burgeoning literary scene grew up around it.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; [[Jack Kerouac]] described 1940s [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipsters]] as "rising and roaming America, bumming and hitchhiking everywhere [as] characters of a special spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.tc/kerouac/beat.html Kerouac, Jack. "About the Beat Generation", (1957), published as "Aftermath: The Philosophy of the Beat Generation" in ''Esquire'', March 1958] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107052429/http://archive.tc/kerouac/beat.html |date=November 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the beginning of his poem ''[[Howl]]'', [[Allen Ginsberg]] mentioned "angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night". In his essay "[[The White Negro]]", [[Norman Mailer]] characterized hipsters as American [[existentialists]], living a life surrounded by death—annihilated by atomic war or strangled by social conformity—and electing instead to "divorce [themselves] from society, to exist without roots, to set out on that uncharted journey into the rebellious imperatives of the self".&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt;

== 21st-century hipsters ==

In early 2000, both ''The New York Times'' and ''Time Out New York'' ran profiles of [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] without using the term ''hipster''. The ''Times'' referred to "bohemians"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brooklyn Nights Turn Brighter|first=Ann|last=Powers|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 11, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/11/movies/brooklyn-nights-turn-brighter.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''TONY'' to "arty East Village types".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Bedford Files|journal=Time Out New York|date=February 3–10, 2000|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, when ''[[The Hipster Handbook]]'' was published by Williamsburg resident [[Robert Lanham]], the term had come into widespread use in relation to Williamsburg and similar neighborhoods. ''The Hipster Handbook'' described hipsters as young people with "[[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircuts]], swinging retro [[Handbag|pocketbook]]s, talking on [[cell phone]]s, smoking European [[cigarette]]s... strutting in [[platform shoes]] with a [[biography]] of [[Che Guevara]] sticking out of their bags".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lanham, ''The Hipster Handbook'' (2003) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Lanham further describes hipsters: "You graduated from a liberal arts school whose football team hasn't won a game since the [[Reagan administration]]" and "you have one [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] friend who you always describe as being your 'one Republican friend.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; Mark Greif  dates the initial phase of the revival of the term from 1999 to 2003.&lt;ref name="Mark Greif" /&gt;

A similar phenomenon occurred in the United Kingdom, with young workers in the media and digital industries moving into traditional working class areas of London such as [[Hoxton]], [[Spitalfields]], and, particularly, [[Shoreditch]]. The subculture was parodied in the magazine ''[[Shoreditch Twat]]'' (1999) and the television sitcom ''[[Nathan Barley]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://overlycriticalreviews.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/nathan-barley-retrospective-review-charlie-brooker-christopher-morris/ |title=Nathan Barley: A retrospective review, the self-loathing of Charlie Brooker, and the elusiveness of Christopher Morris|work=Overly Critical Reviews|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005). The series, about a self-described "self-facilitating media node",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426654/quotes |publisher=IMDb|title=Nathan Barley – Quotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the term "Nathan Barleys" being used pejoratively to describe the culture it parodied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/04/cameron_east_london_post_olympic_tech_city/|title=Nathan Barleys to fill Olympic chasm - Cameron|work=theregister.co.uk|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''[[Utne Reader]]'' magazine writer Jake Mohan described "[[Hipster hop|hipster rap]]" as "consisting of the most recent crop of MCs and DJs who flout conventional hip-hop fashions, eschewing baggy clothes and gold chains for tight jeans, big sunglasses, the occasional [[keffiyeh]], and other trappings of the hipster lifestyle". He notes that the "old-school hip-hop website Unkut, and [[Jersey City]] rapper Mazzi" have criticized mainstream rappers whom they deem to be [[poseur|posers]] or "fags for copping the [[metrosexual]] appearances of hipster fashion".&lt;ref name=HipsterRap&gt;{{cite web | title=Hipster Rap: The Latest Hater Battleground | first=Jake|last=Mohan | url=http://www.utne.com/arts/hipster-rap-the-latest-hater-battleground.aspx | publisher=[[Utne Reader]] | date=2008-06-13 | accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prefix Mag'' writer Ethan Stanislawski argues that there are racial elements to the rise of hipster rap. He claims that there "have been a slew of angry retorts to the rise of hipster rap", which he says can be summed up as "white kids want the funky otherness of hip-hop...without all the scary black people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Chicago Reader has hip-hop hipster backlash against hip-hop hipster backlash | first=Ethan|last=Stanislawski | url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/hip-hop-hipster-backlash/19451/ |journal=[[Prefix Magazine]] | date=2008-06-20 | accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article described hipsters thus: "take your grandmother's sweater and [[Bob Dylan]]'s [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|Wayfarers]], add jean shorts, [[Converse All-Stars]] and a can of [[Pabst Blue Ribbon|Pabst]] and bam—hipster."&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' writer Brandon Stosuy noted that "[[heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] has recently conquered a new frontier, making an unexpected crossover into the realm of hipsterdom". He argues that the "current revival seems to be a natural mutation from the hipster fascination with post-punk, noise, and no wave", which allowed even the "nerdiest indie kids to dip their toes into jagged, autistic sounds". He argues that a "byproduct" of this development was an "investigation of a musical culture that many had previously feared or fetishized from afar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Heavy Metal: It's alive and flourishing | first=Brandon|last=Stosuy | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2005/08/heavy_metal.html | publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=2005-08-19 | accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his 2011 book ''HipsterMattic'', author [[Matt Granfield]] described hipster culture:&lt;ref name="HipsterMattic"&gt;{{cite book |last= Granfield |first= Matt |title= ''HipsterMattic'' |publisher= [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1-74237-785-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|While mainstream society of the 2000s (decade) had been busying itself with reality television, dance music, and locating the whereabouts of Britney Spears's underpants, an uprising was quietly and conscientiously taking place behind the scenes. Long-forgotten styles of clothing, beer, cigarettes and music were becoming popular again. [[Retro]] was cool, the environment was precious, and old was the new 'new'. Kids wanted to wear [[Sylvia Plath]]'s cardigans and [[Buddy Holly]]'s glasses—they revelled in the irony of making something so [[nerdy]] so cool. They wanted to live sustainably and eat organic gluten-free grains. Above all, they wanted to be recognised for being different—to diverge from the mainstream and carve a cultural niche all for themselves. For this new generation, style wasn't something you could buy in a department store, it became something you found in a thrift shop, or, ideally, made yourself. The way to be cool wasn't to look like a television star: it was to look like as though you'd never seen television.}}

As hipsters—"young creatives" priced out of [[Bohemian style|Bohemian]] urban neighborhoods in [[Brooklyn]] such as [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]], and [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]]—moved into [[suburb]]s near New York City, ''[[The New York Times]]'' coined the [[neologism]] "Hipsturbia" to describe the hip lifestyle as lived in suburbia.

A minor trend of cross acculturation of Chabad Hasidism and Hipster subculture appeared within the [[Jews in New York City|New York Jewish community]], beginning in the late 2000s. A significant number of members of the [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic]] community, mostly residing [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn]], appear to now have adopted various cultural affinities as the local hipster subculture. These cross-acculturated Hasidim have been dubbed "[[Chabad hipsters]]" or "Hasidic hipsters".&lt;ref name=birthofhasidic&gt;Greenfield, Nicole.

[[File:Propaganda against Hipster Style in Dresden.jpg|thumb|2014 anti-hipster sticker in [[Dresden, Germany]].]]
Christian Lorentzen of ''Time Out New York'' argues that "hipsterism [[commodity fetishism|fetishizes]] the authentic" elements of all of the "fringe movements of the postwar era—Beat, hippie, punk, even grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity" and "gay style," and then "regurgitates it with a winking inauthenticity." He claims that this group of "18-to-34-year-olds," who are mostly white, "have defanged, skinned and consumed" all of these influences.&lt;ref name="killthehip" /&gt; Lorentzen says hipsters, "in their present undead incarnation," are "essentially people who think of themselves as being cooler than America," also referring to them as "the assassins of cool." He argues that [[metrosexual]]ity is the hipster appropriation of [[gay culture]], as a trait carried over from their "Emo" phase. He writes that "these [[aesthetics]] are assimilated&amp;mdash;cannibalized&amp;mdash;into a repertoire of meaninglessness, from which the hipster can construct an identity in the manner of a collage, or a shuffled playlist on an [[iPod]]."&lt;ref name="killthehip" /&gt; He also criticizes how the subculture's original menace has long been abandoned and has been replaced with "the form of not-quite-passive aggression called [[wikt:snark#Noun|snark]]".&lt;ref name="killthehip" /&gt;

In a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' article entitled "Who's a Hipster?", Julia Plevin argues that the "definition of 'hipster' remains opaque to anyone outside this self-proclaiming, highly-selective circle". She claims that the "whole point of hipsters is that they avoid labels and being labeled. However, they all dress the same and act the same and conform in their non-conformity" to an "iconic carefully created sloppy vintage look".&lt;ref name="plevin"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's a Hipster?|first=Julia|last=Plevin|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|date=2008-08-08|accessdate=2014-05-06|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-plevin/whos-a-hipster_b_117383.html |newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Horning developed a critique of hipsterism in his April 2009 article "The Death of the Hipster" in ''[[PopMatters]]'', exploring several possible definitions for the hipster. He muses that the hipster might be the "embodiment of [[postmodernism]] as a spent force, revealing what happens when pastiche and irony exhaust themselves as aesthetics", or might be "a kind of permanent cultural middleman in hypermediated late capitalism, selling out alternative sources of social power developed by outsider groups, just as the original 'white negros' evinced by [[Norman Mailer]] did to the original, pre-pejorative 'hipsters'&amp;mdash;blacks". Horning also proposed that the role of hipsters may be to "appropriat[e] the new cultural capital forms, delivering them to mainstream media in a commercial form and stripping their inventors ... of the power and the glory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Death of the Hipster | first=Rob|last=Horning | work=[[Pop Matters]] | url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/the-death-of-the-hipster-panel/ | date=2009-04-13 | accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horning argues that the "problem with hipsters" is the "way in which they reduce the particularity of anything you might be curious about or invested in into the same dreary common denominator of how 'cool' it is perceived to be", as "just another signifier of personal identity". Furthermore, he argues that the "hipster is defined by a lack of authenticity, by a sense of lateness to the scene" or the way that they transform the situation into a "self-conscious scene, something others can scrutinize and exploit".

[[File:BywaterKeepOffHipstersStepsB.jpg|thumb|"Hipsters manage to attract a loathing unique in its intensity." –Dan Fletcher, ''Time Magazine''.]]
Dan Fletcher in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' seems to support this theory, positing that stores like [[Urban Outfitters]] have mass-produced hipster [[List of chics|chic]], merging hipsterdom with parts of mainstream culture, thus overshadowing its originators' still-strong alternative art and music scene.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; According to Fletcher, "Hipsters manage to attract a loathing unique in its intensity. Critics have described the loosely defined group as smug, full of contradictions and, ultimately, the dead end of Western civilization."&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt;

Elise Thompson, an editor for the LA blog ''LAist'' argues that "people who came of age in the 70s and 80s punk rock movement seem to universally hate 'hipsters'", which she defines as people wearing "expensive 'alternative' fashion[s]", going to the "latest, coolest, hippest bar...[and] listen[ing] to the latest, coolest, hippest band". Thompson argues that hipsters "don't seem to subscribe to any particular philosophy ... [or] ... particular genre of music". Instead, she argues that they are "[[mercenary|soldiers of fortune]] of style" who take up whatever is popular and in style, "appropriat[ing] the style[s]" of past countercultural movements such as punk, while "discard[ing] everything that the style stood for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Elise|title=Why Does Everyone Hate Hipster Assholes?|date=February 20, 2008|url=http://laist.com/2008/02/20/why_does_everyo.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306054749/http://laist.com/2008/02/20/why_does_everyo.php|archivedate=March 6, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing from [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s work and [[Thomas Frank]]'s theories of [[co-optation]], Zeynep Arsel and Craig Thompson argue that in order to segment and [[Cultural appropriation|co-opt]] the indie marketplace, mass media and marketers have engaged in commercial "mythmaking" and contributed to the formation of the contemporary discourse about hipsters.&lt;ref name="Arsel and Thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arsel|first1=Zeynep|first2=Craig J.|last2=Thompson|jstor=10.1086/656389|title=Demythologizing Consumption Practices: How Consumers Protect their Field-Dependent Identity Investments From Devaluing Marketplace Myths|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=August 26, 2010|doi=10.1086/656389}}&lt;/ref&gt; They substantiate this argument using a historical [[discourse analysis]] of the term and its use in the popular culture, based on Arsel's dissertation that was published in 2007. Their claim is that the contemporary depiction of hipster is generated through mass media narratives with different commercial and ideological interests. In other words, hipster is less of an objective category, and more of a culturally- and ideologically-shaped and mass-mediated modern mythology that appropriates the [[Indie (music)|indie]] consumption [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]] and eventually turns into a form of [[Social stigma|stigma]]. Arsel and Thompson also interview participants of the indie culture (DJs, designers, writers) to better understand how they feel about being labeled as one. Their findings demonstrate three strategies for dissociation from the hipster [[stereotype]]: aesthetic discrimination, symbolic demarcation, and proclaiming sovereignty. These strategies, empowered by one's status in the indie field (or their [[cultural capital]]) enable these individuals to defend their field dependent cultural investments and tastes from devaluing hipster mythology.

[[File:No Hipsters!.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Humorous and [[passive-aggressive]] "no hipsters" sign at the entrance to a venue.]]
Arsel and Thompson's work seeks to explain why people who are ostensibly fitting the hipster stereotype profusely deny being one: they argue that hipster mythology devalues their tastes and interests and thus they have to socially distinguish themselves from this cultural category and defend their tastes from devaluation. To succeed in denying being a hipster, while looking, acting, and consuming like one, Arsel and Thompson suggest that these individuals demythologize their existing consumption practices by engaging in rhetorics and practices that symbolically differentiate their actions from the hipster [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigma]].&lt;ref name="Arsel and Thompson"/&gt;

[[Mark Greif]], a founder of ''[[n+1]]'' and an Assistant Professor at [[The New School]], in a ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial, states that "hipster" is often used by youth from disparate economic backgrounds to jockey for [[social status|social position]]. He questions the contradictory nature of the label, and the way that no one thinks of themselves as a hipster: "Paradoxically, those who used the insult were themselves often said to resemble hipsters—they wore the skinny jeans and big eyeglasses, gathered in tiny enclaves in big cities, and looked down on mainstream fashions and 'tourists'." He believes the much-cited difficulty in analyzing the term stems from the fact that any attempt to do so provokes universal anxiety, since it "calls everyone's bluff". Like Arsel and Thompson, he draws from ''[[La Distinction]]'' by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] to conclude:

{{quote|You can see how hipster neighborhoods are crossroads where young people from different origins, all crammed together, jockey for social gain. One hipster subgroup's strategy is to disparage others as "[[liberal arts college]] grads with too much time on their hands"; the attack is leveled at the children of the [[upper middle class]] who move to cities after college with hopes of working in the "creative professions". These hipsters are instantly declassed, reservoired in abject [[internship]]s and ignored in the urban hierarchy—but able to use college-taught skills of classification, collection and appreciation to generate a superior body of [[cultural capital|cultural "cool"]].
They, in turn, may malign the "trust fund hipsters". This challenges the wealthy who possess money, but but lack culture, and convert real capital into "cultural capital" ([[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu's]] most famous coinage), acquiring subculture as if it were ready-to-wear. (Think of Paris Hilton in her trucker hat.) Both groups, meanwhile, look down on the couch-surfing, old-clothes-wearing hipsters who seem most authentic but are also often the most socially precarious—the lower-middle-class young, moving up through style, but with no backstop of parental culture or family capital. They are the bartenders and boutique clerks who wait on their well-to-do peers and wealthy tourists. Only on the basis of their cool clothes can they be "superior": hipster knowledge compensates for economic immobility.&lt;ref name=NYT111310&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mark Greif|title=The Hipster in the Mirror|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/books/review/Greif-t.html |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 12, 2010|quote=All hipsters play at being the inventors or first adopters of novelties: pride comes from knowing, and deciding, what’s cool in advance of the rest of the world}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Greif's efforts puts the term "hipster" into a [[socioeconomic]] framework rooted in the [[Petite bourgeoisie|petite bourgeois]] tendencies of a youth generation unsure of their future social status. The cultural trend is indicative of a social structure with heightened economic anxiety and lessened class mobility.&lt;ref name=NYT111310 /&gt;

"'''Improbable'''" is the thirteenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]] and the 195th episode overall of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. The episode first aired in the United States and Canada on April 7, 2002 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom. It was written and directed by series creator and executive producer [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]. The episode is a "monster-of-the-week" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]], or overarching fictional history, of ''The X-Files''. The episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 5.1 and was viewed by 9.1 million viewers. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s; this season focuses on the investigations of [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). In this episode, Reyes and her fellow agents investigate a serial killer who uses numerology to choose his victims. Soon, Reyes and Scully meet an unusual man who may prove more of a hindrance than a help.

"Improbable" features [[Burt Reynolds]] playing God. Reynolds was chosen after he expressed his desire to appear in an episode of ''The X-Files'' to Robert Patrick. Carter approved the idea, and Patrick later said that Reynolds enjoyed filming the episode. "Improbable" contains several elaborate effects, such as a cityscape rendered to look like Reynolds' head. Furthermore, the episode contains themes pertaining to fate, free will, and numerology. The tagline for this episode is "Dio Ti Ama", meaning "God loves you" in Italian, replacing the usual phrase "The Truth is Out There."

== Plot ==
At a casino bar, an unpleasant man known as "Wayno" ([[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]]) meets a mysterious, mustachioed man ([[Burt Reynolds]]) who seems to know a lot about him. The mysterious man speaks in an enigmatic way, but his words do not seem to make any difference to Wayno, who murders a woman in a casino restroom shortly after the mysterious man tells him to "surprise him" by leaving the casino rather than following the woman into the restroom.

Agent [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) is investigating the woman's murder as the latest in a series of cases that she believes are linked by [[numerology]]. She realizes that when she adds the numbers of letters in the victims' names with the numbers in their birthdates, a pattern arises. While explaining the case to [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]), who rejects the idea that numerology is relevant or that the world can be broken down into one simple equation, Scully discovers another possible clue—marks on each of the victim's cheeks that looks like three small circles, likely imprinted by the killer's ring while he beat the victims. On consulting a numerologist, who happens to have an office in the same building as the killer's apartment, Reyes ties the murders together. However, the killer also finds the numerologist, murdering her as she is on the phone with Reyes.

Reyes' numerology theories do not go down well at the FBI, but the pattern of the killings, when viewed on a map, seem to line up as the number six (6). After looking at the pictures of the victims, Scully realizes that the pattern on the victims was not three circles, but instead, three sixes, the mark of the devil. Meanwhile, Wayno has several additional run-ins with the mysterious man, who continues to give cryptic advice.

Scully and Reyes revisit the murdered numerologist's office and meet the killer in the elevator. Scully recognizes the ring on the killer's hand as the agents exit the elevator, and draws her gun on him. The killer slips back into the elevator and gets to the parking lot first. Reyes and Scully arrive only to see a car fleeing the garage and the gate closing behind it. Scully and Reyes are locked in the garage without a way out and their phones are without service.

They see another person hiding in a car and demand that he come out. It is the strange man. He says he is meeting a friend to play checkers, but does not know when his friend is coming. He does not have any identification and does not have a phone. The pair demand that he open his trunk. Inside are many CDs—the man proclaims his love of music—and a checker board. To pass the time, the mysterious man engages Reyes and Scully in a game of checkers. They play several rounds. Reyes eventually realizes that the checkers' colors (red &amp; black) are surrogates for Scully (a redhead) and herself (a brunette); The pair realize that the last victim, the numerologist (victim number 7) was a blonde, and that the murderer has been following a pattern of killing a blonde, then a redhead, then a brunette. Thus, a redhead and a brunette are the anticipated hair-colors of the next two victims. Scully and Reyes also realize that, although they assumed that the car that exited the garage was the killer, it was possible that the killer might still be inside the garage with them. Scully and Reyes begin searching, but are surprised by the killer, who shuts off the lights, grabs Reyes and eventually gets hold of her gun. However, [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), also realizing that the number "6" pattern is actually a "9" and that the killer must intend to have two more victims, arrives in the nick of time to shoot him. Reyes attempts to ask the killer why he did what he did. The killer begins to mouth a word, but dies before being able to speak to Reyes. Scully and Reyes then realize that the mysterious man is no longer in the garage.

At the end of the episode, Scully and Reyes are getting ready for bed. Scully suddenly calls Reyes and asks her what her assigned numerology "number" is. Reyes informs Scully she is a "9" which means she has risen above the other numbers and understands that there is more to life than this world. The clock shows us that it is 9:09 pm. In a nearby Italian neighborhood, an Italian festival is in progress. Two men sing a jovial song in Italian and lead a crowd through the streets. The camera zooms out to reveal that the entire neighborhood, when viewed from above, suggests the appearance of Burt's face, hinting at the fact that he might be God.&lt;ref name="twp" /&gt;

== Production ==
[[File:Chris Carter (July 2008).jpg|thumb|150px|left|The episode was written and directed by [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]].]]

=== Development ===
Carter later explained that humorous episodes were important to the show, especially during the "pitch-black" ninth season.&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt; He reasoned "there are the downbeats, and then you need the relief in the tension."&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The use of numbers in this episode helped emphasize the idea "that numerology is an important part of our life and plays a part, but it really ... illustrate[s] the idea of patterns, patterns of behavior, of the ways in which numbers rule both the universe and our lives and our ability to solve things, [and] to solve our mysteries of life".&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; The tagline for this episode is "Dio Ti Ama", meaning "God loves you" in Italian, replacing the usual phrase "The Truth is Out There." The normal line "Executive Producer: Chris Carter" is also rendered in Italian, reading, "Produttore Esecutivo: Chris Carter".&lt;ref name="twp" /&gt;

[[File:Burt Reynolds 1991 portrait crop.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The episode guest starred [[Burt Reynolds]] as God.]]

The name Vicki Burdick came from a [[high school]] student [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] knew. Carter felt that he needed to kill the character "all out of fondness." Before casting [[Ellen Greene]], Carter had first spotted her in the [[Musical theatre|musical]], ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' both in "[[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]]." The first scene shot for Greene's character took a "long day". Carter called her a "trouper" and said she was open to the direction he gave her. The set for that scene was created by Tim Stepeck, the show's set decorator during its ninth season.&lt;ref name="Commentary"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] |date=2002 |title=Audio Commentary for "Improbable" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annabeth Gish later revealed that her lines were difficult to remember. She explained, "I remember learning my lines and thinking, 'Oh my God. I've got to memorize this. It's scary. Like physics united theory, all of that."&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

===Casting===
Burt Reynolds was chosen for "Improbable" after he expressed his desire to appear in an episode of ''The X-Files'' to Robert Patrick. Carter approved the idea and told Patrick that he would "write something good". He later noted that "as a young man, [Reynolds] meant something to me" and that the chance to act alongside him him was "surreal". After Carter had written the script, he presented it to Reynolds for his approval; Reynolds approved of the script and agreed to be in the episode.&lt;ref name="thetruth"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] |date=2002 |title=The Truth Behind Season 9 |location=''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]''|medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Patrick later noted that Reynolds "had a great time, and he loved working with everybody."&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

===Effects and music===
The final scene, featuring Burt's face superimposed onto the cityscape, was created by special effects supervisor Mat Beck. The only actual footage in the scene is a pull-back shot of the carnival that was filmed with the use of a crane. A CGI cityscape was then created that resembled Burt Reynolds' head. The two shots were composited together, and a blur effect was added to "[make] it sell". An alternate version of the scene was created that featured Chris Carter's head instead of Reynolds'. This version was included as a bonus feature on the season nine DVD set.&lt;ref name="sfx"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Paul Rabwin]] |year=2002 |title=Special Effects by Mat Beck with Commentary by Paul Rabwin: "Burt as City Grid" |location= ''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score for the episode, like the rest of the series, was composed by [[Mark Snow]]. Snow based much of the music in the episode on records made by [[Karl Zéro]], on the request of Carter. Carter later noted that "I had heard his music and it was so far out and it fit with exactly what I wanted to do because I wanted to recreate [the yearly celebration in] [[Little Italy]]. [...] I wanted to create that festival."&lt;ref name="fraga"&gt;Fraga, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
According to [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], the whole idea behind the episode was about numbers and that the "significance of numbers in our lives starts here on the card table where the players are being dealt a hand each."&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; He continued with "the idea is that we're all dealt hands, genetic hands, and maybe even numerological hands that give us basically the tools with which we deal and/or use for our lives."&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; He further stated that the idea was that it was "free will" and "fate", continued with that fate was determined by our own [[Genetics|genetic]]s.&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt;

The [[villain]] in the story, Mad Wayne, had been dealt a bad hand in life. Because of his situation, he "acts on his bad impulses"; Carter elaborated, "Is it fate that Wayne is about, the character, this is what I was interested in exploring here. As we'll see with the introduction in a moment of a character who throws all of this into question – God – we're going to see what his place is in all of this, or at least explore what Burt Reynolds, playing God here, has to do with the character Wayne."&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; The main idea behind the episode, was that "[[God]] knows all the numbers [because] they'e his numbers" and he is laying them down and is in "charge of the big game".&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt; God in this episode is thus "trying to show [the characters] the game" of life that is to be "won or lost". By making the wrong decisions, Wayne, by the end of the episode, has lost this game.&lt;ref name="Commentary" /&gt;

===Reviews===

But it's still pretty smart."&lt;ref name="shearman" /&gt; M.A. Crang, in his book ''Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11'', called the episode "bizarre yet amusing" and said that the central numerology story "doesn't feel like it's enough to sustain an entire episode".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11|last = Crang|first = M.A.|publisher = Createspace|year = 2015|isbn = 9781517009038|location = |pages = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jihadi tourism''', also referred to as '''jihad tourism''' or '''jihadist tourism''', is a term sometimes used to describe [[tourism|travel]] to foreign destinations with the object of scouting for terrorist training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-05-08/us/28302434_1_pakistanis-shoe-bomber-mir-aimal-kansi 'Pakistanis are posing as Indians to escape discrimination'], Times Of India, May 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; US [[diplomatic cable]]s made public by [[WikiLeaks]] in 2010 have raised concerns about this form of travel.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20025544-503543.html "WikiLeaks: "Jihadi Tourism" Worries U.S., U.K."], CBS News, December 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Within intelligence circles, the term is also sometimes applied dismissively to travellers who are assumed to be seeking contact with extremist groups mainly out of curiosity.&lt;ref name=tt/&gt;

==History==
In previous times, several people from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] along with [[Middle East]] travelled to join [[Soviet–Afghan War]].

==Tourism for terrorist training or connections==
British police characterized a visit to [[Pakistan]] by [[homegrown terrorism|homegrown terrorists]], [[Mohammad Sidique Khan]] and [[Shehzad Tanweer]], as [[jihad]]i tourism, and doubted that they were actual terrorists.  Sidique Khan and Tanweer were reported to have met [[Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi]], one of [[al-Qaeda]]’s most experienced commanders, in November 2004, when he tasked them to plan an attack in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Police Department, [http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/files/NYPD_Report-Radicalization_in_the_West.pdf “Radicalization in the West: The Homegrown Threat”] (2007), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Khan and Tanweer were later two of the four suicide bombers in the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]].&lt;ref name=tt&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardham|first=Duncan|title=7/7 inquests: MI5 had chance to identify July 7 leader|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/8341672/77-inquests-MI5-had-chance-to-identify-July-7-leader.html|accessdate=26 April 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] has many festivals ({{nihongo|[[matsuri]]|祭り}}) and other events in all of the seasons, usually based on its rich historical heritage. They are often sponsored by private businesses and, unlike those in [[Kyoto]], they are relatively small-scale events attended mostly by locals and a few tourists.&lt;ref name="KOT170"&gt;Kamakura Official Textbook for Culture and Tourism, pages 170 to 188 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; January in particular has many because it's the first month of the year, so authorities, fishermen, businesses and artisans organize events to pray for their own health and safety, and for a good and prosperous working year. Kamakura's numerous temples and shrines, first among them city symbols [[Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū]] and [[Kenchō-ji]], organize many events too, bringing the total to over a hundred.&lt;ref name="KOT170"/&gt;

Many '''[[Division (military)|Army division]]s''' have over the years earned '''[[nicknames]]'''; some [[Praise|laudatory]], some [[Insult|derogatory]], but mostly [[Interest (emotion)|colorful]]. Sometimes, the nicknames themselves have overshadowed the actual name of the division, e.g. the "Screaming Eagles" for the [[101st Airborne Division]].

==Special designation==
An official [[special designation]] is a "nickname granted to a [[military organization]]" which has been authorized by the [[Center of Military History]] and recognized through a certificate signed by the [[Secretary of the Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/orghist.html#tab_4| title = Special Designations| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Division (military)|division's]] nickname may derive from numerous sources:

* it may be inspired by the division's [[Shoulder sleeve insignia|badge or insignia]], such as the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Infantry Division]]'s  "Big Red One". On the other hand, some division's badges are actually suggested by the nickname, such as the "CY" patch of the "Cyclone Division" ([[38th Infantry Division (United States)|38th Infantry Division]]);
* it may derive from the place where the division was raised or trained ([[U.S. 36th Infantry Division|36th Infantry Division]], "[[Texas]]"), or the places of origin of the division's soldiers ([[U.S. 29th Infantry Division|29th Infantry Division]], "Blue and Gray", for [[Northern United States|northern]] and [[Southern United States|southern]] [[U.S. states|states]]);
* it may be bestowed by the enemy in battle, such as the moniker "Red Devils", a nickname for the [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]] "granted" by the [[German Army (German Empire)|Germans]] at the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]], [[World War I]];
* it may be the pairing of an adjective (such as "Fighting") paired with the division's [[Ordinal number|ordinal]], such as "The Fighting First" for the 1st Infantry Division; or
* it may defy accurate explanation (albeit not without numerous theories), such as the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]], or "Old Reliables".

Active divisions are listed in '''boldface'''; no distinction has been made between [[Regular Army (United States)|regular Army]] divisions and those of the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] or [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]. The origin of the nickname is noted where possible. In some cases, the nickname was officially adopted by the division in question; this is indicated along with date of adoption (where known). Official status might also be inferred by the presence of the nickname on official [[distinctive unit insignia]] or in official military [[source materials]].

A '''''llanero''''' ({{IPA-es|ʝaˈneɾo}}, ''plainsman'') is a South American [[herder]].  The name is taken from the [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]] grasslands occupying western-central Venezuela and eastern Colombia. The Llanero were originally part Spanish and Indian and have a strong culture including a distinctive form of music.

During the [[Latin American wars of independence]], Llaneros served in both armies and provided the bulk of the cavalry during the war. In 1819, an army of Llaneros, led by [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[José Antonio Páez]], defeated the Spanish with a surprise attack when they crossed over the [[Orinoco]] plains and the [[Andes]] mountains.

==History==
Prior to Spanish settlement in 1548, the Llanos were occupied by indigenous groups. [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] monks established settlements close to Native American villages and accomplished conversion through a mixture of persuasion and force.

The Spaniards started to graze cattle on the grasslands of the llanos and the Llanero were originally a mixture of Spaniards and Indians. Indeed, Llaneros still use many terms dating from the 16th and 17th centuries. From 1640 to 1790, outlaw [[slavery|slaves]] lived in ''cumbes'', or outlaw slave communities, and intermarried with the Llanero.

By the end of the 18th century, the region exported 30,000 [[mule]]s a year to the [[Antilles]] and salted meat for the 1.5 million slaves there and in Cuba. There were 1.2 million cattle in the area by 1815.

When the Wars of Liberation started, the Spanish enlisted the Llaneros, playing on their dislike of the ''criollos'' of the independence movement. Bolívar realized that the plains were critical to success in the wars of liberation &amp;ndash; they offered freedom of movement, as well as the capacity to feed his army.
[[File:Vuelvan caras.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Arturo Michelena]], ''Vuelvan Caras''.  The painting depicts an incident at the [[Battle of Las Queseras del Medio]], in which [[José Antonio Páez]] ordered his ''llaneros'' to turn around and attack the Spanish cavalry that was pursuing them.]]
He therefore sought to enlist the Llaneros to his cause and gradually succeeded by enduring the same hardships as they did &amp;ndash; the Llaneros called him ''culo de hierro'' &amp;ndash; or "iron [[buttocks]]" &amp;ndash; for his endurance on horseback.

The Llaneros led by Páez proved crucial in Bolivar's campaign. After leading his forces including the Llanero troops over the eastern [[Andes]], Bolívar won a critical victory at the [[Battle of Boyacá]] on August 7, 1819. Three days later, he captured [[Bogotá]] in what was the turning point of wars of liberation.

The Llaneros would also prove to be vital in future battles in the campaign. Páez's ''[[Bravos de Apure]]'' or lancers were again critical in the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on June 24, 1821, and allowed Bolivar to capture [[Caracas]]. Páez would become the first President of Venezuela.

During the 1850s, a hide boom stimulated the local economy.  A boom in [[great egret]] feathers in the early 1930s in Europe led to them being called ''white gold'' until the trade was banned.

==Llanero culture==
[[File:Joropo Dance - Eloy Palacios.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dance of Joropo at Venezuelan plains]]
Cattle form an important part of Llanero culture. There are 12 million cattle on the llano. During the year, the Llaneros have to drive cattle great distances.  During the winter [[wet season]], the Llaneros have to drive the cattle to higher ground as the poor drainage of the plains means that the annual floods are extensive. Conversely, they have to drive the cattle towards wet areas during the dry summer.

The Llaneros show their skills in [[coleo]] competitions, similar to rodeos, where they compete to drag cattle to the ground.

Llanero music is distinctive for its use of the [[harp]], the [[maraca]]s and a small guitar called a [[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]]. The [[joropo]], a Llanero dance, has become the national dance of  Venezuela, and of the Llanos of Colombia. While Llanero music is relatively unknown outside of Venezuela and Colombia, the musical groups [http://www.losllaneros.com Los Llaneros] and Cimarron have toured throughout the world.

Llanero cuisine is based on meat, fish, chicken, "chiguire" meat (also known as [[capybara]]), rice, [[arepas]], and other starches, although wheat is not used. Llanero Ken, a doll dressed in the distinctive Llanero costume [[Liqui liqui]], including a customary starched hat, has become a popular doll in Venezuela.

==North American usage==
The Spanish also used the term to describe the nomadic tribes of the [[Llano Estacado]] of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]] and was applied to the [[Apache]] in particular.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[The Lone Ranger]] is known as '''''El Llanero Solitario'''''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5415">'''Mormon Expression''' is a periodic [[podcast]] created by John Larsen dealing with issues of [[Mormonism|Mormon]] faith, culture, doctrine and history. The podcast includes a mixed format of interviews and panel discussions. The overall tone of the podcast is somewhat critical of the mainline [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]], but also includes faithful perspectives from believing Mormons.

==Content==
According to the Mormon Expression website, the podcast is a "weekly discussion of topics dealing with Mormon faith, culture, doctrine and history." It adds, "We try to straddle the position between defense and criticism of the faith, and look at it from all points of view. We believe that Mormonism is interesting by itself, and we are going to talk about it!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mormonexpression.com/about-the-podcast/ |title= About |work= Mormon Expression |publisher= mormonexpression.com |accessdate= 4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast has had several guests who are faithful Mormons, but skews towards those who are not in the mainstream or those who have abandoned the faith.

John Larsen, founder of Mormon Expression, explains that the target audience for the website is “anyone interested in Mormonism as a legitimate topic of inquiry. So much of what is out there dealing with Mormonism is either apologetic, propaganda, or vitriolic attack. We want to get to the heart of what Mormonism is, not what people would have it be – for good or for bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Mormon Expression Podcasts and Blog Explore LDS Religion |publisher= [[Suite101.com]] |date= 10 January 2011 |author= Aimee Larsen Stoddard |accessdate= 4 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The podcast was the brainchild of John Larsen who was its host and director until he retired on December 23, 2014. John had been active in the [[ex-Mormon]] community for several years before beginning the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CALM offers former Mormons empathy, support|first= Jamie |last= Lampros |date= 4 August 2007 |newspaper= [[Standard-Examiner]]}} Article [http://www.postmormon.org/exp_e/index.php/members/comments/article_in_ogden_newspaper/ reprint] at postmormon.org, and [http://activepaper.olivesoftware.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=U1NFLzIwMDcvMDgvMDQjQXIwNDAwMg==&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom reprint] at olivesoftware.com&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast began publishing episodes on June 23, 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormonexpression.com/2009/06/episode-1-leaving-the-church-but-not-leaving-it-alone/ Episode 1: Leaving the Church but not Leaving it Alone], Mormon Expression&lt;/ref&gt; and released its 100th episode on January 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormonexpression.com/2011/01/episode-100-the-live-anniversary-show/ Episode 100: The Live Anniversary Show], Mormon Expression&lt;/ref&gt;  The podcast has included an active number of regular panelists. The initial panelists including Tom Perry, James Hill, "George" Thatcher, "Nyal Davidsson" (alias) and Zilpha Larsen who is John's ex-wife. Later additions include Mike Tannehill, Glenn Ostlund and Bridget Jack Jeffries.

On February 23, 2010, the podcast won the 2009 [[Fawn M. Brodie|Brodie]] Award (an award for Mormon-themed blogs and websites) for best podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://latterdaymainstreet.com/2010/02/23/the-2009-brodie-winners-are/ |title= The 2009 Brodie Winners Are… |author= "Chanson" |date= 23 February 2010 |work= Main Street Plaza (blog) |publisher= latterdaymainstreet.com |accessdate= 4 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 30, 2010, the podcast was downloaded an average of 15,000 times per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.postmormon.org/exp_e/index.php/discussions/viewthread/26052 |title= Mormon Expression Turns 100! |last= Larsen |first= John |date= 30 December 2010 |publisher= postmormon.org |accessdate= 4 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The podcast ended on September 27, 2015, with the release of final episode #317.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larsen|first1=John|title=Episode 317: Goodbye and Thanks for Listening|url=http://mormonexpression.com/2015/09/27/episode-317-goodbye-and-thanks-for-listening/|website=Mormon Expression|publisher=Whitefields Educational Foundation|accessdate=28 September 2015|date=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same episode, Larsen announced his intent to re-release 20 episodes of his choosing with added commentary, after which time the episode archive would require a fee to access.

==Guest appearances==
Several notable individuals with ties to the Mormon Community have appeared on the podcast including [[Ed Decker]], [[Will Bagley]], Brian Keith "[[Mr. Deity]]" Dalton, Richie T. the producer of the [[Radio From Hell]] radio show, and [[Elna Baker]], author of ''The New York Regional Mormon Singles Halloween Dance'' and contributor to [[This American Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://swearingelders.blogspot.com/2009/11/i-think-im-in-love-with-elna-baker.html |title= I think I'm in love with Elna Baker |author= "Swearing Elder" |date= 11 November 2009 |work= "Swearing Elders" (blog) |publisher= blogspot.com |accessdate= 4 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5408">'''Nadaism''' ({{lang-es|Nadaísmo}}, meaning "'''Nothing-ism'''" in English) was an artistic and philosophical counterculture movement in [[Colombia]] prevalent from 1958 to 1964. The movement was founded by writer [[Gonzalo Arango]] and was influenced by [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], and the works of Colombian writer and philosopher [[Fernando González (writer)|Fernando González Ochoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Esslinger|first1=Pat M.|title=The Nadaism of Gonzalo Arango|journal=Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction|volume=10|issue=1|pages=85–91|doi=10.1080/00111619.1967.10689914|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nadaism was largely a movement in reaction to ''[[La Violencia]]'' and was the Colombian expression of numerous avant-garde-like movements in the poetry of the Americas during the 1950s and 60s, such as the [[Beat Generation]] in the United States and the ''Tzanticos'' in Ecuador. The movement was largely anti-establishment. It resulted in several works of [[literary movement|literature]], music, and movies expressing nadaist themes.

The term ''nadaísmo'' was a play on the words "''nada''", meaning nothing, and "[[Dadaism]]" ({{lang-es|Dadaísmo}}). Nadaísmo has sometimes been called "Colombian dadaism", a "Colombian Beat Generation", or "Colombian Futurism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roldan|first1=Camilo|title=An Introduction to Nadaismo|journal=Mandorla|issue=14|url=http://litline.org/Mandorla/pdfs/issue_15/Roldan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The violent events in Colombia during the 1940s and 1950s permeate the works of Nadaist writers. Events such as [[La Violencia]] and the military government of [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]], as well as a considerable urban expansion, greatly influenced the formation of the ''Nadaísta'' (Nothing-ist) movement. Arango had originally supported Pinilla when he came to power in Colombia, joining the  ''Movimiento Amplio Nacional'' (Broad National Movement) composed of artists and young intellectuals that supported the dictator.&lt;ref name="Boceto biográfico"&gt;Escobar, Eduardo, [http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm Boceto biográfico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604212958/http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |date=2008-06-04 }}. Link retrieved on June 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, Arango devoted himself to journalism. Soon, however, the reaction of the leaders of conservatives and liberals against Rojas was manifested in an agreement that caused his fall on May 10, 1957. While the dictator was exiled in [[Spain]], Gonzalo Arango eventually fled to [[Medellín]], Colombia.

Arango began the Nadaist movement in 1958 when his 42-page "Nadaism Manifesto", signed as "gonzaloarango", was published in the magazine ''Amistad'' (meaning "Friendship") in Medellín.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Nadaísmo|url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/node/23932|website=Luis Angel Arango Virtual Library|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arango and other writers would write about their disillusionment with the government they had supported.

Some of the first people to join the new movement were Alberto Escobar and Amilkar Osorio. As an inauguration, in 1958 they burned Colombian literature in the Plazuela de San Ignacio in Medellín as a symbol against what was considered the traditional great works of Colombian literature. Works that they denounced included the earlier literary movements such as ''Los Nuevos''. One of the books they burned was Arango's first work, "After the Man".

The movement ended largely with the deaths of its founding members. Toward the end of his life, Arango distanced himself from the beliefs of the other members associated with the movement.&lt;ref name="BalderstonGonzalez2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Balderston|author2=Mike Gonzalez|author3=Ana M. Lopez|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Latin American and Caribbean Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kp6FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-78852-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Periodic table}}

==Etymology==
{{main article|List of chemical element name etymologies}}
Element names can refer to:
* a mythological concept or character (including an astronomical object),
* a mineral or similar substance,
* a place, or geographical region,
* a property of the element, or
* a scientist.

===People===
{{main article|List of scientists whose names are used in chemical element names}}

Chemical elements are sometimes named after people, especially the synthetic elements discovered (created) after ca. 1940. However, very few are named after their discoverers, and even fewer are named after living people. The element [[seaborgium]] is named after [[Glenn Seaborg]], who was alive at the time;&lt;ref&gt;Kean, 129&lt;/ref&gt; and [[oganesson]] is named after [[Yuri Oganessian]] (still living {{As of|2018|01|lc=y}}).

Many of the [[Transuranium element|transuranic elements]] are named after recipients of the [[Nobel Prize]], including:
{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* [[bohrium]] ([[Niels Bohr]]),
* [[curium]] ([[Marie Skłodowska-Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]]),
* [[einsteinium]] ([[Albert Einstein]]),
* [[fermium]] ([[Enrico Fermi]]),
* [[lawrencium]] ([[Ernest Lawrence]]),
* [[roentgenium]] ([[Wilhelm Röntgen]]),
* [[rutherfordium]] ([[Ernest Rutherford]]),
* and [[seaborgium]] ([[Glenn T. Seaborg]]).
}}
Transuranic elements named in honour of scientists who did not receive the prize include:&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 230-231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kean, 273&lt;/ref&gt;
{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* [[copernicium]] ([[Nicolaus Copernicus]]),
* [[flerovium]] ([[Georgy Flyorov]]),
* [[meitnerium]] ([[Lise Meitner]]),
* [[mendelevium]] ([[Dmitri Mendeleev]]),
* [[nobelium]] ([[Alfred Nobel]]),
* and [[oganesson]] ([[Yuri Oganessian]]).
}}
The transuranic element [[americium]] is indirectly named (via the continents [[The Americas]]&lt;ref&gt;https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-24-america-turns-500_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt;) after [[Amerigo Vespucci]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Transuranium Elements|first = Glenn T.|last = Seaborg|journal = Science|volume = 104|issue = 2704|date = 1946|pages = 379–386|doi = 10.1126/science.104.2704.379|pmid = 17842184|jstor = 1675046|bibcode = 1946Sci...104..379S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-transuranic element [[samarium]] is named after [[Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets]],&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 464&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gadolinium]] is indirectly named (via the mineral [[gadolinite]]), after [[Johan Gadolin]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 220-229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 188&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], who named the element [[gallium]] after his native land of France (from [[Latin]] ''Gallia'' meaning [[Gaul]]) denied that the element's naming was for a [[pun]] on his own name ("le coq" means "the rooster" in [[French language|French]], as does "gallus" in [[Latin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kean, 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=Mary Elvira|authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks|date=1932|title=The discovery of the elements. XIII. Some elements predicted by Mendeleeff|journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]]|volume=9|issue=9|pages=1605–1619|bibcode=1932JChEd...9.1605W|doi=10.1021/ed009p1605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Places on earth===
{{main article|List of places used in the names of chemical elements}}

Some chemical elements are named after places on the planet earth.

Five are named after currently existing countries&amp;nbsp;– [[polonium]] (named after [[Poland]]&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 412&lt;/ref&gt;), [[francium]] and [[gallium]] (named after [[France]]&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 185&lt;/ref&gt;), [[nihonium]] (named after [[Japan]]) and [[germanium]] (named after [[Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 197&lt;/ref&gt; Only gallium and germanium are stable and occur in more than trace amounts on Earth. [[Americium]] is named after the [[Americas]], in analogy with [[europium]] being named after [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Other elements are named after modern states or cities, including [[berkelium]], [[californium]] and [[tennessine]] named respectively after the American city of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and the states of [[California]] and [[Tennessee]] where they were discovered;&lt;ref&gt;Kean, 119&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dubnium]] and [[moscovium]], similarly named after Russia's [[Dubna, Russia|Dubna]]&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 157&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Moscow]].

Several places in [[Scandinavia]] have elements named after them:
* [[Yttrium]], [[terbium]], [[erbium]], and [[ytterbium]] are all named for the Swedish village of [[Ytterby]], where their ores were first found.&lt;ref name="kean62"&gt;Kean, 62&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Holmium]] is named after ''Holmia'', Latin for the [[Sweden|Swedish]] capital [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kean62" /&gt;
* [[Scandium]] comes from the Latin word for Scandinavia.
* [[Thulium]] is from the [[Thule|Ancient Greek word]] for the remote Arctic land that the Romans called [[Ultima Thule]].&lt;ref name="kean62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 468&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of other elements are named after [[Classical antiquity|classical]] words for various places.
* [[Ruthenium]] is from the [[Latin]] name for [[Ruthenia|the region]] including [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 458&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lutetium]] is named after ''Lutetia'', the Latin name for [[Paris]].
* [[Hafnium]] is named for ''Hafnia'', the Latin name for [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 210&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Copper]]'s name comes from an [[Old English]] word derived from the Latin name for the island of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

* The names of both [[magnesium]] and [[manganese]] derive from the [[Greek language|Greek]] region of [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 310&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomical objects===
The naming of elements from astronomical objects stems from the ancient association of metals with the various planets and their gods, as follows: mercury with the fast-moving planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]; copper with the brilliant, beautiful planet [[Venus]]; iron with [[Mars]] (named for the Roman god of war); tin with [[Jupiter]] (named for the Roman king of the gods); and lead with the slow-moving planet [[Saturn]] (named for the ancient, slow god who was the father of Jupiter). The [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] were associated with gold and silver, respectively.

A few other elements are directly named for astronomical bodies, including [[planets]], [[dwarf planet]]s, a few [[asteroid]]s,  our [[star]], our planet, and our Moon. [[Uranium]], [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], [[cerium]], and [[palladium]] were named after [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], [[Pluto]], [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], and [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] respectively, which were at the time of their naming all considered to be planets. (Today, Pluto and Ceres are considered to be dwarf planets, and Pallas is considered to be an asteroid.)&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 594&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, 475&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the element [[selenium]] came from the Greek word for the [[Moon]] (Σελήνη, ''Selene''). The name [[helium]] comes from the Greek word for the [[Sun]] (Ἢλιος, ''Helios''). This is because the first evidence for helium was in distinctive, heretofore unknown [[spectroscopic lines]] from the Sun; these could not be explained by any of the known elements in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe|last=Gray|first=Theodore|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minerals===
Many elements are named after the minerals in which they are found, e.g. [[calcium]] after Latin ''calx'' (lime), [[silicon]] is named after Latin ''silex'' (sand), [[sodium]] after soda and [[potassium]] after potash.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

===Temporary names===
{{main article|Systematic element name|IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party}}
In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations for their [[systematic element name]]s to be used for yet unnamed or undiscovered elements&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1979|volume=51|pages=381–384|title=Recommendations for the naming of elements of atomic numbers greater than 100|doi=10.1351/pac197951020381|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[placeholder name|placeholder]], until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a permanent name is decided on. The recommendations are mostly ignored among scientists, who simply call these elements by their [[atomic number]], for example "element 119" (instead of "ununennium"), with the symbol of ''(119)'' or even simply ''119''.&lt;ref name=Haire&gt;{{cite book| title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements| editor1-last = Morss|editor2-first = Norman M.| editor2-last = Edelstein| editor3-last = Fuger|editor3-first = Jean| last = Haire|first = Richard G.| chapter = Transactinides and the future elements| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]| date = 2006 | isbn = 1-4020-3555-1| location = Dordrecht, The Netherlands| edition = 3rd| ref = CITEREFHaire2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division has been the official body responsible with assigning official names to new elements, with the IUPAC Council making the final decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1351/pac200274050787 | volume=74 | issue=5 | title=Naming of new elements(IUPAC Recommendations 2002) | journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry| year=2002 | last1=Koppenol | first1=W. H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical symbol==
{{main article|Symbol (chemistry)}}

Once an element has been named, a one-, or two-letter symbol must be ascribed to it so it can be easily referred to in such contexts as the periodic table. The first letter is always capitalised. While the symbol is often a contraction of the element's name, it may sometimes not match the element's name when the symbol is based on non-English words; examples include "Pb" for lead (from ''plumbum'' in Latin) or "W" for [[tungsten]] (from ''Wolfram'' in German). Elements which have only temporary systematic names are given temporary three-letter symbols (e.g. Uue for [[ununennium]], the undiscovered element 119).

==Naming controversies==
{{main article|List of chemical elements naming controversies}}
The naming of the synthetic elements [[dubnium]] and [[seaborgium]] generated a significant amount of controversy, referred to as the [[Transfermium Wars]]. The Americans wished to name element 105 [[hahnium]], while the Russians preferred the name dubnium. The Americans also wished to name element 106 seaborgium. This naming dispute ran from the 1970s (when the elements were discovered) to the 1990s, when the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) created a tentative list of the element names for elements 104 to 109. The Americans, however, refused to agree with these names because seaborgium was not in the list. Thus, IUPAC reconsidered, and in 1996 named element 105 dubnium and element 106 seaborgium.&lt;ref&gt;Kean, 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative forms of an element, names indicating molecular structure, and names of compounds==
When a pure element, comprising only one type of atom, nevertheless exists in multiple forms ([[allotrope]]s) with different structure and properties, they are generally given different names; for example [[graphite]] and [[diamond]] are both forms of the element [[carbon]].  Even for elements such as [[nitrogen]] having only one stable allotrope, a name such as dinitrogen may be used to indicate its molecular structure N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as its elemental composition.  The naming of chemical compounds comprising more than one element is a complex subject, discussed at length in the article on [[chemical nomenclature]].

"'''Simudzai Mureza wedu WeZimbabwe'''" ({{Lang-en|"Blessed be the Land of Zimbabwe"}}, {{Literal translation|"Lift High Zimbabwe's Banner"}}; {{lang-nd|Kalibusiswe Ilizwe leZimbabwe}}) is the [[List of national anthems|national anthem]] of [[Zimbabwe]].

==History==
It was introduced in March 1994 after a nationwide competition to replace the South African-derived "[[Ishe Komborera Africa]]" with a distinctly Zimbabwean song. The winning entry was a [[Shona language|Shona]] song written by Professor [[Solomon Mutswairo]] and composed by Fred Changundega.

It has been translated into English and [[Zimbabwean Ndebele language|Ndebele]], the two other main languages of Zimbabwe. 

The Ndebele version is mainly sung in the [[Matebeleland]] regions of Zimbabwe, while the English version is not commonly sung. Some schools in [[Matabeleland South]] have introduced the [[Sotho language|Sotho]]/[[Tswana language|Tswana]] version.

'''Nut art''' was an artistic consciousness movement centered in northern California that flourished primarily in the late 60s and early 70s.

The term "Nut art" was coined by artist [[Roy De Forest]] (in conversation with writer David Zack) to describe an approach to art making which embraced humor along with the phantasmagorical. According to De Forest, Nut artists sought to create fantasy worlds reflective of their own quirks and eccentricities. As such, Nut art placed a high degree of emphasis on evolving visions, of which specific artworks were produced as part of the ongoing process of self-definition, or in service to creating new personas and personal mythologies.&lt;ref name=Daniels&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L. Daniels ; with essays by Philip E.|title=Clayton Bailey's world of wonders|year=2011|publisher=Crocker Art Museum|location=Sacramento, CA|isbn=978-1-8840-3822-8|pages=8, 24|author2=Frank, Patrick }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Among these personas was that of Ralph "Doggy" Dinsmore, which was used by De Forest.)

As with [[Conceptual art]], the idea or underlying concept with Nut art was paramount. As a result, the creation of the Nut artist was not restricted by style or medium, allowing the movement to embrace emerging formats such as performance, text pieces, and appropriation, in addition to more traditional two and three dimensional mediums such as drawing, photography, and sculpture. Because of the emphasis on concept and satire, Nut art welcomed contributions from participants without formal artistic backgrounds as well as those with advanced technical skill and training. Nut art also reflected the importance of process over product, which had been a central tenet of the Action painters a generation previous.

Besides De Forest, other key practitioners of Nut art included [[Robert Arneson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fineberg|first=Jonathan|title=A troublesome subject : the art of Robert Arneson|year=2013|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-27383-2|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clayton Bailey]] (as well as Bailey's alter-ego Dr. Gladstone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Thomas|title=Art in the San Francisco Bay area, 1945-1980 : an illustrated history|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0-520-05193-9|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Victor Cicansky (alter-ego Victor Ceramski), Robert Cumming, [[Lowell Darling]], Jack Ford, [[David Gilhooly]], Jerry Gooch, Linda Renner, [[Peter Saul]], Harold Schlotzhauer, Richard Shaw, Irv Tepper, Chris Unterseher, Peter VandenBerge, Franklin Williams, Maija Zack (alter-ego Maija Woof), and David Zack.&lt;ref name=DePaoli /&gt;

David Zack, who was also a poet and art critic, reviewed many of the group's exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Daniels /&gt; Zack also participated in the movement as an exhibiting artist.

The first major exhibition of Nut art took place in 1972 at the University Art Gallery of [[California State University, Hayward]]. The show was co-curated by Clayton Bailey  (then art faculty) and Gallery Director Irene Keil.&lt;ref name=DePaoli&gt;{{cite book|last=DePaoli |first=G.

[[File:Obsolete Russian units of length - ru.svg|thumb]]
A native system of weights and measures was used in [[Imperial Russia]] and after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], but it was abandoned after [[July 1925#July 21, 1925 (Tuesday)|July 21, 1925]], when the [[Soviet Union]] adopted the [[metric system]], per the order of the [[Council of People's Commissars]].

The [[Obsolete Tatar weights and measures|Tatar system]] is very similar to the Russian one, but some names are different.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

The system existed since [[ancient Rus']], but under [[Peter the Great]], the Russian units were redefined relative to the [[English unit|English system]].&lt;ref name=Shost&gt;Шостьин Н. А. Очерки истории русской метрологии XI — начала XX века. М.: 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Until Peter the Great the system also used [[Cyrillic numerals]], and only in the 18th century did Peter the Great replace it with the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref name=Shost/&gt;

==Length==
The basic unit is the Russian [[cubit]], called the ''arshin'', which has been in use since the 16th century.  It was standardized by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in the 18th century to measure exactly twenty-eight English inches ({{convert|28|in|cm|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}). Thus, 80 vershoks = 20 piads = 5 arshins = 140 English inches ({{convert|140|in|cm|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}).&lt;ref name=Carda&gt;{{cite book|author=Cardarelli, F.|year=2004|title=Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures: Their SI Equivalences and Origins|publisher=Springer|edition=2nd|pages=120–124|isbn=1-85233-682-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KCx8Ww75VkC&amp;pg=PA118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''piad'' ({{lang|ru|пядь}}, “palm”, “five”) or ''chetvert'' ({{lang|ru|че́тверть}}, “quarter”) is a [[span (unit)|hand span]], the distance between ends of the spread thumb and [[index finger]].

Alternative units:
* Swung sazhen ({{lang|ru|маховая сажень}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|makhovaya sazhen’}}, distance between tips of arms stretched sidewards) = 1.76 m
* Skewed, or oblique sazhen ({{lang|ru|косая сажень}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|kosaya sazhen’}}, distance between tip of a raised arm and a tip of an opposite leg slightly put away) = 2.48 m
* Double versta or border versta, ({{lang|ru|межевая верста}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|mezhevaya versta}}), used to measure land plots and distances between settlements = 2 verstas (comes from an older standard for versta)

== Area ==
* Desiatina (desyatina : {{lang|ru|десяти́на}}, “a tenth” or “ten”), approximately one [[hectare]]
** Treasury/official desiatina {{lang|ru|казённая десяти́на}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|kazionnaya desiatina}}) = 10,925.4 m² = 117,600 ft² = 2.7 acres = 2,400 square sazhen
** Proprietor's ({{lang|ru|владе́льческая десяти́на}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|vladelcheskaya desiatina}}) = 14,567.2 m² = 156,800 ft² = 3,200 square sazhen
*** 3 proprietor's desiatinas = 4 official desiatinas

==Volume==
As in many ancient systems of measurement the Russian distinguishes between dry and liquid measurements of capacity. Note that the chetvert appears in both lists with vastly differing values.

== Weight/mass ==

Two systems of weight were in use, an ordinary one in common use, and an [[apothecaries' system]].

| 
| 400
| 163.807 kg 
| 361.206 lb (25.8 [[Stone (Imperial mass)|st]])
|}

The pood was first mentioned in a number of documents of the twelfth century. {{cn|date=February 2014}} It may still be encountered in documents dealing with agricultural production (especially with reference to cereals), and has been revived in determining weights when casting bells in belfries following the rebirth of the Orthodox Churches in the former Soviet lands.  It is also popular in the modern fitness industry of the 21st century, as the pood is used when referencing the weight of a [[kettlebell]], a Russian invention, especially in CrossFit. {{cn|date=February 2014}}

===Apothecaries' system===
The Imperial Russian apothecaries' weight was defined by setting the grain ({{lang-ru|гран}}) to be exactly seven-fifths of a ''dolia''.  The only unit name shared between the two was the ''funt'' (pound), but the one in the apothecaries' system is exactly seven-eighths of the ordinary ''funt''.

==Idiomatic expressions==
The obsolete units of measurement survived in [[Russian culture]] in a number of [[idiom]]atic expressions and [[proverb]]s, for example:

* Слышно за ''версту'': (It) can be heard a verst away - about something very loud
* Бешеной собаке семь ''вёрст'' не крюк.: 7 versts is not a detour for a mad dog - about excessive energy or hassle
* Милому дружку семь ''вёрст'' не околица: 7 verst is not too far for a darling friend
* ''Верста'' коломенская: [[Kolomna]] verst - about a very tall and slim person (in this case the reference is to the verst pole road mark: (''verstovoy stolb''))
* ''Косая сажень'' в плечах:  Skew sazhen in the shoulders - about a strong, wide-shouldered person
* Мерить всех на свой ''аршин''. To gauge everybody by the same [literally: one's own] yardstick
* Проглотить ''аршин''. To swallow an arshin (yardstick)  - about standing very straight and still 
* От горшка два ''вершка''. Two vershok above the pot. - Very young kid
* Сто ''пудов''. - Hundred poods - very large amount. In modern colloquial Russian it is used in a generic meanings of "very much" and "very", as well as "most surely";&lt;ref&gt;English-Russian-English dictionary of slang, jargon and Russian names. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective 'stopudovy' and the adverb 'stopudovo' derive from this expression, although it is more likely a mangled contraction of "100%" (stoprocentny).
* Семь ''пядей'' во лбу. Seven 'pyad' across the forehead - very smart
* Не семь ''пядей'' во лбу. Not seven 'pyad' across the forehead - not so smart
* Мал ''золотник'', да до́рог. A zolotnik is small, but expensive : when quality rather than quantity is important 
* Идти ''семимильными'' шагами. To walk in 7-mile steps  - Any kind of very fast progress, e.g., of improvement
* Узнать, почём ''фунт'' лиха. To learn how much a pound of ''[[likho]]'' costs - To experience something bad
* Ни ''пяди'' земли (не уступить). Do not give up (even) a ''pyad'' of land
* Съесть ''пуд'' соли (вместе с кем-либо). To eat a 'pood' of salt (with somebody) - To have a long common experience with somebody (with the implication "to know someone well")

'''Old Cotabato City Hall Museum''' is a city museum fronting Rizal Park Plaza in [[Cotabato City]], Philippines. The structure was built in 1940s as the Municipal Hall of former Municipality of Cotabato also served as the visitors information center.

==History==
Built in 1940s under the leadership of the former Cotabato Mayor Jose Lim, later dubbed as Cotabato City Hall in 1960s when the Municipality of Cotabato is recognized as a City. 

Designed by the Filipino architect Juan Arellano&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sembrano|first1=Edgar|title=Juan Arellano: The architect, artist and master builder|url=http://www.tribune.net.ph/life-style/juan-arellano-the-architect-artist-and-master-builder|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=The Daily Tribune|date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the war, this building is a legacy of neo vernacular architecture.

'''Pittcon Editors’ Awards''' honoured the best new products on show at the [[Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy]], or Pittcon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittcon.org/|title=Home - Pittcon {{!}} Conference &amp; Expo|website=Pittcon {{!}} Conference &amp; Expo|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; for 20 years from 1996 having been established by Dr Gordon Wilkinson, managing editor of ''Analytical Instrument Industry Report'' (later ''Instrumenta''). On 8 March 2015, the event returned to the Morial Convention Center in [[New Orleans]] and this was the last occasion when the awards were presented.

The independent awards, which represented the results of an informal poll of leading editors, had become an important feature of the world’s largest [[Trade Show|trade show]] for the [[laboratory equipment]] industry. Pittcon organisers and media center supported the scheme and provided details and photographs on the exhibition's Press and Media Information page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pittcon.org/press/|title=Press &amp; Media Information - Pittcon {{!}} Conference &amp; Expo|work=Pittcon {{!}} Conference &amp; Expo|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the group of editors and journalists that formed the core of the judging panel reluctantly decided to discontinue the awards program citing gradually dwindling support from ever-busier media representatives.

== History and organisation ==

The awards were started because of the challenge that editors faced of effectively covering the [[trade show]], which in 2015 hosted 925 exhibitors. New exhibitors at the [[Morial Convention Center]] totalled 130 companies. Walking past every booth at an event such as this represents a trek of over {{convert|10|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccno.com/|title=Home - Ernest N. Morial Convention Center|website=Ernest N. Morial Convention Center|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accredited media representatives, of whom there were more than 150 per year, were invited to list up to three new products on a nomination form provided on registration at the Media Center. Editors were invited to attend a judging session towards the end of the trade show. They reviewed entries and voted on the nominated products. The only criterion was that products must have appeared at the exhibition for the first time, but winning products usually featured innovations in technology or [[industrial design]], or enabled new [[analytics|analytical applications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instrumentnews.co.uk/2013/03/what-is-the-reason-for-the-pittcon-editors-award/|title=Instrument News {{!}} Tracking analytical instrumentation {{!}} Subscribe|website=www.instrumentnews.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold, Silver and Bronze winners were determined and plaques were awarded to the booth personnel of the winning companies on the final morning of the four-day exposition. Other nominated products received an [[Honourable Mention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlaboratory.com/913-Technical-Articles/160948-Pittcon-sup-sup-2014-Editors-Awards-Acknowledge-Innovations-in-Scientific-Instrumentation/|title=Pittcon&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; 2014 Editors’ Awards Acknowledge Innovations in Scientific Instrumentation|website=www.americanlaboratory.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award winners ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Winners for the period 1996 to 2015, together with the names of their products, are listed below. Of the award winners, the majority were the largest instrument makers in the industry, but over 30 small companies or [[start-ups]] went home with awards, illustrating that editors were able to use their technical expertise to spot innovations irrespective of the marketing budgets of exhibitors.

Company names are listed in the format used at the date of the award, although may have now changed as a result of change of ownership. [[Trademarks]] are acknowledged, but not indicated; readers should check corporate literature or websites for current [[intellectual property]] rights.

The '''''Predator''''' film series is a [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[media franchise|franchise]] based on a race of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|fictional extraterrestrials]] created by Jim Thomas and John Thomas. Produced by [[20th Century Fox]], the series started in 1987 with the film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', which led to two sequels and [[novel]], [[comic book]], and [[video game]] spin-offs. Related to the franchise is the [[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|''Alien vs. Predator'']], which combine the eponymous [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] with [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|the creatures]] from the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' film series]].

==Background==
''Predator'' was [[John McTiernan]]'s first studio film as director. The studio hired screenplay writer [[Shane Black]] to not only play a supporting role in the film, but to keep an eye on McTiernan due to the director's inexperience. [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was originally cast as the film's creature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletext.co.uk/bigscreen/your-film-views/2c716751d7abb28f897edd93c630b4ef/Vortex+Van+Damme+in+Predator.aspx |title=Teletext Big Screen Vortex |publisher=Teletext.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea being that the physical action star would use his martial arts skills to make the creature an agile, [[ninja]]-esque hunter. When compared to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Carl Weathers]] and [[Jesse Ventura]], actors known for their bodybuilding regimes, it became apparent a more physically imposing man was needed to make the creature appear threatening. Eventually, Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by the actor and mime artist [[Kevin Peter Hall]].

The predator creature's design is credited to special effects artist [[Stan Winston]]. While flying to [[Japan]] with ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' director [[James Cameron]], Winston, who had been hired to design the Predator, was doing concept art on the flight. Cameron saw what he was drawing and said, "I always wanted to see something with [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]]". Winston then included them in his designs. Schwarzenegger recommended Winston after his experience working on ''[[The Terminator]]''.

The film's creature was originally designed with a long neck, a [[dog]]-like head and a single eye. This design was abandoned when it became apparent that the jungle locations would make shooting the complex design too difficult. Originally, the studio contracted the makeup effects for the alien from [[Richard Edlund]]'s ''Boss Film Creature Shop''. However, with problems filming the creature in Mexico and attempts to create a convincing monster of Van Damme, wearing a much different body suit, failing, makeup effects responsibilities were given to Winston and his studio, [[R/Greenberg Associates]]. According to former ''Boss Film Creature Shop'' makeup supervisor Steve Johnson, the makeup failed because of an impractical design by McTiernan that included {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} length extensions that gave the creature a backward bent [[satyr]]-leg. The design did not work in the jungle locations. After six weeks of shooting in the jungles of [[Palenque, Mexico]], the production had to shut down so that Winston could make the new creature. This took eight months and then filming resumed for five weeks.

The sound of the creature was provided by [[Peter Cullen]]. Despite his resolution not to voice any more monsters following injuries to his throat sustained during the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)#Automated Dialogue Replacement / post-sync|ADR]] of [[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]], his agent convinced him to audition. The bubbling sound was inspired by a mixture of the visual of the creature and his recollection of a dying horseshoe crab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62478 |title=Prime Directive: An Exclusive Interview with Peter Cullen |publisher=dvdtimes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R/Greenberg Associates created the film's optical effects, including the creature's ability to become [[invisible]], its [[thermal vision]] point-of-view, its glowing blood, and the [[electric spark]] effects. The invisibility effect was achieved by having someone in a bright [[Chroma key|red suit]] (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and the blue of the sky) the size of the creature. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape. For the thermal vision, [[infrared film]] could not be used because it did not register in the range of [[body temperature]] [[wavelength]]s. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from [[glow stick|chem-lite sticks]] used by campers. The electrical sparks were [[rotoscoped]] animation using white paper pin registered on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were [[compositing|composited]] by the optical crew for the finished effects.

Also, in an interview on ''Predator'' Special Edition, actor Carl Weathers said many of the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3 a.m. to work out before the day's shooting, in order to look "pumped" during the scene. Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after all the other actors were nowhere to be seen. It was reported that actor [[Sonny Landham]] was so unstable on the set that a bodyguard was hired; not to protect Landham, but to protect the other cast members from him.

According to Schwarzenegger, filming was physically demanding as he had to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien. In addition, cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required [[heat lamp]]s to be on all of the time. Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with Kevin Peter Hall who could not see in the creature's suit. Hall could not see out of the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and then memorize where everything was. The outfit was difficult to wear because it was heavy and off-balance.

The film was particularly successful and subsequently inspired a number of [[comic books]], [[video games]] and popular anecdotes within the media. Schwarzenegger was asked to reprise his role in a ''Predator'' sequel, but was already attached to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and could not accept the role. The character was rewritten from the developing sequel's script, and the sequel to ''Predator'', directed by [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]], was scheduled for 1990.

Due to excessive violence, ''[[Predator 2]]'' was the first film to be given the newly instituted [[NC-17]] rating in the United States. It was eventually rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] after being re-cut to its final theatrical length. The film cast [[Danny Glover]] in the lead role, and reprised Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator. Also, returning to the role of [[List of Predator characters#Anna|Anna]] in the sequel, [[Elpidia Carrillo]] was slated to be in two scenes but was cut back to a brief appearance on a video screen in the government agents' surveillance trailer. Her character is showing damage to the [[Central America]]n jungle caused by the explosion at the conclusion of the first film

===Future installments===
The producer, [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]], says that ''The Predator'' will set up two sequels that he hopes Shane Black will return to direct. About this, Black said: "I would love to say we've been planning a trilogy, but I take one day at a time, in motion-picture terms that's one movie at a time."&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2018/film/news/the-predator-reboot-shane-black-1202874827/&lt;/ref&gt; The box office results of The Predator in China may encourage 20th Century Fox to press on with another sequel.

==Crossover series==
{{Main|Alien vs. Predator}}

Inspired by the [[Dark Horse Comics]] series, the filmmakers of ''[[Predator 2]]'' (1990) incorporated an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in which an Alien skull was seen in a Predator trophy case. Expansions upon this [[Shared fictional universe|shared universe]] between the ''Alien'' and ''Predator'' franchises followed, through comics and video games, until a film franchise was launched with the release of ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' in 2004, followed by the sequel ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' in 2007, which spawned various new comics, novels, video games, and other merchandise based upon or inspired by the films.

===''Alien vs. Predator'' (2004)===
{{main|Alien vs. Predator (film)}}

In 2004, a Predator mothership arrives in [[Earth]] orbit to draw humans to an ancient Predator training ground on [[Bouvet Island|Bouvetøya]], an island about one thousand miles north of [[Antarctica]]. A buried [[pyramid]] giving off a "heat bloom" attracts a group of explorers led by Charles Bishop Weyland ([[Lance Henriksen]]), the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries, who unknowingly activates an Alien egg production line as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid. Three Predators descend unto the planet and enters the structure, killing all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered explorers are captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos. Two Predators die in the ensuing battle with an Alien.  The third Predator allies itself with the lone surviving human, Alexa "Lex" Woods ([[Sanaa Lathan]]), while in their way out of the pyramid as it is destroyed by the Predator's wrist bomb and eventually battles with the escaped Alien Queen on the surface. The Queen is defeated by being dragged down by a water tower into the dark depths of the frozen sea, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator. The orbiting Predator mothership uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator. A Predator elder gives Lex a spear as a sign of respect, and then departs. Once in orbit it is revealed that an Alien [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Chestburster|Chestburster]] was present within the corpse, thus a Predalien hybrid is born.

===''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' (2007)===
{{main|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem}}

Set immediately after the events of the previous film, the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Predalien|Predalien]] hybrid aboard the Predator scout ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of [[Gunnison, Colorado]]. The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the Predalien, which is received by a [[veteran]] Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth to "clean up" the infestation. When it arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the sewer below the town. He removes evidence of their presence as he moves along using a corrosive blue liquid and uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures, but the Aliens still manage to escape into the town above. The Predator fashions a plasma pistol from its remaining plasma caster and hunts Aliens all across town, accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process. During a confrontation with human survivors, the Predator loses its plasma pistol. The Predator then fights the Predalien singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the US air force drops a tactical nuclear bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants along with the Predalien's warriors and hive, as well as the few remaining humans in the town. The salvaged plasma pistol is then taken to a Ms. Yutani of the Yutani Corporation, foreshadowing an advancement in technology leading to the future events of the ''Alien'' films.

{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''Queer pedagogy''' ('''QP''') is an academic discipline devoted to exploring the intersection between [[queer theory]] and [[critical pedagogy]], which are both grounded in Marxist [[critical theory]].

QP explores and interrogates the student/teacher relationship, the role of identities in the classroom, the role of eroticism in the teaching process, the nature of disciplines and curriculum, and the connection between the classroom and the broader community with a goal of being both a set of theoretical tools for pedagogical critique / critique of pedagogy and/or a set of practical tools for those doing pedagogical work.

==History==

According to [[William Pinar]], a [[curriculum]] theorist at the [[University of British Columbia]], homosexuality and pedagogy have been linked as far back as the [[ancient Greeks]] and Romans.  Modern notions of queer theory in education, however, originate around 1981 with Pinar's "Understanding Curriculum as Gender Text," critiquing the way in which [[machisimo]] and [[masculinity]] plays out in [[Marxist]] educational theory.  In 1982, Meredith Reiniger wrote about [[misogyny]] that had been internalized by her secondary English students.  In 1983, James Sears wrote an article entitled "Sexuality: Taking off the Masks" for a journal called ''Changing Schools''.

The term "queer pedagogy" itself, however, appears to have originated in 1993 with an article in the ''Canadian Journal of Education''.  This article was written by two Canadian professors, Mary Bryson (University of British Columbia) and Suzanne de Castell (Simon Fraser University), who were grappling with [[poststructuralist]] and [[essentialist]] theories of [[Personal identity|identity]] in the context of a classroom setting.  They present various techniques that they tried, but eventually conclude that the task is both necessary and impossible, concluding: "Queer pedagogy it is indeed, that, after all, in trying to make a difference we seem only able to entrench essentialist boundaries which continue both to define and to divide us."

In 1995, [[Deborah Britzman]] wrote an article entitled "Is there a queer pedagogy-- Or, stop reading straight."

In 1998, as part of William Pinar's anthology ''Queer Theory in Education'', the challenge of articulating a queer pedagogy was taken up by a doctoral student at York University, Susanne Luhmann.  In "Queering/Querying Pedagogy? Or, Pedagogy is a Pretty Queer Thing" (part of a larger anthology on Queer Theory in Education), she asks questions such as, "Is a queer pedagogy about and for queer students or queer teachers?  Is a queer pedagogy a question of queer curriculum?  Or, is it about teaching methods adequate for queer content?  Or, about queer learning and teaching-- and what would that mean?  Moreover, is a queer pedagogy to become the house pedagogy of queer studies or is it about the queering of pedagogical theory?"  She suggests that an "inquiry into the conditions that make learning possible or prevent learning"  through exploration of the teacher/student relationships and "the conditions for understanding, or refusing, knowledge."

In 2002, Tanya Olson (who teaches Developmental English at Vance-Granville Community College) further explored the teacher/student relationship in an article in ''[[Bad Subjects]]'', an online [[cultural studies]] journal. In this article, entitled "TA/TG: The Pedagogy of the Cross-Dressed", Olson compared the experience of being a butch woman and not knowing which restroom and whether one was male or female to use to the experience of being a Teaching Assistant (TA) and not being fully a student or a teacher, drawing on it for inspiration towards creating a new conception of pedagogy.  She concludes, "Maybe re-defining TAs in the academy will help stop the sense of masquerade that currently characterizes their work. No matter how much they challenge accepted cultural standards or straddle societal binary divisions, everyone deserves a bathroom they can call home. From there we can create a pedagogy of the cross-dressed."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20040">'''Rapid automatized naming''' (RAN) is a task that measures how quickly individuals can name aloud objects, pictures, colors, or
[[symbol]]s (letters or digits). Variations in rapid automatized naming time in children provide a strong predictor of their later ability to [[Reading (process)|read]], and is independent from other predictors such as [[phonological awareness]], [[verbal IQ]], and existing reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Powell D, Stainthorp R, Stuart M, Garwood H, Quinlan P |title=An experimental comparison between rival theories of rapid automatized naming performance and its relationship to reading |journal=J Exp Child Psychol |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=46–68 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17555762 |doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2007.04.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, rapid automatized naming of pictures and letters can predict later reading abilities for pre-literate children.&lt;ref name="Lervåg, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lervåg A, Hulme C |title=Rapid automatized naming (RAN) taps a mechanism that places constraints on the development of early reading fluency |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=1040–8 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19619178 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02405.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of rapid automatized naming began with a study by Geshwind and Fusillo in 1966. They found some adults who suffered from a [[stroke]] were later unable to name colors despite being able to color match and having no evidence of [[color blindness]].&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denckla|first1=Martha Bridge|last2=Cutting|first2=Laurie E. |title=History and significance of rapid automatized naming|journal=Annals of Dyslexia |volume=49 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=29–42|issn=0736-9387|doi=10.1007/s11881-999-0018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals however were able to spell and write, indicating that their brain structures were intact and that they could generate the pathway from spoken words to visual and kinaesthetic representations.&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt; This visual-verbal disconnection led to a search for individuals who could not read and may be unable to name colors, primarily grade one students. It was found that in grade one students who could not read, color naming was possible but took much longer than color naming in children who could read.&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt;

The first color naming task was located in Ruesch and Wells Mental Examiner’s Handbook (1972).&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt; It consisted of 50 squares of 5 [[primary colors]] repeated in random order 10 times. The test was originally administered as a timed continuous test at the bedside of individuals recovering from head injury.&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt;

Rapid automatized naming was first identified in 1974 as predicting reading abilities in young English readers between 5–11 years of age by Martha Denckla and Rita Rudel of [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Denckla MB, Rudel R |title=Rapid "automatized" naming of pictured objects, colors, letters and numbers by normal children |journal=Cortex |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=186–202 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4844470 |doi= 10.1016/s0010-9452(74)80009-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faster times in RAN trials have been found to be a good indicator of reading competence, not only in alphabetic [[writing system]]s, but in writing systems such as Chinese [[logograph]]s  and Japanese [[kanji]] and [[hiragana]].&lt;ref name="HoLai1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ho |first1=Connie Suk-Han|last2=Lai|first2=Daphne Ngar-Chi|title=Naming-speed deficits and phonological memory deficits in Chinese developmental dyslexia|journal=Learning and Individual Differences |volume=11|issue=2 |year=1999|pages=173–186 |issn=1041-6080 |doi=10.1016/S1041-6080(00)80004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kobayashi MS, Haynes CW, Macaruso P, Hook PE, Kato J |title=Effects of mora deletion, nonword repetition, rapid naming, and visual search performance on beginning reading in Japanese |journal=Ann Dyslexia |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=105–28 |date=June 2005 |pmid=16107782 |doi= 10.1007/s11881-005-0006-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAN testing has been shown to be effective in testing reader’s [[fluency]] in languages with [[Orthography|orthographically]] transparent [[Alphabet|alphabetic scripts]] such as [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Heinz|last2=Mayringer|first2=Heinz|last3=Landerl|first3=Karin|title=The double-deficit hypothesis and difficulties in learning to read a regular orthography.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=92 |issue=4|year=2000 |pages=668–680 |issn=1939-2176|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.92.4.668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timed reading tests of poor readers of transparent [[Orthography|orthographies]] show very few reading errors; their main reading problem is slow, laborious decoding for words that are automatically read by their peers. This was also found for other readers in languages with consistent [[Orthography|orthographies]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"/&gt; English is an inconsistent [[orthography]] because it has poor [[Phonemic orthography|letter sound correspondences]]. English [[orthography]] and  [[Orthography of French|French orthography]] are also inconsistent because of their use of silent letters.&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"/&gt;

It has been found that continuous rapid naming of a list, compared to naming of single items, is easier for nondyslexic readers than it is for [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]] ones.&lt;ref name="JonesBranigan2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Manon W.|last2=Branigan|first2=Holly P.|last3=Kelly|first3=M. Louise|title=Dyslexic and nondyslexic reading fluency: Rapid automatized naming and the importance of continuous lists|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=16|issue=3|year=2009|pages=567–572|issn=1069-9384|doi=10.3758/PBR.16.3.567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Wimmer, Mayringer and Landerl (2000) suggest that the diagnosis of [[dyslexia]] in English readers often overlooks naming-speed deficit and that most studies rely on poor word recognition to diagnose [[reading disability]].&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"/&gt;

==Types of RAN Testing==
Rapid automatized naming can be used in many different ways. One of its strengths is flexibility in what types of stimuli categories it uses. Different categories consist of colors, digits, objects and letters.&lt;ref name="Arnell, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arnell KM, Joanisse MF, Klein RM, Busseri MA, Tannock R |title=Decomposing the relation between Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) and reading ability |journal=Can J Exp Psychol |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=173–84 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19739900 |doi=10.1037/a0015721 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers use RAN to test [[Orthography|orthographic]] interpretation and [[phonological awareness]]. Two RAN tests are the CTOPP and TOWRE.&lt;ref name="FurnesSamuelsson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnes|first1=Bjarte|last2=Samuelsson|first2=Stefan|title=Phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming predicting early development in reading and spelling: Results from a cross-linguistic longitudinal study|journal=Learning and Individual Differences |volume=21 |issue=1|year=2011 |pages=85–95 |issn=1041-6080|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2010.10.005|pmc=3045196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two formats of RAN testing are used, discrete and serial testing.

===Serial Testing===
Using a serial testing method, participants are shown a row or column of [[symbol]]s and must name the symbols sequentially as fast as possible. An assumption made of serial RAN testing is that it consists of two components: [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] time (the mean time it takes to articulate the symbol), and  pause time (the mean length of time between naming two adjacent symbols).  When referring to pause time, this can include [[Saccade|saccadic eye movements]], disengagement from previously named symbols and focusing on upcoming symbols.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Jong|first1=Peter F.|title=What Discrete and Serial Rapid Automatized Naming Can Reveal About Reading|journal=Scientific Studies of Reading|volume=15|issue=4|year=2011|pages=314–337|issn=1088-8438|doi=10.1080/10888438.2010.485624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrete Testing===
Using the discrete testing method, participants are shown symbols individually usually on a computer screen. In discrete RAN testing each individual symbols' naming latency is measured. The naming latency consists of the mean time from presentation to articulation of symbol. It is scored using the mean naming latency of all symbols. Some theorists believe that discrete RAN testing reflects the retrieval of [[Phonology|phonological code]] from [[memory]] which can also be referred to as lexical access speed.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt;

Some researchers argue that discrete testing is a better method because of individual differences in the reading speed of a list of sight words; the relationship of RAN and reading will be stronger if sight word reading speed is measured by discrete presentation.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Today RAN is frequently used as a clinical instrument for diagnosing [[Reading disability|reading disabilities]] in children. It is often used to predict category membership in reading group sub-types. Some concerns with diagnosis using rapid automatized naming arise because it assesses a wide range of [[Cognition|cognitive skills]]. Speed and accuracy can be influenced by many different processing mechanisms and variables, including the perceived speed of the object to be named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ben-Haim|first1=Moshe Shay|last2=Chajut|first2=Eran|last3=Hassin|first3=Ran|last4=Algom|first4=Daniel|title=Speeded naming or naming speed? The automatic effect of object speed on performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=April 2015|volume=2|issue=144|pages=326–338|doi=10.1037/a0038569|pmid=25559652|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/144/2/326/|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is identifying which cognitive mechanisms are shared with reading. It is not clear whether RAN is testing [[Orthography|orthographic knowledge]] or whether it is testing phonological processing.&lt;ref name="Arnell, 2009"/&gt;

==Theories==
The role RAN plays in testing reading ability is contentious. Research supports the use of RAN as a measure of phonological processing, as a measure of [[Orthography|orthographic processing]] and integration, and as a measure of reading ability. It has been suggested that RAN may link to reading because reading depends on object-naming circuits in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] that are recruited in reading to underpin word-recognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Lervåg, 2009"/&gt;

===Orthographic and/or Phonological Processing===
Little is known about the mediator variable between [[phonological awareness]] and RAN and the relationship between [[phonological awareness]] and RAN.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanson|first1=H. L.|last2=Trainin|first2=G. |last3=Necoechea |first3=D. M.|last4=Hammill|first4=D. D.|title=Rapid Naming, Phonological Awareness, and Reading: A Meta-Analysis of the Correlation Evidence|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=73 |issue=4|year=2003 |pages=407–440|issn=0034-6543 |doi=10.3102/00346543073004407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers argue that RAN tests "the ability to retrieve phonological representations rapidly from long-term memory".&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt; Part of this view consists of RAN as tapping into the phonological system  by measuring the rate of retrieval of phonological information in long term memory. "The theoretical underpinnings being that, beyond the precision or accuracy of the grapheme–phoneme representations itself, rapid access to phonological representations is the main prerequisite to develop automaticity in reading a transparent writing system".&lt;ref name="FurnesSamuelsson2011"/&gt;

Others however dispute the link between RAN testing and phonological processing. They argue that [[phonological awareness]] is more strongly  related  to  pure  decoding ability, whereas  naming  speed  appears to be  more  strongly related to [[Fluency|reading fluency]].&lt;ref name="Schatschneider, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schatschneider C, Carlson CD, Francis DJ, Foorman BR, Fletcher JM |title=Relationship of rapid automatized naming and phonological awareness in early reading development: implications for the double-deficit hypothesis |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=245–56 |year=2002 |pmid=15493321 |doi=10.1177/002221940203500306  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other researchers view RAN as a sub-process of [[phonological awareness]]. In this view RAN is seen as a task that draws on accessing phonological codes for effective execution.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt; Although the relationship between RAN and [[phonological awareness]] is [[monotonic]], these measures do not produce uniform changes. Instead, as reading skills increase or decrease, RAN and [[phonological awareness]] skills do not change uniformly.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt;

An alternative view is that RAN plays a larger role in measuring [[Orthography|orthographic processing]]. Here RAN is believed to measure processes that are important in gaining [[Orthography|orthographic representations]].&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt; Studies have been conducted where RAN has been seen to measure reading of different kinds of words. These researchers argue that  "the relationship of RAN with reading should be higher if the reading task requires more [[Orthography|orthographic knowledge]]." The results of some studies tend to support this prediction as stronger relationships were found with exception word reading.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt;

Still other studies focus on the relationship between phonological processing and [[Orthography|orthographic processing]]. "The fact that RAN as a predictor of reading and spelling was not affected by [[Orthography|orthographic]] regularity seems to suggest that RAN is a compound skill that consists of several sub-processes that are related to early literacy development. These processes might very well imply both [[Orthography|orthographical]] and phonological skills".&lt;ref name="FurnesSamuelsson2011"/&gt;

===Reading Ability===
There are several theories why rapid automatized naming is associated with reading abilities. One suggestion is that they both exploit the speed with which [[phonological]] representations are retrieved from [[long-term memory]]. Another related theory is that both depend on variations in the rate of development of a general cognitive speed of information processing.&lt;ref name="Kail, Hall, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kail|first1=Robert|last2=Hall|first2=Lynda K.|title=Processing speed, naming speed, and reading.|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=30 |issue=6|year=1994 |pages=949–954 |issn=0012-1649|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.30.6.949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kail, Hall, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kail|first1=Robert|last2=Hall|first2=Lynda K.|last3=Caskey|first3=Bradley J.|title=Processing speed, exposure to print, and naming speed|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|volume=20|issue=02|year=1999|issn=0142-7164|doi=10.1017/S0142716499002076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence exists that RAN’s contribution to reading ability decreases as we age. Longitudinal studies report that the contribution of naming speed to reading skills after grade 3 diminishes, whereas the contribution of [[phonological awareness]] remains constant.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt;

The validity of RAN in measuring reading ability is based on three assumptions.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt; First, that RAN deficits and phonological deficits are independent of one another. Secondly, the relationship between RAN and [[phonological awareness]] varies according to reading maturity. Finally, naming speed is a complex process involving processes beyond the phonological system.

Labelling RAN as a measure of reading ability ignores many complexities of the task. Schatschneider et al. argue "that rapid naming tasks are composed of [[attention]]al, [[Visual system|visual]], [[Lexicon|lexical]], [[Temporal lobe|temporal]], and [[Memory|recognition]] sub-processes that all contribute to naming speed performance. Lumping all these sub-processes under the category of phonological processes obscures the complexity of rapid naming tasks. Such a hypothesis is consistent with the finding that naming speed tasks consistently account for variance in early reading skills beyond that accounted for by measures of phonemic awareness".&lt;ref name="Schatschneider, 2002"/&gt;

Another viewpoint is that rapid automatized naming directly relates to differences in reading competence. Supporting this is the fact that the ability to rapidly name digits and letters predicts reading better than rapidly naming colors and objects.  This suggests a difference due to differences in experience with letters. However, rapid automatized naming of colors, objects, numbers and letters measured in children before they learn to read predicts later differences in reading skill, while early differences in reading ability do not predict later differences in rapid automatized naming.&lt;ref name="Lervåg, 2009"/&gt;

===Double Deficit Hypothesis===
It has been proposed that [[dyslexia]] is due to a "[[Double deficit (education)|double-deficit hypothesis]]" in which phonological deficits and naming-speed deficits are two separate causes of reading problems, such that when they are combined, they produce a greater dyslexic defect than would be produced by either deficit individually.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Wolf, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowers|first1=Patricia Greig|last2=Wolf|first2=Maryanne|title=Theoretical links among naming speed, precise timing mechanisms and orthographic skill in dyslexia |journal=Reading and Writing |volume=5 |issue=1|year=1993 |pages=69–85 |issn=0922-4777 |doi=10.1007/BF01026919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf, Bowers, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf |first1=Maryanne |last2=Bowers|first2=Patricia Greig|title=The double-deficit hypothesis for the developmental dyslexias.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=3 |year=1999|pages=415–438|issn=0022-0663|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.3.415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The double-deficit hypothesis suggests that RAN and [[phonological awareness]] operate as independent systems that are equally important in word identification. This model is based on literature showing that phonological disabilities and naming speed-deficits underlie some forms of reading disabilities. In the case of modest or severe reading disability, the concurrence of both a phonological deficit and rapid naming deficit characterizes the most difficult forms of reading disabilities. These individuals score lowest on reading measures.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt;

'''Reading Recovery''' is a school-based, short-term intervention designed for children aged five or six, who are the lowest achieving in [[literacy]] after their first year of school. For instance, a child who is unable to read the simplest of books or write their own name, after a year in school, would be appropriate for a referral to a Reading Recovery program. The intervention involves intensive one-to-one lessons for 30 minutes a day with a trained literacy teacher, for between 12 and 20 weeks.

Reading Recovery was developed in the 1970s by New Zealand educator [[Marie Clay]]. After lengthy observations of early readers, Clay defined reading as a message-getting, problem-solving activity, and writing as a message-sending, problem-solving activity. Clay suggested that both activities involved linking invisible patterns of oral language with visible symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Reading Recovery is an application of [[Whole Language]] instructional principles in an attempt to address the needs of struggling readers.

== Description of the program ==

A combination of teacher judgment and systematic evaluation procedures identify those lowest-achieving children for whom Reading Recovery was designed. The lowest performing children (the bottom 5-20% depending on the context) are identified using the Observation Survey (Clay, 2002), a multi-faceted series of assessment tools covering early reading and writing. The Observation Survey has been standardized in the UK and US to determine its validity and reliability, however coefficients have not been reported. 
Once a child has been identified and referred to the Reading Recovery program, intervention is developed. The intervention is different for every child, assessing what the child knows and what s/he needs to learn next. The focus of each lesson is to understand and construct "messages"—to understand messages in reading and construct messages in writing—and to learn how to attend to detail without losing focus on meaning.

Daily 30 minute lessons are individually designed and delivered by specially trained teachers. Drawing from their training, Reading Recovery teachers make moment-to-moment decisions to support the child's learning. During each lesson, children read many little books. These include two to three familiar books, a rereading of the previous day's new book and the introduction and reading of a new story. Teachers take a [[running record]] of the previous day's new book to analyse the child's independence and reading behaviour. Children also compose, write and read their own messages or stories. Magnetic alphabet letters are used for sorting, to assist visual discrimination, and to look closely at how words work. Reading skills, including phonetic skills, are taught in the context of extended reading and writing by Reading Recovery teachers who have completed a year-long inservice education program that focuses on moment-to-moment responses to children's actions and behaviour.

The intervention goal is to bring children up to the level of their peers and to give them the assistance they need to develop independent reading and writing strategies. Once they are reading and writing at a level equivalent to that of their peers, their series of lessons is discontinued.

The intervention is not intended as an alternative to classroom teaching, but is complementary, to enable children to engage in their classroom program.

==Professional development for teachers ==

An essential component of the Reading Recovery program is the training of the teachers who provide the tutorial instruction. Reading Recovery teachers learn to observe, analyse, and interpret the reading and writing behaviours of individual students and to design and implement an individual program to meet each student's needs. Just as the Reading Recovery children engage in learning through social interaction with the teacher, Reading Recovery teachers engage in learning through social interaction with their colleagues and mentors to construct a view of learning and teaching that supports literacy development. Reading Recovery has one of the best professional development protocols in the field of beginning reading.

==Reading Recovery programs around the world ==

In 2015, a report from the New South Wales Department of Education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Deborah  |last1=Bradford |first2=Wai-Yin |last2=Wan |date=2015 |title=Reading Recovery: A Sector-Wide Analysis |url=https://www.cese.nsw.gov.au/publications-filter/reading-recovery-evaluation |publisher=Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation, Department of Education, New South Wales, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;, concluded that Reading Recovery was largely ineffective, and should not be used for most children &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Alexandra |date=20 December 2015 |title=Reading Recovery program used in 960 NSW public schools does not work |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/reading-recovery-program-used-in-960-nsw-public-schools-does-not-work-20151218-glqplg.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location= |access-date= 19 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, in 2016, Reading Recovery lost its "mandated status" as part of the curriculum in NSW's more than 900 public schools, although individual schools may still opt to use it &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagshaw |first=Eryk|date=21 September 2016 |title=Reading Recovery: NSW government ditches 30-year-old, $55m a year program  |url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/reading-recovery-nsw-government-ditches-30yearold-55m-a-year-program-20160921-grkv1n.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location= |access-date= 19 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. A further consequence of this shift in policy is that, in 2017, the NSW Department of Education initiated a hiring program to recruit dozens of new literacy and numeracy experts to support teachers in "evidence-based professional learning", according to NSW Minister for Education, [[Rob Stokes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Alexandra |date=30 December 2017 |title=New literacy teachers recruited as NSW government axes Reading Recovery  |url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/new-literacy-teachers-recruited-as-nsw-government-axes-reading-recovery-20171222-h09c5f.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location= |access-date= 19 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Kirby was born into a military family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ula.org/conference/2006conf/conf.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714121421/http://www.ula.org/conference/2006conf/conf.html# |archive-date=2009-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Barstow, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/kirby/2018/01/07/kirby-if-god-picks-me-to-be-the-next-mormon-prophet-heres-what-i-will-do/|title=Kirby: If God picks me to be the next Mormon prophet, here’s what I will do|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as a [[Mission (LDS Church)|missionary]] for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in [[Uruguay]], where he met his future wife.&lt;ref name=SLT&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/news/5061019-155/kirby-you-can-find-me-on  ''Salt Lake Tribune'' accessed 15 March 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; On his return from Uruguay, he was hired as a police officer with the [[Grantsville, Utah|Grantsville]] Police Department, and later the [[Springville, Utah|Springville]] Police Department (1979).  

Kirby began writing columns for the local newspapers the Springville Daily Herald and ''Utah County Journal'' under the pseudonym ''Officer John "Blitz" Kreeg''&lt;ref name=SLT/&gt;

In 1989, Kirby quit the police force to write full-time. The ''Salt Lake Tribune'' has published his column since 1994, winning the 2007 Utah Headliners Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utah|title=spj.blogspot.com/2007_06-01_archive.html "Kirby wins first place in 2007 Utah Headliners Award, Opinion Column Category (accessed 25 September 2009)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Kirby was suspended from the ''Salt Lake Tribune'' for three months without pay, following an internal investigation into multiple complaints regarding his treatment of women.  This included the allegation that while attending a convention in July 2018 he made inappropriate sexual comments to a young woman, co-erced her into consuming an illegal drug, then outed her as a user. Kirby issued a written apology stating he was "sorry that my actions have offended people" and acknowledged that there was some truth to the allegations, but initially did not apologize for the actions and words themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ksl.com/article/46391388/salt-lake-tribune-suspends-columnist-robert-kirby-over-allegations-of-misconduct|title=Salt Lake Tribune suspends columnist Robert Kirby over allegations of misconduct|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent statements carried a fuller acknowledgement of his responsibility and  his understanding of the harmful nature of his words and actions: 
"In his own written statement, Kirby said: “I’m profoundly sorry that my actions have offended people in the community. I have a lot of work to do in understanding the pain I have caused.
“After discussing my conduct with Tribune management,” he continued, “I am more aware of the consequences of my actions and I will be undergoing training and counseling to become a better person.”&lt;ref&gt;{cite news |last1=Semerad |first1=Tony |title=Tribune columnist Robert Kirby suspended after investigation into inappropriate behavior |url=https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/09/15/tribune-columnist-robert/ |accessdate=10-26-1018 |publisher=Salt Lake Tribune |date=9-15-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing style==
Kirby, who is active in the LDS Church, often writes about its teachings and how its members interpret those teachings in their daily lives. Since many of the ''Salt Lake Tribune'''s readers are non-Mormon, Kirby attempts to explain (usually in a humorous way) the Mormon way of thinking to outsiders. At one time he referred to himself as an "OxyMormon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allanrayandrews.net/websites_for_journalists/columns-and-editorials-li.html|title=Websites for Journalists, accessed 25 September 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach either alienates those [[Latter-day Saints]] who feel their beliefs should not be satirized, or endears itself to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;'' . . . I have come to think of [Kirby] as a rather peculiar uncle who shows up every few days to say something quirky and walks out, leaving everyone to think for a moment.  I know when I see his name that I'm going to have a good morning.''  [http://www.onefalsestep.com] (Blogsite) accessed 25 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this discordant reception, Kirby was once quoted favorably in the LDS Church's bi-annual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Kirby | title=Kicked out of the Mormon church?

[[File:Róisín Dubh (Black Rose).jpg|thumb|alt=A Black Rose as Symbol of Ireland|"Róisín Dubh" ]]
"'''Róisín Dubh'''" ({{IPA-ga|ˈrˠoːʃiːnʲ d̪ˠʊvˠ|}}, "Dark Rosaleen" or "Little Dark Rose"), written in the 16th century{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, is one of Ireland's most famous political songs. It is based on an older love-lyric which referred to the poet's beloved rather than, as here, being a metaphor for Ireland. The intimate tone of the original carries over into the political song.  It is often attributed to [[Antoine Ó Raifteiri]], but almost certainly predates him.&lt;ref&gt;''Duanaire, 1600–1900: Poems of the Dispossessed''; Thomas Kinsella (Editor), Seán Ó Tuama (Editor); {{ISBN|0851053645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The song is named after [[Róisín]] Dubh, probably one of the daughters of [[Aodh Mór Ó Néill]], [[earl of Tyrone]] in the late 16th Century. The song is reputed to have originated in the camps of [[Aodh Rua Ó Domhnaill]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

This song is traditionally sung in the [[Irish language]], with only a few recordings of the English existing. It has been translated from the [[Irish language]] by [[James Clarence Mangan]] and [[Patrick Pearse]]. The following translation is by [[Thomas Kinsella]] (''The New Oxford Book of Irish Verse'', 1986).

Roisin, have no sorrow for all that has happened to you&lt;br/&gt;
The Friars are out on the brine. They are travelling the sea&lt;br/&gt;
Your pardon from the Pope will come, from Rome in the East&lt;br/&gt;
And we won't spare the Spanish wine for my Roisin Dubh&lt;br/&gt;

Far have we journeyed together, since days gone by.&lt;br/&gt;
I've crossed over mountains with her, and sailed the sea&lt;br/&gt;
I have cleared the Erne, though in spate, at a single leap&lt;br/&gt;
And like music of the strings all about me, my Roisin Dubh&lt;br/&gt;

You have driven me mad, fickle girl- may it do you no good!&lt;br/&gt;
My soul is in thrall, not just yesterday nor today&lt;br/&gt;
You have left me weary and weak in body and mind&lt;br/&gt;
O deceive not the one who loves you, my Roisin Dubh&lt;br/&gt;

I would walk in the dew beside you, or the bitter desert&lt;br/&gt;
In hopes I might have your affection, or part of your love&lt;br/&gt;
Fragrant small branch, you have given your word you love me&lt;br/&gt;
The choicest flower of Munster, my Roisin Dubh&lt;br/&gt;

If I had six horses, I would plough against the hill&lt;br/&gt;
I'd make Roisin Dubh my Gospel in the middle of Mass&lt;br/&gt;
I'd kiss the young girl who would grant me her maidenhead&lt;br/&gt;
And do deeds behind the [[wikt:lios|''lios'']] with my Roisin Dubh!&lt;br/&gt;

The Erne will be strong in flood, the hills be torn&lt;br/&gt;
The ocean will be all red waves, the sky all blood,&lt;br/&gt;
Every mountain and bog in Ireland will shake&lt;br/&gt;
One day, before she shall perish, my Roisin Dubh.&lt;br/&gt;

==Renditions==
Róisín Dubh has been frequently performed and recorded, both in its own native Irish and translated into English. (However, quality of the translations vary greatly, from strict ones to those bearing no relationship to the original Irish.) It has been sung by numerous Irish traditional singers including the late Joe Heaney and Maighread Ní Dhomhnaill, as well as in genres ranging from classical to rock and jazz.

The instrumental range is as wide as the vocal, but the instruments best suited to render this air authentically are the native Irish uilleann pipes, flute, fiddle, and whistle, as these are capable of making the "caoine" ("cry"), the note-shaping and changing that is characteristic of the native Irish music. However, other versions using different instruments are also widely available.

Musicians/composers who have performed or recorded the song include these:
*[[Joe Heaney]], famed [[Connemara]] [[Sean-nós song|Sean-nós]] singer
*[[The Wolfe Tones]] recorded it in their debut album [[The_Foggy_Dew_(album)|The Foggy Dew]] in 1965 
*[[Paddy Tunney]]- folk singer and lilter from the county Fermanagh in Ulster
*[[Maighread Ní Dhomhnaill]] – native Irish singer from the famed Ó Domhnaill singing family of [[Rann na Feirste]], [[Co. Donegal]].
*[[Sinéad O'Connor]]
*[[Caitlín Maude]] on her 1975 album ''Caitlín''
*[[Cherish the Ladies]] 1993
*[[Ann Mulqueen]]

===Instrumental===
*[[Seán Ó Riada]], whose score for the 1959 film ''[[Mise Éire]]'' was based on the melody
* The Dubliners. Instrumental, circa 1964. Also the song 'For what died the sons of Róisín'.
*[[Joanie Madden]], leader of Cherish the Ladies, [[tin whistle]] instrumental on her [[solo album]] "Song of the Irish Whistle" (1997)
*[[Máire Ní Chathasaigh]] recorded an instrumental version for solo harp on her duo album with Chris Newman [http://www.oldbridgemusic.com/obmcom_cd08.htm "Live in the Highlands"] (1995)

===Others===
*[[Thin Lizzy]] wrote the song "Black Rose" based on the story of Róisín Dubh. This song was covered by [[Northern Kings]] on their 2008 album ''[[Rethroned]]''.
*[[Flogging Molly]] recorded the song "To Youth (My Sweet Róisín Dubh)" on the album ''[[Within a Mile of Home]]'' (2004)
*[[Black 47]] recorded a song titled Black Rose for the album Home of the Brave

A '''scholarship''' is an award of [[Student financial aid|financial aid]] for a [[student]] to further their [[education]]. Scholarships are awarded based upon various criteria, which usually reflect the values and purposes of the donor or founder of the award.  Scholarship money is not required to be repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastweb.com/financial-aid/articles/815-financial-aid-glossary?page=5|title=Financial Aid Glossary|last=Peterson|first=Kay|date=4 September 2008|publisher=fastweb|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://search-proquest-com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/docview/474208063/pageviewPDF/3727F0E3DE2F40BCPQ/1?accountid=14697|title=UNIVERSITY REFORM: REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSIONERS ON THE STATE OF THE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGES OF OXFORD|last=|first=|date=1952|work=The Observer|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article primarily addresses scholarships in North America.

==Scholarships vs. grants==
While the terms are frequently used interchangeably, there is a difference. Scholarships may have a financial need component but rely on other criteria as well.

* Academic Scholarships typically use a minimum Grade Point Average or standardized test score such as the ACT or SAT to select awardees.
* Athletic Scholarships are generally based on athletic performance of a student and used as a tool to recruit high-performing athletes for their school's athletic teams.
* Merit Scholarships can be based on a number of criteria, including performance in a particular school subject or even club participation or community service.

Grants, however, are offered based exclusively on financial need and determined using the applicant's [[FAFSA]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholarships.com/resources/parents-practical-guide-to-college/parents-guide-to-college-financial-aid/loans-vs-grants-vs-scholarships/|title=Loans Vs Grants Vs Scholarships - Scholarships.com|last=Scholarships.com|website=www.scholarships.com|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The most common scholarships may be classified as:
* '''Merit-based:''' These awards are based on a student's academic, artistic, athletic or other abilities, and often factor in an applicant's extracurricular activities and community service record. The most common merit-based scholarships, awarded by either private organizations or directly by a student's intended college, recognize academic achievement or high scores on standardized tests.

* '''Need-based:''' Some private need-based awards are confusingly called scholarships, and require the results of a FAFSA (the family's EFC). However, scholarships are often merit-based, while grants tend to be need-based.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/grants-for-college/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Student-specific:''' These are scholarships for which applicants must initially qualify based upon gender, race, religion, family, and medical history, or many other student-specific factors. Minority scholarships are the most common awards in this category.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} For example, students in Canada may qualify for a number of aboriginal scholarships, whether they study at home or abroad.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The [[Gates Millennium Scholars]] program is another minority scholarship funded by Bill and Melinda Gates for excellent African American, American Indian, Asian Pacific Islander American and Latino students who enroll in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gates Millennium Scholars|url=http://www.gmsp.org/publicweb/aboutus.aspx|accessdate=9 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115031320/http://gmsp.org/publicweb/AboutUs.aspx|archivedate=15 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Career-specific:''' These are scholarships a college or university awards to students who plan to pursue a specific field of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.debt.org/students/scholarships-and-grants/aid-based-on-your-career-choice/|title=Aid Based on Your Career Choice|work=Debt.org|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the most generous awards to students who pursue careers in high-need areas such as education or nursing. Many schools in the United States give future nurses full scholarships to enter the field, especially if the student intends to work in a high-need community.
* '''College-specific:''' College-specific scholarships are offered by individual colleges and universities to highly qualified applicants. These scholarships are given on the basis of academic and personal achievement. Some scholarships have a "bond" requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teng|first1=Amelia|title=Many slam A*Star scientist's protest against her scholarship bond|url=http://www.stcommunities.sg/education/many-slam-astar-scientists-protest-against-her-scholarship-bond|accessdate=15 December 2014|agency=ST}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients may be required to work for a particular employer for a specified period of time or to work in rural or remote areas; otherwise, they may be required to repay the value of the support they received from the scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dancing out of A*Star|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/dancing-star-005756200.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141215152449/https://sg.news.yahoo.com/dancing-star-005756200.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 December 2014|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly the case with education and nursing scholarships for people prepared to work in rural and remote areas.

* '''[[Athletic scholarship|Athletic]]:''' Awarded to students with exceptional skill in a sport. Often this is so that the student will be available to attend the school or college and play the sport on their team, although in some countries government funded sports scholarships are available, allowing scholarship holders to train for international representation.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.tass.gov.uk/ Talented Athlete Scholarship]'', UK Government.

Of increasing interest in the United States are "last dollar" scholarships. These can be provided by private and government-based institutions, and are intended to cover the remaining fees charged to a student after the various grants are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Kelchen, Robert.

Retrieved February 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; To prohibit institutions from taking last dollar scholarships into account, and thereby removing other sources of funding, these scholarships are not offered until after financial aid has been offered in the form of a letter. Furthermore, last dollar scholarships may require families to have filed taxes for the most recent year; received their other sources of financial aid; and not yet received loans.

==Local==

It is typical for people to find scholarships in their home regions. Information on these can be found by asking local institutions and [[organizations]]. Typically, these are less competitive as the eligible population is smaller.
* '''Guidance counselors:''' When starting to explore scholarship opportunities, most high school students check with their guidance counselors. They can be a reliable resource for local scholarships.
* '''Non-profits and charitable trusts:''' Most non-profit organizations have at some point of their history founded scholarships for prospective students. The ''[[Good Schools Guide]]'', a guide to schools in the [[UK]], states "Charitable grant-making trusts can help in cases of genuine need," and goes on to outline several instances where this may be the case, including an "unforeseen family disaster" and a "need for special education".
* '''Community foundations:''' Many counties and cities and regions have a local foundation dedicated to giving money in the form of grants and scholarships to people and organizations in the area.
* '''Music teachers:''' Some music teachers offer reduced-cost or free lessons to help low-income children gain access to an arts education. In addition, some local non-profits provide free music classes to youths.
* '''Foundations:''' Certain foundations in the United States offer scholarships for entrepreneurial endeavors.
* '''Labor/trade unions:''' Major [[trade union|union]]s often offer scholarships for members and their dependent children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/the-scholarship-coach/2014/08/28/organize-scholarship-support-from-a-labor-union|title=Organize Scholarship Support From a Labor Union|last=Konrad|first=Matt|date=August 28, 2014|website=US News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Houses of worship:''' The local [[house of worship]] may or may not have any scholarships for their members, but the religious organization or headquarters may have some available. [[Theology]] study is highly encouraged.
* '''Chamber of commerce:''' Many [[chambers of commerce]] offer (usually small) grants to students in the community, especially those planning on careers in business and public service. Even if they do not offer any themselves, one can usually get a listing of members, and many of them may offer small scholarships to local students.
* '''Other volunteer organizations:''' Many organizations offer scholarships or award grants to students whose background or chosen field overlaps the field of the organization. For example, local chapters of professional societies may help the studies of exceptionally distinguished students of the region. Similarly, charity organizations may offer help, especially if the late parent of the student was a member of the organization (e.g., a Masonic lodge might help the orphan of a lodge brother.) This kind of scholarship is mostly ad hoc.
* '''School:''' Old, well-known [[schools]] are often endowed with scholarship funds.
* '''University:''' Old, well-established [[universities]] may have funds to finance the studies of extremely talented students of little means. Eligibility often requires that a student belong to some special category or be among a nation's best. However, universities provide information on scholarships and grants, possibly even internship opportunities.
* '''PSAT/NMSQT:''' In the United States, students are offered the opportunity to take the [[PSAT/NMSQT]] test, usually in their junior year of high school. National Merit Scholarship programs are initially determined by the scores received on the PSAT/NMSQT test. Some private scholarship programs require applicants to take the PSAT.  The test can be used as preparation for the [[SAT]].
* '''Enrichment Centres:''' In certain countries, [[Tuition center|enrichment centers]] have begun to provide scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20080909-86631.html |title=Bond Free |author=Janice Heng |publisher=THE STRAITS TIMES |date=Sep 9, 2008 |accessdate=Sep 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Disabilities:''' Students with [[disability|disabilities]] may be able to apply for awards intended for people with disabilities. Those scholarships may be intended for disabled students in general, or in relation to a specific disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipolar-lives.com/2011-Bipolar-Lives-Scholarship.html |title=Bipolar Lives Scholarship |accessdate=2010-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103095439/http://www.bipolar-lives.com/2011-Bipolar-Lives-Scholarship.html |archivedate=2010-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Literature of Spain}}
'''Spanish Enlightenment literature''' is the [[literature]] of [[Spain]] written during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

During the 18th century a new spirit was born (it is in essence a continuation of the [[Renaissance]]) which swept away the older values of the [[Baroque]] and which receives the name of "Enlightenment". This movement laid its foundations in a critical spirit, in the predominance of reason and experience, philosophy and science were the most valued sources of knowledge. The period is also known as the "century of lights" or the "century of reason". In short, human happiness was pursued by means of culture and progress. The new winds that caused that art and literature were oriented towards a new classicism ([[Neoclassicism]]). The expression of feeling was avoided, norms and academic rules were followed, and balance and harmony were valued. At the end of century a reaction against so much rigidity arose, a return to the world of the feelings taking its place; this movement is known as "Pre-[[romanticism]]".

==Historical context==
[[Image:Villars a Denain1.jpg|thumb|right|Battle of Denain]]
The 18th century began with the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714). The European powers, worried about the hegemonic power of the French king [[Louis XIV|Luis XIV]], together with his grandson [[Philip V of Spain|Felipe de Anjou]], whom [[Carlos II]] had named heir to the throne, formed the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Great Alliance]] and endorsed the putsches of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Carlos of Austria]] to accede to the crown. After the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], [[Felipe V]] (1700–1746) was recognized King of Spain, although he later lost his dominions in Menorca and Gibraltar. In 1724, he abdicated in favor of his son [[Louis of Spain|Luis I]], but when the latter died months later, he returned to assume the Spanish throne. During his reign, he developed a centralist policy and reorganized Public Property.

After the death of Felipe V, [[Fernando VI]] (1746–1759) succeeded him, who, with ministers like Carvajal and Marqués de la Ensenada, improved communications and the road network of the country, encouraged naval constructions and favored the development of the sciences.

After the reign of Felipe V, his stepbrother [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] succeeded to the throne. Prototype of illustrated monarch, he relied on the support of important ministers, like Floridablanca, Campomanes, Aranda, Grimaldi and Marqués de Esquilache. Without leaving the model of the [[Old Regime]], he modernized the country, repopulated the Sierra Morena, and favored education, commerce and public works.

During the reign of [[Carlos IV]], the [[French Revolution]] exploded (1789). Because of his weakness and the ambition of minister Godoy, he had to abdicate in favour of his son [[Fernando VII]], after the [[Peninsular War|invasion by the French]] in 1808.

==The Enlightenment in Europe==
{{main|Age of Enlightenment}}
[[Image:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''[[L'Encyclopédie]]'' (1751)]]
In the last decades of the 17th century, the [[Old Regime]], based on the predominance of the ecclesiastical, military and aristocratic classes, entered into crisis in Europe. In this century, Europe critically reviewed the established order. Reason and the critique prevailed, and the experimental method and studies founded on reason are impelled.

The anxiety for knowledge became general. Court meetings left place to the bourgeois salons, cafés or cultural institutions. A necessity was felt to travel by reasons of study or pleasure, to know other languages, to make sport to keep the body fit or to improve the conditions of life of the citizens.

In this new attitude, the illustrated person is a philanthropist that worries about others, and proposes and undertakes reforms in the aspects related to the poor and society. They defended religious tolerance, and skepticism was put into practice and it was even reached to attack religions. In opposition to the absolute monarchies, [[Montesquieu]] defended the bases of modern democracy and the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial powers. The illustrated people wanted to enjoy freedom and to choose their own governors. All that inspired the motto of the [[French Revolution]]: Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood.

The illustrated theories had their origin in England, although they reached their peak in France, where they were gathered in the '''[[Encyclopédie]]''' (Encyclopedie, or reasoned dictionary of the sciences, the arts and the offices, 1751–1772), published by Jean Le Rond d'Alembert and Denis Diderot. In this work they gathered all the existing knowledge of their time, in alphabetical order.

==The Enlightenment in Spain==
{{main|Enlightenment in Spain}}

===Antecedents of the reforming policy: the ''novatores'' of the 18th century===
During the reign of the minor Austrias, Spain practically abandoned the scientific studies, seen with suspicion and continuously persecuted by the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]]. The delay with regard to Europe was evident at the beginning of the 18th century. Nevertheless, some intellectuals since the end of the 17th century refused to leave the investigation; not exent of risks, they were always up-to-date about the European discoveries in astronomy, medicine, mathematics or botany. These scholars are the so-called ''novatores'' ("innovating ones", contemptuously called this way). They spread the theories of Galileo Galilei, Kepler, Linnaeus or Isaac Newton. Among the ''novatores'', Juan de Cabriada, Antonio Hugo de Omerique, [[Juan Caramuel]], Martínez, Tosca and Corachán stand out. In the 18th century, the legacy that they left was continued by other scientists like [[Jorge Juan y Santacilia|Jorge Juan]], Cosme Bueno, [[Antonio de Ulloa]], etc.

===Penetration of the Enlightenment in Spain===
After the [[Spanish War of Sucession|War of Succession]], the [[Bourbon house|Bourbons]] found a Spain sunk in misery and ignorance. The [[Iberian Peninsula]] hardly had seven million and a half inhabitants. With a French political conception, [[Felipe V]] fortified the monarchic power and harnessed a process of centralization in the nation, abolishing the [[fuero]]s and the laws of Aragón and Catalonia. The Church maintained its dominion, although some religious orders like the [[Company of Jesus]] fell, already at time of [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]]. On the other hand, the common people, formed by livestock farmers, crop farmers, civil employees and marginalized people, lacked rights. The monarchs gradually reduced some privileges of the hereditary aristocracy and adopted a ''regalista'' or critical position in front of the Church, with the purpose of making a series of basic reforms. At the end of century, the quality of life of the Spaniards had been improved, as it is demonstrated by the increase of the population in almost three million inhabitants, a figure which is nevertheless smaller than the ones of other European countries.

[[Image:Estatutos rae 1715big.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the first edition of ''Foundation and statutes of the Royal Spanish Academy'' (1715)]]
Enlightenment ideas entered Spain through diverse ways:
* The diffusion of the ideas of some illustrated people like [[Gregorio Mayans]] and Benito Jerónimo Feijoo, ''novatores'' of the 18th century.
* The propagation of the French encyclopedic ideas ([[Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]]), in spite of the censorship of the time to avoid its introduction in the Peninsula and the monitoring of the Inquisition.
* The translation of French books of all genres and the hiring of foreign or erudite professors in certain matters.
* The trips of study and knowledge of the European life and customs made by the scholars and intellectuals.
* The appearance of newspapers or publications where the illustrated ideas spread.
* The creation of a series of cultural institutions and "Economic societies of friends of the country" destined to promote the cultural, social and economic progress of Spain by means of the extension of the culture. The first of the societies was founded in the Basque Country in 1765, and soon they spread all over the nation. They were constituted by illustrated people coming from the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie and the clergy. In this century organisms of great importance were created, like the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]], founded for the benefit of the language, under the motto "cleans, fixes and gives splendor". This society tried to create codes for the correct use of the language, and its first effort was destined to the elaboration of a [[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española|Dictionary of the Castilian language]], known today as the Dictionary of Authorities, in six volumes (1726–1739). The etymology of each word could be found in it, and each meaning appeared accompanied of a brief text of a famous writer who demonstrated the existence of this meaning. Other institutions that arose then were the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España|National Library]] (1712), the Royal Academy of History (1736), the [[Jardín Botánico de Madrid|Botanical Garden]] (1755), the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando]] (1751), the Royal Academy of Good Letters of Barcelona (1752) and the [[Museo del Prado|Museum of El Prado]] (1785).

The maximum splendor of the Enlightenment in Spain occurred during the reign of [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] and its decay, about the dates of the [[French Revolution]] (1789) and the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian Peninsula]] (1808). The illustrated people, in spite of counting on the support of the Crown, did not obtain the recognition of the majority; many were described as pro-strangers and accused of attacking the tradition and the religious education. After the French Revolution, some were persecuted and even jailed.

==The Spanish language in the 18th century==
In this century, a fight in favor of the clarity and naturalness of the artistic language is fought, in which many writers fought against the rests of the Baroque style that still survived, that is to say, the use of artifices at which the late Baroque had arrived.

Latin was used in universities as academic language, but little by little it was being replaced in that role. Spaniards wanted to return to the splendor of the [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] as literary language, but for that it was necessary to develop forms of expression in agreement with the European experimental sciences, work which was developed by Feijoo, Sarmiento, Mayans, Jovellanos, Forner, Capmany, among others. In 1813, after the War of Independence, the Meeting created by the Regency to make a general reform of education ordered the exclusive use of the Spanish in the university.

Many of the illustrated people, for the modernization of Spain, defended the implantation of education in other languages (French, English, Italian) in the centers, and the translation of outstanding works to Castilian. To the first were opposed those who defended the priority of the classic languages (Latin and Greek) as opposed to the modern ones, and to the second were opposed those who rejected the translations because they would introduce unnecessary foreign words in the Spanish language and would endanger its identity. Two positions arose thus: '''casticismo''', that defended a pure language, without neither mixture of voices nor strange turns, with words documented by the authorities (the Royal Spanish Academy); and '''purismo''', that was totally against the penetration of neologisms, mainly the foreign ones, blaming its opponents for being stainers of the language.

==Stages of the literature of the 18th century==
Three stages in the Spanish Literature of the 18th century can be distinguished:
* '''Antibaroquism''' (until 1750 approximately): Writers fought against the style of the last Baroque, considered to be excessively rhetorical and convoluted. Recreational literature is not cultivated, but they are more interested in the essay and the satire, using the language with simplicity and purity.
* '''Neoclassicism''' (until the end of the 18th century): A fixation for the French and Italian classicism is felt. The writers also imitate the old classics (Greek and Roman) and their boom extended from the reign of [[Fernando VI]] until the end of the century.
* '''Preromanticism''' (end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century): The influence of the English philosopher [[John Locke]], next to the French [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Denis Diderot]], will make a new feeling arise, unsatisfied with the tyranny of the reason, which makes the right of the individuals to express his personal emotions be worth (repressed then by the illustrated people), among which fundamentally the love appears. This current announces the decay of the Neoclasicism and opens the doors to the Romanticism.

==Prose==
The narrative is almost nonexistent in Spain during this period. Practically it is reduced to the ''Life'' of [[Diego de Torres Villarroel]], or to the story ''Fray Gerundio de Campazas'' of [[José Francisco de Isla]].

Another modality of great influence in this time was the newspaper. Literary, scientific, or of curiosities, publications like the ''Newspaper of the Literate of Spain'', ''The Censor'' or ''The Mail of Madrid'' contributed to spread the theories and the ideas of the moment in Spain, laying the principles of the Enlightenment.

On the contrary, the essay is the dominant genre. This educative and doctrinal prose shows a desire to approach the problems of the moment, tends to the reform of the customary and usually makes use of the epistolar form.

===Friar Benito Jerónimo Feijoo===

{{main|Benito Jerónimo Feijoo y Montenegro}}
The benedictine friar Fray Benito Jerónimo Feijoo y Montenegro (Orense, 1676 - Oviedo, 1764) had an aristotelian formation. His works reached numerous editions and provoked many controversies, so many that Fernando VII, in an act of enlightened despotism, had to defend him by designating him his honorary advisor and prohibiting the attacks against his work and his person.

His knowledge was manifested in a multitude of essays that he grouped in the eight volumes of ''The universal critical theater'' (1727–1739) and in the five of ''Erudite and curious letters'' (1742–1760). Feijoo saw the necessity of writing to move Spain away from its delay; with this intention, he gave a didactic character to his work, noticeably catholic, but with the intention that the new European currents penetrated, at least, in the illustrated classes. He was very critical with the superstitions and the false miracles.

Feijoo contributed to the consolidation of the Castilian as a cultured language by defending its use as opposed to the Latin, that still was used in the universities. He also accepted the introduction of new voices, when they were necessary, without concerning where they came. His production covers very diverse fields like economy, politics, astronomy, mathematics, physics, history, religion, etc. His style was characterized by its simplicity, naturalness and clarity. For many critics, the Spanish prosa becomes modern with Feijoo.

===Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos===
[[Image:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos.jpg|thumb|right|Jovellanos portrayed by [[Goya]], 1798. [[Prado Museum|El Prado Museum]]]]
{{main|Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos}}
Jovellanos (Gijón, 1744 – Puerto de Vega, Asturias, 1811) is probably the most important essayist of the 18th century. Coming from an accommodated family, he studied law and he was destined to Seville, where he made epistolar contact with the Salmantine poetic School. In Madrid, as Mayor of House and Court, his political activity was in constant increase. After an exile, he was named minister of Grace and Justice by Godoy, and later, Advisor of State. When the confidence in the minister was lost, he was imprisoned in Majorca in the Castle of Bellver until the Riot of Aranjuez, that overthrew Godoy, gave him back the freedom. In 1808 he took part in the Central Meeting that confronted the Napoleonic army. He was persecuted by the French and he tried to be transferred to Cadiz, but the meteorological inclemencies forced him to take refuge in the Vega de Navia port, where he died.

Jovellanos began to write lyric poetry with the pastoral name (very common in his time) of Jovino, and with illustrated ideals. Like Cadalso, he satirized the uneducated aristocracy in his satire ''A Arnesto''. But soon he got tired of the poetry, which he considered to be an adolescent game to which the reason was not applied, and which was improper of a respectable man. Curiously, years later he invites in verse to the insurrection of 1808 in the ''Song for the Astures against the French''.

He also composed ''The honest delinquent'', an illustrated reformist drama. A law had been promulgated that condemned the survivor of the duels to death, considering the offender and the victim equally guilty; Jovellanos based his drama on this, because for him only the offender was the culprit. The work follows the line of the sentimental comedy, so admired in France, and its tone is already Preromantic.
Clarity, concision and sobriety are the characteristic features of the didactic work of Jovellanos.

===José Cadalso===
[[Image:Josecadalso.jpg|thumb|right|José Cadalso]]
{{main|José Cadalso}}
José Cadalso y Vázquez de Andrade (1741–1782) is another of the great prose writers of the 18th century. He wrote important literary works, whose most important creation was ''Moroccan Letters''. It was said of him that he had a vast culture, probably enriched by his trips to England, France, Germany and Italy. He was a military man and he received the colonel rank. He was deeply in love with the actress María Ignacia Ibáñez, whose excesses that she committed caused her death at a very early age. Cadalso tried to unearth her, action which caused his exile to Salamanca (ordered so that he was cured of his insanity). He was later destined to Extremadura, Andalusia, Madrid and finally Gibraltar, place where he died during the Great Siege of Gibraltar. His body was laid to rest in Santa Maria la Coronada Parish Church in [[San Roque, Cádiz]].

As poet, and under the name of "Dalmiro", he composed the work ''Leisures of my youth'' (1771). His love towards the actress María Ignacia Ibáñez made him approach the dramatic world. Although he wrote three tragedies, only one of them was represented, and with little success, ''Don Sancho García, count of Castile'' (1771). His work in prose is however more extensive. In ''Dismal nights'' he narrates in dialogue form his frustrated yearning for rescuing the body of María Ignacia from the tomb. Entirely neoclassical is the book ''The erudites to the violet'', against the false intellectuals; seven lessons that satirize those who try to know much studying little.

Nevertheless, the ''Moroccan Letters'' (1789), published posthumously, are the ones that give the most importance to the literary production of Cadalso. According to a very cultivated model in France (for example, the Persian Letters of [[Montesquieu]]), the author composes a book with ninety letters written between Gazel, moor that visits Spain, his Moroccan teacher and friend Ben-Beley, and Nuño Núñez, Christian friend of Gazel. They comment on the historical past of Spain and its present life, and they judge the work of the governors and the customs of the country.

==Lyric==
In 1737, [[Ignacio de Luzán Claramunt de Suelves y Gurrea|Ignacio de Luzán]] gathered the aesthetic ideas of the Neoclasicism in his ''Poética''. This style prevailed in Spain imposing criteria of utility and service to the humanity, next to desires of aesthetic pleasure. The artistic ideals imported from France and the "good taste" and the courtesy dominated, while feelings and passions were repressed. The subjection to the norms was general, fleeing from the spontaneity and the imagination, which were replaced by the didactic eagerness.

The neoclassical poetry treated historical, customary and satirical subjects. In the variant denominated "[[Rococo|Rococó]]", more luxurious and recharged, the pastoral themes that raised the pleasure and the gallant love dominated. Habitual forms were odes, epistles, "elegías" and romances.

Important names of the Spanish poetry are Juan Meléndez Valdés, the maximum Spanish representative of the Rococó, Nicolás Fernández de Moratín and the story-tellers Tomás de Iriarte and Félix María Samaniego.

The neoclassical literature was developed mainly in three cities: [[Salamanca]], by people related to its University; [[Seville]], with the influence of its assistant (position similar to mayor) Pablo de Olavide; and [[Madrid]], around its boarding house of San Sebastián. This way, the writers of that tendency are grouped in '''schools''' or '''poetic groups''': The Salmantine school, in which Cadalso, Meléndez Valdés, Jovellanos and [[Juan Pablo Forner|Forner]] are found; the Sevillian school, in which the writers [[Manuel María de Arjona]], [[José Marchena]], [[Joseph Blanco White|José María Blanco]] and [[Alberto Lista]] are included, who soon evolved towards a starting Romanticism (Preromanticism); and the Madrilenian group, formed by Vicente García de la Huerta, Ramón de la Cruz, Iriarte, Samaniego and both Fernández de Moratín.

===The Salmantine school: Juan Meléndez Valdés===
[[Image:Juan Meléndez Valdés (1797).jpg|thumb|right|Juan Meléndez Valdés (1797) by [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]]]]
{{main|Juan Meléndez Valdés}}
Meléndez Valdés (Ribera del Fresno, Badajoz, 1754 - Montpellier, France, 1814) is considered one of the best poets of the 18th century. He was university professor in Salamanca, where he maintained friendship with Cadalso and Jovellanos. He worked as a jurist, occupying destinies in Zaragoza, Valladolid and finally in Madrid, where he worked as public prosecutor of the Supreme Court. Once that his mentor, Jovellanos, fell in misfortune before Godoy, his exile to Medina del Campo was ordered, later to Zamora and finally to Salamanca. He was pro-French during the War of Independence and he avoided being shot in Oviedo, but he had to exile himself after the defeat of the French army.

Two stages in the lyric of Meléndez Valdés can be differentiated:
* In the first one he feels attracted in his youth by the predominant Rococo poetry and the influence of José Cadalso. He composed anacreontic and pastoral poems with the love as predominant theme. From this first stage it is possible to emphasize the égloga ''Batilo''.
* Nevertheless, after the death of Cadalso, and following the advice of Jovellanos, he thought that the pastoral lyric was inappropriate of a magistrate, so he composed another type of poetry which would be in more agreement with his occupation. Like Jovellanos, he is aware of the social inequalities, he defends the necessity to undertake reforms that improve the life of the town, he criticizes the customs of the court, and his poetry becomes philosophical, sentimental and reflective.

His style in the beginnings was artificial and conventional, but later it became very well cared for and precise. He himself defined his intention when writing: "I have taken care of explaining myself with nobility and of using a language worthy of the great subjects that I have treated".

===The Madrilenian group: the story-tellers Iriarte and Samaniego===
{{main|Tomás de Iriarte|Félix María de Samaniego}}
In the court and in the bourgeois environment the reformist ideas of the 18th century penetrated quickly. In addition to the Academies there were also other particular initiatives which influenced very much in the literature, as it is the case of the boarding house of San Sebastián, founded by Nicolás Fernández de Moratín and his son Leandro, along with Cadalso and Jovellanos.

Two writers were also members of the Madrilenian group. With the purpose of correcting defects and showing the rational values, they wrote fables.
They were Tomás de Iriarte (La Orotava, Tenerife, 1750 - Madrid, 1791) and Félix María Samaniego: (La Guardia, Álava, 1745–1801).

===The Sevillian school===
Like Salamanca, the Sevillian city also had a great poetic tradition. In 1751 the ''Academy of the Good Letters'' was founded, which promoted the literary activity. As of 1760, and as a result of the arrival of Pablo de Olavide as intendant of the Government of Andalusia, the culture in that city was impelled remarkably. In 1776, that illustrated person is persecuted and jailed by the Inquisition.

By influence of José Cadalso and Meléndez, more recharged and colorist poems were written than in the Salmantine school, also influenced by [[Fernando de Herrera]]. In the Sevillian school poets like Manuel María Arjona (1771–1820), José Marchena (1768–1820), José María Blanco (1775–1841) and Alberto Lista (1775–1848) stood out. They wrote patriotic poems urging to fight by the freedom, after the invasion of the French and the return of Fernando VII, already in the 19th century. Some of them finished in the exile.

==Theater==
In theater, the main cultivators were those of the Madrilenian group. They were put under which the classic and modern rulers taught, and they created a theater which followed the political and moral interests of the time. Three tendencies existed:
* The traditional tendency. During the first half of the 18th century the theater is in decay.
* The neoclassical tendency.
* The popular tendency. The [[Género chico|sainetes]] enjoyed popular support. They were written in verse, related to the [[paso]]s and [[Entremés|entremeses]] of the previous centuries. The most important author of sainetes was Ramón de la Cruz.

Theater adopted the new fashions that arrived from France. In the neoclassical theater also the reason and the harmony prevailed as norm. The so-called "rule of the three units" was obeyed, which demanded a single action, a single scene and a coherent chronological time in the development of the dramatic action. The separation between the comical and the tragic was established. The imaginative containment prevailed, eliminating everything which was considered exaggerated or of "bad taste". An educative and moralizing purpose was adopted, which would serve to spread the universal values of culture and the progress.

Although less rationalist than other genres, tragedy cultivated historical subjects, as is the case of the most known, ''Raquel'', of [[Vicente García de la Huerta]]. But without doubt the most representative theater of the moment was that of Leandro Fernández de Moratín, creator of what has been called "moratinian comedy". As opposed to the tragic genre, the most common then, and which his father Nicolás practiced, and as opposed to the customary and kind sainete of Ramón de la Cruz, Moratín Jr ridiculed the vices and the customs of his time, in a clear attempt to turn the theater into a vehicle to moralize the custom.

===Leandro Fernandez de Moratín===
[[Image:Leandro Fernández de Moratín.jpg|thumb|right|Leandro Fernández de Moratín (1799), by [[Goya]], [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]]]
{{main|Leandro Fernández de Moratín}}
Son of [[Nicolás Fernández de Moratín]], Leandro (Madrid, 1760 - Paris, 1828) is the main author of theater in the 18th century. His neoclassical direction is due to his father. Protégé of Jovellanos and Godoy, he traveled by England, France (he was present at the outbreak of the French Revolution) and Italy. He fell enamored with Paquita Muñoz, much younger than him, whom he did not marry according to his desire of not contracting commitments. He was pro-French and he accepted from José Bonaparte the position of Great Librarian, reason why he was exiled to France, where he died  after the defeat of the invaders.

As poet, he wrote satirical poems like the ''Satire against the introduced vices in the Castilian poetry'', theme that he returns to treat in prose in ''The defeat of the pedantic ones''. The present critic considers Moratinos to be the most outstanding lyric writer of the 18th century. In the poem ''Elegía a las musas'', being already old, he sayd goodbye to the poetry and the theater, which had been his reason of living.

As dramatic author, he wrote solely five comedies that gave a great reputation to him among illustrated people. In ''The old man and the girl'' and ''The yes of the girls'' (1806), he defends the right that the woman has to accept or not her spouse against the imposition of the family, because until then it was frequent to marry young girls with wealthy old men. In ''La mojigata'', he criticizes the hypocrisy and the false devotion. Another comedy is ''The baron'', and finally ''The new comedy or The coffee'' (1792) is a ridicule towards the authors who ignore the aristotelian rules.

===Ramón de la Cruz===
{{main|Ramón de la Cruz}}
The [[Género chico|sainete]]-writer Ramón de la Cruz (Madrid, 1731–1794) was one of the most applauded authors by the public and most criticized by the illustrated people (although some of them, seeing the popular support of his work, withdrew). He began writing tragedies of neoclassical cut, rejecting the "out of order" theater that people preferred. Nevertheless, his economic necessities made him approach less illustrated genres but more acclaimed by the public and the actors. This way he began to write [[zarzuela]]s of Spanish thematic and, simultaneously, sainetes. Of these he wrote more than four hundred, generally in octosyllabic verses, and some in endecasyllabic. The personages of this theater subgenus are popular (nerve girls, smart boys, deceived husbands, ruined bricklayers, chestnut sellers, nobleman of low grade, etc.) and the action usually happens in Madrid: ''The prairie of San Isidro'', ''El Prado in the evening'', ''El Rastro in the morning''; its end sometimes wants to be exemplary. The most famous of his sainetes is ''Manolo'', satire of the theater that his neoclassical enemies wrote. With his maxim "I write and the truth dictates", he could find in the people an inexhaustible source, the same that, with greater depth, would inspire [[Francisco de Goya]].

==Preromanticism==
Some works of the Salmantine school augur the beginning of the Romanticism. Thus, in ''The lugubrious nights'' of José Cadalso, the madness, tetric and nocturnal atmospheres, and a great loving passion, are introduced. Other important authors are [[Nicasio Álvarez de Cienfuegos]] (1764–1809), [[Manuel José Quintana]] (1772–1857), [[Juan Nicasio Gallego]] (1777–1853) and José Somoza (1781–1852).

"Principles of Sustainability in Contemporary Art". Praesens: central European contemporary art review. 1 (5-12) ISSN 1588-5534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable art may also be understood as art that is produced with consideration for the wider impact of the work and its reception in relationship to its environments (social, economic, biophysical, historical and cultural).

== History ==
According to the contemporary art historians and curators [[Maja and Reuben Fowkes]], the origins of sustainable art can be traced to the [[conceptual art]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, with its stress on dematerialisation and questioning of the functioning of the art system.&lt;ref&gt;‘Planetary Forecast: The Roots of Sustainability in the Radical Art of the 1970s’ Third Text 100 Special Issue vol 23 issue 5 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They also connect the rise of the concept of sustainability to the ending of the Cold War in 1989 and the emergence of a new awareness of the global character of ecological and social problems.&lt;ref&gt;'The Ecology of Post-Socialism and the Implications of Sustainability for Contemporary Art' in ''Art and Theory After Socialism'' edited Malcolm Miles (Plymouth Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable art adopts, according to these authors, a critical position towards some key practitioners in the [[land art]] movement of the 1960s, who showed little concern for the environmental consequences of e.g. treating the landscape like a giant canvas with a bulldozer for a brush.&lt;ref&gt;“Art and Ecology – Economy Special Issue” (2006). Praesens: central European contemporary art review. 1. ISSN 1588-5534.&lt;/ref&gt; They have questioned the polemical division between 'autonomous' and 'instrumental' art originating with modernism, arguing that it is 'autonomy that gives art, as well as artists as social actors, the potential to be free and able to offer alternatives to dominant ideological paradigms.'&lt;ref&gt;Maja and Reuben Fowkes, 'Sensuous Resistance:the legacy of modernism for sustainable art' Dokumenta 12 magazine project (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005 there is a Sustainable Arts Biennale running at Ihlienworth near Hamburg, Germany, curated by the German conceptional artist and curator Samuel J. Fleiner.
There are a range of interpretations over the relations between art and sustainability, besides the term 'sustainable art' promoted by Maja and Reuben Fowkes: Other authors prefer the broader notions of 'sustainability arts' or 'art and sustainability' (e.g. Kagan and Kirchberg).&lt;ref&gt;Eds Sacha Kagan and Volker Kirchberg (2008). "Sustainability: a new frontier for the arts and cultures". Frankfurt am Main: VAS. {{ISBN|978-3-88864-440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others explicitly rejected the use of the term 'sustainable art', referring instead to 'artistic work that inspires us to think about sustainability" (Margot Käßmann).&lt;ref&gt;Margot Käßmann. "The Spirit of Sustainability." Berlin: Rat für Nachhaltige Entwicklung.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional discussion of the relationship of contemporary art to notions of sustainability blossomed across Europe in the early years 2000, with e.g. the conference of the German Society for Political Culture (Instituts für Kulturpolitik der Kulturpolitischen Gesellschaft e.V.), in January 2002 at the Art Academy of Berlin, and the 'Tutzinger Manifest'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kupoge.de/ifk/tutzinger-manifest/kun.htm Kultur - Kunst - Nachhaltigkeit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An International Symposium on Sustainability and Contemporary Art took place at [[Central European University]], in Budapest (Hungary) in March 2006. This was the first in a series of international symposia organised by [[Maja and Reuben Fowkes]] bringing together contemporary artists, philosophers, environmental sciences and acvitists to explore common ground around issues such as 'Exit or Activism' (2008), 'Hard Realities and the New Materiality' (2009) and 'Art, Post-Fordism and Eco-Critique' (2010).[https://web.archive.org/web/20100115070048/http://www.translocal.org/sustainability/index.htm]. In March–April 2007 at the [[Lüneburg University|Leuphana University Lüneburg]], the Arts Research Network of the European Sociological Association focused its attention on the recent movements and approaches to 'arts and sustainability' at its biennial conference.&lt;ref&gt;Volker Kirchberg, Sacha Kagan and Christoph Behnke (2007).

'''''The Invention of Lying''''' is a 2009 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[romantic comedy]] film written and directed by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]] (in their [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debuts]]). The film stars Gervais as the first human with the ability to lie in a world where people can only tell the truth. The supporting cast features [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Rob Lowe]], and [[Tina Fey]].  The film was released in the United States on October 2, 2009.

== Plot ==
The film is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative reality]] in which lying does not exist.

Mark Bellison is a [[screenwriter]], in a film industry limited to historical readings because there is no fiction. One night he has a date with the beautiful and [[wealth]]y Anna McDoogles. She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, because of his looks and failing financial situation, but is going out with him as a favour to his best friend, Greg Kleinschmidt.

The next day, Mark is fired from his job because of the lack of interest in his films (which are set in the lackluster [[14th century]]), and his landlord threatens to evict him for not paying his rent. Crestfallen, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark then has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that enables him to tell the world's first lie, which is that he has $800 — the amount he owed his landlord — in his account. He then lies in a variety of other circumstances, initially for personal gain; he prevents a police officer from arresting Greg for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]], [[Breaking the bank|breaks the bank]] at a [[casino]], and writing a screenplay about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century that ends with the claim that everyone's memories were erased. He becomes wealthy from the film's success. Mark soon realises that lying can also be used to help others, such as stopping his [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] neighbour Frank Fawcett from committing [[suicide]]. Soon after, Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again. She congratulates Mark for his financial success and admits that he would be a good husband and father, but she is still not attracted to him. 

Mark then gets a call that his mother has had a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor tells him that his mother is going to die. She is scared of death, believing that it will bring an [[Eternal oblivion|eternity of nothingness]]. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful [[afterlife]], introducing the concept of a [[Heaven]] to her, and she dies happy. Mark soon receives worldwide attention as the news of his supposed information about death spreads. After encouragement from Anna, he tells the world, through "ten rules" (mirroring the [[Ten Commandments]]), that he talks to a "Man In The Sky" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after death, as long as you do no more than three "bad things". 

Some time later, Anna and Mark are together in a park and Anna asks him, if they marry, if his now being rich and famous would make their children more physically attractive. Mark wants to lie, but does not because of his love for Anna, and says "No". Meanwhile, Mark's rival, Brad Kessler, pursues Anna romantically, motivated by his jealousy at Mark's success. Though Brad's selfish and cruel manner makes Anna uncomfortable, she continues dating him and they become engaged. Before the wedding, Greg appears and convinces Mark that he has not missed his chance with Anna. Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding, where he objects to the marriage. The officiant, however, informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do, but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie. Anna struggles to understand the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it "wouldn't count". Anna confesses that she loves him.

Some time later, Anna and Mark are shown happily married with a son, who appears by his actions to have inherited his father's ability to lie.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
[[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]]’s script which was titled ''This Side of Truth'' at the time, was included in 2007 official [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] of the “most liked” un-produced scripts in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=BlackList&gt;{{cite web |title=2007 Black List |url=https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=The Black List, LLC |quote=10th rank with 10 mentions |accessdate=2018-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107120223/https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and producer [[Lynda Obst]] sent Ricky Gervais the script out of the blue in the hopes that it would spark his interest. Gervais loved it and eventually flew Robinson to London to retool the script and make the movie. Robinson’s original idea for a feature film grew from a skit he wrote about two people on a date who do not have the ability to lie. He later expanded on the idea for more skits with the same premise and then adapted them it into a full film script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifc.com/2015/05/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-invention-of-lying 15 THINGS WE BET YOU DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT THE INVENTION OF LYING]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soundtrack ===
The soundtrack includes [[Elvis Costello]]'s otherwise-unreleased rendition of the [[Cat Stevens]] song "Sitting".

Songs also include: [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]]' "[[Do Anything You Wanna Do]]", [[Donovan]]'s "[[Catch the Wind]]", [[Supertramp]]'s "[[Give a Little Bit]]" and [[Electric Light Orchestra]]'s "[[Mr. Blue Sky]]".

== Release ==
[[Warner Bros.]] owns the rights for the film's North American distribution, while [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] owns the rights to release the film outside of North America. The film was released in North America on October 2, 2009. Its world premiere occurred two weeks earlier at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 14, 2009.

The DVD and Blu-ray were released on January 19, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bluray.ign.com/articles/105/1051539p1.html | title=The Art of Lying | work=[[IGN Entertainment]] | publisher=IGN Movies | date=2009-12-03 | accessdate= 2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais briefly promoted the DVD during his hosting duty at the [[67th Golden Globe Awards]] in a joking manner, referring to its modest box office results.

== Reception ==
===Critical reception===
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 56% of 188 critics have given the film a positive review, with a [[weighted mean|rating average]] of 5.9/10. The site's consensus says, "It doesn't quite follow through on its promise, and relies too heavily on shopworn romantic comedy tropes, but ''The Invention of Lying'' is uncommonly sly and funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/invention_of_lying/ |title=The Invention of Lying |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalised]] rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 58 based on 31 reviews, suggesting "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/inventionoflying?q=the%20invention%20of%20lying | title = The Invention of Lying (2009): Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three and a half stars out of four saying "in its amiable, quiet, PG-13 way, [it] is a remarkably radical comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=The Invention of Lying|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090930/REVIEWS/909309993|publisher=rogerebert.com|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Xan Brooks of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was also favourable, giving the film four out of five stars, although he was critical of some aspects: "It is slick and it is funny. But it is also too obviously schematic, while that romantic subplot can feel awfully synthetic at times."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/02/the-invention-of-lying-review ''Invention of Lying'' review] from ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''The New York Times'' called it a "mostly funny if melancholic defense of deceit" that "looks so shoddy that you yearn for the camerawork, lighting and polish of his shows, like [[The Office (UK TV series)|the original ''The Office'']], because, really, these days TV rarely looks this bad."  In some scenes, Dargis says "lying becomes a means to transcendence, an escape from the quotidian, from our oppressive literal-mindedness, from our brute selves. For the most part, though, Mr. Gervais prefers to shock us with our own brutality...[with] unvarnished truths [that] begin to feel heavy, cruel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= A World Where Truth Turns Out Not to Be Beauty | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/movies/02invention.html |author= Manohla Dargis |date= October 2, 2009| publisher= ''The New York Times''| accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Box office ===
The film opened at #5 with US$7,027,472 behind ''[[Zombieland]]'', ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'' in its third weekend, the ''[[Toy Story]]''/''[[Toy Story 2]]'' 3-D double feature, and ''[[Surrogates (film)|Surrogates]]'' in its second weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/boxoffice/?date=2009-10-02&amp;region=us Internet Movie Database US film charts 2nd October]&lt;/ref&gt; The film has grossed US$18,451,251 in the United States, and US$13,955,256 internationally, with a worldwide gross of US$32,406,507.&lt;ref name="the-numbers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=inventionoflying.htm ''The Invention of Lying''] from [[Box Office Mojo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Moon Moth'''" is a [[science fiction]] short story by American author [[Jack Vance]], first published in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' (August [[1961 in literature|1961]]).

==Plot summary==
Edwer Thissell, the new consul from Earth to the planet Sirene, has trouble adjusting to the local culture.  The Sirenese cover their faces and heads with exquisitely crafted masks that indicate their [[social status]] (''strakh'') and mood. They also [[musical language|communicate by singing]], accompanying themselves with one of a score of musical instruments, selected based on the social situation and feelings. Furthermore, errors of [[etiquette]] may prove fatal.  Thissell is a clumsy musician and lacks confidence in the alien society, so he is forced to wear a lowly Moon Moth mask. 

One day, he receives an alert to arrest a notorious assassin named Haxo Angmark, who is due on the next starship. Thissell, however, gets the message too late. He races to the spaceport, but Angmark, thoroughly comfortable with Sirenese customs, has already landed and disappeared. Thissell commits a number of serious social blunders in his haste to reach the spaceport and in enquiring after Angmark.

The next morning, Thissell is shown the body of an offworlder. He concludes that, since the fugitive would be unable to pass himself off as a native, Angmark must have killed and taken the place of one of the other three expatriates on the planet. But since even they wear masks, how is Thissell to know which one?

Eventually, Thissell solves the mystery by borrowing a slave from each of the suspects and determining their masters' mask preferences before and after Angmark's arrival. He succeeds in identifying his quarry, but is captured and forced to walk unmasked in public (the ultimate humiliation to the natives), while Angmark masquerades as Thissell by wearing his Moon Moth mask. However, the Sirenese turn on Angmark and kill him for the perversion of unmasking another man and, ironically, for Thissell's previous gaffes.

Thinking quickly, Thissell cleverly represents his humiliation as an act of unsurpassed bravery, asking if any present would be willing to be so shamed in order to destroy his enemy. With his new-found confidence, Thissell receives [[gift economy|offers of gifts]] (the acceptance of which would enhance the prestige of both the giver and the recipient). He first goes with a mask maker to procure a covering more befitting his lofty new ''strakh''.

==Plot==
[[Pessimism|Pessimistic]] 10-year-old Richard Tyler lives life based on statistics and [[panphobia|fears everything]]. His exasperated parents have tried multiple ways to build up the courage of their son, but to little success. Richard is sent to buy a bag of nails for building a [[treehouse]]. However, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm and takes shelter in a [[library]]. He meets Mr. Dewey, an eccentric [[librarian]] who insists that he is in need of a special book and gives him a library card, despite Richard explaining he is only sheltering from the storm. Searching for a phone, Richard finds a large [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] painted with many famous literary characters. He slips on water dripping from his coat and falls over, knocking himself out. Richard awakens to find the rotunda art melting, which washes over him and the library, turning them into [[illustration]]s.

He is met by the Pagemaster, the mythical Keeper of Books and Guardian of the Written Word. Richard asks for directions to the exit so the Pagemaster sends him through the fiction section toward the green neon exit sign. Along the way, Richard befriends three [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] books: Adventure, a swashbuckling pirate-like book; Fantasy, a sassy but caring fairy tale book; and Horror, a fearful "Hunchbook" with a misshapen spine. The three agree to help Richard if he checks them out using his new library card. Together, the quartet encounters classic-fictional characters. They meet [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll]] who turns into Mr. Hyde, driving them to the open waters of the Land of Adventure. However, the group is separated after [[Moby-Dick]] attacks, following the whale's battle with [[Captain Ahab]]. Richard and Adventure are picked up by the ''Hispaniola'', captained by [[Long John Silver]]. The pirates go to [[Treasure Island]], but find no treasure except for one gold coin, nearly causing a mutiny. Fantasy and Horror return and defeat the pirates. Silver attempts to convince Richard to leave with him, but surrenders when Richard threatens him with a sword.

In the fantasy section, Richard sees the exit sign on the top of a mountain. However, Adventure's bumbling awakens a dormant [[dragon]]. Richard tries to fight the dragon with a sword and shield, but the dragon swallows him. Richard finds books in the dragon's stomach and uses a beanstalk from ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' to escape through the dragon's mouth. He and the books climb the beanstalk to reach the exit. They enter a large dark room where the Pagemaster awaits them. Richard accuses the Pagemaster of causing the horrors that he suffered, but the Pagemaster reveals the journey was intended to make Richard face his fears. Dr. Jekyll, Captain Ahab, [[Long John Silver]], and the [[dragon]] reappear in a magical twister and congratulate him. The Pagemaster then swoops Richard and the books into the twister, sending them back to the real world.

Richard awakens, finding Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror lying next to him as real books. Mr. Dewey finds him, and, even though the library policy only allows a person to check out two books at time, lets him check out all three books "just this once". Richard returns home a braver child, sleeping in his new treehouse with his books.

==Production==
{{unsourced|section|date=July 2016}}
''The Pagemaster'' took three years to produce; the animation in the film was produced by [[Turner Feature Animation]], headed by [[David Kirschner]] and recently spun off from [[Hanna-Barbera]]. The crew included animators who were veterans of productions such as ''[[An American Tail]]'' (1986) (also produced by [[David Kirschner]] and composed by [[James Horner]]), ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' (1988) and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992). This was one of the first films to feature live-action, traditional animation, and CGI animation all together. One scene involving a computer-generated [[dragon]] made from paint was used, a challenge for the filmmakers. All of the fictional works featured in the film were created and first published before January 1, 1923, making them a part of the [[public domain]] in most countries. The theme songs to the movie are "[[Dream Away (Babyface and Lisa Stansfield song)|Dream Away]]", sung by [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]] and [[Lisa Stansfield]], and "Whatever You Imagine", sung by [[Wendy Moten]].

Many of the cast members have had roles in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise: [[Patrick Stewart]] played Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] played [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: The Next Generation#Guinan|Guinan]], [[Leonard Nimoy]] played [[Spock|Mr. Spock]], [[Christopher Lloyd]] played Kruge in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'', [[Ed Begley Jr.]] played Henry Starling in a two-part episode of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', [[George Hearn]] played Dr. Berel in an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]] played numerous characters in ''Star Trek'' computer games, as did [[Jim Cummings]]. Composer [[James Horner]] was also the composer for ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' and ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]''. [[Frank Welker]] voiced Spock's screams in ''Star Trek III'' and the alien creature in the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode "[[Nothing Human (Star Trek: Voyager)|Nothing Human]]". [[Robert Picardo]] played [[Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Doctor]] on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''.

Additionally, both Nimoy and Welker voiced the character Galvatron in ''Transformers'' (with Nimoy voicing him in [[The Transformers: The Movie|the 1986 film]], and Welker voicing him in [[The Transformers (TV series)|the television series]] and again in ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction]]'' and ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]'').

Promotional advertisements for this film used the theme from the 1984 film, ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''.

Casci's original screenplay included a story arc for the protagonist, Richard Tyler (played by Macaulay Culkin), who begins the tale as a boy who hates reading, but by the end of the film, learns to love reading. The revised screenplay by Contreras and Kirschner omitted the reading-themed story arc, instead emphasizing the boy's journey from cowardice to courage.

According to the film's animation crew, the film went overbudget during animation production due to mismanagement and changes to the narrative. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The 2001 book ''Producing Animation'' by [[Catherine Winder]] and Zahra Dowlatbadi (Johnston's assistant on ''The Pagemaster'') recommends against making story changes during the animation process.

Fantasy and Long John Silver are voiced by Goldberg and Cummings. The two of them (along with [[Cheech Marin]]) voiced the three troublesome hyenas in ''[[The Lion King]]'', another animated film released the same year.

Animation production began in August 1992, and live-action scenes were filmed from September 21 to October 15, 1992. After two years in the making, the film was completed and wrapped in the summer of 1994. According to the copyright holder, it was believed to be made in 1993{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} (although the film was just released a year later).

===Legal issue===
The screenwriting credits for this film were the subject of a protracted [[Arbitration|legal arbitration]] with the [[WGA screenwriting credit system|Writers Guild of America (WGA)]]&lt;ref&gt;WGAw official case # 94SR002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Morning Report|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1997-12-13|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/13/entertainment/ca-63480|accessdate=2011-12-16|first=Shauna|last=Snow}}&lt;/ref&gt; when its producer, [[David Kirschner]], attempted to claim sole authorship of the screenplay and original story, with no credit for its original screenwriter, David Casci. Typically, proposed [[WGA screenwriting credit system|credits]] are submitted to the WGA for approval well in advance of the release of a movie or the publishing of posters or novelizations on which writing credits appear. In the case of ''The Pagemaster,'' the producers attempted to claim that, as the film was now largely animated, the WGA did not have jurisdiction to determine credits. Casci had written the screenplay under a WGA contract, as well as previous live-action versions for [[Walt Disney Television|Disney Television]] dating back to 1985, also written under WGA contract. These facts positioned the WGA to get involved, testing their tenuous authority over a feature film with animated elements.

After a lengthy investigation and interviews with those intimately familiar with the genesis of the ''Pagemaster'' project, including three persons within Kirschner's own office, the WGA credit arbitration process determined that David Casci was, in fact, the primary writer, and that Kirschner did not provide a sufficient creative contribution to the writing process to warrant any screenwriting credit. Upon receiving this determination by the WGA, Fox threatened to pull out of arbitration and release the film without WGA-approved credits, positioning the WGA to be forced to file an injunction blocking the film's heavily promoted Christmas season release.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

Ultimately, a settlement was reached, and Fox released the film with both Kirschner and Casci receiving story and screenplay credit, with a third writer, Ernie Contreras, also receiving screenplay credit.

At the time, this case was the most expensive and extensive investigation of its type undertaken by the [[Writers Guild of America, West|WGA]] on behalf of one of its members.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

===Extended and deleted scenes===
''The Pagemaster'' is presented in an extended cut version. During the production, some original scenes were removed, both live-action and animation. The deleted scenes and characters can be still seen during the making of the film, trailers and TV spots, [[SkyBox International]] trading cards, books and other related products. They can be also seen during the sneak peek on the 1993 VHS release of ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]'', the 1994 VHS release of ''[[Rookie of the Year (film)|Rookie of the Year]]'', and in the promotional trailer of the VHS release of the film on the promotional demo/screener VHS copy in 1995.

==Reception and release==
The film was a production by Turner Pictures. 20th Century Fox handled U.S. distribution, while Turner Pictures Worldwide handled International distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-09/business/fi-25306_1_distribution-pact | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Company Town | date=1994-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turner Broadcasting System]] handles the broadcasting rights of the film to be aired on their variety of television networks (including [[Cartoon Network]]). [[Warner Bros.]] now handles International and television distribution to the film as a result of the Turner/[[Time Warner]] merger on October 10, 1996.

The film grossed $13,670,688 in theaters,&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo1"/&gt; on a $27 million budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110763/#titleDetails|title=The Pagemaster (1994)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pagemaster'' earned a [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]] nomination for Macaulay Culkin as Worst Actor for his performance in the movie (also for ''[[Getting Even with Dad]]'' and ''[[Richie Rich (film)|Richie Rich]]'') but lost the award to [[Kevin Costner]] for ''[[Wyatt Earp (film)|Wyatt Earp]]''.

The film received a 17% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 18 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James |first=Caryn |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9906E7DC1630F930A15752C1A962958260&amp;partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes |title=Movie Review - The Pagemaster - Film in Review; Macaulay Culkin Finding Himself in a World of Books |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1994-11-23 |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pagemaster/ |title=The Pagemaster (1994) |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' criticized the way the film's message came across, calling it a "sad and dreary film," adding that its message seemed to be that "books can be almost as much fun as TV cartoons and video arcade games."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger.  [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941123/REVIEWS/411230305 "The Pagemaster."] ''[[RogerEbert.com]]''.  23 November 1994.  9 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that the film's principal appeal for adults would be its abbreviated running time, and that it did not do enough with its famous fictional characters, noting "A more inspired moment has Richard using a book, 'Jack and the Beanstalk,' to escape from the belly of a dragon. Unfortunately, such moments are few and far between."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117903392.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |title=The Pagemaster |accessdate=2009-01-05 |last=Lowry |first=Brian |date=1994-11-21 |work= |publisher=Variety }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', however, gave the film a positive review, calling it a "splendidly original children's fantasy about the world of books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Pagemaster|work= [[Washington Post]]|date=1994-11-23|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/thepagemastergkempley_c01179.htm|accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of ReelViews gave another positive review, calling it a "clever, often engaging, and always fast-paced motion picture" that "uses the visual medium to encourage its viewers to reach out with their imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Pagemaster|work= [[ReelViews]]|date=|url= http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/p/pagemaster.html|accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home media ===
''The Pagemaster'' was first released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] on April 4, 1995. [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] released the film on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on August 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Pagemaster|date=August 6, 2013|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00D81Q55C/ref=tmm_mfc_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|publisher=20th Century Fox|accessdate=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book adaptations==
Contrary to any claims, the screenplay and film are not based on any book. David Casci's screenplay preceded all novelizations and illustrated books by several years.

A number of books based on the film exist, including an illustrated book attributed to [[David Kirschner]] and Ernie Contreras, illustrated by Jerry Tiritilli, which contained large passages from the Casci screenplay without giving Casci writing credit. The film was well into production by the time this book was introduced in the 1993 F. A. O. Schwarz Christmas Catalog. Other properties based on the film include a novelization of the film, children's story books, pop-up books and other film ancillaries such as toys and games.

==Video game==
{{Main|The Pagemaster (video game)}}
Video game adaptations of the film were released the same year as the film. They were developed by [[Probe Software|Probe Software Ltd.]] and published by [[Fox Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pagemaster.enjin.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The PC and handheld versions of the game are almost entirely different games; the PC game is an interactive game, and the handheld version is a platformer.

'''Trading companies''' are [[business]]es working with different kinds of [[product (business)|product]]s which are sold for [[consumer]], business or [[government]] purposes. Trading companies buy a specialized range of products, maintain a stock or a shop, and deliver products to [[customer]]s.

Different kinds of practical conditions make for many kinds of business. Usually two kinds of businesses are defined in trading. Importers or wholesalers maintain a stock and deliver products to shops or large end customers. They work in a large geographical area, while their customers, the shops, work in smaller areas and often in just a small neighbourhood.

When talking about "trading companies", today we refer mainly to global B2B traders, highly specialized in one goods category and with a strong logistic organization.

Changes in practical conditions such as faster [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[computing]] and modern [[marketing]] have led to changes in their business models.

The ''[[Winding-up and Restructuring Act]]'', an act of the [[Parliament of Canada]], uses the following definition"
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“trading company” means any company, except a railway or telegraph company, carrying on business similar to that carried on by apothecaries, auctioneers, bankers, brokers, brickmakers, builders, carpenters, carriers, cattle or sheep salesmen, coach proprietors, dyers, fullers, keepers of inns, taverns, hotels, saloons or coffee houses, lime burners, livery stable keepers, market gardeners, millers, miners, packers, printers, quarrymen, sharebrokers, ship-owners, shipwrights, stockbrokers, stock-jobbers, victuallers, warehousemen, wharfingers, persons using the trade of merchandise by way of bargaining, exchange, bartering, commission, consignment or otherwise, in gross or by retail, or by persons who, either for themselves, or as agents or factors for others, seek their living by buying and selling or buying and letting for hire goods or commodities, or by the manufacture, workmanship or the conversion of goods or commodities or [[trees]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Japan]] has a special class of "general trading companies" (''[[sogo shosha]]''), large and highly diversified businesses that trade in a wide range of goods and services.
Trading Companies are mostly b2b business services and they trade by other companies invested money and takes commission.
